In this study, we designed electrospun substrates inspired by morphologic features of non-failing and failing human heart ECM, and examined how these substrates regulate phenotypes of adult and neonatal rat ventricular CMs (ARVM and NRVM, respectively). We found that poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) fiber substrates designed to mimic the organized ECM of a non-failing human heart maintained healthy CM phenotype (evidenced by cell morphology, organized actin/myomesin bands and expression of \u03b2-MYH7 and SCN5A.1 and SCN5A.2) compared to both failing heart ECM-mimetic substrates and tissue culture plates. Moreover, culture of ARVMs and NRVMs on aligned substrates showed differences in m- and z-line alignment; with ARVMs aligning parallel to the ECM fibers and the NRVMs aligning perpendicular to the fibers.

Thus, a greater understanding of the underlying changes in tissue properties induced by ablative therapies will ultimately promote safer and more efficacious procedures.

Integration of microelectrodes into the backbone of these systems may enable guidance during their motion and allow precise control over these actuators with specific activation patterns. Here, we addressed this challenge by developing aligned CNT forest microelectrode arrays and incorporated them into scaffolds for stimulating the cells. Aligned CNTs were successfully embedded into flexible and biocompatible hydrogel exhibiting excellent anisotropic electrical conductivity. Bioactuators were then engineered by culturing cardiomyocytes on the CNT microelectrode-integrated hydrogel constructs. The resulting cardiac tissue showed homogeneous cell organization with improved cell-to-cell coupling and maturation, which was directly related to the contractile force of muscle tissue. This centimeter-scale bioactuator has excellent mechanical integrity, embedded microelectrodes and is capable of spontaneous actuation behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a biohybrid machine can be controlled by an external electrical field provided by the integrated CNT microelectrode arrays.

Injection of isoproterenol in diabetic rats produced greater ECG disturbances compared to non-diabetic rats. Treatment with pioglitazone (5 mg/kg) reduced the infarct size and improved some ECG findings. Pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) enhanced ECG findings, improved the histopathological picture and downregulated apoptosis in cardiac tissues. Whereas the higher dose of pioglitazone (20 mg/kg) did not improve most of the measured parameters but rather worsened some of them, such as proapoptotic markers. Importantly, a positive correlation was found between serum AGEs and cardiac AGE receptors (RAGEs) versus caspase 3 expression in the two experiments. Therefore, the current effect of pioglitazone was, at least in part, mediated through downregulation of AGE-RAGE axis and inhibition of apoptosis.

However, poor retention of CDCs in infarcted hearts often causes less than ideal therapeutic outcomes. Cell sheet technology has been developed as a means of permitting longer retention of graft cells, and this therapeutic strategy has opened new avenues of cell-based therapy for severe ischemic diseases. However, there is still scope for improvement before this treatment can be routinely applied in clinical settings. In this study, we investigated whether hypoxic preconditioning enhances the therapeutic efficacy of CDC monolayer sheets. To induce hypoxia priming, CDC monolayer sheets were placed in an incubator adjusted to 2% oxygen for 24 hours, and then preconditioned mouse CDC sheets were implanted into the infarcted heart of old myocardial infarction mouse models. Hypoxic preconditioning of CDC sheets remarkably increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor through the PI3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Implantation of preconditioned CDC sheets improved left ventricular function inchronically infarcted hearts and reduced fibrosis.

The rs11515 single-nucleotide polymorphism in the p16 (INK4a) /p14 (ARF) 3'-untranslated region is associated with glioblastoma, melanoma, and other cancers. This study investigated the frequency and effect of rs11515 genotypes in breast cancer. Genomic DNA samples from 400 women (200 with and 200 without a diagnosis of breast cancer) were genotyped for the rs11515 major (C) and minor (G) alleles. The rs11515 polymorphism was also investigated in 108 heart tissues to test for tissue-specific effects. Four 9p21 transcripts, p16 (INK4a) , p14 (ARF) , p15 (INK4b) , and ANRIL were measured in breast tumors and myocardium using quantitative PCR. Heterozygotes (CG genotype) were more frequent in women with breast cancer compared to the control population (P\u2009=\u20090.0039). In those with breast cancer, the CG genotype was associated with an older age (P\u2009=\u20090.016) and increased lymph node involvement (P\u2009=\u20090.007) compared to homozygotes for the major allele (CC genotype). In breast tumors, the CG genotype had higher ANRIL (P\u2009=\u20090.031) and lower p16 (INK4a) (P\u2009=\u20090.006) expression compared to the CC genotype. The CG genotype was not associated with altered 9p21 transcripts in heart tissue. In breast cancer, the rs11515 CG genotype is more frequent and associated with a more aggressive tumor that could be due to increased ANRIL and reduced p16 (INK4a) expression.

Pathway enrichment analysis of the dysregulated genes pointed to cell signaling/communication, cell/organism defense and cell structure/motility. We next compared the expression profiles of potential regulating miRNAs, suggesting that dysregulation of a number of AMI-associated genes (e.g., IL12A, KIF1A, HIF1\u03b1 and CDK13) may be attributed to the dysregulation of their respective regulating miRNAs.

Among other matrix metalloproteinases, MMP-9 has an important role in adverse cardiac remodelling and might have a role in the development of cardiovascular disorders associated with metabolic syndrome.

In this study we investigated the effect of fructose-rich diet on MMP-9 expression in the heart of male and female rats, along with the effect of fructose-rich diet and oestradiol on MMP-9 expression in ovariectomized females. We further assessed the effect of fructose-rich diet and oestradiol on NF\u03baB activation, measured as the level of p65 phosphorylation at Ser 276. The results showed that the diet regime did not affect the heart mass. Higher MMP-9 gene expression was found in cardiac tissue of male rats fed the fructose-rich diet than in females on the same diet regime. In ovariectomized females, fructose-rich diet upregulated MMP-9 protein and mRNA expression in the heart, as well as phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF\u03baB at Ser 276. Oestradiol replacement therapy reverted these changes in the heart of ovariectomized females.

{"title": "Improving Cell Engraftment in Cardiac Stem Cell Therapy.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) affects millions of people worldwide. MI causes massive cardiac cell death and heart function decrease. However, heart tissue cannot effectively regenerate by itself. While stem cell therapy has been considered an effective approach for regeneration, the efficacy of cardiac stem cell therapy remains low due to inferior cell engraftment in the infarcted region. This is mainly a result of low cell retention in the tissue and poor cell survival under ischemic, immune rejection and inflammatory conditions. Various approaches have been explored to improve cell engraftment: increase of cell retention using biomaterials as cell carriers; augmentation of cell survival under ischemic conditions by preconditioning cells, genetic modification of cells, and controlled release of growth factors and oxygen; and enhancement of cell survival by protecting cells from excessive inflammation and immune surveillance.

Shock wave therapy might affect cardiac tissues because of its ability to promote angiogenesis. In this report, we investigated if the up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by SW therapy is involved in cell proliferation in cultured endothelial cells. After human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with SW, the expression and secretion of VEGF as well as cell proliferation were analyzed. We also determined the mechanism underlying SW-induced the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) using western blotting. Our results demonstrated that SW treatment induced VEGF expression in endothelial cells in a hypoxia-inducible factor 1-independent manner. Up-regulation of VEGF expression led to an increase in its concentration in the cultured medium. The autocrine VEGF in the medium activated the ERK MAPK signaling, which in turn enhanced cell proliferation. Therefore, we concluded that VEGF mediates SW application-induced endothelial cell proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner.", "journal": "Genetics and molecular research : GMR", "date": "2016-01-20", "authors": ["Y ZPeng", "KZheng", "PYang", "YWang", "R JLi", "LLi", "J HPan", "TGuo"], "doi": "10.4238/2015.December.29.30"}

While previous studies have shown the therapeutic value of dates phytoconstituents in liver and kidney diseases etc., its cardioprotective potential remains elusive. We therefore, investigated the cardioprotective effect of lyophilized Ajwa extract (AJLE) ex vivo as well as in vivo.\nEx vivo cardioprotective effect of AJLE was evaluated on DCFH-toxicated cardiomyoblast cells (H9C2). In vivo hemodynamics, cardiac function, serum cardiac enzymes, myocardial antioxidant, inflammatory and apoptotic biomarkers as well as histopathological parameters were studied in IPS-injured Wistar rat heart tissues.\nAJLE (250\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) attenuated the cytotoxicity and enhanced the H9C2 proliferation by up to 40%. Oral administration of AJLE (250 and 500 mg/kg.bw) prevented the depletion of endogenous antioxidants (CAT, SOD, NP-SH and NO) and myocyte injury marker enzymes, and inhibited lipid peroxidation (MDA, MPO). Moreover, AJLE downregulated the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF\u03b1) and apoptotic markers (caspase-3 and Bax), and upregulated the anti-apototic protein Bcl2. Histological data showed that AJLE pretreatment reduced myonecrosis, edema, and infiltration of inflammatory cells and restored the cardiomyocytes architecture.\nTaken together, our data revealed that AJLE had strong antioxidant, hypolipidimic, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic potential against myocardial damage.

However, since LV remodeling is a complex, time dependent process, the most efficacious time of hydrogel injection is not clear. In this study, we injected a relatively stiff, thermoresponsive and bioabsorbable hydrogel in rat hearts at 3 different time points - immediately after MI (IM), 3 d post-MI (3D), and 2 w post-MI (2W), corresponding to the beginnings of the necrotic, fibrotic and chronic remodeling phases. The employed left anterior descending coronary artery ligation model showed expected infarction responses including functional loss, inflammation and fibrosis with distinct time dependent patterns. Changes in LV geometry and contractile function were followed by longitudinal echocardiography for 10 w post-MI. While all injection times positively affected LV function and wall thickness, the 3D group gave better functional outcomes than the other injection times and also exhibited more local vascularization and less inflammatory markers than the earlier injection time. The results indicate an important role for injection timing in the increasingly explored concept of post-MI biomaterial injection therapy and suggest that for hydrogels with mechanical support as primary function, injection at the beginning of the fibrotic phase may provide improved outcomes.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-01-18", "authors": ["TomoYoshizumi", "YangZhu", "HongbinJiang", "AntonioD'Amore", "HirokazuSakaguchi", "JasonTchao", "KimimasaTobita", "William RWagner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.002"}
{"title": "Prolonged hyperinsulinemia affects metabolic signal transduction markers in a tissue specific manner.", "abstract": "Insulin dysregulation is common in horses although the mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction are poorly understood. We hypothesized that insulin signaling in striated (cardiac and skeletal) muscle and lamellae may be mediated through different receptors as a result of receptor content, and that transcriptional regulation of downstream signal transduction and glucose transport may also differ between tissues sites during hyperinsulinemia. Archived samples from horses treated with a prolonged insulin infusion or a balanced electrolyte solution were used. All treated horses developed marked hyperinsulinemia and clinical laminitis. Protein expression was compared across tissues for the insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) by immunoblotting. Gene expression of metabolic insulin-signaling markers (insulin receptor substrate 1, Akt2, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta [GSK-3\u03b2]) and glucose transport (basal glucose transporter 1 and insulin-sensitive glucose transporter 4) was evaluated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Lamellar tissue contained significantly more IGF-1R protein than skeletal muscle, indicating the potential significance of IGF-1R signaling for this tissue. Gene expression of the selected markers of insulin signaling and glucose transport in skeletal muscle and lamellar tissues was unaffected by prolonged hyperinsulinemia. In contrast, the significant upregulation of Akt2, GSK-3\u03b2, GLUT1, and GLUT4 gene expression in cardiac tissue suggested that the prolonged hyperinsulinemia induced an increase in insulin sensitivity and a transcriptional activation of glucose transport.

An electrical device delivers a controlled amount of electrical energy via a pair of electrodes in order to reestablish a normal heart rate. We propose a technique that is a combination of biphasic shocks applied with a four-electrode system rather than the standard two-electrode system. We use a numerical model of a one-dimensional ring of cardiac tissue in order to test and evaluate the benefit of this technique. We compare three different shock protocols, namely a monophasic and two types of biphasic shocks. The results obtained by using a four-electrode system are compared quantitatively with those obtained with the standard two-electrode system. We find that a huge reduction in defibrillation threshold is achieved with the four-electrode system. For the most efficient protocol (asymmetric biphasic), we obtain a reduction in excess of 80% in the energy required for a defibrillation success rate of 90%. The mechanisms of successful defibrillation are also analyzed. This reveals that the advantage of asymmetric biphasic shocks with four electrodes lies in the duration of the cathodal and anodal phase of the shock.", "journal": "Physical review.

Further in vitro research indicated that up-regulated AGO1 and AGO3 are related to the down-regulated TNFAIP3, which is a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB pathway. Subsequently, we confirmed that TNFAIP3 is a direct target of miR-19a/b, and during CVB3 infection, the expression of miR-19a/b and miR-125a/b is not significantly changed.

{"title": "Myocardial interstitial fibrosis - histological and immunohistochemical aspects.", "abstract": "The process of myocardial fibrosis is based on the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which leads to increased myocardium stiffness and, in turn, severe alterations of the cardiac function. This phenomenon is consecutive to various types of cardiac disease, primarily infarction, due to inflammatory reactions involving various types of cellular mechanisms. We aimed in this paper to assess both microscopically and immunohistochemically the main aspects of ischemic myocardium found in areas of fibrosis and compare the findings with normal images from unaffected cardiac tissue of the same type.\nOur study included infarction fragments of 2/2/2 cm harvested after autopsy from 26 patients who died during 2014 at the Emergency County Hospital of Craiova, Romania, following the diagnostic of ischemic cardiomyopathy. After usual histological preparations, we performed both classical staining with Hematoxylin-Eosin and trichromic Goldner-Szekely, as well as immunohistochemical assessment using anti-alpha-SMA, anti-desmin, anti-CD34 and anti-CD68 antibodies.\nWe have evaluated myocardial fibrosis in all areas of the myocardium and noted that it primarily develops around the arterioles and metarterioles. The area of myocardial fibrosis was more extensive, myocardiocytes being surrounded by collagen fibers. Collagen interstitial fibrosis, gave a \"brindle\" look to the myocardium. Myocardial fibrosis areas did not reveal myofibroblasts. We found lower numbers of blood vessels with an uneven distribution in areas of myocardial fibrosis. In the areas of normal myocardium, the macrophage numbers were two to three times lower than in areas of fibrosis, also displaying larger volume, with intense reaction to CD68.\nMyocardial interstitial fibrosis occurs in outbreaks, mainly perivascular, but it affects larger areas of the myocardium interstitial space. We believe that interstitial fibrosis is a progressive process that can become permanent, thus constituting a promising therapeutic target for a large variety of cardiac conditions.", "journal": "Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie", "date": "2016-01-09", "authors": ["OctavianIstr\u0103toaie", "Anca-MariaOfi\u0162eru", "Gabriela-CameliaNicola", "R\u0103zvan-IlieRadu", "CristinaFlorescu", "Lauren\u0163iuMogoant\u0103", "Costin TeodorStreba"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Pre-hospital emergency medicine.", "abstract": "Pre-hospital care is emergency medical care given to patients before arrival in hospital after activation of emergency medical services. It traditionally incorporated a breadth of care from bystander resuscitation to statutory emergency medical services treatment and transfer. New concepts of care including community paramedicine, novel roles such as emergency care practitioners, and physician delivered pre-hospital emergency medicine are re-defining the scope of pre-hospital care. For severely ill or injured patients, acting quickly in the pre-hospital period is crucial with decisions and interventions greatly affecting outcomes. The transfer of skills and procedures from hospital care to pre-hospital medicine enables early advanced care across a range of disciplines. The variety of possible pathologies, challenges of environmental factors, and hazardous situations requires management that is tailored to the patient's clinical need and setting. Pre-hospital clinicians should be generalists with a broad understanding of medical, surgical, and trauma pathologies, who will often work from locally developed standard operating procedures, but who are able to revert to core principles. Pre-hospital emergency medicine consists of not only clinical care, but also logistics, rescue competencies, and scene management skills (especially in major incidents, which have their own set of management principles). Traditionally, research into the hyper-acute phase (the first hour) of disease has been difficult, largely because physicians are rarely present and issues of consent, transport expediency, and resourcing of research. However, the pre-hospital phase is acknowledged as a crucial period, when irreversible pathology and secondary injury to neuronal and cardiac tissue can be prevented. The development of pre-hospital emergency medicine into a sub-specialty in its own right should bring focus to this period of care.", "journal": "Lancet (London, England)", "date": "2016-01-08", "authors": ["Mark HWilson", "KarelHabig", "ChristopherWright", "AmyHughes", "GarethDavies", "Chirstopher H EImray"], "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00985-X"}

{"title": "Spiral wave classification using normalized compression distance: Towards atrial tissue spatiotemporal electrophysiological behavior characterization.", "abstract": "Analysis of electrical activation patterns such as re-entries during atrial fibrillation (Afib) is crucial in understanding arrhythmic mechanisms and assessment of diagnostic measures. Spiral waves are a phenomena that provide intuitive basis for re-entries occurring in cardiac tissue. Distinct spiral wave behaviors such as stable spiral waves, meandering spiral waves, and spiral wave break-up may have distinct electrogram manifestations on a mapping catheter. Hence, it is desirable to have an automated classification of spiral wave behavior based on catheter recordings for a qualitative characterization of spatiotemporal electrophysiological activity on atrial tissue. In this study, we propose a method for classification of spatiotemporal characteristics of simulated atrial activation patterns in terms of distinct spiral wave behaviors during Afib using two different techniques: normalized compressed distance (NCD) and normalized FFT (NFFTD). We use a phenomenological model for cardiac electrical propagation to produce various simulated spiral wave behaviors on a 2D grid and labeled them as stable, meandering, or breakup. By mimicking commonly used catheter types, a star shaped and a circular shaped both of which do the local readings from atrial wall, monopolar and bipolar intracardiac electrograms are simulated. Virtual catheters are positioned at different locations on the grid. The classification performance for different catheter locations, types and for monopolar or bipolar readings were also compared. We observed that the performance for each case differed slightly. However, we found that NCD performance is superior to NFFTD. Through the simulation study, we showed the theoretical validation of the proposed method. Our findings suggest that a qualitative wavefront activation pattern can be assessed during Afib without the need for highly invasive mapping techniques such as multisite simultaneous electrogram recordings.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Quantifying spatiotemporal complexity of cardiac dynamics using ordinal patterns.", "abstract": "Analyzing the dynamics of complex excitation wave patterns in cardiac tissue plays a key role for understanding the origin of life-threatening arrhythmias and for devising novel approaches to control them. The quantification of spatiotemporal complexity, however, remains a challenging task. This holds in particular for the analysis of data from fluorescence imaging (optical mapping), which allows for the measurement of membrane potential and intracellular calcium at high spatial and temporal resolution. Hitherto methods, like dominant frequency maps and the analysis of phase singularities, address important aspects of cardiac dynamics, but they consider very specific properties of excitable media, only. This article focuses on the benchmark of spatial complexity measures over time in the context of cardiac cell cultures. Standard Shannon Entropy and Spatial Permutation Entropy, an adaption of [1], have been implemented and applied to optical mapping data from embryonic chicken cell culture experiments. We introduce spatial separation of samples when generating ordinal patterns and show its importance for Spatial Permutation Entropy. Results suggest that Spatial Permutation Entropies provide a robust and interpretable measure for detecting qualitative changes in the dynamics of this excitable medium.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

In this case, a thermo-electrical equivalence is considered as a method for modelling the inter-dependence of electrical and mechanical phenomena in biological tissue. We seek to assess this approach for multi-scale models (from micro-structure to tissue scale) of biological media, such as nerve cells and cardiac tissue, in which the electrical charge distribution is modelled as a heat distribution in an equivalent thermal system. This procedure allows for the reduction in problem complexity and it facilitates the coupling of electrical and mechanical phenomena in an efficient and practical way.

We employ a three-dimensional model to simulate the bioelectrical activity and the biomechanics of a multilayered culture made of ventricular cells and with four possible architectures consisting of: i) random fibers in all cells; ii) randomly rotating fibers among layers; iii) structurally rotating fibers from the bottom layer to the top one; iv) parallel fibers among layers.

Modelling their properties could be helpful for researchers involved in this field. In this paper, we develop a three-dimensional electromechanical model to study how thickness affects the bioelectrical and biomechanical performances of an in vitro culture made of ventricular cells. In particular, by our in silico simulations we want to verify if thickness variations can be a key factor in modifying the response of the whole culture when this one is grown to become a cardiac patch. Therefore, for this parameter we choose three increasing values while keeping a fiber architecture among layers that is similar to the one of the in vivo heart but it is randomly stated at the beginning of each simulation.

{"title": "A gap junction-based cardiac electromechanics model.", "abstract": "Action potential propagation in cardiac tissue is mainly governed by highly resistive gap junctions, which causes the tissue to behave as a network of active cell nodes interconnected by resistors. This property causes the action potential propagation to be less dependent on the level of mechanical deformation. This study proposes that the electrical conductivity in cardiac electromechanical simulations should be held fixed relative to the material frame, reproducing the dominant effect of intercellular gap junctions on the tissue electrical resistance instead of the more commonly employed spatial frame. Our simulations showed that the implementation of gap junction-based conductivity resulted in similar activation times at given material point, irrespective of the level of deformation. In contrast, the activation time of a given material point using spatial-based conductivity was dependent on the deformation experienced by the tissue. These findings have implication on more complex electromechanical simulations such as spiral wave since gap junction-based conductivity is independent of contraction, in contrast to spatial-based conductivity. Therefore, selection of the appropriate electrical conductivity assumption is highly crucial in electromechanics models of cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Endothelial injury may lead to a phenotypic change (i.e., endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition [EndMT]), causing cardiac fibrosis. Epigenetic mechanisms, through specific microRNA, may regulate such a process. We investigated the mechanisms for such changes in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and in the heart of genetically engineered mice with chemically induced diabetes. Cardiac tissues and isolated mouse heart endothelial cells (MHECs) from animals with or without endothelial-specific overexpression of miR-200b, with or without streptozotocin-induced diabetes, were examined at the mRNA and protein levels for endothelial and mesenchymal markers. Expression of miR-200b and its targets was quantified. Cardiac functions and structures were analyzed. In the hearts of wild-type diabetic mice, EndMT was observed, which was prevented in the miR-200b transgenic diabetic mice. Expression of specific markers such as vascular endothelial growth factor, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox, transforming growth factor-\u03b21, and p300 were increased in the hearts of diabetic mice and were prevented following miR-200b overexpression.

In this work, the expression, function, cellular and subcellular localization, and potential cardioprotective role against anoxic-ischaemic cardiac injury of Kv7.4 channels have been investigated.\nExpression of Kv7.1 and Kv7.4 transcripts was found in rat heart tissue by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Western blots detected Kv7.4 subunits in mitochondria from Kv7.4-transfected cells, H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, freshly isolated adult cardiomyocytes, and whole hearts. Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that Kv7.4 subunits co-localized with mitochondrial markers in cardiac cells, with \u223c 30-40% of cardiac mitochondria being labelled by Kv7.4 antibodies, a result also confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy experiments. In isolated cardiac (but not liver) mitochondria, retigabine (1-30 \u00b5M) and flupirtine (30 \u00b5M), two selective Kv7 activators, increased Tl(+) influx, depolarized the membrane potential, and inhibited calcium uptake; all these effects were antagonized by the Kv7 blocker XE991. In intact H9c2 cells, reducing Kv7.4 expression by RNA interference blunted retigabine-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization; in these cells, retigabine decreased mitochondrial Ca(2+) levels and increased radical oxygen species production, both effects prevented by XE991. Finally, retigabine reduced cellular damage in H9c2 cells exposed to anoxia/re-oxygenation and largely prevented the functional and morphological changes triggered by global ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts.\nKv7.4 channels are present and functional in cardiac mitochondria; their activation exerts a significant cardioprotective role, making them potential therapeutic targets against I/R-induced cardiac injury.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2016-01-01", "authors": ["LaraTestai", "VincenzoBarrese", "Maria VirginiaSoldovieri", "PaoloAmbrosino", "AlmaMartelli", "IolandaVinciguerra", "FrancescoMiceli", "Iain AndrewGreenwood", "Michael JohnCurtis", "Maria CristinaBreschi", "Maria Jos\u00e8Sisalli", "AntonellaScorziello", "Miren JosuneCanduela", "PedroGrandes", "VincenzoCalderone", "MaurizioTaglialatela"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvv281"}

The present study sought to investigate the preclinical performance and mechanism of the combination therapy of aFGF-nanoparticles (aFGF-NP) and ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) technique for DCM prevention. From Mason staining and TUNEL staining, aFGF-NP+UTMD group showed significant differences from the diabetes group and other groups treated with aFGF or aFGF-NP. The cardiac collagen volume fraction (CVF) and cardiac myocyte apoptosis index in aFGF-NP+UTMD group reduced to 4.15% and 2.31% respectively, compared with those in the diabetes group (20.5% and 11.3% respectively). Myocardial microvascular density (MCD) in aFGF-NP+UTMD group was up to 35n/hpf, much higher than that in the diabetes group (14n/hpf). The diabetes group showed similar results (MCD, CVF and cardiac myocyte apoptosis index) to other aFGF treatment groups (free aFGF\u00b1UTMD or aFGF-NP). Indexes from transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic evaluation also proved the same conclusion. These results confirmed that the abnormalities including diastolic dysfunctions, myocardial fibrosis and metabolic could be suppressed by the different extents of twice weekly aFGF treatments for 12 consecutive weeks (free aFGF or aFGF-NP\u00b1UTMD), with the strongest improvements observed in the aFGF-NP+UTMD group.

We used FoxO1-knockout heterozygous mice (FoxO1(+/-)) and wild-type mice (WT) as a control. Both WT and FoxO1(+/-) were subjected to ad libitum (AL) feeding or 30% CR compared to AL for 20 weeks from 15 weeks of age. The heart-to-body weight ratio, blood glucose, and serum lipid profiles were not different among all groups of mice at the end of the study.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of metformin on myocardial dysfunction and TLR4 activity in LPS-induced sepsis. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=6): control received normal saline (0.5ml), LPS group received lipopolysaccharide (0.5mg/kg; i.p), and metformin treated group received LPS (0.5mg/kg)+metformin (100mg/kg; i.p). 9h later the hemodynamic parameters were recorded, blood samples were collected, and the hearts were removed and weighted. The concentration of TNF-\u03b1, content of MYD88, the phosphorylation of AMPK, and the rate of TLR4 expression in the heart were assessed. In the animals treated with metformin, the preservation of left ventricular function was associated with the reduction of myeloperoxidase activity (31%, P<0.01) in the heart and decrease of TNF-\u03b1 level both in the serum and heart tissue (20%, P<0.01 and 42%, P<0.05, respectively). It was found that the level of phosphorylated AMPK in heart was significantly upregulated by 43% (P<0.001) in the metformin group while the content of TLRs adapter protein of MyD88 was reduced by 45% (P<0.05). This was associated with a remarkable decrease in the expression of myocardial TLR4. Furthermore, in a mice model of sepsis, coadministration of compound C (20mg/kg) as an AMPK inhibitor reversed the suppressive effects of metformin on TLR4 expression and MYD88 protein level.

{"title": "Cardiac differentiation potential of human induced pluripotent stem cells in a 3D self-assembling peptide scaffold.", "abstract": "In the past decade, various strategies for cardiac reparative medicine involving stem cells from multiple sources have been investigated. However, the intra-cardiac implantation of cells with contractile ability may seriously disrupt the cardiac syncytium and de-synchronize cardiac rhythm. For this reason, bioactive cardiac implants, consisting of stem cells embedded in biomaterials that act like band aids, have been exploited to repair the cardiac wall after myocardial infarction. For such bioactive implants to function properly after transplantation, the choice of biomaterial is equally important as the selection of the stem cell source. While adult stem cells have shown promising results, they have various disadvantages including low proliferative potential in vitro, which make their successful usage in human transplants difficult. As a first step towards the development of a bioactive cardiac patch, we investigate here the cardiac differentiation properties of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) when cultured with and without ascorbic acid (AA) and when embedded in RAD16-I, a biomaterial commonly used to develop cardiac implants. In adherent cultures and in the absence of RAD16-I, AA promotes the cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs by enhancing the expression of specific cardiac genes and proteins and by increasing the number of contracting clusters. In turn, embedding in peptide hydrogel based on RAD16-I interferes with the normal cardiac differentiation progression. Embedded hiPSCs up-regulate genes associated with early cardiogenesis by up to 105 times independently of the presence of AA. However, neither connexin 43 nor troponin I proteins, which are related with mature cardiomyocytes, were detected and no contraction was noted in the constructs.

Our previous studies found that Na/K-ATPase ligands or 5/6th partial nephrectomy (PNx) induces cardiac fibrosis in rats and mice. The current study used in vitro and in vivo models to explore novel roles for microRNA in this mechanism of cardiac fibrosis formation. To accomplish this, we performed microRNA profiling with RT-qPCR based arrays on cardiac tissue from rats subjected to marinobufagenin (MBG) infusion or PNx. The analysis showed that a series of fibrosis-related microRNAs were dysregulated. Among the dysregulated microRNAs, microRNA (miR)-29b-3p, which directly targets mRNA of collagen, was consistently reduced in both PNx and MBG-infused animals. In vitro experiments demonstrated that treatment of primary cultures of adult rat cardiac fibroblasts with Na/K-ATPase ligands induced significant increases in the fibrosis marker, collagen protein, and mRNA expression compared with controls, whereas miR-29b-3p expression decreased >50%. Transfection of miR-29b-3p mimics into cardiac fibroblasts inhibited cardiotonic steroids-induced collagen synthesis. Moreover, a specific Na/K-ATPase signaling antagonist, pNaKtide, prevented ouabain-induced increases in collagen synthesis and decreases in miR-29b-3p expression in these cells.

The precise molecular mechanisms and physiological effects that underlie the beneficial effects of rapamycin are an exciting area of research. Surprisingly, while some data suggest that mTOR signaling normally increases with age in mice, the effect of age on mTOR signaling has never been comprehensively assessed. Here, we determine the age-associated changes in mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) signaling in the liver, muscle, adipose, and heart of C57BL/6J.Nia mice, the lifespan of which can be extended by rapamycin treatment. We find that the effect of age on several different readouts of mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity varies by tissue and sex in C57BL/6J.Nia mice. Intriguingly, we observed increased mTORC1 activity in the liver and heart tissue of young female mice compared to male mice of the same age. Tissue and substrate-specific results were observed in the livers of HET3 and DBA/2 mouse strains, and in liver, muscle and adipose tissue of F344 rats. Our results demonstrate that aging does not result in increased mTOR signaling in most tissues and suggest that rapamycin does not promote lifespan by reversing or blunting such an effect.", "journal": "Aging cell", "date": "2015-12-24", "authors": ["Emma LBaar", "Kathryn ACarbajal", "Irene MOng", "Dudley WLamming"], "doi": "10.1111/acel.12425"}
{"title": "Beyond the Mammalian Heart: Fish and Amphibians as a Model for Cardiac Repair and Regeneration.", "abstract": "The epidemic of heart disease, the leading cause of death worldwide, is made worse by the fact that the adult mammalian heart is especially poor at repair. Damage to the mammal heart-such as that caused by myocardial infarction-leads to scarring, resulting in cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. In contrast, the hearts of fish and urodele amphibians are capable of complete regeneration of cardiac tissue from multiple types of damage, with full restoration of functionality. In the last decades, research has revealed a wealth of information on how these animals are able to perform this remarkable feat, and non-mammalian models of heart repair have become a burgeoning new source of data on the morphological, cellular, and molecular processes necessary to heal cardiac damage. In this review we present the major findings from recent research on the underlying mechanisms of fish and amphibian heart regeneration.

Recently, microRNA-214 (miR-214) was found to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac remodelling. In the present study, we examined the role and the underlying mechanism of miR-214 in isoproterenol (ISO, a \u03b2-AR agonist)-induced CF proliferation and collagen synthesis. The expression of miR-214 was increased in both ISO-mediated fibrotic heart tissue and fibroblasts. Downregulation of miR-214 by antagonists attenuated the proliferation and collagen synthesis in ISO-treated CFs. Using bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assays, mitofusin2 (Mfn2), a critical regulator of cell proliferation and tissue fibrosis, was identified as a direct target gene of miR-214; this result was confirmed by western blot analysis. Additionally, corresponding to the upregulation of miR-214, the expression of Mfn2 was downregulated in the fibrotic heart and fibroblasts. Furthermore, the downregulation of miR-214 inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signalling induced by ISO treatment. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that miR-214 mediates CF proliferation and collagen synthesis via inhibition of Mfn2 and activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signalling, which provides a new explanation for the mechanism of \u03b2-AR activation-induced cardiac fibrosis.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2015-12-23", "authors": ["MinSun", "HaiyiYu", "YouyiZhang", "ZijianLi", "WeiGao"], "doi": "10.1038/srep18351"}
{"title": "Modulators of Macrophage Polarization Influence Healing of the Infarcted Myocardium.", "abstract": "To diminish heart failure development after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), several preclinical studies have focused on influencing the inflammatory processes in the healing response post-AMI. The initial purpose of this healing response is to clear cell debris of the injured cardiac tissue and to eventually resolve inflammation and support scar tissue formation. This is a well-balanced reaction. However, excess inflammation can lead to infarct expansion, adverse ventricular remodeling and thereby propagate heart failure development. Different macrophage subtypes are centrally involved in both the promotion and resolution phase of inflammation. Modulation of macrophage subset polarization has been described to greatly affect the quality and outcome of healing after AMI. Therefore, it is of great interest to reveal the process of macrophage polarization to support the development of therapeutic targets.

At the end of the 6th week blood samples and heart tissues were collected and used for determination of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA) and histological evaluation. Induction of diabetes increased MDA levels in blood and homogenates of heart. In diabetic rats treated with garlic, MDA levels decreased in blood and heart homogenates. Treatment of diabetic rats with garlic increased SOD, GPX and CAT in blood and heart homogenates.

Accumulated evidence indicates that oxidative stress in mitochondria plays an important role in cardiac injury, but how mitochondrial redox mechanisms are involved in cardiac dysfunction remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) activates the translocation of the mitochondrial apoptosis inducing factor (AIFm2) and facilitates apoptosis in heart tissue of mice and humans. Doxorubicin treatments significantly enhance cardiac levels of HNE and AIFm2. HNE adduction of AIFm2 inactivates the NADH oxidoreductase activity of AIFm2 and facilitates its translocation from mitochondria. His 174 on AIFm2 is the critical target of HNE adduction that triggers this functional switch. HNE adduction and translocation of AIFm2 from mitochondria upon Doxorubicin treatment are attenuated by superoxide dismutase mimetics.

To address this need, we introduced a biohybrid temperature-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) PNIPAAm-Gelatin-based injectable hydrogel with excellent bioactivity as well as mechanical robustness for cardiac tissue engineering. A unique feature of our work was that we performed extensive in vitro biological analyses to assess the functionalities of cardiomyocytes (CMs) alone and in co-culture with cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) (2:1 ratio) within the hydrogel matrix. The synthesized hydrogel exhibited viscoelastic behavior (storage modulus: 1260 Pa) and necessary water content (75%) to properly accommodate the cardiac cells. The encapsulated cells demonstrated a high level of cell survival (90% for co-culture condition, day 7) and spreading throughout the hydrogel matrix in both culture conditions. A dense network of stained F-actin fibers (\u223c 6 \u00d7 10(4) \u03bcm(2) area coverage, co-culture condition) illustrated the formation of an intact and three dimensional (3D) cell-embedded matrix. Furthermore, immunostaining and gene expression analyses revealed mature phenotypic characteristics of cardiac cells. Notably, the co-culture group exhibited superior structural organization and cell-cell coupling, as well as beating behavior (average \u223c 45 beats per min, co-culture condition, day 7).

Numerical experiments on the model showed that an initially uniform strand, formed on the inherently identical cells, became functionally heterogeneous due to the asynchronous excitation via the electrical wave spread. Mechanical interactions between the cells and the mechano-electric feedback beat-to-beat affect the functional characteristics of coupled cardiomyocytes further, adjusting their electrical and mechanical heterogeneity to the activation timing. Model simulations showed that functional heterogeneity increases with an enlarged spatial extension of the myocardial strand (in terms of the longer slack length not a higher stretch of the strand), demonstrating a special role of the heart size in its function.

{"title": "Evidence for MOR on cell membrane, sarcoplasmatic reticulum and mitochondria in left ventricular myocardium in rats.", "abstract": "Cardiac function is one important determinant to maintain tissue oxygenation and is thus highly regulated. In this context, it is interesting that centrally mediated opioidergic influence on cardiac function has long been known. Only recently, KOR and DOR have been found to be expressed in healthy left ventricular myocardium in rats and colocalized with parts of the excitation-contraction-coupling system. However, several comments in literature exist doubting the existence of MOR in cardiac tissue. We, therefore, aimed to detect MOR in rat left ventricular cardiomyocytes, and to evaluate whether MOR and POMC are regulated during heart failure. After IRB approval, heart failure was induced using a modified infrarenal aortocaval fistula (ACF) in male Wistar rats. All rats of the control and ACF group were characterized by their morphometrics and hemodynamics and the existence of MOR and POMC was investigated by means of radioligand binding, double immunofluorescence confocal analysis, RT-PCR and Western blot. Membrane MOR selective binding sites were detected in the left ventricular myocardium, however, they were lower in abundance than KOR- and DOR-specific binding sites and B max of MOR could not be determined. In left ventricular cardiomyocytes, MOR colocalized with parts of the excitation-coupling mechanism, e.g., Cav1.2 of the cell membrane and invaginated T-tubules as well as the ryanodine receptor of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum. More importantly, MOR strongly colocalized with mitochondria of left ventricular cardiomyocytes. Volume overload was not associated with an altered expression of MOR and POMC on both mRNA and protein level. These findings provide evidence for the existence of MOR on the cell membrane, sarcoplasmatic reticulum and mitochondria in left ventricular cardiomyocytes in rats. However, heart failure does not result in an altered expression of the cardiac MOR-opioid system. Thus, MOR agonist treatment-commonly used in the clinical setting-might directly affect cardiac function, which needs to be evaluated in greater detail in the near future.", "journal": "Heart and vessels", "date": "2015-12-22", "authors": ["SaschaTreskatsch", "MohammedShaqura", "LukasDehe", "Torsten KRoepke", "MehdiShakibaei", "MichaelSch\u00e4fer", "Shaaban AMousa"], "doi": "10.1007/s00380-015-0784-8"}

{"title": "DNA methylation in an engineered heart tissue model of cardiac hypertrophy: common signatures and effects of DNA methylation inhibitors.", "abstract": "DNA methylation affects transcriptional regulation and constitutes a drug target in cancer biology. In cardiac hypertrophy, DNA methylation may control the fetal gene program. We therefore investigated DNA methylation signatures and their dynamics in an in vitro model of cardiac hypertrophy based on engineered heart tissue (EHT). We exposed EHTs from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to a 12-fold increased afterload (AE) or to phenylephrine (PE 20 \u00b5M) and compared DNA methylation signatures to control EHT by pull-down assay and DNA methylation microarray. A 7-day intervention sufficed to induce contractile dysfunction and significantly decrease promoter methylation of hypertrophy-associated upregulated genes such as Nppa (encoding ANP) and Acta1 (\u03b1-skeletal actin) in both intervention groups. To evaluate whether pathological consequences of AE are affected by inhibiting de novo DNA methylation we applied AE in the absence and presence of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors: 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza, 100 \u00b5M, nucleosidic inhibitor), RG108 (60 \u00b5M, non-nucleosidic) or methylene disalicylic acid (MDSA, 25 \u00b5M, non-nucleosidic). Aza had no effect on EHT function, but RG108 and MDSA partially prevented the detrimental consequences of AE on force, contraction and relaxation velocity. RG108 reduced AE-induced Atp2a2 (SERCA2a) promoter methylation. The results provide evidence for dynamic DNA methylation in cardiac hypertrophy and warrant further investigation of the potential of DNA methylation in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2015-12-19", "authors": ["JustusStenzig", "Marc NHirt", "AlexandraL\u00f6ser", "Lena MBartholdt", "Jan-TobiasHensel", "Tessa RWerner", "MonaRiemenschneider", "DanielaIndenbirken", "ThomasGuenther", "ChristianM\u00fcller", "NorbertH\u00fcbner", "MonikaStoll", "ThomasEschenhagen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-015-0528-z"}

Pathogenic reactions were observed in terms of physical and central nervous symptoms. Distributions of T. canis larvae in liver, lung, kidney, heart and brain organs were respectively detected by scanning tissue sections. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR was employed to identify the variations of Th2 immune response. The results showed that high inocula resulted in advanced larval emergences and arrested migrations in liver, lung, kidney and brain. However, no larvae were found in any of the histological sections of heart tissues. Higher levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-10 were detected along with the increasing inoculation doses, but the heaviest inoculum (3000 EE in this study) resulted in the sharp reduction of these ILs.

{"title": "A Computational Study of the Factors Influencing the PVC-Triggering Ability of a Cluster of Early Afterdepolarization-Capable Myocytes.", "abstract": "Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), which are abnormal impulse propagations in cardiac tissue, can develop because of various reasons including early afterdepolarizations (EADs). We show how a cluster of EAD-generating cells (EAD clump) can lead to PVCs in a model of cardiac tissue, and also investigate the factors that assist such clumps in triggering PVCs. In particular, we study, through computer simulations, the effects of the following factors on the PVC-triggering ability of an EAD clump: (1) the repolarization reserve (RR) of the EAD cells; (2) the size of the EAD clump; (3) the coupling strength between the EAD cells in the clump; and (4) the presence of fibroblasts in the EAD clump. We find that, although a low value of RR is necessary to generate EADs and hence PVCs, a very low value of RR leads to low-amplitude EAD oscillations that decay with time and do not lead to PVCs. We demonstrate that a certain threshold size of the EAD clump, or a reduction in the coupling strength between the EAD cells, in the clump, is required to trigger PVCs. We illustrate how randomly distributed inexcitable obstacles, which we use to model collagen deposits, affect PVC-triggering by an EAD clump. We show that the gap-junctional coupling of fibroblasts with myocytes can either assist or impede the PVC-triggering ability of an EAD clump, depending on the resting membrane potential of the fibroblasts and the coupling strength between the myocyte and fibroblasts. We also find that the triggering of PVCs by an EAD clump depends sensitively on factors like the pacing cycle length and the distribution pattern of the fibroblasts.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-12-18", "authors": ["SolingZimik", "Alok RanjanNayak", "RahulPandit"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0144979\n10.1126/science.7973648\n10.1126/science.270.5239.1222\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00022-5\n10.1093/cvr/cvt104\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.258103\n10.1371/journal.pone.0084595\n10.1073/pnas.0809148106\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.06.007\n10.1371/journal.pone.0130632\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.06.042\n10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07807-8\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000103701.30662.5C\n10.1109/10.740876\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.018\n10.1152/ajpheart.00579.2009\n10.1109/TBME.2012.2188291\n10.1161/hc0402.102661\n10.1161/01.RES.0000089258.40661.0C\n10.1161/01.RES.79.1.115\n10.1093/cvr/27.3.341\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.080002\n10.1161/01.RES.0000152325.07495.5a\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2008.04.026\n10.1053/euhj.2000.2499\n10.1152/ajpheart.00105.2002\n10.1016/j.tcm.2003.12.002\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002061\n10.1152/ajpheart.00109.2006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0084401\n10.1371/journal.pone.0072950\n10.1371/journal.pone.0045040\n10.1529/biophysj.106.101410\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.09.003\n10.1103/PhysRevE.75.011929\n10.1371/journal.pone.0004738\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.09.024\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e318207a35f\n10.1152/ajpheart.00341.2009\n10.1093/cvr/cvs183\n10.1529/biophysj.104.054429\n10.1529/biophysj.108.136473\n10.1103/PhysRevE.92.032720\n10.1152/ajpheart.00410.2014\n10.1161/01.RES.47.2.151\n10.1161/01.RES.69.6.1427\n10.1161/hc1002.105231\n10.1093/cvr/cvr292\n10.1098/rsif.2014.0352\n10.1371/journal.pone.0007307\n10.1093/europace/eum207"}

Administration of lipopolysaccharide was followed by continuous rise in colonic body temperature compared to saline-treated controls. Endotoxemia in rats was accompanied by significant decrease in HRV spectral activity in high-frequency range at maximal body temperature (logHFpower: 1.2+/-0.5 vs. 1.9+/-0.6 ms(2), P<0.01). Increased IL-6 was found in heart tissue homogenates of LPS rats (8.0+/-0.6 vs. 26.4+/-4.8 pg/ml, (P<0.05).

{"title": "SPAK and OSR1 Sensitive Kir2.1 K+ Channels.", "abstract": "Kir2.1 (KCNJ2) channels are expressed in neurons, skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue and maintain the resting membrane potential. The activity of those channels is regulated by diverse signalling molecules. The present study explored whether Kir2.1 channels are sensitive to the transporter and channels regulating kinases SPAK (SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1), which are in turn regulated by WNK (with-no-K[Lys]) kinases.\ncRNA encoding Kir2.1 was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes with or without additional injection of cRNA encoding wild-type SPAK, constitutively active T233E SPAK, WNK insensitive T233A SPAK, catalytically inactive D212A SPAK, wild-type OSR1, constitutively active T185E OSR1, WNK insensitive T185A OSR1 and catalytically inactive D164A OSR1. Inwardly rectifying K+ channel activity was quantified utilizing dual electrode voltage clamp and Kir2.1 channel protein abundance in the cell membrane was measured utilizing chemiluminescence of Kir2.1 containing an extracellular HA-tag epitope.\nKir2.1 activity was significantly enhanced by wild-type SPAK and T233E SPAK, but not by T233A SPAK and D212A SPAK, as well as by wild-type OSR1 and T185E OSR1, but not by T185A OSR1 and D164A OSR1. As shown for SPAK, the kinases enhanced Kir2.1 protein abundance in the cell membrane. The difference of current and conductance between oocytes expressing Kir2.1 together with SPAK or OSR1 and oocytes expressing Kir2.1 alone was dissipated following a 24 hours inhibition of channel insertion into the cell membrane by brefeldin A (5 \u00b5M).\nSPAK and OSR1 are both stimulators of Kir2.1 activity. They are presumably effective by enhancing channel insertion into the cell membrane.", "journal": "Neuro-Signals", "date": "2015-12-18", "authors": ["MyriamFezai", "MusaabAhmed", "ZohrehHosseinzadeh", "BernatElvira", "FlorianLang"], "doi": "10.1159/000442601"}

For the best possible image contrast was experimentally established the correction for Petri dish bottom thickness equal to 1 mm (objective lens Carl Zeiss). It was shown by method of the reconstruction of optical cross sections that growth zone in organotypic culture forms a multidimensional structure. In the presence of atenolol (10(-4) M) the thickness of the growth zone of the cardiac tissue explants was above the reference value 212%. The thickness of the growth zone in the presence of epinephrine (10(-9)-10(-13) M) did not differ from the control values. Experimentally was proved that atenolol mimics the trophotropic effects of epinephrine and these effects of epinephrine is realized primarily through \u03b21-adrenergic receptors.", "journal": "Rossiiskii fiziologicheskii zhurnal imeni I.M.

{"title": "Absence of cystatin C involvement in ventricular remodelling and heart failure.", "abstract": "Cystatin C (CysC) is a protease encoded by housekeeping genes. Although its prognostic value in heart failure (HF) is well known, it is debatable whether this value is due to the greater accuracy of CysC in calculating the glomerular filtration rate or to its involvement in pathological ventricular remodelling. The aim of this study was to determine whether CysC expression changes in the myocardium of foetuses of different ages and in the myocardium of adults with various cardiovascular diseases, as well as to analyse the correlation between its serum concentrations and cardiac structure and morphology in a patient group with HF.\nWe analysed the correlations (Pearson's r and Spearman's test) between the serum CysC levels and echocardiographic parameters of 351 patients with HF. We also performed immunohistochemical staining for CysC, metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and desmin in 9 cardiac tissue samples from autopsies of 4 foetuses of different gestational ages and 5 healthy adults or adults with cardiovascular disease.\nFor the patients with HF, there was no correlation between the CysC concentrations and the cardiac parameters measured by 2D echocardiography. The immunohistochemistry showed a weak background staining for CysC in all samples, regardless of age and the presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases.\nOur results suggest that CysC does not have a significant role in the pathological remodelling of the left ventricle in HF.", "journal": "Revista clinica espanola", "date": "2015-12-17", "authors": ["J IP\u00e9rez-Calvo", "TCastiella Muruz\u00e1bal", "MB\u00facar Barjud", "CJosa Laorden", "MS\u00e1nchez Marteles", "ILacambra Blasco", "M CAsensio L\u00f3pez", "D APascual Figal"], "doi": "10.1016/j.rce.2015.11.003"}
{"title": "In vivo experience with natural scaffolds for myocardial infarction: the times they are a-changin'.", "abstract": "Treating a myocardial infarction (MI), the most frequent cause of death worldwide, remains one of the most exciting medical challenges in the 21st century. Cardiac tissue engineering, a novel emerging treatment, involves the use of therapeutic cells supported by a scaffold for regenerating the infarcted area. It is essential to select the appropriate scaffold material; the ideal one should provide a suitable cellular microenvironment, mimic the native myocardium, and allow mechanical and electrical coupling with host tissues. Among available scaffold materials, natural scaffolds are preferable for achieving these purposes because they possess myocardial extracellular matrix properties and structures. Here, we review several natural scaffolds for applications in MI management, with a focus on pre-clinical studies and clinical trials performed to date. We also evaluate scaffolds combined with different cell types and proteins for their ability to promote improved heart function, contractility and neovascularization, and attenuate adverse ventricular remodeling. Although further refinement is necessary in the coming years, promising results indicate that natural scaffolds may be a valuable translational therapeutic option with clinical impact in MI repair.",

Some, such as frequent atrial or ventricular premature beats, may require long-term anti-arrhythmic therapy. In humans and small animals, sotalol hydrochloride (STL) is often used for chronic oral anti-arrhythmic therapy.

No information on STL pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics in horses is available and the aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenously (IV) and orally (PO) administered STL and the effects on surface electrocardiogram and left ventricular systolic function. Six healthy horses were given 1\u2009mg STL/kg bodyweight either IV or PO. Blood samples to determine plasma STL concentrations were taken before and at several time points after STL administration. Electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed at different time points before and after IV STL administration. Mean peak plasma concentrations after IV and PO administration of STL were 1624\u2009ng/mL and 317\u2009ng/mL, respectively. The oral bioavailability was intermediate (48%) with maximal absorption after 0.94\u2009h, a moderate distribution and a mean elimination half-life of 15.24\u2009h. After IV administration, there was a significant increase in QT interval, but no significant changes in other electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters. Transient transpiration was observed after IV administration, but no adverse effects were noted after a single oral dose of 1\u2009mg/kg STL in any of the horses.

Basal- and O3-induced antioxidant substances in tissues varied widely among strains. Wistar rats had a robust O3-induced increase in GSx and AH2 in the lung. Two CVD strains (JCR and SHHF) had high basal levels of AH2 and GSx in BALF as well as high basal lung UA. Across all strains, high BALF GSx was only observed when high BALF AH2 was present. CVD rats tended to respond less to O3 than normal. High-basal BALF AH2 levels were associated with decreased O3 toxicity. In summary, large differences were observed between both normal and CVD rat strains in low-molecular weight antioxidant concentrations in lung, BALF and heart tissue.

Oxidative stress and inflammation play vital role in the development of MI. The Indian basil or Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum Linn.), owing to its antioxidant potential, is used in the traditional system of Indian medicine to treat various disorders. We evaluated methanolic extract of O. sanctum (Tulsi) leaves on inflammation in isoproterenol (ISP) induced MI in rats. ISP-induced MI increased the levels of cardiac markers, phospholipases and phospholipid content. However, the same were reduced on pre-treatment with methanolic extract of O. sanctum leaves. The activities of 5-lipoxygenase and cycloxygenase-2 and levels of leukotriene B4 and thromboxane B2 were also elevated in ISP-treated rats, which were significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in extract pre-treated rats. The enhanced mRNA expressions of nuclear factor kappa-B, 5-lipoxygenase activating protein and receptor for leukotriene B4 on MI induction, were considerably reduced (P < 0.001) on extract pre-treatment. Histopathological analysis also confirmed the findings. The results also revealed the high phenolic content of methanolic extract of O. sanctum leaves. The study demonstrated that methanolic extract of Tulsi leaves can decrease inflammation in the cardiac tissue of ISP-induced MI in rats and its effect may be through downregulation of oxidative stress and arachidonic acid pathway.

{"title": "microRNA and Cardiac Regeneration.", "abstract": "Heart diseases are a very common health problem in developed as well as developing countries. In particular, ischemic heart disease and heart failure represent a plague for the patients and for the society. Loss of cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction or dysfunctioning tissue in nonischemic cardiomyopathies may result in cardiac failure. Despite great advancements in the treatment of these diseases, there is a substantial unmet need for novel therapies, ideally addressing repair and regeneration of the damaged or lost myocardium. Along this line, cardiac cell based therapies have gained substantial attention. Three main approaches are currently under investigation: stem cell therapy with either embryonic or adult stem cells; generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells; stimulation of endogenous regeneration trough direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes, activation of resident cardiac stem cells or induction of native resident cardiomyocytes to reenter the cell cycle. All these strategies need to be optimized since their efficiency is low.It has recently become clear that cardiac signaling and transcriptional pathways are intimately intertwined with microRNA molecules which act as modulators of cardiac development, function, and disease.

Current ablation technologies suffer from substantial recurrence rates, thermal side effects, and long procedure times. We demonstrate that ablation with nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) can potentially overcome these limitations.\nWe used optical mapping to monitor electrical activity in Langendorff-perfused New Zealand rabbit hearts (n = 12). We repeatedly inserted two shock electrodes, spaced 2-4 mm apart, into the ventricles (through the entire wall) and applied nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) (5-20 kV/cm, 350 ns duration, at varying pulse numbers and frequencies) to create linear lesions of 12-18 mm length. Hearts were stained either with tetrazolium chloride (TTC) or propidium iodide (PI) to determine the extent of ablation. Some stained lesions were sectioned to obtain the three-dimensional geometry of the ablated volume.\nIn all animals (12/12), we were able to create nonconducting lesions with less than 2 seconds of nsPEF application per site and minimal heating (< 0.2\u00b0C) of the tissue. The geometry of the ablated volume was smoother and more uniform throughout the wall than typical for RF ablation. The width of the lesions could be controlled up to 6 mm via the electrode spacing and the shock parameters.\nAblation with nsPEFs is a promising alternative to radiofrequency (RF) ablation of AF. It may dramatically reduce procedure times and produce more consistent lesion thickness than RF ablation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["FeiXie", "FrencyVarghese", "Andrei GPakhomov", "IuriiSemenov", "ShuXiao", "JonathanPhilpott", "ChristianZemlin"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0144833\n10.1161/CIRCEP.114.001853\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.000629\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.08.083\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.198\n10.1016/j.ccl.2013.07.007\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.08.034\n10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.01.03\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2008.01181.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302362\n10.3390/ijms160510834\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.03.013\n10.1007/s11886-015-0631-7\n10.1093/europace/euu215\n10.1007/s00232-014-9699-z\n10.1152/ajpheart.01121.2011\n10.1093/europace/eut368\n10.1007/s10840-014-9885-z\n10.1016/j.jcin.2008.12.014\n10.1007/s10840-011-9603-z\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.09.017\n10.1161/CIRCEP.111.970079\n10.1161/CIRCEP.114.001607\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2015.06.018\n10.1002/bem.21796\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.07.006\n10.1038/gt.2012.15"}

Cellular experiments demonstrated increased CD40-mediated uptake of Hsp70-SPIONs in comparison to non-conjugated SPIONs. Following induction of an acute infarct in rats by ligation of the left anterior descending artery SPIONs and Hsp70-SPION conjugates were injected intravenously on day 4.

{"title": "Fibrous scaffolds for building hearts and heart parts.", "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and biochemistry provide cell-instructive cues that promote and regulate tissue growth, function, and repair. From a structural perspective, the ECM is a scaffold that guides the self-assembly of cells into distinct functional tissues. The ECM promotes the interaction between individual cells and between different cell types, and increases the strength and resilience of the tissue in mechanically dynamic environments. From a biochemical perspective, factors regulating cell-ECM adhesion have been described and diverse aspects of cell-ECM interactions in health and disease continue to be clarified. Natural ECMs therefore provide excellent design rules for tissue engineering scaffolds. The design of regenerative three-dimensional (3D) engineered scaffolds is informed by the target ECM structure, chemistry, and mechanics, to encourage cell infiltration and tissue genesis. This can be achieved using nanofibrous scaffolds composed of polymers that simultaneously recapitulate 3D ECM architecture, high-fidelity nanoscale topography, and bio-activity. Their high porosity, structural anisotropy, and bio-activity present unique advantages for engineering 3D anisotropic tissues. Here, we use the heart as a case study and examine the potential of ECM-inspired nanofibrous scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering. We asked: Do we know enough to build a heart? To answer this question, we tabulated structural and functional properties of myocardial and valvular tissues for use as design criteria, reviewed nanofiber manufacturing platforms and assessed their capabilities to produce scaffolds that meet our design criteria. Our knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the heart, as well as our ability to create synthetic ECM scaffolds have advanced to the point that valve replacement with nanofibrous scaffolds may be achieved in the short term, while myocardial repair requires further study in vitro and in vivo.", "journal": "Advanced drug delivery reviews", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["A KCapulli", "L AMacQueen", "Sean PSheehy", "K KParker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.addr.2015.11.020"}

We sought to discover the molecular basis of sporadic DCM in an 11-year-old female with severe heart failure necessitating cardiac transplantation.\nParental echocardiograms excluded asymptomatic DCM. Whole exome sequencing was performed on the family trio and filtered for rare, deleterious, recessive, and de novo variants. Of the 8 candidate genes identified, only 2 had a role in cardiac physiology. A de novo missense mutation in TNNT2 was identified, previously reported and functionally validated in familial DCM with markedly variable penetrance. Additionally, recessive compound heterozygous truncating mutations were identified in XIRP2, a member of the ancient Xin gene family, which governs intercalated disc (ICD) maturation. Histomorphological analysis of explanted heart tissue revealed misregistration, mislocalization, and shortening of ICDs, findings similar to Xirp2(-/-) mice.\nThe synergistic effects of TNNT2 and XIRP2 mutations, resulting in perturbed sarcomeric force generation and transmission, respectively, would account for an early-onset heart failure phenotype.

{"title": "\u03b1-MHC MitoTimer mouse: In vivo mitochondrial turnover model reveals remarkable mitochondrial heterogeneity in the heart.", "abstract": "In order to maintain an efficient, energy-producing network in the heart, dysfunctional mitochondria are cleared through the mechanism of autophagy, which is closely linked with mitochondrial biogenesis; these, together with fusion and fission comprise a crucial process known as mitochondrial turnover. Until recently, the lack of molecular tools and methods available to researchers has impeded in vivo investigations of turnover. To investigate the process at the level of a single mitochondrion, our laboratory has developed the MitoTimer protein. Timer is a mutant of DsRed fluorescent protein characterized by transition from green fluorescence to a more stable red conformation over 48 h, and its rate of maturation is stable under physiological conditions. We fused the Timer cDNA with the inner mitochondrial membrane signal sequence and placed it under the control of a cardiac-restricted promoter. This construct was used to create the alpha-MHC-MitoTimer mice. Surprisingly, initial analysis of the hearts from these mice demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity in the ratio of red-to-green fluorescence of MitoTimer in cardiac tissue. Further, scattered solitary mitochondria within cardiomyocytes display a much higher red-to-green fluorescence (red-shifted) relative to other mitochondria in the cell, implying a block in import of newly synthesized MitoTimer likely due to lower membrane potential. These red-shifted mitochondria may represent older, senescent mitochondria. Concurrently, the cardiomyocytes also contain a subpopulation of mitochondria that display a lower red-to-green fluorescence (green-shifted) relative to other mitochondria, indicative of germinal mitochondria that are actively engaged in import of newly-synthesized mito-targeted proteins. These mitochondria can be isolated and sorted from the heart by flow cytometry for further analysis. Initial studies suggest that these mice represent an elegant tool for the investigation of mitochondrial turnover in the heart.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["AleksandrStotland", "Roberta AGottlieb"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.032"}

However, the mechanisms by which sustained \u03b2AR stimulation affects insulin resistance in the heart are incompletely understood.

Overstimulation of \u03b22AR inhibited the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes.

Various pharmacological activities of SSYX have been identified. However, the role of SSYX in cardiac hypertrophy remains to be fully elucidated.

The extent of cardiac hypertrophy was then evaluated by pathological and molecular analyses of heart tissue samples. In addition, in vitro experiments were performed to confirm the in vivo results. The data of the present study demonstrated that SSYX prevented the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis induced by AB, as assessed by measurements of heart weight and gross heart size, hematoxylin and eosin staining, cross\u2011sectional cardiomyocyte area and the mRNA expression levels of hypertrophic markers.

Preclinical models used to assess the risk for compound-induced effects on cardiac electrophysiology largely rely on animals that can differ in terms of sensitivity and specificity to the targeted clinical response. There is currently no in vitro human cardiomyocyte model for routine preclinical compound screening, as adult human cardiac tissue is unsuitable for such screening. The commercial availability of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) makes possible the development of assays for assessing compound-induced effects on cardiac function in a human cardiomyocyte-like model. Using multielectrode array (MEA) technology with hiPSC-CMs provides a facile screen for compound-induced effects on cardiac electrophysiology. The MEA data generated from hiPSC-CMs correlate well with the results of conventional preclinical assays and clinical findings. Described in this unit is a technique for measuring extracellular field potentials from hiPSC-CMs using MEA technology to screen for compound-induced effects on cardiac electrophysiology.", "journal": "Current protocols in pharmacology", "date": "2015-12-10", "authors": ["KateHarris"], "doi": "10.1002/0471141755.ph1118s71"}
{"title": "Characterization of changes in plasma and tissue oxylipin levels in LPS and CLP induced murine sepsis.", "abstract": "The present study aimed to comprehensively investigate the changes in oxylipins during murine sepsis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).\nTwenty-four hours after induction of sepsis in male C57BL/6 mice by LPS or CLP, plasma and liver, lung, kidney and heart tissues were sampled. Oxylipin levels in plasma and tissue were quantified by means of LC-MS. Moreover, clinical chemistry parameters were determined in plasma and interleukin levels (MCP-1 and IL-6) were determined in kidney and liver.\nElevation of liver function plasma parameters at 24 h revealed that both models were successful in the induction of sepsis. LPS induced sepsis resulted in a dramatic increase of plasma PGE2 (2,100% change in comparison to control) and other cyclooxygenase metabolites, whereas this effect was less pronounced in CLP induced sepsis (97% increase of PGE2). Plasma epoxy-fatty acids (FAs) and hydroxy-FAs and most of the dihydroxy-FAs were elevated in both models of sepsis. Changes of tissue oxylipin concentrations were organ dependent. Only few changes were detected in the lung and liver tissue, epoxy-FAs were elevated in the kidney. In the heart tissue a trend towards lower levels of hydroxy-FAs and epoxy-FAs was observed.\nBoth murine models of sepsis are characterized by changes of oxylipins formed in all branches of the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade. The more pronounced effects in the LPS model make this model more suitable for the investigation of the AA cascade and its pharmacological modulation in sepsis.", "journal": "Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

{"title": "Cardioprotective effect of metformin against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in rats.", "abstract": "The clinical use of doxorubicin, which is a strong antineoplastic agent, is limited due to its cardiotoxic side effects. Metformin is a drug with antihyperglycemic effects, and it has been shown to have a cardioprotective effect on left ventricular function in experimental animal models of myocardial ischemia. The present study investigated the cardioprotective effect of metformin in rats with doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.\nWistar albino rats were used in the study. Forty male, 10-week-old Wistar albino rats were randomly divided four groups. The control group rats were intraperitoneally administered saline solution twice a week, four doses in total. The doxorubicin group rats received doxorubicin (4 mg/kg, twice a week, cumulative dose: 16 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. The metformin group rats received metformin (250 mg/kg/day, every day for 14 days) via gavage. The doxorubicin + metformin group rats received doxorubicin and metformin at the same dose. Left ventricular functions were evaluated by using M-mode echocardiography one day after the last dose of doxorubicin. Heart tissue samples were histopathologically examined. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected using in situ terminal deoxynucleotide transferase assay (TUNEL). Serum brain natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide levels were measured. Catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were analyzed in the heart tissue. The assumptions of equality of variances and normal distribution were checked for all variables (Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Q graphics).To identify intergroup differences, one-way variant analysis or the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. A p<0.05 value was accepted as statistically significant.\nOur results showed that doxorubicin treatment caused significant deterioration in left ventricular functions by echocardiography, histological heart tissue damage, and increase in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Doxorubicin + metformin group showed protection in left ventricular function, elimination of histopathologic change, and reduced of cardiomyocyte apoptosis.\nThe present study provided evidence that metformin has cardioprotective effects against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Anatolian journal of cardiology", "date": "2015-12-08", "authors": ["MustafaArgun", "Kaz\u0131m\u00dcz\u00fcm", "Mehmet FatihS\u00f6nmez", "Abdullah\u00d6zyurt", "KarabulutDerya", "K\u00fcbra Tu\u011f\u00e7e\u00c7ilenk", "SunayUnalm\u0131\u015f", "\u00d6zgePamukcu", "AliBaykan", "FigenNarin", "FerhanElmal\u0131", "NazmiNarin"], "doi": "10.5152/akd.2015.6185"}

Here, we demonstrate that strong Dkk3 expression was markedly downregulated in adult hearts from WT mice, and Dkk3 expression was upregulated suddenly in hearts from DCM mouse models. Using Dkk3 transgenic and knockout mice, as well as cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice, which manifests progressive chamber dilation and contractile dysfunction and has pathologic phenotypes similar to human DCM patients, we determined that transgenic expression of Dkk3 increased survival rate, improved cardiac morphology breakage and dysfunction, and ameliorated cardiac pathological changes in the cTnT(R141W) mice. In contrast, Dkk3 knockout reduced the survival rate and aggravated the pathological phenotypes of the cTnT(R141W) mice. The protective effects of Dkk3 appeared clearly at 3 months of age, peaked at 6 months of age, and decreased at 10 months of age in the cTnT(R141W) mice. Furthermore, we determined that Dkk3 upregulated Dvl1 (Dishevelled 1) and key proteins of the canonical Wnt pathway (cytoplasmic and nuclear \u03b2-catenin, c-Myc, and Axin2) and downregulated key proteins of the noncanonical Wnt pathway (c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII), and histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4)). In contrast, Dkk3 knockout reversed these changes in the cTnT(R141W) mice. In summary, Dkk3 could prevent FDCM development in mice, especially in the compensatory stage, and probably through activation of the canonical and inhibition of the noncanonical Wnt pathway, which suggested that Dkk3 could serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiomyopathy and heart failure.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2015-12-08", "authors": ["DanLu", "DanBao", "WeiDong", "NingLiu", "XuZhang", "ShanGao", "WenpingGe", "XiangGao", "LianfengZhang"], "doi": "10.1038/labinvest.2015.145"}

Low-tyramine diets are recommended for patients treated with MAO inhibitors to avoid the fatal hypertensive crisis sadly known as \"cheese effect\". Hence, tyramine intake is suspected to have toxicological consequences in humans, while its administration to type 1 diabetic rodents has been reported to improve glucose tolerance. We investigated in mice whether prolonged tyramine ingestion could alter glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue physiology or cardiovascular functions. Tyramine was added at 0.04 or 0.14\u00a0% in the drinking water since this was estimated to increase by 10- to 40-fold the spontaneous tyramine intake of control mice fed a standard diet. Ten to 12\u00a0weeks of such tyramine supplementation did not influence body weight gain, adiposity or food consumption. Both doses (reaching approx. 300 and 1100\u00a0\u03bcmol tyramine/kg bw/day) decreased nonfasting blood glucose but did not modify glucose tolerance or fasting levels of glucose, insulin or circulating lipids. Blood pressure was not increased in tyramine-drinking mice, while only the higher tested dose moderately increased heart rate without change in its variability. Markers of cardiac tissue injury or oxidative stress remained unaltered, except an increased hydrogen peroxide production in heart preparations. In isolated adipocytes, tyramine inhibited lipolysis similarly in treated and control groups, as did insulin.

{"title": "Time-Dependent and Organ-Specific Changes in Mitochondrial Function, Mitochondrial DNA Integrity, Oxidative Stress and Mononuclear Cell Infiltration in a Mouse Model of Burn Injury.", "abstract": "Severe thermal injury induces a pathophysiological response that affects most of the organs within the body; liver, heart, lung, skeletal muscle among others, with inflammation and hyper-metabolism as a hallmark of the post-burn damage. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a key component in development of inflammatory and metabolic responses induced by burn. The goal of the current study was to evaluate several critical mitochondrial functions in a mouse model of severe burn injury. Mitochondrial bioenergetics, measured by Extracellular Flux Analyzer, showed a time dependent, post-burn decrease in basal respiration and ATP-turnover but enhanced maximal respiratory capacity in mitochondria isolated from the liver and lung of animals subjected to burn injury. Moreover, we detected a tissue-specific degree of DNA damage, particularly of the mitochondrial DNA, with the most profound effect detected in lungs and hearts of mice subjected to burn injury. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis in lung tissue in response to burn injury was also observed. Burn injury also induced time dependent increases in oxidative stress (measured by amount of malondialdehyde) and neutrophil infiltration (measured by myeloperoxidase activity), particularly in lung and heart. Tissue mononuclear cell infiltration was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The amount of poly(ADP-ribose) polymers decreased in the liver, but increased in the heart in later time points after burn. All of these biochemical changes were also associated with histological alterations in all three organs studied. Finally, we detected a significant increase in mitochondrial DNA fragments circulating in the blood immediately post-burn. There was no evidence of systemic bacteremia, or the presence of bacterial DNA fragments at any time after burn injury.

This study provides a systematic investigation of the spatio-temporal effects of a space-fractional model in cardiac electrophysiology. We consider a simplified model of electrical pulse propagation through cardiac tissue, namely the monodomain formulation of the Beeler-Reuter cell model on insulated tissue fibres, and obtain a space-fractional modification of the model by using the spectral definition of the one-dimensional continuous fractional Laplacian. The spectral decomposition of the fractional operator allows us to develop an efficient numerical method for the space-fractional problem. Particular attention is paid to the role played by the fractional operator in determining the solution behaviour and to the identification of crucial differences between the non-fractional and the fractional cases. We find a positive linear dependence of the depolarization peak height and a power law decay of notch and dome peak amplitudes for decreasing orders of the fractional operator. Furthermore, we establish a quadratic relationship in conduction velocity, and quantify the increasingly wider action potential foot and more pronounced dispersion of action potential duration, as the fractional order is decreased.

{"title": "Development of Electrically Conductive Double-Network Hydrogels via One-Step Facile Strategy for Cardiac Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering is an effective method to treat the myocardial infarction. However, the lack of electrical conductivity of biomaterials limits their applications. In this work, a homogeneous electronically conductive double network (HEDN) hydrogel via one-step facile strategy is developed, consisting of a rigid/hydrophobic/conductive network of chemical crosslinked poly(thiophene-3-acetic acid) (PTAA) and a flexible/hydrophilic/biocompatible network of photo-crosslinking methacrylated aminated gelatin (MAAG). Results suggest that the swelling, mechanical, and conductive properties of HEDN hydrogel can be modulated via adjusting the ratio of PTAA network to MAAG network. HEDN hydrogel has Young's moduli ranging from 22.7 to 493.1 kPa, and its conductivity (\u224810(-4) S cm(-1)) falls in the range of reported conductivities for native myocardium tissue. To assess their biological activity, the brown adipose-derived stem cells (BADSCs) are seeded on the surface of HEDN hydrogel with or without electrical stimulation. Our data show that the HEDN hydrogel can support the survival and proliferation of BADSCs, and that it can improve the cardiac differentiation efficiency of BADSCs and upregulate the expression of connexin 43. Moreover, electrical stimulation can further improve this effect.

{"title": "The role of Wnt regulation in heart development, cardiac repair and disease: A tissue engineering perspective.", "abstract": "Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling has proven to be a fundamental mechanism in cardiovascular development as well as disease. Understanding its particular role in heart formation has helped to develop pluripotent stem cell differentiation protocols that produce relatively pure cardiomyocyte populations. The resultant cardiomyocytes have been used to generate heart tissue for pharmaceutical testing, and to study physiological and disease states. Such protocols in combination with induced pluripotent stem cell technology have yielded patient-derived cardiomyocytes that exhibit some of the hallmarks of cardiovascular disease and are therefore being used to model disease states. While FDA approval of new treatments typically requires animal experiments, the burgeoning field of tissue engineering could act as a replacement. This would necessitate the generation of reproducible three-dimensional cardiac tissues in a well-controlled environment, which exhibit native heart properties, such as cellular density, composition, extracellular matrix composition, and structure-function. Such tissues could also enable the further study of Wnt signaling. Furthermore, as Wnt signaling has been found to have a mechanistic role in cardiac pathophysiology, e.g. heart attack, hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, and aortic stenosis, its strategic manipulation could provide a means of generating reproducible and specific, physiological and pathological cardiac models.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2015-12-03", "authors": ["AricPahnke", "GennaConant", "Locke DavenportHuyer", "YimuZhao", "NicoleFeric", "MilicaRadisic"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.060\n10.1038/nrg2320\n10.1101/cshperspect.a005975\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.02.008\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.113126\n10.1016/j.devcel.2014.08.008\n10.1074/jbc.M704287200\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010571\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.12.001\n10.1093/abbs/gmr079\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.221531\n10.1038/nchembio.137\n10.1073/pnas.1120068109\n10.1016/j.tips.2008.01.003\n10.1101/gad.1303605\n10.1161/01.RES.0000080317.92718.99\n10.1056/NEJMoa0908679\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1073/pnas.0605768103\n10.1073/pnas.0702859104\n10.1038/35035117\n10.1038/nature06894\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.205419\n10.1038/cr.2010.163\n10.1126/science.1136370\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.02.017\n10.1161/JAHA.112.002261\n10.1007/s11596-014-1228-x\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000093186.22847.4C\n10.1073/pnas.0835895100\n10.1073/pnas.0808393105\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000255946.55091.24\n10.1093/cvr/cvu054\n10.1016/j.tcm.2012.09.010\n10.1073/pnas.0610024104\n10.1073/pnas.0803437105\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.976969\n10.1093/cvr/cvq067\n10.1186/1755-1536-6-5\n10.1038/nm0597-541\n10.1046/j.1365-201X.2001.00887.x\n10.1038/nrcardio.2009.199\n10.1007/s00395-002-0365-8\n10.1242/dmm.006510\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.141127\n10.1056/NEJM199910213411706\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.06.006\n10.1093/cvr/cvu004\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.00391\n10.1056/NEJM199901143400207\n10.1152/ajpheart.00982.2007\n10.4049/jimmunol.1000181\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr062\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2014.05.922\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.189761\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000039342.85015.5C\n10.1161/01.RES.0000266605.63681.5a\n10.1016/j.febslet.2014.05.039\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.881433\n10.1007/s00395-012-0307-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0079821\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.116996\n10.1115/1.4026576"}

We have previously shown that cells isolated from uteri increase angiogenesis and alleviate cardiac dysfunction when transplanted after MI.

Here we report that uterine-derived CD11b cells significantly increase vasculogenesis and promote myocardial healing in ischemic cardiomyopathy. We have established a novel and simple methodology for uterine CD11b cell isolation and enrichment and demonstrate that this technique can be used for purifying and establishing viable CD11b cell cultures in rats. The isolated fresh CD11b cells were transplanted into ischemic rat hearts 5 days after injury. Following transplantation, vasculogenesis significantly increased in ischemic cardiac tissue, which reduced infarct size and restored myocardial function and perfusion compared with controls. Thus, uterine CD11b cells have the potential to promote functional healing when implanted after ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Recent studies, however, indicated that apart from NO and CO, H\u2082S is the third \"gasotransmitter\" involved in the regulation of various physiological functions. Nevertheless, its impact on renal IR injury remains unclear.\nRats were randomly divided into three groups: sham control; renal IR; and renal IR+NaHS groups.NaHS (100 \u00b5mol/kg, ip) was administered 30 min prior to the induction of renal ischemia.\nNaHS was found to attenuate significantly the IR-induced elevations in the serum levels of urea, creatinine and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) as compared with IR group. NaHS also significantly compensated the deficits in the total antioxidant capacities (TAC) and lowered the elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels observed with renal IR in renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac tissues. Furthermore, NaHS pretreatment down-regulated the renal IR-induced over-expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and up-regulated the IR-induced suppression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The loss of normal architecture, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cells infiltration detected by histopathological examination of renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac tissues in IR rats were markedly ameliorated by pre-ischemic NaHS treatment.\nNaHS protects against the effects of renal IR injury by acting primarily through a decrease in both pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS expression as well as through up-regulation of the eNOS pathway.

Given the biological and genetic diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi, the high morbidity, mortality, and the observed therapeutic failure, new characteristics of these outbreaks need to be addressed at different levels, both in Trypanosoma cruzi as in patient response. The aim of this work was to evaluate the patient's features involved in six outbreaks of acute Chagas disease which occurred in Santander, Colombia, and the characteristics of Trypanosoma cruzi clones isolated from these patients, to establish the potential relationship between the etiologic agent features with host behavior.\nThe clinical, pathological and epidemiological aspects of outbreaks were analyzed. In addition, Trypanosoma cruzi clones were biologically characterized both in vitro and in vivo, and the susceptibility to the classical trypanocidal drugs nifurtimox and benznidazole was evaluated. Trypanosoma cruzi clones were genotyped by means of mini-exon intergenic spacer and cytochrome b genes sequencing.\nAll clones were DTU I, and based on the mini-exon intergenic spacer, belong to two genotypes: G2 related with sub-urban, and G11 with rural outbreaks. Gir\u00f3n outbreak clones with higher susceptibility to drugs presented G2 genotype and C/T transition in Cyt b. The outbreaks affected mainly young population (\u00b125.9\u00a0years), and the mortality rate was 10\u00a0%. The cardiac tissue showed intense inflammatory infiltrate, myocardial necrosis and abundant amastigote nests. However, although the gastrointestinal tissue was congestive, no inflammation or parasites were observed.\nAlthough all clones belong to DTU I, two intra-DTU genotypes were found with the sequencing of the mini-exon intergenic spacer, however there is no strict correlation between genetic groups, the cycles of the parasite or the clinical forms of the disease.

A semi-synthetic triterpenoid, bardoxolone methyl (BM) was administrated to mice fed a HF diet for 21 weeks to determine if it would prevent the development of obesity-associated cardiac and renal pathophysiologies. Twelve week old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a lab chow (LC), HF (40% fat), or a HF diet supplemented with 10\u00a0mg/kg/day BM in drinking water. After 21 weeks, the left ventricles of hearts and cortex of kidneys of mice were collected for analysis. Histological analysis revealed that BM prevented HF diet-induced development of structural changes in the heart and kidneys. BM prevented HF diet-induced decreases in myocyte number in cardiac tissue, although this treatment also elevated cardiac endothelin signalling molecules. In the kidneys, BM administration prevented HF diet-induced renal corpuscle hypertrophy and attenuated endothelin signalling. Furthermore, in both the hearts and kidneys of mice fed a HF diet, BM administration prevented HF diet-induced increases in fat accumulation, macrophage infiltration and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) gene expression. These findings suggest that BM prevents HF diet-induced developments of cardiac and renal pathophysiologies in mice fed a chronic HF diet by preventing inflammation.

Streptococcus gordonii is one of the pioneer colonizers. In addition to its role in oral biofilm development, S. gordonii also is a pathogen in infective endocarditis in susceptible humans. A surface adhesin, Hsa, has been shown to play a critical role in colonization of S. gordonii on the heart tissue; however, its role in oral biofilm development has not been reported. In this study we demonstrate that Hsa is essential for coaggregation between S. gordonii and Veillonella sp., which are bridging species connecting the pioneer colonizers to the late colonizers. Interestingly, the same domains shown to be required for Hsa binding to sialic acid on the human cell surface are also required for coaggregation with Veillonella sp. However, sialic acid appeared not to be required for this intergeneric coaggregation.

{"title": "The muscle contraction mode determines lymphangiogenesis differentially in rat skeletal and cardiac muscles by modifying local lymphatic extracellular matrix microenvironments.", "abstract": "Lymphatic vessels are of special importance for tissue homeostasis, and increases of their density may foster tissue regeneration. Exercise could be a relevant tool to increase lymphatic vessel density (LVD); however, a significant lack of knowledge remains to understand lymphangiogenesis in skeletal muscles upon training. Interestingly, training-induced lymphangiogenesis has never been studied in the heart. We studied lymphangiogenesis and LVD upon chronic concentric and chronic eccentric muscle contractions in both rat skeletal (Mm. Edl and Sol) and cardiac muscles.\nWe found that LVD decreased in both skeletal muscles specifically upon eccentric training, while this contraction increased LVD in cardiac tissue. These observations were supported by opposing local remodelling of lymphatic vessel-specific extracellular matrix components in skeletal and cardiac muscles and protein levels of lymphatic markers (Lyve-1, Pdpn, Vegf-C/D). Confocal microscopy further revealed transformations of lymphatic vessels into vessels expressing both blood (Cav-1) and lymphatic (Vegfr-3) markers upon eccentric training specifically in skeletal muscles.

{"title": "Computational Approaches to Understanding the Role of Fibroblast-Myocyte Interactions in Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis.", "abstract": "The adult heart is composed of a dense network of cardiomyocytes surrounded by nonmyocytes, the most abundant of which are cardiac fibroblasts. Several cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarction or dilated cardiomyopathy, are associated with an increased density of fibroblasts, that is, fibrosis. Fibroblasts play a significant role in the development of electrical and mechanical dysfunction of the heart; however the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood. One widely studied mechanism suggests that fibroblasts produce excess extracellular matrix, resulting in collagenous septa. These collagenous septa slow propagation, cause zig-zag conduction paths, and decouple cardiomyocytes resulting in a substrate for arrhythmia. Another emerging mechanism suggests that fibroblasts promote arrhythmogenesis through direct electrical interactions with cardiomyocytes via gap junctions. Due to the challenges of investigating fibroblast-myocyte coupling in native cardiac tissue, computational modeling and in vitro experiments have facilitated the investigation into the mechanisms underlying fibroblast-mediated changes in cardiomyocyte action potential morphology, conduction velocity, spontaneous excitability, and vulnerability to reentry. In this paper, we summarize the major findings of the existing computational studies investigating the implications of fibroblast-myocyte interactions in the normal and diseased heart.

Meis1 also reduces Ang II-induced activation of Akt-mTOR pathway. Finally, we show that PCBP2 overexpression rescues the Meis1 effects of Akt-mTOR pathway and hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes. \u00a9 2015 IUBMB Life, 68(1):13-22, 2016.", "journal": "IUBMB life", "date": "2015-11-26", "authors": ["YunjiaoZhang", "YiSi", "NanMa"], "doi": "10.1002/iub.1456"}
{"title": "Improving vagal activity ameliorates cardiac fibrosis induced by angiotensin II: in vivo and in vitro.", "abstract": "Cardiac remodeling is characterized by overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and withdrawal of vagal activity. We hypothesized that improving vagal activity could attenuate cardiac fibrosis induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) in vivo and in vitro. Rats were subjected to abdominal aorta constriction (AAC) with or without pyridostigmine (PYR) (31 mg/kg/d). After 8 weeks, PYR significantly decreased Ang II level, AT1 protein expression, and collagen deposition in cardiac tissue and improved heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity and cardiac function, which were abolished by atropine. In vitro, treatment of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) with Ang II (10(-7) M) increased cell proliferation, migration, transformation, and secretory properties, which were significantly diminished by acetylcholine (ACh, 10(-6) M). Subsequently, Ang II significantly increased collagen type I expression as well as metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 expression and activity. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 expression and Smad3 phosphorylation presented a similar trend. Notably, the knockdown of the acetylcholine M2 receptor by siRNA could abolish ACh anti-fibrotic action. These data implicated cholinesterase inhibitor can increase vagal activity and reduce local Ang II level, and ACh inhibit Ang II pro-fibrotic effects.

{"title": "Ischemia triggered ATP release through Pannexin-1 channel by myocardial cells activates sympathetic fibers.", "abstract": "The cardiovascular system is extensively innervated by the autonomic nervous system, and the autonomic modulation including sympathetic innervation is crucial to the function of heart during normal and ischemic conditions. Severe myocardial ischemia could cause acute myocardial infarction, which is one of the leading diseases in the world. Thus studying the sympathetic modulation during ischemia could reduce the probability of myocardial infarction and further heart failure. The neurotransmitter ATP is released by myocardial cells during ischemia; however, the effect of ATP release remains elusive. We examined whether ATP released during ischemia functions as a neurotransmitter that activates sympathetic nerve in the heart. A novel technique of recording the sympathetic fiber calcium imaging in mouse cardiac tissue slices was used. We have applied the Cre/loxP system to specifically express GCaMP3, a genetically encoded calcium indicator, in the sympathetic nerve. Using this technique, we found that ATP released by myocardial cells through Pannexin-1 channel during ischemia could evoke calcium responses in cardiac sympathetic nerve fibers.

We previously generated cardiovascular cell sheets entirely from pluripotent stem cells with cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and vascular mural cells.

Here we report an efficient method to overcome the stacking limitation. Insertion of gelatin hydrogel microspheres (GHMs) between each cardiovascular cell sheet broke the viable limitation via appropriate spacing and fluid impregnation with GHMs. Fifteen sheets with GHMs (15-GHM construct; >1\u2009mm thickness) were stacked within several hours and viable after 1 week in vitro.

Previous models of cardiac electromechanics often ignore such discrete properties and treat cardiac tissue as a continuous medium, which has fundamental limitations. In the present study, we introduce a 2D electromechanical model for human atrial tissue based on the discrete element method (DEM). In the model, single-cell dynamics are governed by strongly coupling the electrophysiological model of Courtemanche et al. to the myofilament model of Rice et al. with two-way feedbacks. Each cell is treated as a viscoelastic body, which is physically represented by a clump of nine particles. Cell aggregations are arranged so that the anisotropic nature of cardiac tissue due to fibre orientations can be modelled. Each cell is electrically coupled to neighbouring cells, allowing excitation waves to propagate through the tissue. Cell-to-cell mechanical interactions are modelled using a linear contact bond model in DEM. By coupling cardiac electrophysiology with mechanics via the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, the DEM model successfully simulates the conduction of cardiac electrical waves and the tissue's corresponding mechanical contractions. The developed DEM model is numerically stable and provides a powerful method for studying the electromechanical coupling problem in the heart.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2015-11-20", "authors": ["PaulBrocklehurst", "IsmailAdeniran", "DongminYang", "YongSheng", "HengguiZhang", "JianqiaoYe"], "doi": "10.1155/2015/854953\n10.1016/j.pcad.2005.06.002\n10.1161/01.cir.98.10.946\n10.1146/annurev.me.39.020188.000353\n10.1007/s11517-013-1090-1\n10.2165/00003495-200969070-00001\n10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764\n10.1113/jphysiol.1962.sp006849\n10.1161/01.res.82.1.63\n10.1161/01.res.87.7.e25\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.06.011\n10.1136/jamia.1996.96236280\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1781\n10.1002/cpe.1332\n10.1007/s11517-012-0924-6\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.05.008\n10.1152/ajpheart.00923.2006\n10.1016/s0079-6107(98)00038-8\n10.1529/biophysj.107.119487\n10.1529/biophysj.105.069534\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2009.11.001\n10.1109/jproc.2006.871772\n10.1152/ajpheart.00862.2009\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2004.01.016\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2010.05.003\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2010.08.006\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2011.05.014\n10.1016/j.ijrmms.2004.09.011\n10.1038/173971a0\n10.1152/ajpheart.00478.2003\n10.1006/abbi.2000.2131\n10.1016/s1357-2725(03)00264-4\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.035\n10.1103/physrevlett.110.158101\n10.1161/01.RES.61.6.815\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.529545\n10.1113/jphysiol.2013.254987\n10.1002/cnm.2570\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2004.01.002"}

The fraction of nonconducting media in comparison with the fraction of healthy myocytes and the topological distribution of cells determines the probability of ectopic beat generation. First, a detailed subcellular microscopic model that accounts for the microstructure of the cardiac tissue is constructed and employed for the numerical simulation of action potential propagation. Next, an equivalent discrete model is implemented, which permits a faster integration of the equations. This discrete model is a simplified version of the microscopic model that maintains the distribution of connections between cells. Both models produce similar results when describing action potential propagation in homogeneous tissue; however, they slightly differ in the generation of ectopic beats in heterogeneous tissue. Nevertheless, both models present the generation of reentry inside fibrotic tissues. This kind of reentry restricted to microfibrosis regions can result in the formation of ectopic pacemakers, that is, regions that will generate a series of ectopic stimulus at a fast pacing rate.

Such a repolarization pattern is believed to trigger phase-2 reentry (P2R); however, little is known about the conditions necessary for its initiation. This study aims to determine the specific mechanisms that facilitate P2R induction in Brugada-affected cardiac tissue in humans.\nIonic models for Brugada syndrome in human epicardial cells were developed and used to study the induction of P2R in cables, sheets, and a three-dimensional model of the right ventricular free wall.\nIn one-dimensional cables, P2R can be induced by adjoining lost-dome and delayed-dome regions, as mediated by tissue excitability and transmembrane voltage profiles, and reduced coupling facilitates its induction. In two and three dimensions, sustained reentry can arise when three regions (delayed-dome, lost-dome, and normal epicardium) are present.\nNot only does P2R induction by Brugada syndrome require regions of action potential with delayed-dome and lost-dome, but in order to generate a sustained reentry from a triggered waveback multiple factors are necessary, including heterogeneity in action potential distribution, tissue coupling, direction of stimulation, the shape of the late plateau, the duration of lost-dome action potentials, and recovery of tissue excitability, which is predominantly modulated by tissue coupling.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2015-11-20", "authors": ["AlfonsoBueno-Orovio", "Elizabeth MCherry", "Steven JEvans", "Flavio HFenton"], "doi": "10.1155/2015/197586\n10.1016/0735-1097(92)90253-j\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1997.tb00796.x\n10.1161/01.cir.97.5.457\n10.1161/01.res.0000046046.53721.90\n10.1038/32675\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.12.019\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.07.021\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.03.005\n10.1016/0008-6363(96)00115-0\n10.1161/01.cir.87.2.562\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.15.1660\n10.1161/circep.108.790543\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.11.033\n10.1093/cvr/cvn023\n10.1152/ajpheart.91495.2007\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.12.064\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.10.059\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2008.02.028\n10.1161/circulationaha.105.532614\n10.1161/circulationaha.108.771401\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.03.029\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2004.03.061\n10.1152/ajpheart.00849.2002\n10.1016/s0735-1097(02)01964-2\n10.1063/1.1840311\n10.1137/040607575\n10.1016/0735-1097(95)00167-x\n10.1161/hc1002.105183\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2001.00268.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000032002.22105.7A\n10.1161/01.cir.0000105762.94855.46\n10.1161/01.cir.93.1.168\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2003.02365.x\n10.1253/circj.69.567\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.02.043\n10.1088/0967-3334/27/11/006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0052234\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00071\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.06.039\n10.1371/journal.pone.0086947\n10.1152/ajpheart.00747.2003\n10.1161/circulationaha.114.013698\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1999.tb00667.x\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.02.016\n10.1016/S0002-9149(97)00942-9\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2004.03681.x\n10.1536/ihj.51.17\n10.1098/rsif.2014.0352\n10.1073/pnas.1304382110\n10.1371/journal.pone.0105897"}

Matricellular proteins are described as extracellular matrix-associated proteins that do not serve classical structural roles in the matrix such as those ascribed to laminins and collagens. The family of matricellular proteins modulates cell:extracellular matrix interactions and is actively expressed during tissue remodeling. Functional activities attributed to SPARC in cultured cells include regulation of cell adhesion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, proliferation, and matrix assembly. The primary phenotype characteristic of SPARC-null mice is a deficit in amounts of fibrillar collagen and fibril morphology. Strikingly, SPARC-null mice demonstrate a blunted fibrotic response in a number of different tissue settings. The role of monocyte/macrophages as an important component of tissue fibrosis is becoming increasingly appreciated. Expression of SPARC by bone marrow derived inflammatory cells raises the interesting proposition that SPARC produced by infiltrating leukocytes might contribute to the course of inflammation and tissue fibrosis in the heart.

{"title": "Analysis of Mitochondrial Proteins in the Surviving Myocardium after Ischemia Identifies Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier Expression as Possible Mediator of Tissue Viability.", "abstract": "The endogenous mechanisms contributing to tissue survival following myocardial infarction are not fully understood. We investigated the alterations in the mitochondrial proteome after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and its possible implications on cell survival. Mitochondrial proteomic analysis of cardiac tissue from an in vivo porcine I/R model found that surviving tissue in the peri-infarct border zone showed increased expression of several proteins. Notably, these included subunits of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), namely MPC1 and MPC2. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA analysis corroborated the elevated expression of MPC in the surviving tissue. Furthermore, MPC1 and MPC2 protein levels were found to be markedly elevated in the myocardium of ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. These findings led to the hypothesis that increased MPC expression is cardioprotective due to enhancement of mitochondrial pyruvate uptake in the energy-starved heart following I/R. To test this, isolated mouse hearts perfused with a modified Krebs buffer (containing glucose, pyruvate, and octanoate as metabolic substrates) were subjected to I/R with or without the MPC transport inhibitor UK5099.

However, aerobically perfused control hearts that were exposed to UK5099 did not modulate contractile function, although pyruvate uptake was blocked as evidenced by increased cytosolic lactate and pyruvate levels.

Endogenously generated electric field (EF) have been proven as an important regulator for cell migration and tissue repair. The mechanisms of ion channel involvement in EF-induced cell responses are extensively studied but largely are poorly understood. In this study we generated three COS-7 clones with different expression levels of Kv1.2 channel, and confirmed their functional variations with patch clamp analysis. Time-lapse imaging analysis showed that EF-induced cell migration response was Kv1.2 channel expression level depended. Inhibition of Kv1.2 channels with charybdotoxin (ChTX) constrained the sensitivity of COS-7 cells to EF stimulation more than their motility. Immunocytochemistry and pull-down analyses demonstrated association of Kv1.2 channels with actin-binding protein cortactin and its re-localization to the cathode-facing membrane at EF stimulation, which confirms the mechanism of EF-induced directional migration. This study displays that Kv1.2 channels represent an important physiological link in EF-induced cell migration. The described mechanism suggests a potential application of EF which may improve therapeutic performance in curing injuries of neuronal and/or cardiac tissue repair, post operational therapy, and various degenerative syndromes.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2015-11-19", "authors": ["GaofengZhang", "MathewEdmundson", "VsevolodTelezhkin", "YuGu", "XiaoqingWei", "Paul JKemp", "BingSong"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.25259"}

In this study, we investigated whether atorvastatin could inhibit radiation-induced heart fibrosis in Sprague-Dawley rats, which were randomly divided into six groups: control; radiation only; and four treatment groups receiving atorvastatin plus radiation (E1, E2, E3 and E4). All rats, except the control group, received local heart irradiation in 7 daily fractions of 3 Gy for a total of 21 Gy. Rats in groups E1 (10 mg/kg/day) and E2 (20 mg/kg/day) received atorvastatin and radiation treatment until week 12 after exposure. Rats in groups E3 (10 mg/kg/day) and E4 (20 mg/kg/day) received atorvastatin treatment from 3 months before irradiation to week 12 after irradiation. The expressions of TGF-\u03b21, Smad2, Smad3, fibronectin, ROCK I and p-Akt in heart tissues were evaluated using real-time PCR or Western blot analyses. Atorvastatin significantly reduced the expression of TGF-\u03b21, Smad3/P-Smad3, ROCK I and p-Akt in rats of the E1-E4 groups and in a dose-dependent manner. Fibronectin exhibited a similar pattern of expression changes. In addition, echocardiography showed that atorvastatin treatment can inhibit the increase of left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, left ventricular end-systolic diameter and left ventricular posterior wall thickness, and prevent the decrease of ejection fraction and fraction shortening in E1-E4 groups compared with the radiation only group. This study demonstrated that radiation exposure increased the expression of fibronectin in cardiac fibroblasts and induced cardiac fibrosis through activation of the TGF-\u03b21/Smad3, RhoA/ROCK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.

Our primary aim was to investigate the effects of post-myocardial infarction heart failure well-characterized by left ventricular hemodynamic parameters on the total and high molecular weight adiponectin concentrations in plasma, fat and cardiac tissue. Eight weeks after myocardial infarction or sham operation, total and high molecular weight adiponectin concentrations in plasma, fat, and cardiac tissues were assayed in rats. In addition, hemodynamic parameters and expression of the genes encoding atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide in left ventricle were evaluated. Atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide mRNA levels in left ventricle tissue were higher in rats with myocardial infarction-induced heart failure compared with the controls. Similarly, total adiponectin concentration was increased in left ventricle (but not in right ventricle) in rats with post-myocardial infarction heart failure. In contrast, adiponectin levels in plasma and cardiac adipose tissue in rats with post-myocardial infarction heart failure were lower than in sham-operated animals. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in levels of high molecular weight adiponectin in plasma, cardiac tissue or adipose tissue between these two groups.

We reported earlier that a specific proteasome isoform, the immunoproteasome, prevents exacerbation of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocardial destruction and preserves cell vitality in heart tissue inflammation. Following the aim to decipher molecular targets of immunoproteasome-dependent proteolysis, we investigated the function and regulation of the soluble PRR Pentraxin3 (PTX3). We show that the ablation of PTX3 in mice aggravated CVB3-triggered inflammatory injury of heart tissue, without having any significant effect on viral titers. Thus, there might be a role of PTX3 in preventing damage-associated molecular pattern-induced cell death. We found that the catalytic activity of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 regulates the timely availability of factors controlling PTX3 production. We report on immunoproteasome-dependent alteration of ERK1/2 and p38MAPKs, which were both found to be involved in PTX3 expression control. Our finding of a cardioprotective function of immunoproteasome-dependent PTX3 expression revealed a crucial mechanism of the stress-induced damage response in myocardial inflammation.

This involves an increase in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and intracellular polyamines associated with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) increases. The aim of the study was to establish the role of these in the human heart in living patients. For this, polyamines (by high performance liquid chromatography) and the activity of ODC and N(1)-acetylpolyamine oxidases (APAO) were determined in the right atrial appendage of 17 patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation to correlate with clinical parameters. There existed enzymatic activity associated with the homeostasis of polyamines. Left atria size was positively associated with ODC (r = 0.661, P = 0.027) and negatively with APAO-N(1) -acetylspermine (r = -0.769, P = 0.026), suggesting that increased levels of polyamines are associated with left atrial hemodynamic overload.

In the present study, we elucidate that physical forces exerted by electroactuated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have a strong influence in regulating the lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). A novel platform that combines intracellular and extracellular GNPs as nano-manipulators was designed to trigger neurogenic/cardiomyogenic differentiation in hMSCs, in electric field stimulated culture condition. In order to mimic the native microenvironment of nerve and cardiac tissues, hMSCs were treated with physiologically relevant direct current electric field (DC EF) or pulsed electric field (PEF) stimuli, respectively. When exposed to regular intermittent cycles of DC EF stimuli, majority of the GNP actuated hMSCs acquired longer filopodial extensions with multiple branch-points possessing neural-like architecture. Such morphological changes were consistent with higher mRNA expression level for neural-specific markers. On the other hand, PEF elicited cardiomyogenic differentiation, which is commensurate with the tube-like morphological alterations along with the upregulation of cardiac specific markers. The observed effect was significantly promoted even by intracellular actuation and was found to be substrate independent. Further, we have substantiated the participation of oxidative signaling, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)]i elevation as the key upstream regulators dictating GNP assisted hMSC differentiation. Thus, by adopting dual stimulation protocols, we could successfully divert the DC EF exposed cells to differentiate predominantly into neural-like cells and PEF treated cells into cardiomyogenic-like cells, via nanoactuation of GNPs.

Here, we found that GAS6 was upregulated in human dilated cardiomyopathic hearts, hypertrophic murine hearts, and angiotensin II-treated cardiomyocytes. Next, we examined the influence of GAS6 expression in response to a cardiac stress by inducing chronic pressure overload with aortic banding in wild-type and GAS6-knockout mice or cardiac-specific GAS6 overexpressing mice. Under basal conditions, the GAS6-knockout mice had normal left ventricular structure and function but after aortic banding, the mice demonstrated less hypertrophy, fibrosis, and contractile dysfunction when compared with wild-type mice. Conversely, cardiac-specific overexpression of GAS6 exacerbated aortic banding-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GAS6 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway during pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and the pharmacological mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 inhibitor U0126 almost completely reversed GAS6 overexpression-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, resulting in improved cardiac function. Collectively, our data support the notion that GAS6 impairs ventricular adaptation to chronic pressure overload by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling.

In this study, matrix metalloproteinases were investigated at different times of cardiomyocyte 2D cultivation and 3D cultivation in collagen gels. It was found that cardiomyocytes in 2D culture synthesize matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, wherein their amount varies with the cultivation time. The peak MMP-9 amount is at early cultivation time, when the reorganization of cardiomyocyte contractile apparatus occurs, and the MMP-2 peak precedes the recovery of the initial organization of their contractile apparatus. Upon cardiomyocyte cultivation in 3D collagen gels, in which case their contractile apparatus does not rearrange, a steady small amount of MMP-2 and MMP-9 is observed. These data indicate that the cardiomyocyte contractile apparatus reorganization in culture is associated with synthesis and spatial organization of their own extracellular matrix.", "journal": "Biochemistry.

{"title": "Trimetazidine prevents macrophage-mediated septic myocardial dysfunction via activation of the histone deacetylase sirtuin 1.", "abstract": "Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response accompanied by excessive production of inflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular dysfunction. Importantly, macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory agents play a key role in cardiovascular impairment in sepsis. Here we have investigated the effects of trimetazidine (TMZ) on pro-inflammatory responses of macrophages in endotoxin-induced myocardial dysfunction.\nMice pretreated with TMZ were injected i.p. with LPS and cardiac function evaluated. Levels of macrophage infiltration, macrophage inflammatory response and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were measured using immunohistochemical staining, elisa, real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, TUNEL and flow cytometry assays.\nPretreatment with TMZ prevented LPS-induced myocardial dysfunction and apoptosis. TMZ also lowered levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and cardiac tissue and myocardial macrophage infiltration. Bone marrow transplantation indicated that TMZ alleviated LPS-induced myocardial dysfunction via decreasing macrophage infiltration. TMZ reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated cardiac and peritoneal macrophages. Co-culture of TMZ-pretreated macrophages with cardiomyocytes and conditioned media from TMZ-pretreated macrophages both decreased LPS-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The anti-apoptosis effects of TMZ resulted from decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines, partly due to normalizing the sirtuin 1 (Sirt1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Nrf2/haem oxygenase-1 and Sirt1/PPAR\u03b1 pathways in macrophages. Cytokine secretion was also regulated by ROS, which were attenuated by TMZ via activation of Sirt1, AMPK and PPAR\u03b1.\nTMZ protected against LPS-induced myocardial dysfunction and apoptosis, accompanied by inhibition of macrophage pro-inflammatory responses.

The cardiac myocytes were respectively inoculated in one 12-well plate filled with 6 round cover slips, one 12-well plate filled with 6 square cover slips, two cell culture flasks, and two cell culture dishes. After routine culture for three days, the cardiac myocytes from all the containers were divided into normal control group (NC, routinely cultured with 3 mL DMEM/F12 solution rewarmed at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h) and group MD (routinely cultured with 3 mL DMEM/F12 solution rewarmed at 37 \u00b0 and containing 8 \u00b5mol/L colchicine for 3 h) according to the random number table, with 3 holes, 1 flask, or 1 dish in each group. The morphological changes in microtubules were observed with confocal laser scanning microscope after immunofluorescent staining. The content of polymerized or dissociative \u03b1-tubulin was determined by Western blotting. Spontaneous beating rate of the cells was observed and calculated under inverted microscope. Dissolved oxygen concentration of DMEM/F12 solution containing cardiac myocytes was determined by oxygen microelectrode system before and after the addition of colchicine. Additionally, dissolved oxygen concentration of DMEM/F12 solution and colchicine + DMEM/F12 solution was determined. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record AP, delayed rectifier K+ current (I(K)), and L-type Ca2+ current (I(Ca-L)) in cardiac myocytes; current density-voltage (I-V) curves were drawn based on the traces. Data were processed with independent or paired samples t-test.\n(1) In group NC, microtubules of cardiac myocytes were around the nucleus in radial distribution with intact and clear linear tubiform structure. The microtubules in group MD were observed in dispersive distribution with damaged structure and rough linear tubiform structure.

{"title": "Regulation of Spatiotemporal Patterns by Biological Variability: General Principles and Applications to Dictyostelium discoideum.", "abstract": "Spatiotemporal patterns often emerge from local interactions in a self-organizing fashion. In biology, the resulting patterns are also subject to the influence of the systematic differences between the system's constituents (biological variability). This regulation of spatiotemporal patterns by biological variability is the topic of our review. We discuss several examples of correlations between cell properties and the self-organized spatiotemporal patterns, together with their relevance for biology. Our guiding, illustrative example will be spiral waves of cAMP in a colony of Dictyostelium discoideum cells. Analogous processes take place in diverse situations (such as cardiac tissue, where spiral waves occur in potentially fatal ventricular fibrillation) so a deeper understanding of this additional layer of self-organized pattern formation would be beneficial to a wide range of applications. One of the most striking differences between pattern-forming systems in physics or chemistry and those in biology is the potential importance of variability. In the former, system components are essentially identical with random fluctuations determining the details of the self-organization process and the resulting patterns. In biology, due to variability, the properties of potentially very few cells can have a driving influence on the resulting asymptotic collective state of the colony. Variability is one means of implementing a few-element control on the collective mode. Regulatory architectures, parameters of signaling cascades, and properties of structure formation processes can be \"reverse-engineered\" from observed spatiotemporal patterns, as different types of regulation and forms of interactions between the constituents can lead to markedly different correlations. The power of this biology-inspired view of pattern formation lies in building a bridge between two scales: the patterns as a collective state of a very large number of cells on the one hand, and the internal parameters of the single cells on the other.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2015-11-13", "authors": ["MiriamGrace", "Marc-ThorstenH\u00fctt"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004367\n10.1038/ng.1090\n10.1126/science.1179047\n10.1073/pnas.1018109108\n10.1016/j.tree.2007.10.013\n10.1126/science.1183415\n10.1073/pnas.1218025110\n10.1038/nrm2766\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000422\n10.1098/rsif.2012.1016\n10.1126/science.1154413\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000190\n10.15252/msb.20145399\n10.1016/j.bpc.2008.10.001\n10.1063/1.3206698\n10.1371/journal.pone.0042508\n10.1063/1.3204256\n10.1073/pnas.0910414107\n10.1098/rsta.2010.0038\n10.1091/mbc.E11-09-0764\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.04.001\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.05.002\n10.1002/bies.201100187\n10.1016/j.gde.2010.09.004\n10.1126/scisignal.2002449\n10.1126/science.1190372\n10.1007/978-1-62703-450-0_10"}
{"title": "Six Conductivity Values to Use in the Bidomain Model of Cardiac Tissue.", "abstract": "The aim of this work is to produce a consistent set of six conductivity values for use in the bidomain model of cardiac tissue.\nStudies in 2007 by Hooks et\u00a0al. and in 2009 by Caldwell et\u00a0al. have found that, in the directions longitudinal:transverse:normal (l:t:n) to the cardiac fibers, ratios of bulk conductivities and conduction velocities are each approximately in the ratio 4:2:1. These results are used here as the basis for a method that can find sets of six normalized bidomain conductivity values.\nIt is found that the ratios involving transverse and normal conductivities are quite consistent, allowing new light to be shed on conductivity in the normal direction. For example, it is found that the ratio of transverse to normal conductivity is much greater in the intracellular (i) than the extracellular (e) domain. Using parameter values from experimental studies leads to the proposal of a new nominal six conductivity dataset: gil=2.4, gel=2.4, git=0.35, get=2.0, gin=0.08, and gen=1.1 (all in mS/cm).\nWhen it is used to model partial thickness ischaemia, this dataset produces epicardial potential distributions in accord with experimental studies in an animal model. It is, therefore, suggested that the dataset is suitable for use in numerical simulations.\nSince the bidomain approach is the most commonly used method for modeling cardiac electrophysiological phenomena, new information about conductivity in the normal direction, as well as a consistent set of six conductivity values, is valuable for researchers who perform simulation studies.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2015-11-13", "authors": ["Barbara MJohnston"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2015.2498144"}

In group 1 (sham group) the rats underwent the same anaesthetic and surgical procedure as the control group except for ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery; group 2 (control group) rats were subjected to regional ischaemia for 25 minutes by ligation of LAD coronary artery and reperfusion for 2 hours; group 3 (control vehicle group) rats received (normal saline) vehicle of valsartan via IP injection and were subjected to regional ischaemia for 25 minutes by ligation of LAD coronary artery and reperfusion for two hours; group 4 (valsartan treated group) rats were pretreated with valsartan 10 mg/kg IP 30 minutes before ligation of LAD coronary artery. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were taken by direct cardiac puncture for the measurement of plasma levels of troponin T (cTnT) and serum levels for both malondialdehyde MDA and glutathione GSH. After blood sampling, the heart was removed and divided into two parts; the apex was used for histopathological examination, and the remaining part was used for the measurement of cardiac tissue levels of tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), cysteine aspartic acid-protease 3 (caspase-3), and BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), after removal of the remaining blood clots and aorta.\nIn the active control group, as compared with the sham group, the results revealed that the myocardial tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, caspase-3, and BAX, and the plasma level of cTnT and serum level of malondialdehyde MDA were significantly increased (p < 0.001), while the serum level of glutathione GSH was significantly decreased (p < 0.001). Regarding the histopathological part of the study, all rats in the active control group showed a significant cardiac tissue injury (p < 0.001) compared with the sham group.

{"title": "Possible mechanism by which renal sympathetic denervation improves left ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "What is the central question of this study? The enzyme system that is responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover is the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which can be blocked by the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). Whether renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) is able to ameliorate post-myocardial infarction left ventricular remodelling through attenuation of ECM via regulation of MMP activity and/or the MMP-TIMP complex remains unknown. What is the main finding and its importance? Renal sympathetic denervation has therapeutic effects on post-myocardial infarction left ventricular remodelling, probably by attenuating the ECM through regulation of the MMP9-TIMP1 complex in the transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (a profibrotic cytokine that accelerates ECM remodelling after ischaemia) signalling pathway. Whether renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) is able to ameliorate post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) left ventricular (LV) remodelling by attenuation of the extracellular matrix via regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and/or the MMP-tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) complex remains unknown. Sixty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following four groups: normal (N, n = 15), RSD (RSD, n = 15), myocardial infarction (MI, n = 15) and RSD 3 days after MI (MI3d+RSD, n = 20). The bilateral renal nerves were surgically denervated 3 days after MI had been induced by coronary artery ligation. Left ventricular function was assessed using echocardiography and a Millar catheter at 6 weeks post-MI. Plasma noradrenaline, angiotensin II and aldosterone, collagen volume fraction, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), MMP2, MMP9 and TIMP1 in heart tissue were measured 6 weeks after MI. In rats with MI3d+RSD compared with MI rats, RSD improved systolic and diastolic function, resulting in an improvement in ejection fraction (P < 0.05), fractional shortening (P < 0.05) and LV internal dimension in systole (P < 0.05) and diastole (P < 0.05). Additionally, RSD treatment decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (P < 0.05) and increased LV systolic pressure (P < 0.05) and maximal and minimal rate of LV pressure (both P < 0.05). Meanwhile, RSD reduced collagen content (P < 0.01). TIMP1 was upregulated (P < 0.05), whereas MMP2, MMP9 and TGF-\u03b21 were downregulated in the LV of RSD-treated animals (P < 0.05). Renal sympathetic denervation has therapeutic effects on post-MI LV remodelling, probably owing to effects on the extracellular matrix by regulation of the MMP9-TIMP1 balance in the TGF-\u03b21 signalling pathway.

Severe inflammation, including in sepsis, is sometimes treated with exogenous glucocorticoids (GCs). Here, to explore the potential effect of GCs to protect against myocardial injury, we created a model of sepsis in rats by performing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in 96 rats randomly divided into sham-operated control (N=32), untreated sepsis (CLP, N=32), and GC-treated sepsis (N=32) groups. At 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after surgery, the changes in cardiac hemodynamic indexes, serum inflammatory response factor levels, and myocardial enzymes were measured, along with mitochondrial membrane potential in myocardial cells, apoptosis of myocardial cells, and the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB p65) in myocardial tissues. Pathological changes in myocardial cells were also observed. Compared to the sham-operated group, CLP rats experienced deterioration of left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), maximum rate of left ventricular pressure rise (+dP/dtmax), and the maximum rate of left ventricular pressure drop (-dP/dtmax). CLP rats also had a rise in serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and NF-\u03baB p65 in myocardial tissues. The GCs-treated group had lower levels of these inflammatory response molecules than the CLP group, with the exception of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), which was higher in the GC-treated rats than the CLP group at each time point post-surgery. Compared to the sham group, CLP rats had a rise in myocardial cell apoptosis and a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential in myocardial cells. In addition, GCs-treated rats had a marked drop in the myocardial cell apoptosis rate and a rise in the mitochondrial membrane potential compared to CLP rats. After intervention with GCs, the pathological changes in heart tissues were also reduced compared to those in the sepsis group. Based on these results, we conclude that exogenous GCs can inhibit a drop in myocardial mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibit myocardial cell apoptosis by blocking the activation of NF-\u03baB, decreasing the generation of proinflammatory cytokines, and relieving inflammatory injury in heart tissues.", "journal": "International journal of clinical and experimental medicine", "date": "2015-11-10", "authors": ["Zhong-QianLu", "Jian-XiaLu", "Yi-JunDeng"], "doi": null}

Recently, a few reports have shown that pentoxifylline (PTX) might produce cardioprotection in cardiac dysfunction. Here, we investigated the protective effects of PTX on ADR-induced cardiomyopathy in rats. Male rats were randomly assigned either to saline, ADR (adriamycin, 5 mg/kg/week), or A (adriamycin, 5 mg/kg/week) + PTX (pentoxifylline, 50 mg/kg/day) groups. After 3 weeks, these animals were sacrificed and the heart tissue was harvested for histological analysis and assessment of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and caspase-3 expression. Histopathological findings showed that PTX can alleviate myocardial damage caused by ADR. Cardiac fibrosis was significantly suppressed in the A+PTX group compared to that in the ADR group. The HGF gene expression was decreased significantly in the ADR group compared with the control group, but was increased in the A+PTX group. Caspase-3 was up-regulated in the ADR group, and down-regulated in the A+PTX group. These results show that treatment with PTX exerts a protective effect against ADR-induced myocardial fibrosis via regulation of HGF and caspase-3 gene expression.

Ultrasound thermography has been proposed as a non-invasive technique for temperature measurement, and accurate calibration of the temperature-dependent ultrasound signal changes against temperature is required. Here we report a method that uses infrared thermography for calibration and validation of ultrasound thermography. Using phantoms and cardiac tissue specimens subjected to high-intensity focused ultrasound heating, we simultaneously acquired ultrasound and infrared imaging data from the same surface plane of a sample. The commonly used echo time shift-based method was chosen to compute ultrasound thermometry. We first correlated the ultrasound echo time shifts with infrared-measured temperatures for material-dependent calibration and found that the calibration coefficient was positive for fat-mimicking phantom (1.49 \u00b1 0.27) but negative for tissue-mimicking phantom (-0.59 \u00b1 0.08) and cardiac tissue (-0.69 \u00b1 0.18\u00b0C-mm/ns). We then obtained the estimation error of the ultrasound thermometry by comparing against the infrared-measured temperature and revealed that the error increased with decreased size of the heated region. Consistent with previous findings, the echo time shifts were no longer linearly dependent on temperature beyond 45\u00b0C-50\u00b0C in cardiac tissues. Unlike previous studies in which thermocouples or water bath techniques were used to evaluate the performance of ultrasound thermography, our results indicate that high-resolution infrared thermography is a useful tool that can be applied to evaluate and understand the limitations of ultrasound thermography methods.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2015-11-09", "authors": ["Yi-SingHsiao", "Cheri XDeng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2015.09.021"}

Thus, it is essential to utilize physiological stimuli to improve the quality of engineered constructs. Numerous publications reported that mechanical stimulation of small-sized, non-perfusable, tissue engineered cardiac constructs leads to a maturation of immature cardiomyocytes like neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or induced pluripotent stem cells/embryonic stem cells derived self-contracting cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of mechanical stimulation and perfusion on the maturation process of large-scale (2.5\u00d74.5cm), implantable cardiac patches based on decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) or Biological Vascularized Matrix (BioVaM) and a 3-dimensional construct containing neonatal rat heart cells. Application of cyclic mechanical stretch improved contractile function, cardiomyocyte alignment along the stretch axis and gene expression of cardiomyocyte markers. The development of a complex network formed by endothelial cells within the cardiac construct was enhanced by cyclic stretch. Finally, the utilization of BioVaM enabled the perfusion of the matrix during stimulation, augmenting the beneficial influence of cyclic stretch. Thus, this study demonstrates the maturation of cardiac constructs with clinically relevant dimensions by the application of cyclic mechanical stretch and perfusion of the starter matrix.\nConsidering the poor endogenous regeneration of the heart, engineering of bioartificial cardiac tissue for the replacement of infarcted myocardium is an exciting strategy. Most techniques for the generation of cardiac tissue result in relative small-sized constructs insufficient for clinical applications. Another issue is to achieve cardiomyocytes and tissue maturation in culture. Here we report, for the first time, the effect of mechanical stimulation and simultaneous perfusion on the maturation of cardiac constructs of clinical relevant dimensions, which are based on a perfusable starter matrix derived from porcine small intestine. In response to these stimuli superior organization of cardiomyocytes and vascular networks was observed in contrast to untreated controls.

In the last few years, biomaterial based delivery systems, such as polymeric microparticles (MPs) made of poly(lactic co glycolic acid) and polyethylene glycol (PLGA and PEG-PLGA MPs), have improved the efficacy of protein therapy in preclinical studies. However, no cardiac treatment based on MPs has yet been commercialized since this is a relatively new field and total characterization of polymeric MPs remains mandatory before they reach the clinical arena. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize the in vivo release, bioactivity and biodegradation of PLGA and PEG-PLGA MPs loaded with biotinylated NRG in a rat model of MI. The effect of PEGylation in the clearance of the particles from the cardiac tissue was also evaluated. Interestingly, MPs were detected in the cardiac tissue for up to 12 weeks after administration. In vivo release analysis showed that bNRG was released in a controlled manner throughout the twelve week study. Moreover, the biological cardiomyocyte receptor (ErbB4) for NRG was detected in its activated form only in those animals treated with bNRG loaded MPs. On the other hand, the PEGylation strategy was effective in diminishing phagocytosis of these MPs compared to noncoated MPs in the long term (12 weeks after injection). Taking all this together, we report new evidence in favor of the use of polymeric PLGA and PEG-PLGA MPs as delivery systems for treating MI, which could be soon included in clinical trials.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2015-11-08", "authors": ["SPascual-Gil", "TSim\u00f3n-Yarza", "EGarbayo", "FProsper", "M JBlanco-Prieto"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.10.058"}

Fourteen rabbits were divided into three administration groups and the control group. Doses of 4mg/kg and 10mg/kg of nandrolone decanoate, given intramuscularly and subcutaneously, two days per week for six months were applied. A 4-months wash-out period followed.

Thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS) levels were significantly increased in the high dose groups, while catalase activity decreased. Myocardial Performance Index (MPI) is the main echocardiographic index primarily affected by nandrolone administration in rabbits. Despite the preserved systolic performance, histological lesions observed associated with distorted MPI values, point to diastolic impairment of the thickened myocardium due to nandrolone treatment.

We study the various possible shapes of LV and different degree of anisotropy of cardiac tissue. We show that, for positive filament tension, the final position of scroll wave filament is mainly determined by the thickness of the myocardial wall but, however, anisotropy attracts the filament to the LV apex.

However, no T2-mapping sequence has ever been validated against actual myocardial water content for edema detection. In addition, these T2-mapping sequences are either time-consuming or require specialized software for data acquisition and/or post-processing, factors impeding their routine clinical use. Our objective was to obtain in vivo validation of a sequence for fast and accurate myocardial T2-mapping (T2 gradient-spin-echo [GraSE]) that can be easily integrated in routine protocols.\nThe study population comprised 25 pigs. Closed-chest 40\u00a0min ischemia/reperfusion was performed in 20 pigs. Pigs were sacrificed at 120\u00a0min (n\u2009=\u20095), 24\u00a0h (n\u2009=\u20095), 4\u00a0days (n\u2009=\u20095) and 7\u00a0days (n\u2009=\u20095) after reperfusion, and heart tissue extracted for quantification of myocardial water content. For the evaluation of T2 relaxation time, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scans, including T2 turbo-spin-echo (T2-TSE, reference standard) mapping and T2-GraSE mapping, were performed at baseline and at every follow-up until sacrifice. Five additional pigs were sacrificed after baseline CMR study and served as controls.\nAcquisition of T2-GraSE mapping was significantly (3-fold) faster than conventional T2-TSE mapping. Myocardial T2 relaxation measurements performed by T2-TSE and T2-GraSE mapping demonstrated an almost perfect correlation (R(2)\u2009=\u20090.99) and agreement with no systematic error between techniques.

Further, we deduced a generic theoretical framework that can predict the minimal unpinning period.

Using a discrete-time kinematic model and complex frequency (Z) domain analysis, we derive analytical expressions to predict phase reversals and spatial discordance in the interbeat interval (IBI) and APD, which, importantly, cannot be predicted with a model that neglects the influence of cell coupling on repolarization. We identify key dimensionless parameters that determine the transition from spatial concordance to discordance. Finally, we show that the theoretical predictions agree closely with numerical simulations of an ionic myocyte model, over a wide range of parameters, including variable IBI, altered ionic current gating, and reduced cell coupling. We demonstrate a novel approach to predict instability in cardiac tissue during alternate pacing and further illustrate how this approach can be generalized to more detail models of myocyte dynamics.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2015-11-02", "authors": ["Seth HWeinberg"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4932961"}
{"title": "Heterozygous deletion of sarcolipin maintains normal cardiac function.", "abstract": "Sarcolipin (SLN) is a small proteolipid and a regulator of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. In heart tissue, SLN is exclusively expressed in the atrium. Previously, we inserted Cre recombinase into the endogenous SLN locus by homologous recombination and succeeded in generating SLN-Cre knockin (Sln(Cre/+)) mice. This Sln(Cre/+) mouse can be used to generate an atrium-specific gene-targeting mutant, and it is based on the Cre-loxP system. In the present study, we used adult Sln(Cre/+) mice atria and analyzed the effects of heterozygous SLN deletion by Cre knockin before use as the gene targeting mouse. Both SLN mRNA and protein levels were decreased in Sln(Cre/+) mouse atria, but there were no morphological, physiological, or molecular biological abnormalities. The properties of contractility and Ca(2+) handling were similar to wild-type (WT) mice, and expression levels of several stress markers and sarcoplasmic reticulum-related protein levels were not different between Sln(Cre/+) and WT mice. Moreover, there was no significant difference in sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity between the two groups. We showed that Sln(Cre/+) mice were not significantly different from WT mice in all aspects that were examined. The present study provides basic characteristics of Sln(Cre/+) mice and possibly information on the usefulness of Sln(Cre/+) mice as an atrium-specific gene-targeting model.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

This study investigates the effect of puerarin on severe burn-induced acute myocardial injury in rats and its underlying mechanisms.\nHealthy adult Wistar rats were divided into three groups: (1) sham group, sham burn treatment; (2) burn group, third-degree burns over 30% of the total body surface area (TBSA) with lactated Ringer's solution for resuscitation; and (3) burn plus puerarin group, third-degree burns over 30% of TBSA with lactated Ringer's solution containing puerarin for resuscitation. The burned animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after burn injury. Myocardial injury was evaluated by analyzing serum creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB) activity and cardiac troponin T (cTNT) level. Changes in cardiomyocyte ultrastructure were also determined using a transmission electron microscope. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 concentration in serum was measured by radioimmunoassay. Cardiac myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration were measured to determine neutrophil infiltration and oxidative stress in the heart, respectively. The expression of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in the heart was determined by Western blot analysis.\nAfter the 30% TBSA full-thickness burn injury, serum CK-MB activities and cTnT levels increased markedly, both of which were significantly decreased by the puerarin treatment. The level of serum TNF-\u03b1 concentration in burn group at each time-point was obviously higher than those in sham group (1.09\u00b10.09 ng/ml), and it reached the peak value at 12 h post burn. Burn trauma also resulted in worsen ultrastructural condition, elevated MPO activity and MDA content in heart tissue, and a significant activation of cardiac p38 MAP kinase. Administration of puerarin improved the ultrastructural changes in cardiomyocytes, decreased TNF-\u03b1 concentration in serum as well as suppressed cardiac MPO activity and reduced MDA content, and abolished the activation of p38 MAP kinase in heart tissue after severe burn.\nThese results suggest that puerarin attenuates inflammatory responses, reduces neutrophil infiltration and oxidative stress in the heart, and protects against acute myocardial injury induced by severe burn.", "journal": "Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries", "date": "2015-10-31", "authors": ["ShengLiu", "Hong-BoRen", "Xu-LinChen", "FeiWang", "Ren-SuWang", "BoZhou", "ChaoWang", "Ye-XiangSun", "Yong-JieWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.burns.2015.06.001"}

However, the roles of miRNAs in human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (hCMPCs) remain to be elucidated. Our previous study showed that miR-134 was significantly downregulated in heart tissue suffering from congenital heart disease, underlying the potential role of miR-134 in cardiogenesis. In the present work, we showed that the upregulation of miR-134 reduced the proliferation of hCMPCs, as determined by EdU assay and Ki-67 immunostaining, while the inhibition of miR-134 exhibited an opposite effect. Both up- and downregulation of miR-134 expression altered the transcriptional level of cell-cycle genes. We identified Meis2 as the target of miR-134 in the regulation of hCMPC proliferation through bioinformatic prediction, luciferase reporter assay and western blot. The over-expression of Meis2 mitigated the effect of miR-134 on hCMPC proliferation. Moreover, miR-134 did not change the degree of hCMPC differentiation into cardiomyocytes in our model, suggesting that miR-134 is not required in this process.

{"title": "Celecoxib prevents pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction by inhibiting inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress.", "abstract": "To explore the effects of celecoxib on pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy (CH), cardiac dysfunction and explore the possible protective mechanisms. We surgically created abdominal aortic constrictions (AAC) in rats to induce CH. Rats with CH symptoms at 4 weeks after surgery were treated with celecoxib [2 mg/100 g body-weight(BW)] daily for either 2 or 4 weeks. Survival rate, blood pressure and cardiac function were evaluated after celecoxib treatment. Animals were killed, and cardiac tissue was examined for morphological changes, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, fibrosis, inflammation and oxidative stress. Four weeks after AAC, rats had significantly higher systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, greater heart weight and enlarged cardiomyocytes, which were associated with cardiac dysfunction. Thus, the CH model was successfully established. Two weeks later, animals had impaired cardiac function and histopathological abnormalities including enlarged cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibrosis, which were exacerbated 2 weeks later. However, these pathological changes were remarkably prevented by the treatment of celecoxib, independent of preventing hypertension. Mechanistic studies revealed that celecoxib-induced cardiac protection against CH and cardiac dysfunction was due to inhibition of apoptosis via the murine double mimute 2/P53 pathway, inhibition of inflammation via the AKT/mTOR/NF-\u03baB pathway and inhibition of oxidative stress via increases in nuclear factor E2-related factor-2-mediated gene expression of multiple antioxidants.

We report the development of a scalable, robust, and integrated differentiation platform for large-scale production of hPSC-CM aggregates in a stirred suspension bioreactor as a single-unit operation. Precise modulation of the differentiation process by small molecule activation of WNT signaling, followed by inactivation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and WNT signaling and activation of sonic hedgehog signaling in hPSCs as size-controlled aggregates led to the generation of approximately 100% beating CM spheroids containing virtually pure (\u223c90%) CMs in 10 days. Moreover, the developed differentiation strategy was universal, as demonstrated by testing multiple hPSC lines (5 human embryonic stem cell and 4 human inducible PSC lines) without cell sorting or selection. The produced hPSC-CMs successfully expressed canonical lineage-specific markers and showed high functionality, as demonstrated by microelectrode array and electrophysiology tests. This robust and universal platform could become a valuable tool for the mass production of functional hPSC-CMs as a prerequisite for realizing their promising potential for therapeutic and industrial applications, including drug discovery and toxicity assays.\nRecent advances in the generation of cardiomyocytes (CMs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and the development of novel cell therapy strategies using hPSC-CMs (e.g., cardiac patches) in conjunction with promising preclinical and clinical studies, have raised new hopes for patients with end-stage cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally.

Engineered silica nanoparticles (SiO2-NPs) have been extensively used as contrast agents in regenerative medicine, due to their resistance to degradation and ease of functionalization. However, there are still controversies on their effective biosafety on cellular systems. In this perspective, the aims of the present study are: 1) to deeply investigate the impact of amorphous 50 nm SiO2-NPs on viability and function of human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hMSCs); 2) to optimize a protocol of harmless hMSCs labelling and test its feasibility in a beating heart model.\nOptimal cell labelling is obtained after 16 h exposure of hMSCs to fluorescent 50 nm SiO2-NPs (50 \u00b5g mL(-1)); interestingly, lysosomal activation consequent to NPs storage is not associated to oxidative stress. During prolonged culture hMSCs do not undergo cyto- or genotoxicity, preserve their proliferative potential and their stemness/differentiation properties. Finally, the bright fluorescence emitted by internalized SiO2-NPs allows both clear visualization of hMSCs in normal and infarcted rat hearts and ultrastructural analysis of cell engraftment inside myocardial tissue.\nOverall, 50 nm SiO2-NPs display elevated compatibility with hMSCs in terms of lack of cyto- and genotoxicity and maintenance of important features of these cells.

The underlying pathogenic mechanisms highlight a complex interplay of immunological, genetic, and environmental factors. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether IL-4 (intron 3) and IL-10 (-1082) gene polymorphisms could be associated with susceptibility and/or severity of rheumatic heart disease among patients from the Egyptian population. Materials and methods A cohort of 140 Egyptian children with rheumatic heart disease and 100 healthy controls were enrolled in this case-control study. Genotyping for IL-4 (intron 3) and IL-10 (-1082) gene polymorphisms was carried out for all patients using a polymerase chain reaction-based analysis.\nNo significant difference in the distribution of genotypes and allelic frequencies between rheumatic heart disease cases and controls for IL-4 (intron 3) (p=0.17; OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.82-3.74) and IL-10 (-1082) (p=0.49; OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.65-2.71) gene polymorphisms was observed. Further categorisation of patients into mitral valve disease and combined valve disease subgroups showed that cases with mitral valve disease have significantly higher frequency of the RP2 allele of IL-4 (intron 3) (p=0.03; OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.93-6.15) and the G allele of IL-10 (-1082) (p=0.04; OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.62-4.95) when compared with controls.

{"title": "Pivotal role of miR-448 in the development of ROS-induced cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidases (NOXs) are important contributors to cellular oxidative stress in the cardiovascular system. The NOX2 isoform is upregulated in numerous disorders, including dystrophic cardiomyopathy, where it drives the progression of the disease. However, mechanisms underlying NOX2 overexpression are still unknown. We investigated the role of microRNAs (miRs) in the regulation of NOX2 expression.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) was used as a model of cardiomyopathy. After screening with miRNA target prediction databases and following qRT-PCR analysis, we found drastic downregulation of miR-448-3p in hearts of mdx mice, an animal model of DMD. The downregulation correlated with overexpression of the Ncf1 gene, encoding the NOX2 regulatory subunit p47(phox). Specificity of Ncf1 targeting by miR-448-3p was validated by luciferase reporter assay. Silencing of miR-448-3p in wild-type mice had a dramatic effect on cellular and functional properties of cardiac muscle as assessed by western blotting, qRT-PCR, confocal imaging, echocardiography, and histology. Acute treatment of mice with LNA-miR-448 inhibitors led to increased Ncf1 expression, abnormally elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and exacerbated Ca(2+) signalling in cardiomyocytes, reminiscent of features previously observed in dystrophic cardiac cells. In addition, chronic inhibition of miR-448-3p resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, hallmarks of dystrophic cardiomyopathy.\nOur studies suggest that downregulation of miR-448-3p leads to the increase in the expression of Ncf1 gene and p47(phox) protein, as well as to the substantial increase in NOX2-derived ROS production.

{"title": "Altered conductance and permeability of Cx40 mutations associated with atrial fibrillation.", "abstract": "Gap junctions ensure the rapid propagation of the action potential throughout the myocardium. Three mutant forms of connexin40 (Cx40; A96S, M163V, and G38D), the primary component of the atrial gap junction channel, are associated with atrial fibrillation and retain the ability to form functional channels. We determined the biophysical properties of these mutant gap junctions in transiently transfected HeLa and N2A cells. All three mutants showed macroscopic junctional conductances over the range of 0.5 to 40 nS, and voltage dependences comparable to those of wild-type (WT) Cx40. However, the unitary conductance of G38D channels was \u223c1.6-fold higher than that of WT Cx40 channels (\u223c220 vs. \u223c135 pS), whereas the unitary conductances of the A96S and M163V mutants were similar to that of WT Cx40. Furthermore, the M163V and G38D channels exhibited approximately two- and approximately fivefold higher permeability to the anionic dye Lucifer yellow (LY) relative to K+ (LY/K+) compared with that of WT Cx40, whereas A96S LY transfer was similar to that of WT (G38D > M163V > A96S \u2248 Cx40WT). In contrast, G38D channels were almost impermeable to cationic ethidium bromide (EtBr), suggesting that G38D alters channel selectivity. Conversely, A96S and M163V channels showed enhanced EtBr permeability relative to WT Cx40, with the following permeability order: M163V > A96S > Cx40WT > G38D. Altered conductive and permeability properties of mutant channels suggest an essential role for Cx40-mediated biochemical and electrical coupling in cardiac tissues.

We then repopulated this native human cardiac matrix with cardiomyocytes derived from nontransgenic human induced pluripotent stem cells and generated tissues of increasing 3-dimensional complexity. We maintained such cardiac tissue constructs in culture for 120 days to demonstrate definitive sarcomeric structure, cell and matrix deformation, contractile force, and electrical conduction. To show that functional myocardial tissue of human scale can be built on this platform, we then partially recellularized human whole-heart scaffolds with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Under biomimetic culture, the seeded constructs developed force-generating human myocardial tissue and showed electrical conductivity, left ventricular pressure development, and metabolic function.\nNative cardiac extracellular matrix scaffolds maintain matrix components and structure to support the seeding and engraftment of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and enable the bioengineering of functional human myocardial-like tissue of multiple complexities.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2015-10-28", "authors": ["Jacques PGuyette", "Jonathan MCharest", "Robert WMills", "Bernhard JJank", "Philipp TMoser", "Sarah EGilpin", "Joshua RGershlak", "TatsuyaOkamoto", "GabrielGonzalez", "David JMilan", "Glenn RGaudette", "Harald COtt"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306874"}
{"title": "Formation of vascular network structures within cardiac cell sheets from mouse embryonic stem cells.", "abstract": "Bioengineered cardiac tissues represent a promising strategy for regenerative medicine. However, methods of vascularization and suitable cell sources for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have not yet been established. In this study, we developed methods for the induction of vascular endothelial cells from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells using three-dimensional (3D) suspension culture, and fabricated cardiac cell sheets with a pre-vascularized structure by co-culture of mouse ES cell-derived endothelial cells. After induction, isolated CD31+ cells expressed several endothelial cell marker genes and exhibited the ability to form vascular network structures similar to CD31+ cells from neonatal mouse heart. Co-culture of ES cell-derived CD31+ cells with ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes and dermal fibroblasts resulted in the formation of cardiac cell sheets with microvascular network formation. In contrast, microvascular network formation was reduced in co-cultures without cardiomyocytes, suggesting that cardiomyocytes within the cell sheet might enhance vascular endothelial cell sprouting. Polymerase chain reaction array analysis revealed that the expression levels of several angiogenesis-related genes, including fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), were up-regulated in co-culture with cardiomyocytes compared with cultures without cardiomyocytes. The microvascular network in the cardiac sheets was attenuated by treatment with anti-FGF1 antibody. These results indicate that 3D suspension culture methods may be used to prepare functional vascular endothelial cells from mouse ES cells, and that cardiomyocyte-mediated paracrine effects might be important for fabricating pre-vascularized cardiac cell sheets.", "journal": "Regenerative therapy", "date": "2015-10-27", "authors": ["ShinakoMasuda", "KatsuhisaMatsuura", "MieAnazawa", "TakahiroIwamiya", "TatsuyaShimizu", "TeruoOkano"], "doi": "10.1016/j.reth.2015.10.002"}

Recent studies have demonstrated that heart dysfunction can develop in the setting of choline deprivation even in the absence of underlying heart disease. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are responsible for extracellular matrix degradation, and the dysregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 has been involved in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular disorders. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of MMPs and their inhibitors (TIMPs), in the pathogenesis of choline deficiency-induced cardiomyopathy, and the way they are affected by carnitine supplementation. Male Wistar Albino adult rats were divided into four groups and received standard or choline-deficient diet with or without L-carnitine in drinking water (0.15% w/v) for 1 month. Heart tissue immunohistochemistry for MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 was performed. Choline deficiency was associated with suppressed immunohistochemical expression of MMP-2 and an increased expression of TIMP-2 compared to control, while it had no impact on TIMP-1. MMP-9 expression was decreased without, however, reaching statistical significance. Carnitine did not affect MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 expression. The pattern of TIMP and MMP modulation observed in a choline deficiency setting appears to promote fibrosis.

However, the improvement of cardiac function following MSC transplantation remains suboptimal in both preclinical and clinical studies. Understanding the mechanism of cell therapy may improve its therapeutic outcomes, but the mode of action mediating stem cell promotion of cardiac repair is complex and not fully understood. Recent studies suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs on the macrophage M1/M2 subtype transition allow the transplanted stem cells to inhibit inflammation-induced injury and promote cardiac repair in acute MI. However, equally compelling evidence shows that there is poor survival and minimal graft persistence of transplanted MSCs within the infarcted heart tissues, negating the view that graft survival per se is required for the observed high rate and long duration of the transition from proinflammatory M1 to reparative M2 macrophages in the infarcted myocardium. Therefore, we raised a novel hypothesis that the therapeutic effects of MSC transplantation for acute MI depends not primarily on the grafted cells in infarct myocardium, but that MSCs migrating to and being lodged in the extracardiac organs, demonstrating good graft survival and persistence, may render the therapeutic effects in MI. More specifically, MSC transplantation promotes the transition from M1 to M2 in extracardiac organs, such as spleen and bone marrow, and therapeutic effects are conferred to the infarcted myocardium via paracrine effects. In MSC transplantation, the conversion from proinflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 monocytes may occur remotely from the heart and may serve as one of the major pathways in regulating the dual effects of inflammation. This hypothesis, if proven valid, may represent an important new mechanism of action to be considered for the future of MSC transplantation in the treatment of MI.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2015-10-27", "authors": ["YiPeng", "WeiPan", "YaliOu", "WeifangXu", "SussannahKaelber", "Cesario VBorlongan", "MeiqinSun", "GuolongYu"], "doi": "10.3727/096368915X689758"}

We also review how oxygen-sensing proteins and hydroxylase function could prove to be invaluable in drug design and therapeutic targets for heart disease.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2015-10-23", "authors": ["W H DavinTownley-Tilson", "XinchunPi", "LiangXie"], "doi": "10.1155/2015/676893\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31828124ad\n10.1161/01.RES.83.1.1\n10.1007/978-1-4684-5107-8_17\n10.1172/jci200524408\n10.1007/s00395-013-0359-8\n10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.032207.120833\n10.1161/01.res.30.2.205\n10.1128/MCB.21.10.3436-3444.2001\n10.1016/j.ajog.2011.01.012\n10.1074/jbc.m002740200\n10.1073/pnas.190332597\n10.1038/35017054\n10.1101/gad.924501\n10.1074/jbc.C200273200\n10.1101/gad.991402\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2004.04.010\n10.1038/nrc1187\n10.1074/jbc.c200694200\n10.1182/blood-2004-07-2958\n10.1128/mcb.00444-09\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.03.054\n10.1126/scisignal.2000444\n10.1073/pnas.0602235103\n10.1074/jbc.m608748200\n10.1073/pnas.90.1.347\n10.1074/jbc.270.51.30334\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00275-2\n10.1161/01.cir.0000055318.09997.1f\n10.1006/phrs.1998.0365\n10.5483/BMBRep.2003.36.1.095\n10.1038/35044120\n10.1128/MCB.24.21.9414-9423.2004\n10.1172/jci118909\n10.1161/circresaha.109.208801\n10.1002/iub.241\n10.1016/s0140-6736(00)90008-4\n10.2174/138920008783571792\n10.1016/s0002-9343(00)00481-2\n10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00229-X\n10.1373/clinchem.2009.126029\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000163262.83456.6d\n10.1074/jbc.m209124200\n10.1001/jama.286.17.2136\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.040\n10.1159/000041062\n10.1056/nejm200401293500519\n10.1007/s00253-002-1123-4\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.568451\n10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01422-3\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000025261.58465.62\n10.1161/hc3401.093152\n10.1097/00004872-200309000-00015\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000014927.74465.7F\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01749-1\n10.1042/BJ20061151\n10.1038/nchembio0207-86\n10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2006.01.024\n10.1021/cr020628n\n10.1016/0005-2744(80)90041-8\n10.14814/phy2.12220\n10.1007/s00018-009-0147-7\n10.1038/nrm1366\n10.1242/jcs.00318\n10.1038/nature04433\n10.1038/nature01048\n10.1074/jbc.m109.092593\n10.1128/mcb.01350-09\n10.1074/jbc.m604507200\n10.1039/b809099h\n10.1016/s0092-8674(01)00507-4\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.165\n10.1074/jbc.m304982200\n10.1093/emboj/cdg392\n10.1128/mcb.25.15.6415-6426.2005\n10.1161/01.cir.74.5.1124\n10.1093/cvr/cvm035\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.3.1264\n10.1038/aps.2010.132\n10.1161/circulationaha.108.819250\n10.1093/cvr/cvs014\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01500.x\n10.1074/jbc.m301391200\n10.1152/ajpcell.00100.2006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0089099\n10.1161/01.res.0000102042.83024.ca\n10.1073/pnas.0606877103\n10.1074/jbc.m704102200\n10.1128/MCB.00511-07\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.014019\n10.1371/journal.pone.0109517\n10.1002/cbf.1755\n10.1182/blood-2009-07-232132\n10.1007/978-1-4419-6676-6_6\n10.1016/s1074-5521(02)00092-3\n10.1038/nrd1199\n10.1002/jcp.22798\n10.1038/ki.2010.99\n10.1161/circresaha.108.193102\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2006.12.010\n10.1371/journal.pone.0089451\n10.1038/nbt.1654\n10.1016/j.celrep.2012.07.006\n10.1074/mcp.m300088-mcp200\n10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02419.x\n10.3109/10409231003627991\n10.1038/nsmb.2792\n10.1074/jbc.m110.211110\n10.1152/ajpheart.00422.2004\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.10.015\n10.1152/ajpheart.00089.2005\n10.1161/circulationaha.107.758516\n10.1016/j.surg.2011.06.006\n10.1159/000336818\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2011.09.001\n10.1253/circj.cj-09-0594\n10.1681/ASN.2010010116"}
{"title": "Therapeutic effects of pentoxifylline on diabetic heart tissue via NOS.", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus causes a decrease in cardiac output, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate. In this study, we aimed to investigate, at the molecular level, the effect of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) on heart pathology in type 1 diabetes and look at the therapeutic effect of pentoxifylline on this pathology.\nIn this experimental study, 50 Wistar albino male rats were used. The rats were divided into 5 groups: group C, control; group D, only diabetes; group D+PI and D+PII, diabetes + pentoxifylline; group P, only pentoxifylline. Group D+PI rats received 50 mg/kg/day pentoxifylline over two months. However, group D+PII rats received saline in the first month and 50 mg/kg/day of pentoxifylline over the following month. At the end of two months, NOS expressions in heart tissue were assessed through immunohistochemistry analysis. The data were compared by one-way ANOVA.\nAt the end of the experiments, there was increased cytoplasmic vacuolization, myofibrillar loss, cytoplasmic eosinophilia, and degeneration of cardiomyocytes; nNOS and iNOS expressions in group D decreased compared with that in group C. In group D+PI and group D+PII, nNOS and iNOS expressions improved compared with group D.\nAs a result, we found that diabetes, a known chronic disease, causes serious damage in heart tissue. NOS plays a role in this damage, and pentoxifylline aided in improving nNOS and iNOS expression in this damage.", "journal": "Anatolian journal of cardiology", "date": "2015-10-22", "authors": ["DeryaKarabulut", "Hasan BasriUlusoy", "EminKaymak", "Mehmet FatihS\u00f6nmez"], "doi": "10.5152/akd.2015.6252"}

We in this experiment investigated the effect of different electrical stimulation time on the expression of myocardial specificity gene and protein in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) in vitro. The rBMSCs of second or third generation were randomly divided into three groups, i.e, electrical stimulation (ES) group, 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) group and the control group. The rBMSCs in the ES groups with complete medium were exposed to 2 V, 2 Hz, 5 ms electrical stimulation for 0. 5 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h respectively every day for 10 days. Those in the 5-Aza group were induced by 5-Aza (10 \u03bcmol/L) for 24 h, and then cultured with complete medium for 10 days. Those in the control group were only cultured with complete medium, without any treatment, for 10 days. The rBMSCs' morphological feature in each group was observed with inverted phase microscope. The mRNA expression of myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF-2C) and connexin 43 (Cx43) were examined with Real-Time quantitative PCR and the protein expression of MEF-2C, Cx43 were detected with Western Blot method. The results showed that the mRNA expression level of the MEF-2C, Cx43 and the protein expression level of MEF-2C, Cx43 were significantly higher in the ES group and 5-Aza group than those in the relative control group (P < 0.05). It suggests that electrical stimulation could play a part of role in the induction of the rBMSCs to differentiate into the cariomyocyte-like cells in vitro and the effectiveness of the electrical stimulation with 2 h/d had the best in our experiment. But the mechanism how electrical stimulation promotes the differentiation of rBMSC into cardiomyocyte is still unclear.", "journal": "Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi", "date": "2015-10-22", "authors": ["MinTang", "GangYang", "JianJiang", "XuelingHe", "HuimingLi", "MengyingZhang", "WenchaoWu", "XiaojingLiu", "LiangLi"], "doi": null}
{"title": "[Preliminary Study of Necroptosis in Cardiac Hypertrophy Induced by Pressure Overload].", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to observe whether necroptosis is involved in the process of cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload. SD rats underwent transverse abdominal aortic constriction (TAC) operation for establishing cardiac hypertrophy model. The structure and function of the left ventricle of rats were evaluated via echocardiography, left ventricular mass index, the expression of markers of cardiac hypertrophy and histological detection. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to measure the gene and protein expression of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and RIPK3, the necroptosis markers) respectively. Four weeks after TAC operation, rat model for cardiac hypertrophy was established. The experimental data showed that the gene and protein expressions of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in the rat heart hypertrophic tissues after TAC for 4 weeks were increased significantly compared with those in the sham group. HE staining showed cardiomyocytes injury and hypertrophy in the hearts of TAC rat models. By transmission electron microscope, we observed that mitochondria of cardiomyocytes were damaged seriously in the TAC models. Treatment with losartan used, the selective antagonist of angiotensin II type I receptor could improve the cardiac function of TAC rats. Moreover, losartan treatment decreased the expression of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in heart tissues of TAC rats. The results suggest that necroptosis occurrs in the process of cardiac hypertrophy with pressure overload, and losartan could alleviate the cardiac hypertrophy and inhibit necroptosis.", "journal": "Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi", "date": "2015-10-22", "authors": ["MingyueZhao", "YupeiQin", "LihuiLu", "XiaojuTang", "WenchaoWu", "HuaFu", "XiaojingLiu"], "doi": null}
{"title": "MAS C-Terminal Tail Interacting Proteins Identified by Mass Spectrometry- Based Proteomic Approach.", "abstract": "Propagation of signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in cells is primarily mediated by protein-protein interactions. MAS is a GPCR that was initially discovered as an oncogene and is now known to play an important role in cardiovascular physiology. Current literature suggests that MAS interacts with common heterotrimeric G-proteins, but MAS interaction with proteins which might mediate G protein-independent or atypical signaling is unknown. In this study we hypothesized that MAS C-terminal tail (Ct) is a major determinant of receptor-scaffold protein interactions mediating MAS signaling. Mass-spectrometry based proteomic analysis was used to comprehensively identify the proteins that interact with MAS Ct comprising the PDZ-binding motif (PDZ-BM). We identified both PDZ and non-PDZ proteins from human embryonic kidney cell line, mouse atrial cardiomyocyte cell line and human heart tissue to interact specifically with MAS Ct. For the first time our study provides a panel of PDZ and other proteins that potentially interact with MAS with high significance. A 'cardiac-specific finger print' of MAS interacting PDZ proteins was identified which includes DLG1, MAGI1 and SNTA. Cell based experiments with wild-type and mutant MAS lacking the PDZ-BM validated MAS interaction with PDZ proteins DLG1 and TJP2. Bioinformatics analysis suggested well-known multi-protein scaffold complexes involved in nitric oxide signaling (NOS), cell-cell signaling of neuromuscular junctions, synapses and epithelial cells. Majority of these protein hits were predicted to be part of disease categories comprising cancers and malignant tumors. We propose a 'MAS-signalosome' model to stimulate further research in understanding the molecular mechanism of MAS function. Identifying hierarchy of interactions of 'signalosome' components with MAS will be a necessary step in future to fully understand the physiological and pathological functions of this enigmatic receptor.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-10-21", "authors": ["Kalyan CTirupula", "DongmeiZhang", "AppledeneOsbourne", "ArunachalChatterjee", "RussDesnoyer", "BelindaWillard", "Sadashiva SKarnik"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0140872\n10.1038/sj.onc.1204188\n10.1186/1750-2187-5-11\n10.1113/expphysiol.2007.040345\n10.1038/ki.2009.61\n10.2337/db07-0953\n10.1016/j.peptides.2011.11.014\n10.2119/2007-00073.Fraga-Silva\n10.1152/ajpheart.00173.2007\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000215289.51180.5c\n10.1016/j.regpep.2012.01.001\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.102764\n10.1177/1753944712461164\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e3282f0143c\n10.1016/j.jash.2008.05.003\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.025\n10.1016/j.lfs.2006.09.007\n10.1152/ajpheart.00723.2011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0005406\n10.1371/journal.pone.0103520\n10.1016/B978-0-12-385952-5.00003-8\n10.1126/stke.2003.179.re7\n10.1093/molbev/msp311\n10.1042/BJ20110903\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2012.08699.x\n10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.1\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0060239\n10.1074/jbc.M406169200\n10.1016/j.advenzreg.2009.01.002\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2008.04.013\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.209395\n10.1042/BJ20121885\n10.1371/journal.pone.0025376\n10.1002/pmic.200300780\n10.1007/s13361-011-0237-2\n10.1006/abio.2000.4734\n10.1093/nar/gkn760\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2013.08.023\n10.1074/jbc.M610002200\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04440.x\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.10.007\n10.1038/sj.onc.1207817\n10.1074/mcp.O112.021022\n10.1016/j.bcp.2005.10.050\n10.1152/ajpheart.00879.2009\n10.1177/1470320311426023\n10.1002/ijc.24440\n10.1073/pnas.0801294105\n10.1073/pnas.1010819107\n10.1042/BJ20020481\n10.1093/nar/gkr931"}
{"title": "Stimulating endogenous cardiac repair.", "abstract": "The healthy adult heart has a low turnover of cardiac myocytes. The renewal capacity, however, is augmented after cardiac injury. Participants in cardiac regeneration include cardiac myocytes themselves, cardiac progenitor cells, and peripheral stem cells, particularly from the bone marrow compartment. Cardiac progenitor cells and bone marrow stem cells are augmented after cardiac injury, migrate to the myocardium, and support regeneration. Depletion studies of these populations have demonstrated their necessary role in cardiac repair. However, the potential of these cells to completely regenerate the heart is limited. Efforts are now being focused on ways to augment these natural pathways to improve cardiac healing, primarily after ischemic injury but in other cardiac pathologies as well. Cell and gene therapy or pharmacological interventions are proposed mechanisms. Cell therapy has demonstrated modest results and has passed into clinical trials. However, the beneficial effects of cell therapy have primarily been their ability to produce paracrine effects on the cardiac tissue and recruit endogenous stem cell populations as opposed to direct cardiac regeneration. Gene therapy efforts have focused on prolonging or reactivating natural signaling pathways. Positive results have been demonstrated to activate the endogenous stem cell populations and are currently being tested in clinical trials. A potential new avenue may be to refine pharmacological treatments that are currently in place in the clinic. Evidence is mounting that drugs such as statins or beta blockers may alter endogenous stem cell activity. Understanding the effects of these drugs on stem cell repair while keeping in mind their primary function may strike a balance in myocardial healing.

{"title": "Lessons learned from multi-scale modeling of the failing heart.", "abstract": "Heart failure constitutes a major public health problem worldwide. Affected patients experience a number of changes in the electrical function of the heart that predispose to potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Due to the multitude of electrophysiological changes that may occur during heart failure, the scientific literature is complex and sometimes ambiguous, perhaps because these findings are highly dependent on the etiology, the stage of heart failure, and the experimental model used to study these changes. Nevertheless, a number of common features of failing hearts have been documented. Prolongation of the action potential (AP) involving ion channel remodeling and alterations in calcium handling have been established as the hallmark characteristics of myocytes isolated from failing hearts. Intercellular uncoupling and fibrosis are identified as major arrhythmogenic factors. Multi-scale computational simulations are a powerful tool that complements experimental and clinical research. The development of biophysically detailed computer models of single myocytes and cardiac tissues has contributed greatly to our understanding of processes underlying excitation and repolarization in the heart. The electrical, structural, and metabolic remodeling that arises in cardiac tissues during heart failure has been addressed from different computational perspectives to further understand the arrhythmogenic substrate. This review summarizes the contributions from computational modeling and simulation to predict the underlying mechanisms of heart failure phenotypes and their implications for arrhythmogenesis, ranging from the cellular level to whole-heart simulations. The main aspects of heart failure are presented in several related sections. An overview of the main electrophysiological and structural changes that have been observed experimentally in failing hearts is followed by the description and discussion of the simulation work in this field at the cellular level, and then in 2D and 3D cardiac structures. The implications for arrhythmogenesis in heart failure are also discussed including therapeutic measures, such as drug effects and cardiac resynchronization therapy.

Echocardiography and telemetric ECG recordings revealed that compared with wild type mice, hearts of dKO mice showed an increased ejection fraction and a decreased heart rate, irrespective of age resulting in a maintained cardiac output. We attributed these findings to the lack of G\u03b111, which the absence was associated with a decreased afterload. Histological analysis of the extracellular matrix in the heart depicted a diminished presence of collagen in aging hearts of dKO mice compared to wild-type mice.

Using the Cre-loxP system, we generated a cardiac-specific deletion of Jak2 in the mouse to assess the effect on cardiac function with animals followed up for a 4-month period after birth. These animals had marked mortality during this period, although at 4 months mortality in male mice (47%) was substantially higher compared with female mice (30%). Both male and female cardiac Jak2-deleted mice had hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and severe left ventricular dysfunction, including a marked reduction in ejection fractions as assessed by serial echocardiography, although the responses in females were somewhat less severe. Defective cardiac function was associated with altered protein levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-regulatory proteins particularly in hearts from male mice that had depressed levels of SERCA2 and phosphorylated phospholamban. In contrast, SERCA2 was unchanged in hearts of female mice, whereas phosphorylated phospholamban was increased.

{"title": "Local Drug-Drug Interaction of Donepezil with Cilostazol at Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2) Increases Drug Accumulation in Heart.", "abstract": "Clinical reports indicate that cardiotoxicity due to donepezil can occur after coadministration with cilostazol. We speculated that the concentration of donepezil in heart tissue might be increased as a result of interaction with cilostazol at efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2), which are expressed in many tissues including the heart, and our study tested this hypothesis. First, donepezil was confirmed to be a substrate of both BCRP and P-glycoprotein in transporter-transfected cells in vitro. Cilostazol inhibited BCRP and P-glycoprotein with half-inhibitory concentrations of 130 nM and 12.7 \u03bcM, respectively. Considering the clinically achievable unbound plasma concentration of cilostazol (about 200 nM), it is plausible that BCRP-mediated transport of donepezil would be affected by cilostazol in vivo. Indeed, in an in vivo rat study, we found that coadministration of cilostazol significantly increased the concentrations of donepezil in the heart and brain, where BCRP functions as a part of the blood-tissue barrier, whereas the plasma concentration of donepezil was unaffected. In addition, in vitro accumulation of donepezil in heart tissue slices of rats was significantly increased in the presence of cilostazol. These results indicate that donepezil-cilostazol interaction at BCRP may be clinically relevant in heart and brain tissues. In other words, the tissue distribution of drugs can be influenced by drug-drug interaction (DDI) at efflux transporters in certain tissues (local DDI) without any apparent change in plasma concentration (systemic DDI).", "journal": "Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals", "date": "2015-10-16", "authors": ["RyotaTakeuchi", "KohkiShinozaki", "TakeoNakanishi", "IkumiTamai"], "doi": "10.1124/dmd.115.066654"}

To our knowledge, this is the first case discussing the overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms could increase susceptibility to SIRS-induced cardiomyopathy. It is imperative that this clinical question be investigated further as such a relationship may have significant clinical implications for prevention and future treatments, particularly in patients similar to the one presented in this clinical case.\nA 53-year old Caucasian female presented to the Emergency Department for cough, nausea, vomiting and \"feeling sick for 3\u00a0weeks.\" Labs were indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis. Initial electrocardiograms were suggestive of possible myocardial infarction and follow-up echocardiogram showed severely depressed left ventricular systolic function which resolved upon treatment of ketoacidosis.\nWe suggest that her cardiomyopathy could have three synergistic sources: SIRS, HHNS and NTIS. Overlapping mechanisms suggest uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and NTIS could increase susceptibility to SIRS-induced cardiomyopathy as seen in this case. HHNS and SIRS cause cardiac tissue injury through mechanisms including impairment of fatty acid oxidation and formation of reactive oxygen species, as well as modifying the function of membrane calcium channels. As a result, it is conceivable that diabetes may amplify the deleterious effects of inflammatory stressors on cardiac myocytes.

{"title": "Turbulent states and their transitions in mathematical models for ventricular tissue: the effects of random interstitial fibroblasts.", "abstract": "We study the dynamical behaviors of two types of spiral- and scroll-wave turbulence states, respectively, in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) mathematical models, of human, ventricular, myocyte cells that are attached to randomly distributed interstitial fibroblasts; these turbulence states are promoted by (a) the steep slope of the action-potential-duration-restitution (APDR) plot or (b) early afterdepolarizations (EADs). Our single-cell study shows that (1) the myocyte-fibroblast (MF) coupling G_{j} and (2) the number N_{f} of fibroblasts in an MF unit lower the steepness of the APDR slope and eliminate the EAD behaviors of myocytes; we explore the pacing dependence of such EAD suppression. In our 2D simulations, we observe that a spiral-turbulence (ST) state evolves into a state with a single, rotating spiral (RS) if either (a) G_{j} is large or (b) the maximum possible number of fibroblasts per myocyte N_{f}^{max} is large. We also observe that the minimum value of G_{j}, for the transition from the ST to the RS state, decreases as N_{f}^{max} increases. We find that, for the steep-APDR-induced ST state, once the MF coupling suppresses ST, the rotation period of a spiral in the RS state increases as (1) G_{j} increases, with fixed N_{f}^{max}, and (2) N_{f}^{max} increases, with fixed G_{j}. We obtain the boundary between ST and RS stability regions in the N_{f}^{max}-G_{j} plane. In particular, for low values of N_{f}^{max}, the value of G_{j}, at the ST-RS boundary, depends on the realization of the randomly distributed fibroblasts; this dependence decreases as N_{f}^{max} increases. Our 3D studies show a similar transition from scroll-wave turbulence to a single, rotating, scroll-wave state because of the MF coupling.

Rabbits in group 1 received a regular rabbit chow diet (normal diet) for 8 weeks; those in group 2 received atorvastatin (0.3 mg atorvastatin per day/kg body weight) for 8 weeks; those in group 3 received high-cholesterol diet for 8 weeks; and those in group 4 received high-cholesterol diet for 4 weeks, a high-cholesterol diet + atorvastatin (0.3 mg atorvastatin per day/kg body weight) for 8 weeks. The parameters were measured by spectrophotometric methods. As expected, the atherogenic diet caused a pronounced increase in lipid profile (not HDL) parameters. Rabbits in group 3 showed higher PCO, MDA, and NO levels in circulating and heart tissue compared to the rabbits in group 1. Atorvastatin has prevented or limited LDL oxidation and has showed constitutively beneficial effects in group 4. Increased LDL-C, PCO, MDA, and NO levels leading to decreasing PON-1 activity thus create a predisposition to atherogenesis in this model. But atorvastatin administration partly ameliorated oxidative damage in heart injury of hypercholesterolemic rabbits.

{"title": "Cardioprotective effect of total saponins from three medicinal species of Dioscorea against isoprenaline-induced myocardial ischemia.", "abstract": "As folk medicines used in China since 1950s, Dioscorea nipponica Makino (DN), D. panthaica Prain et Burkill (DP), and D. zingiberensis C.H. Wright (DZ) are regarded as having more or less the same traditional therapeutic actions, such as activating blood, relieving pain, and dispersing swelling. It is noteworthy that, of the 49 species of the genus Dioscorea distributed in China, based on such traditional efficacies, only these three have been further developed as effective single-herb medicines for treating cardiovascular diseases by the modern pharmaceutical industry. In our previous study, it was found that the chemical compositions of DN and DP were similar, and both were distinct from that of DZ. Hence, whether their different chemical profiles support their anti-IHD (ischemic heart disease) activity in common still needs to be answered. So far it is still unknown whether the efficacies of these three herbs act via similar mechanism and whether they possess comparable therapeutic efficacy for experimental myocardial ischemia (MI).\nThe present study aimed to further investigate the underlying mechanisms with respect to antioxidative stress activity by which these Dioscorea spp. attenuate MI, and to compare the therapeutic effect of total saponins from these three species on myocardial antioxidant levels and myocardial histology.\nThe serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as myocardial histology, were compared among rat groups administered with total saponins (TS) of DN, DP or DZ (abbreviated as DNTS, DPTS and DZTS, respectively). The rats experienced myocardial ischemia induced by isoprenaline (ISO) injection; the test solutions (DNTS, DPTS, DZTS) were administered either after the ISO injection, or both before and after.\nCompared with the model group (ISO injection only), TS groups exhibited significantly reduced activities of CK, LDH and AST, lowered level of MDA, and increased activities of SOD, CAT, GPx and T-AOC; heart tissues from TS groups revealed less severe histological damage. The cardioprotective efficacy of these three Dioscorea TS for rat MI was closely comparable based on the above observations.\nThe findings of the present study provide evidence that the anti-MI effect of DNTS, DPTS and DZTS can be attributed to the increase of myocardial antioxidant levels and decrease of lipid peroxidation formation, and the closely comparable results observed from these three Dioscorea saponins thereby explains the similarity in their clinical efficacy as anti-MI drugs.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2015-10-13", "authors": ["Yi-NaTang", "Xi-ChengHe", "MinYe", "HaoHuang", "Hong-LiChen", "Wan-LingPeng", "Zhong-ZhenZhao", "TaoYi", "Hu-BiaoChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2015.10.004"}

Co-assembly of KCNQ1 with the auxiliary \u03b2-subunit KCNE1 strongly up-regulates this current. In cardiac myocytes, KCNQ1/E1 complexes are thought to give rise to the delayed rectifier current IKs, which contributes to cardiac action potential repolarization. We report here that the type I membrane protein BACE1 (\u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1), which is best known for its detrimental role in Alzheimer's disease, but is also, as reported here, present in cardiac myocytes, serves as a novel interaction partner of KCNQ1. Using HEK293T cells as heterologous expression system to study the electrophysiological effects of BACE1 and KCNE1 on KCNQ1 in different combinations, our main findings were the following: (1) BACE1 slowed the inactivation of KCNQ1 current producing an increased initial response to depolarizing voltage steps. (2) Activation kinetics of KCNQ1/E1 currents were significantly slowed in the presence of co-expressed BACE1. (3) BACE1 impaired reconstituted cardiac IKs when cardiac action potentials were used as voltage commands, but interestingly augmented the IKs of ATP-deprived cells, suggesting that the effect of BACE1 depends on the metabolic state of the cell. (4) The electrophysiological effects of BACE1 on KCNQ1 reported here were independent of its enzymatic activity, as they were preserved when the proteolytically inactive variant BACE1 D289N was co-transfected in lieu of BACE1 or when BACE1-expressing cells were treated with the BACE1-inhibiting compound C3. (5) Co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) supported our hypothesis that BACE1 modifies the biophysical properties of IKs by physically interacting with KCNQ1 in a \u03b2-subunit-like fashion.

{"title": "RhoA Ambivalently Controls Prominent Myofibroblast Characteritics by Involving Distinct Signaling Routes.", "abstract": "RhoA has been shown to be beneficial in cardiac disease models when overexpressed in cardiomyocytes, whereas its role in cardiac fibroblasts (CF) is still poorly understood. During cardiac remodeling CF undergo a transition towards a myofibroblast phenotype thereby showing an increased proliferation and migration rate. Both processes involve the remodeling of the cytoskeleton. Since RhoA is known to be a major regulator of the cytoskeleton, we analyzed its role in CF and its effect on myofibroblast characteristics in 2 D and 3D models.\nDownregulation of RhoA was shown to strongly affect the actin cytoskeleton. It decreased the myofibroblast marker \u03b1-sm-actin, but increased certain fibrosis-associated factors like TGF-\u03b2 and collagens. Also, the detailed analysis of CTGF expression demonstrated that the outcome of RhoA signaling strongly depends on the involved stimulus. Furthermore, we show that proliferation of myofibroblasts rely on RhoA and tubulin acetylation. In assays accessing three different types of migration, we demonstrate that RhoA/ROCK/Dia1 are important for 2D migration and the repression of RhoA and Dia1 signaling accelerates 3D migration.

{"title": "Time Course of Cell Sheet Adhesion to Porcine Heart Tissue after Transplantation.", "abstract": "Multilayered cell sheets have been produced from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for investigating their adhesion properties onto native porcine heart tissue. Once MSCs reached confluence after a 7-day culture on a temperature-responsive culture dish, a MSCs monolayer spontaneously detached itself from the dish, when the culture temperature was reduced from 37 to 20\u00b0C. The basal extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins of the single cell sheet are preserved, because this technique requires no proteolytic enzymes for harvesting cell sheet, which become a basic building block for assembling a multilayer cell sheet. The thickness of multilayered cell sheets made from three MSC sheets was found to be approximately 60 \u03bcm. For investigating the adhesion properties of the basal and apical sides, the multilayered cell sheets were transplanted onto the surface of the heart's left ventricle. Multilayered cell sheets were histological investigated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after transplantation by hematoxylin eosin (HE) and azan dyes to determine required time for the adhesion of the multilayered sheets following cell-sheet transplantation. The results showed that only the basal side of multilayered cell sheets significantly enhanced the sheets adhesion onto the surface of heart 30 minutes after transplantation. This study concluded that (1) cell sheets had to be transplanted with its basal side onto the surface of heart tissue and (2) at least 30 minutes were necessary for obtaining the histological adhesion of the sheets to the heart tissue.

{"title": "[Endomyocardial biopsy should be performed in every patient with suspected myocarditis].", "abstract": "The diagnosis of myocarditis is difficult because there is no pathognomonic clinical presentation and the disease may mimic other non-inflammatory diseases. Thus, current classifications on cardiomyopathies (e.g., the World Health Organization and the International Society and Federation of Cardiology [WHO/ISFC], the European Society of Cardiology [ESC], and the 2013 Expert Myocarditis ESC Task Force) define myocarditis as an inflammatory disease of the myocardium, which is diagnosed on endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) based upon histological, immunological, immunohistochemical and molecular tools. This will identify etiology, and differentiate between infectious, mainly viral, and non-infectious, immune-mediated forms. The term \"inflammatory cardiomyopathy\" may be applied in biopsy-proven myocarditis with associated left, right or biventricular dysfunction. Myocarditis may resolve spontaneously, relapse or become chronic progressing to dilated cardiomyopathy, death or heart transplantation. The 2013 Myocarditis ESC Task Force consensus document recommends consideration of EMB and selective coronary angiography in all patients with clinically suspected myocarditis according to the Task Force criteria. It is recommended that EMB analysis includes not only histology (Dallas criteria), but also immunohistology and detection of the genome of infectious agents by molecular tools. EMB should be performed by expert teams. The rationale for this diagnostic effort is the availability of a wide range of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents that, as shown in systemic extracardiac autoimmune disease and in many clinical studies, can be used in infection-negative myocarditis patients to stop or at least stabilize chronic cardiac tissue damage mediated by the immune system, and thus prevent fibrosis and progression to irreversible end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)", "date": "2015-10-09", "authors": ["MartinaTestolina", "AlessandroSchiavo", "RenzoMarcolongo", "SabinoIliceto"], "doi": "10.1714/2028.22032"}

The difficulty lies in the fact that the biological effects of NIR depend not only on their thermodynamic characteristics but also on their frequency and intensity \"windows\", chemical and physical composition of the surrounding medium, as well as on the initial metabolic state of the organism. Therefore, only biomarker can be used for adequate estimation of biological effect of NIR on organisms. Because of the absence of such biomarker(s), organizations having the mission to monitor hazardous effects of NIR traditionally base their instruction on thermodynamic characteristics of NIR. Based on the high sensitivity to NIR of both aqua medium structure and cell hydration, it is suggested that cell bathing medium is one of the primary targets and cell hydration is a biomarker for NIR effects on cells and organisms.

In this report, we checked the effects of SCU on endothelium dysfunction (ED) of coronary artery (CA) against myocardial ischemia reperfusion (MIR) injury in vivo. The involvement of PKG-I\u03b1 was further studied using cultured endothelial cells subjected to hypoxia reoxygenation (HR) injury in vitro. In rat MIR model, SCU (45 and 90 mg/kg, iv) significantly reduced ischemic size and restored the endothelium-dependent vasodilation of isolated CA rings. PKG inhibitor Rp-8-Br-cGMP (50 \u03bcg/kg, iv) could ameliorate the protective effects of SCU. Increase in phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a main substrate of PKG, at Ser 239 was observed in both heart tissue and serum of SCU-treated animals. In cultured human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs), SCU (1 and 10 \u03bcM) dose-dependently protected cell viability and increased the mRNA and protein level of PKG-I\u03b1 against HR injury. The activity of PKG was also increased by SCU treatment. The activation of PKG-1\u03b1 was then studied using targeted proteomic analysis (MRM-MS) checking the phosphorylation state of the autophosphorylation domain (aa42-94). Significant decrease in phosphorylation of PKG-I\u03b1 at Ser50, Ser72, Ser89 was induced by HR injury while SCU treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of PKG-I\u03b1, not only at Ser50, Ser72 and Ser89, but also at Ser44 and Thr58 (two novel phosphorylation domains).

{"title": "Pharmacological identification of cholinergic receptor subtypes on Drosophila melanogaster larval heart.", "abstract": "The Drosophila melanogaster heart is a popular model in which to study cardiac physiology and development. Progress has been made in understanding the role of endogenous compounds in regulating cardiac function in this model. It is well characterized that common neurotransmitters act on many peripheral and non-neuronal tissues as they flow through the hemolymph of insects. Many of these neuromodulators, including acetylcholine (ACh), have been shown to act directly on the D. melanogaster larval heart. ACh is a primary neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates and at the neuromuscular junctions on skeletal and cardiac tissue. In insects, ACh is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter of sensory neurons and is also prominent in the CNS. A full understanding regarding the regulation of the Drosophila cardiac physiology by the cholinergic system remains poorly understood. Here we use semi-intact D. melanogaster larvae to study the pharmacological profile of cholinergic receptor subtypes, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), in modulating heart rate (HR). Cholinergic receptor agonists, nicotine and muscarine both increase HR, while nAChR agonist clothianidin exhibits no significant effect when exposed to an open preparation at concentrations as low as 100\u00a0nM. In addition, both nAChR and mAChR antagonists increase HR as well but also display capabilities of blocking agonist actions. These results provide evidence that both of these receptor subtypes display functional significance in regulating the larval heart's pacemaker activity.", "journal": "Journal of comparative physiology.

Apparently, zinc pyrithione restores the basal zinc levels during I/R and prevents apoptosis by activating phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase/Akt and targeting mitochondrial permeability transition. Receptor tyrosine kinases of the ErbB family (ErbB1 to ErbB4) are cell surface proteins that can regulate cell growth, proliferation and survival. Previous studies have shown that zinc pyrithione-induced activation of PI3kinase/Akt requires ErbB2 expression. On the other hand, while I/R decreases ErbB2 levels causing cardiomyocyte dysfunction and cell death, zinc pyrithione restores ErbB2 levels and maintains cardiomyocyte function. H9c2 cells expressed all the four ErbBs, although the expression of ErbB1 and ErbB2 were higher compared to ErbB3 and ErbB4. Hypoxia/Reoxygenation (H/R) had opposing effects on the mRNA expression of ErbB1 and ErbB2. ErbB2 mRNA levels were enhanced, but corresponding ErbB2 protein levels decreased after reoxygenation. H/R induced the degradation of ErbB2 in caspase-3 dependent manner, with the formation of a 25kDa fragment. This fragment could be detected after H/R only upon treatment of the cells with a proteasomal inhibitor, ALLN, suggesting that caspase-mediated cleavage of 185kDa ErbB2 results in C-terminal cleavage and formation of 25kDa fragment, which is further degraded by proteasome. Heterodimerization and phosphorylation of ErbB2/ErbB1 which decreased upon reoxygenation, was promoted by zinc pyrithione. Zinc pyrithione effectively suppressed the caspase activation, decreased the proteolytic cleavage of ErbB2, enhanced the phosphorylation and activation of ErbB1-ErbB2 complexes and improved the cell survival after hypoxia/reoxygenation.", "journal": "Journal of inorganic biochemistry", "date": "2015-10-06", "authors": ["Vijaya LakshmiBodiga", "SandhyaThokala", "Praveen KumarVemuri", "SreedharBodiga"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2015.09.010"}

Mammalian hibernation is characterized by drastic reductions in body temperature, heart rate, metabolism, and oxygen consumption. These changes pose significant challenges to the physiology of hibernators, especially for the heart, which maintains function throughout the extreme conditions, resembling ischemia and reperfusion. To identify novel cardioadaptive strategies, we merged large-scale RNA-seq data with large-scale iTRAQ-based proteomic data in heart tissue from 13-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) throughout the circannual cycle. Protein identification and data analysis were run through Galaxy-P, a new multiomic data analysis platform enabling effective integration of RNA-seq and MS/MS proteomic data. Galaxy-P uses flexible, modular workflows that combine customized sequence database searching and iTRAQ quantification to identify novel ground squirrel-specific protein sequences and provide insight into molecular mechanisms of hibernation. This study allowed for the quantification of 2007 identified cardiac proteins, including over 350 peptide sequences derived from previously uncharacterized protein products.

Moreover, ASIV combination reduced both calpain-1 protein expression and calpain activity, down-regulated mitochondrial NOX4 (mito-NOX4) expression, increased activity of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (mito-SOD) and mitochondrial catalase (mito-CAT) compared to ISO treated alone. The results suggested that ASIV exerted anti-apoptosis effect on ISO-induced hypertrophic cardiomyocyte by attenuating oxidative stress and calpain-1 activation.", "journal": "Environmental toxicology and pharmacology", "date": "2015-10-05", "authors": ["MengMei", "FutianTang", "MeiliLu", "XinHe", "HongxinWang", "XuweiHou", "JinHu", "ChonghuaXu", "RonghuiHan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.etap.2015.09.007"}

Based on the beneficial effects of exercise on preventing cardiovascular complications of diabetes, we aimed to examine the protective effects of aerobic exercise on expression of LOX-1 receptor and production of free radicals in the heart of diabetic rats.\nFour groups of rats were used: (n = 5 per group): sedentary normal, trained normal, sedentary diabetes and trained diabetes. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). The exercise protocol was consisted of swimming 30 min/day, 5 days/week for eight weeks. Plasma glucose was evaluated at initiation, weeks 4 and 8 of experiment. At the end of experiment, rats were sacrificed and the heart was removed for determination of nitrate, malondialdehyde, and LOX-1 gene expression.\nIn normal non-diabetic rats, the blood glucose level was <150 mg/dl; however, the induction of diabetes resulted in levels more than >400 mg/dl. Gene expression of LOX-1 was increased in the heart of diabetic rats. Exercise reduced the gene expression of this protein in diabetic states without reducing the blood glucose. Finally, swimming exercise decreased the malondialdehyde and nitrate levels in heart tissue both in control and diabetic rats.\nSwimming exercise reduces heart expression of the LOX-1 receptor in accompany with reduction of free radicals production. Since these parameters are important in generation of diabetic complications, swimming exercise is a good candidate for reducing these complications.", "journal": "Iranian biomedical journal", "date": "2015-10-04", "authors": ["SiminRiahi", "Mohammad TaghiMohammadi", "VahidSobhani", "ShimaAbabzadeh"], "doi": "10.7508/ibj.2016.01.004"}

Although reperfusion therapy is the treatment to increase blood supply to the ischemic myocardium, this intervention potentially causes cardiac tissue damage and instigates arrhythmias, processes known as reperfusion injury. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are glycemic control drugs commonly used in T2DM patients. Growing evidence from basic and clinical studies demonstrates that a DPP-4 inhibitor could exert cardioprotection and improve left ventricular function by reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and increasing reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) activity. However, recent reports also showed potentially adverse cardiac events due to the use of a DPP-4 inhibitor. To investigate this disparity, future large clinical trials are essential in verifying whether DPP-4 inhibitors are beneficial beyond their glycemic control particularly for the ischemic heart in obese-insulin resistant subjects and T2DM patients.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2015-10-04", "authors": ["NiponChattipakorn", "NattayapornApaijai", "Siriporn CChattipakorn"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.09.044"}

In this study, we made the first attempt to fabricate a paper-based array for the culture, proliferation, and direct differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into functional beating cardiac tissues and create \"a beating heart on paper.\" This array was simply constructed by binding a cured multi-well polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold with common, commercially available paper substrates. Three types of paper material (print paper, chromatography paper and nitrocellulose membrane) were tested for adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of human-derived iPSCs. We found that hiPSCs grew well on these paper substrates, presenting a three-dimensional (3D)-like morphology with a pluripotent property. The direct differentiation of human iPSCs into functional cardiac tissues on paper was also achieved using our modified differentiation approach. The cardiac tissue retained its functional activities on the coated print paper and chromatography paper with a beating frequency of 40-70 beats per min for up to three months. Interestingly, human iPSCs could be differentiated into retinal pigment epithelium on nitrocellulose membrane under the conditions of cardiac-specific induction, indicating the potential roles of material properties and mechanical cues that are involved in regulating stem cell differentiation.

However, whether 4-PBA is protective in hypertrophic heart disease is unclear. Thus, we tested the therapeutic effect of 4-PBA on pressure-overload induced myocardial hypertrophy. Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was used to create myocardial hypertrophy in C57BL/6 male mice for 4 weeks. Immediately after surgery, the mice were administrated either 4-PBA (20 mg/kg/day) or 0.9% NaCl by intraperitoneal injection. At the end of 4 weeks, the mice underwent high-resolution echocardiographic imaging. Our results showed that both the left ventricular posterior wall thickness at end systole (LVPWs) and diastole (LVPWd) were increased in the TAC group, compared to control. 4-PBA administration attenuated hypertrophy and decreased the heart weight over body weight ratio. Masson's trichrome staining showed that myocardial interstitial fibrosis and collagen deposition were also decreased by 4-PBA. We next detected the ER stress response in the heart tissues of TAC mice in different time points. Western blotting showed that the expression of ER stress marker, GRP78, CHOP and phosphor-PERK, were persistently increased 4 weeks after TAC. The treatment of 4-PBA inhibited the expression of ER stress markers. We also demonstrated that the 4-PBA at 20 mg/kg/day had no effect on histone 3 deacetylation inhibition, while attenuating ER stress and TAC-induced hypertrophy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CT in hypertensive ovariectomized rats undergoing fructose overload in blood pressure variability (BPV), inflammation, and oxidative stress parameters. Female rats were divided into the following groups (n = 8/group): sedentary normotensive Wistar rats (C), and sedentary (FHO) or trained (FHOT) ovariectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats undergoing and fructose overload. CT was performed on a treadmill and ladder adapted to rats in alternate days (8 wk; 40-60% maximal capacity). Arterial pressure (AP) was directly measured. Oxidative stress and inflammation were measured on cardiac and renal tissues.

{"title": "Innervating sympathetic neurons regulate heart size and the timing of cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal.", "abstract": "Sympathetic drive to the heart is a key modulator of cardiac function and interactions between heart tissue and innervating sympathetic fibres are established early in development. Significant innervation takes place during postnatal heart development, a period when cardiomyocytes undergo a rapid transition from proliferative to hypertrophic growth. The question of whether these innervating sympathetic fibres play a role in regulating the modes of cardiomyocyte growth was investigated using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to abolish early sympathetic innervation of the heart. Postnatal chemical sympathectomy resulted in rats with smaller hearts, indicating that heart growth is regulated by innervating sympathetic fibres during the postnatal period. In vitro experiments showed that sympathetic interactions resulted in delays in markers of cardiomyocyte maturation, suggesting that changes in the timing of the transition from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes could underlie changes in heart size in the sympathectomized animals. There was also an increase in the expression of Meis1, which has been linked to cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal, suggesting that sympathetic signalling suppresses cell cycle withdrawal. This signalling involves \u03b2-adrenergic activation, which was necessary for sympathetic regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation and hypertrophy. The effect of \u03b2-adrenergic signalling on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy underwent a developmental transition. While young postnatal cardiomyocytes responded to isoproterenol (isoprenaline) with a decrease in cell size, mature cardiomyocytes showed an increase in cell size in response to the drug. Together, these results suggest that early sympathetic effects on proliferation modulate a key transition between proliferative and hypertrophic growth of the heart and contribute to the sympathetic regulation of adult heart size.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2015-10-01", "authors": ["R EKreipke", "S JBirren"], "doi": "10.1113/JP270917"}

We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models throughout. We analysed outcomes at short-term (less than 12 months) and long-term (12 months or more) follow-up. Dichotomous outcomes are reported as risk ratio (RR) and continuous outcomes are reported as mean difference (MD) or standardised MD (SMD). We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the results in the context of the risk of selection, performance and attrition bias. Exploratory subgroup analysis investigated the effects of baseline cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF) and cell dose, type and timing of administration, as well as the use of heparin in the final cell solution.\nForty-one RCTs with a total of 2732 participants (1564 cell therapy, 1168 controls) were eligible for inclusion.

Additionally, cell therapy had no effect on morbidity, quality of life/performance or LVEF measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Meta-analyses of LVEF measured by echocardiography, single photon emission computed tomography and left ventricular angiography showed evidence of differences in mean LVEF between treatment groups although the mean differences ranged between 2% and 5%, which are accepted not to be clinically relevant. Results were robust to the risk of selection, performance and attrition bias from individual studies.\nThe results of this review suggest that there is insufficient evidence for a beneficial effect of cell therapy for AMI patients.

{"title": "Nano-level morphology of scar tissue after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a pioneer imaging technique commonly employed by biological researchers in detection of the properties of biological membranes over the last decade. The AFM findings distinguish its applicability from the conventional methods, such as: confocal, multi-photons, electron microscopy, etc. as well as from the mechanical methods (compression and indentation test, extensiometry, etc.). With its high resolution (below 10 nm), AFM has emerged as a powerful tool in obtaining the nanostructural details and biomechanical properties of heart tissue. The composition of extracellular matrix is essential for heart compliance and its mechanical function. Here, we illustrate the surface morphology, its structural assembling and the mechanical properties of a myocardial infarction scar section aquired via AFM, in dry conditions. The cross section through the mature myocardial scar of mice after myocardial infarction shows that the embedded fibrils into the tissue matrix of a mature scar overlap at some sites, and form network-like structures.

{"title": "How Severely Is DNA Quantification Hampered by RNA Co-extraction?", "abstract": "The optional RNase digest that is part of many DNA extraction protocols is often omitted, either because RNase is not provided in the kit or because users do not want to risk contaminating their laboratory. Consequently, co-eluting RNA can become a \"contaminant\" of unknown magnitude in a DNA extraction. We extracted DNA from liver, lung, kidney, and heart tissues and established that 28-52% of the \"DNA\" as assessed by spectrophotometry is actually RNA (depending on tissue type). Including an RNase digest in the extraction protocol reduced 260:280 purity ratios. Co-eluting RNA drives an overestimation of DNA yield when quantification is carried out using OD 260\u2009nm spectrophotometry, or becomes an unquantified contaminant when spectrofluorometry is used for DNA quantification. This situation is potentially incompatible with the best practice guidelines for biobanks issued by organizations such as the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories, which state that biospecimens should be accurately characterized in terms of their identity, purity, concentration, and integrity. Consequently, we conclude that an RNase digest must be included in DNA extractions if pure DNA is required.

Male rats in different groups were treated with MOPF orally at the dose of 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg/day for 28 days and were subsequently administered (s.c.) with ISO (85 mg/kg body weight) for the last two days. At the end of the experiment levels of serum troponin-T, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, content of malondialdehyde (MDA), activities/levels of different cellular antioxidants were estimated in control and experimental groups. Additionally, scavenging potential to the hydroxyl radical of the fraction was measured by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). ISO administered rats showed significant increase in the levels of serum troponin-I, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and heart tissue MDA content. Furthermore, marked reduction in the activities of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione levels were observed. EPR study showed an increase in signal intensity in ISO-induced rats. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of heart section revealed a marked increase in infarcted area in ISO-induced rats. Histological features of the heart also indicated a disruption in the structure of cardiac myofibrils in these animals. MOPF (100 mg/kg body weight) pretreatment prevented all these adverse effects of ISO.

We hypothesized that if microRNAs (miRNAs) respond to changes following cardiac stress, then myocardial profiling of these miRNAs may reveal cardio-protective mechanisms of aerobic ET in HF. We used ascending aortic stenosis (AS) inducing HF in Wistar rats. Controls were sham-operated animals. At 18 wk after surgery, rats with cardiac dysfunction were randomized to 10 wk of aerobic ET (HF-ET) or to a heart failure sedentary group (HF-S). ET attenuated cardiac remodeling as well as clinical and pathological signs of HF with maintenance of systolic and diastolic function when compared with that of the HF-S. Global miRNA expression profiling of the cardiac tissue revealed 53 miRNAs exclusively dysregulated in animals in the HF-ET, but only 11 miRNAs were exclusively dysregulated in the HF-S. Out of 23 miRNAs that were differentially regulated in both groups, 17 miRNAs exhibited particularly high increases in expression, including miR-598, miR-429, miR-224, miR-425, and miR-221. From the initial set of deregulated miRNAs, 14 miRNAs with validated targets expressed in cardiac tissue that respond robustly to ET in HF were used to construct miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks that revealed a set of 203 miRNA-target genes involved in programmed cell death, TGF-\u03b2 signaling, cellular metabolic processes, cytokine signaling, and cell morphogenesis.

{"title": "Role of atrial tissue remodeling on rotor dynamics: an in vitro study.", "abstract": "The objective of this article is to present an in vitro model of atrial cardiac tissue that could serve to study the mechanisms of remodeling related to atrial fibrillation (AF). We analyze the modification on gene expression and modifications on rotor dynamics following tissue remodeling. Atrial murine cells (HL-1 myocytes) were maintained in culture after the spontaneous initiation of AF and analyzed at two time points: 3.1 \u00b1 1.3 and 9.7 \u00b1 0.5 days after AF initiation. The degree of electrophysiological remodeling (i.e., relative gene expression of key ion channels) and structural inhomogeneity was compared between early and late cell culture times both in nonfibrillating and fibrillating cell cultures. In addition, the electrophysiological characteristics of in vitro fibrillation [e.g., density of phase singularities (PS/cm(2)), dominant frequency, and rotor meandering] analyzed by means of optical mapping were compared with the degree of electrophysiological remodeling. Fibrillating cell cultures showed a differential ion channel gene expression associated with atrial tissue remodeling (i.e., decreased SCN5A, CACN1C, KCND3, and GJA1 and increased KCNJ2) not present in nonfibrillating cell cultures. Also, fibrillatory complexity was increased in late- vs. early stage cultures (1.12 \u00b1 0.14 vs. 0.43 \u00b1 0.19 PS/cm(2), P < 0.01), which was associated with changes in the electrical reentrant patterns (i.e., decrease in rotor tip meandering and increase in wavefront curvature).

{"title": "Conductive interpenetrating networks of polypyrrole and polycaprolactone encourage electrophysiological development of cardiac cells.", "abstract": "Conductive and electroactive polymers have the potential to enhance engineered cardiac tissue function. In this study, an interpenetrating network of the electrically-conductive polymer polypyrrole (PPy) was grown within a matrix of flexible polycaprolactone (PCL) and evaluated as a platform for directing the formation of functional cardiac cell sheets. PCL films were either treated with sodium hydroxide to render them more hydrophilic and enhance cell adhesion or rendered electroactive with PPy grown via chemical polymerization yielding PPy-PCL that had a resistivity of 1.0 \u00b1 0.4 k\u03a9 cm, which is similar to native cardiac tissue. Both PCL and PPy-PCL films supported cardiomyocyte attachment; increasing the duration of PCL pre-treatment with NaOH resulted in higher numbers of adherent cardiomyocytes per unit area, generating cell densities which were more similar to those on PPy-PCL films (1568 \u00b1 126 cells mm(-2), 2880 \u00b1 439 cells mm(-2), 3623 \u00b1 456 cells mm(-2) for PCL with 0, 24, 48 h of NaOH pretreatment, respectively; 2434 \u00b1 166 cells mm(-2) for PPy-PCL). When cardiomyocytes were cultured on the electrically-conductive PPy-PCL, more cells were observed to have peripheral localization of the gap junction protein connexin-43 (Cx43) as compared to cells on NaOH-treated PCL (60.3 \u00b1 4.3% vs. 46.6 \u00b1 5.7%). Cx43 gene expression remained unchanged between materials. Importantly, the velocity of calcium wave propagation was faster and calcium transient duration was shorter for cardiomyocyte monolayers on PPy-PCL (1612 \u00b1 143 \u03bcm/s, 910 \u00b1 63 ms) relative to cells on PCL (1129 \u00b1 247 \u03bcm/s, 1130 \u00b1 20 ms). In summary, PPy-PCL has demonstrated suitability as an electrically-conductive substrate for culture of cardiomyocytes, yielding enhanced functional properties; results encourage further development of conductive substrates for use in differentiation of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and cardiac tissue engineering applications.\nCurrent conductive materials for use in cardiac regeneration are limited by cytotoxicity or cost in implementation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate for the first time the application of a biocompatible, conductive polypyrrole-polycaprolactone film as a platform for culturing cardiomyocytes for cardiac regeneration. This study shows that the novel conductive film is capable of enhancing cell-cell communication through the formation of connexin-43, leading to higher velocities for calcium wave propagation and reduced calcium transient durations among cultured cardiomyocyte monolayers. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that chemical modification of polycaprolactone through alkaline-mediated hydrolysis increased overall cardiomyocyte adhesion. The results of this study provide insight into how cardiomyocytes interact with conductive substrates and will inform future research efforts to enhance the functional properties of cardiomyocytes, which is critical for their use in pharmaceutical testing and cell therapy.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-09-27", "authors": ["Benjamin SSpearman", "Alexander JHodge", "John LPorter", "John GHardy", "Zenda DDavis", "TengXu", "XinyuZhang", "Christine ESchmidt", "Michael CHamilton", "Elizabeth ALipke"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.09.025"}

These chemical agents are known to confer protection on heart tissue against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Subsequent changes in the redox and ligand-coordination states during experimental simulations of ischemia and reperfusion have also been monitored. We found that these measurements, in real time, could be used to evaluate the preconditioning treatment of cardiomyocytes and to predict the likelihood of cell survival following a potentially lethal period of ischemia. Evaluation of the preconditioning treatment was done at the single-cell level. The binding of NO to myoglobin, giving a 6-coordinate ferrous-heme complex, was inferred from the measured Raman bands of a cardiomyocyte by comparison to pure solution of the protein in the presence of NO. A key change in the Raman spectrum was observed after perfusion of the NO-donor was completed, where, if the preconditioning treatment was successful, the bands corresponding to the nitrosyl complex were replaced by bands corresponding to metmyoglobin, Mb(III). An observation of Mb(III) bands in the Raman spectrum was made for all of the cardiomyocytes that recovered contractile function, whereas the absence of Mb(III) bands always indicated that the cardiomyocyte would be unable to recover contractile function following the simulated conditions of ischemia and reperfusion in these experiments.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2015-09-26", "authors": ["AbdullahAlmohammedi", "Sofia MKapetanaki", "Andrew JHudson", "Nina MStorey"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.5b03103"}

At present, the consequences of phenotypic diversity in macrophages in the heart are incompletely understood. The contribution of cardiac M2-polarized macrophages to the resolution of inflammation and repair response following myocardial infarction remains to be fully defined. In this study, the role of M2 macrophages was investigated utilising a specific CSF-1 receptor signalling inhibition strategy to achieve their depletion. In mice, oral administration of GW2580, a CSF-1R kinase inhibitor, induced significant decreases in Gr1lo and F4/80hi monocyte populations in the circulation and the spleen. GW2580 administration also induced a significant depletion of M2 macrophages in the heart after 1 week treatment as well as a reduction of cardiac arginase1 and CD206 gene expression indicative of M2 macrophage activity. In a murine myocardial infarction model, reduced M2 macrophage content was associated with increased M1-related gene expression (IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2), and decreased M2-related gene expression (Arginase1 and CD206) in the heart of GW2580-treated animals versus vehicle-treated controls. M2 depletion was also associated with a loss in left ventricular contractile function, infarct enlargement, decreased collagen staining and increased inflammatory cell infiltration into the infarct zone, specifically neutrophils and M1 macrophages. Taken together, these data indicate that CSF-1R signalling is critical for maintaining cardiac tissue resident M2-polarized macrophage population, which is required for the resolution of inflammation post myocardial infarction and, in turn, for preservation of ventricular function.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-09-26", "authors": ["Anne-LaureLeblond", "KerstinKlinkert", "KennethMartin", "Elizebeth CTurner", "Arun HKumar", "TaraBrowne", "Noel MCaplice"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0137515\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036814\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.04.021\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.916346\n10.1124/jpet.107.129429\n10.1172/JCI60363\n10.1093/cvr/cvn097\n10.1016/j.imbio.2010.05.012\n10.1038/nm.3337\n10.1182/blood-2009-08-237412\n10.1182/blood-2010-02-266296\n10.1371/journal.pone.0056045\n10.1007/s00395-011-0204-x\n10.1172/JCI41080\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.013\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303567\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.300502"}

However, clinically available systems based on radio-frequency or cryothermal ablation suffer from limited energy penetration and the lack of lesion's extent monitoring. An ultrasound-guided transesophageal device has recently successfully been used to perform High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) ablation in targeted regions of the heart in vivo. In this study we investigate the feasibility of a dual therapy and imaging approach on the same transesophageal device. We demonstrate in vivo that quantitative cardiac shear-wave elastography (SWE) can be performed with the device and we show on ex vivo samples that transesophageal SWE can map the extent of the HIFU lesions. First, SWE was validated with the transesophageal endoscope in one sheep in vivo. The stiffness of normal atrial and ventricular tissues has been assessed during the cardiac cycle (n = 11) and mapped (n = 7). Second, HIFU ablation has been performed with the therapy-imaging transesophageal device in ex vivo chicken breast samples (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20093), then atrial (left, n = 2) and ventricular (left n = 1, right n = 1) porcine heart tissues. SWE provided stiffness maps of the tissues before and after ablation. Areas of the lesions were obtained by tissue color change with gross pathology and compared to SWE. During the cardiac cycle stiffness varied from 0.5\u2009\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u2009\u20090.1 kPa to 6.0\u2009\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u2009\u20090.3 kPa in the atrium and from 1.3\u2009\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u2009\u20090.3 kPa to 13.5\u2009\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u2009\u20099.1 kPa in the ventricles.

Once revealed that long-lived fruit flies exhibit limited cardiac decline, we investigated whether Rpd3 downregulation would improve stress resistance and/or lifespan when targeted in the heart. Contested against three different stressors (oxidation, starvation and heat), heart-specific Rpd3 downregulation significantly enhanced stress resistance in flies. However, these higher levels of resistance were not observed when Rpd3 downregulation was targeted in other tissues or when other long-lived flies were tested in the heart-specific manner. Interestingly, the expressions of anti-aging genes such as sod2, foxo and Thor, were systemically increased as a consequence of heart-specific Rpd3 downregulation. Showing higher resistance to oxidative stress, the heart-specific Rpd3 downregulation concurrently exhibited improved cardiac functions, demonstrating an increased heart rate, decreased heart failure and accelerated heart recovery. Conversely, Rpd3 upregulation in cardiac tissue reduced systemic resistance against heat stress with decreased heart function, also specifying phosphorylated Rpd3 levels as a significant modulator.

{"title": "Engineering multi-layered skeletal muscle tissue by using 3D microgrooved collagen scaffolds.", "abstract": "Preparation of three-dimensional (3D) micropatterned porous scaffolds remains a great challenge for engineering of highly organized tissues such as skeletal muscle tissue and cardiac tissue. Two-dimensional (2D) micropatterned surfaces with periodic features (several nanometers to less than 100 \u03bcm) are commonly used to guide the alignment of muscle myoblasts and myotubes and lead to formation of pre-patterned cell sheets. However, cell sheets from 2D patterned surfaces have limited thickness, and harvesting the cell sheets for implantation is inconvenient and can lead to less alignment of myotubes. 3D micropatterned scaffolds can promote cell alignment and muscle tissue formation. In this study, we developed a novel type of 3D porous collagen scaffolds with concave microgrooves that mimic muscle basement membrane to engineer skeletal muscle tissue.

{"title": "Apigenin attenuates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury via the inactivation of p38 mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase.", "abstract": "Apigenin (Api) is a plant monomer associated with reducing the risk of heart disease. However, the mechanism of action remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, it was hypothesized that API has cardioprotective effects by attenuating myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Rats were randomly subjected to sham operation, myocardial I/R alone or I/R + Api. Cardiac function was measured, and infarct size was evaluated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining following reperfusion. The myocardial enzyme leakage was analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK). The myocardium was also assessed for total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. The phosphorylation of p38 mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase (MAPK) was analyzed by western blotting. The present study reported for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that I/R significantly increased infarct size, induced CK and LDH release, inhibited the activity of SOD and increased the levels of MDA, all of which were prevented by treatment with Api. In addition, I/R increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which was significantly decreased in the Api\u2011treated heart tissue samples following I/R, compared with the untreated heart tissue samples. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that Api inhibited the p38 MAPK signaling pathway to protect cardiomyocytes from I/R\u2011induced injury.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2015-09-24", "authors": ["XiaYang", "JunlanYang", "JingHu", "XiaoqingLi", "XianjiaoZhang", "ZilinLi"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2015.4293"}

Exercise could prevent the incremental effect of nandrolone on MDA/GPX ratio. Chronic administration of nandrolone with moderate-intensity endurance exercise had no significant effect on blood pressure, heart rate, and basal electrocardiographic parameters. Combination of nandrolone and exercise significantly increased the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and reduced the VF latency (P < 0.05).\nThe findings suggest that chronic coadministration of nandrolone with moderate-intensity endurance exercise facilitates the VF occurrence in rat.

There is growing interest in the altered muscle pathophysiology experienced by cachectic patients. This study reports the microarray analysis of gene expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle in the colon 26 (C26) carcinoma mouse model of cancer cachexia. A total of 268 genes were found to be differentially expressed in cardiac muscle tissue, compared with nontumor-bearing controls. This was fewer than the 1,533 genes that changed in cachectic skeletal muscle. In addition to different numbers of genes changing, different cellular functions were seen to change in each tissue. The cachectic heart showed signs of inflammation, similar to cachectic skeletal muscle, but did not show the upregulation of ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes or downregulation of genes involved in cellular energetics and muscle regeneration that characterizes skeletal muscle cachexia. Quantitative PCR was used to investigate a subset of inflammatory genes in the cardiac and skeletal muscle of independent cachectic samples; this revealed that B4galt1, C1s, Serpina3n, and Vsig4 were significantly upregulated in cardiac tissue, whereas C1s and Serpina3n were significantly upregulated in skeletal tissue. Our skeletal muscle microarray results were also compared with those from three published microarray studies and found to be consistent in terms of the genes differentially expressed and the functional processes affected.

{"title": "[Numerical Simulation of Propagation of Electric Excitation in the Heart Wall Taking into Account Its Fibrous-Laminar Structure].", "abstract": "The propagation of excitation wave in the inhomogeneous anisotropic finite element model of cardiac muscle is investigated. In this model, the inhomogeneity stands for the rotation of anisotropy axes through the wall thickness and results from a fibrous-laminar structure of the cardiac muscle tissue. Conductivity of the cardiac muscle is described using a monodomain model and the Aliev-Panfilov equations are used as the relationships between the transmembrane current and transmembrane potential. Numerical simulation is performed by applying the splitting algorithm, in which the partial differential solution to the nonlinear boundary value problem is reduced to a sequence of simple ordinary differential equations and linear partial differential equations. The simulation is carried out for a rectangular block of the cardiac tissue, the minimal size of which is considered to be the thickness of the heart wall. Two types of distribution of the fiber orientation angle are discussed. The first case corresponds 'to the left ventricle of a dog. The endocardium and epicardium fibers are generally oriented in the meridional direction. The angle of fiber orientation varies smoothly through the wall thickness making a half-turn. A circular layer, in which the fibers are oriented in the circumferential direction locates deep in the cardiac wall. The results of calculations show that for this case the wave form strongly depends on a place of initial excitation. For the endocardial and epicardial initial excitation one can see the earlier wave front propagation in the endocardium and epicardium, respectively. At the intramural initial excitation the simultaneous wave front propagation in the endocardium and epicardium occurs, but there is a wave front lag in the middle of the wall. The second case refers to the right ventricle of a swine, in which the endocardium and epicardium fibers are typically oriented in the circumferential direction, whereas the subepicardium fibers undergo an abrupt change in the angle of orientation. For this case the dependence of the wave front on the location of initial excitation is weak. One can see the earlier wave front propagation in the middle of the wall. However, the wave front formation rate is different: with highest velocity for intramural initial excitation and with lowest one during excitation on the endocardial surface.", "journal": "Biofizika", "date": "2015-09-24", "authors": ["I NVasserman", "V PMatveenko", "I NShardakov", "A PShestakov"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Akt-dependent Girdin phosphorylation regulates repair processes after acute myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death, and cardiac rupture following myocardial infarction leads to extremely poor prognostic feature. A large body of evidence suggests that Akt is involved in several cardiac diseases. We previously reported that Akt-mediated Girdin phosphorylation is essential for angiogenesis and neointima formation. The role of Girdin expression and phosphorylation in myocardial infarction, however, is not understood. Therefore, we employed Girdin-deficient mice and Girdin S1416A knock-in (Girdin(SA/SA)) mice, replacing the Akt phosphorylation site with alanine, to address this question. We found that Girdin was expressed and phosphorylated in cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and that its phosphorylation was crucial for the proliferation and migration of cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, Girdin was localized in non-cardiomyocyte interstitial cells and phosphorylated in \u03b1-smooth muscle actin-positive cells, which are likely to be cardiac myofibroblasts. In an acute myocardial infarction model, Girdin(SA/SA) suppressed the accumulation and proliferation of cardiac myofibroblasts in the infarcted area. Furthermore, lower collagen deposition in Girdin(SA/SA) mice impaired cardiac repair and resulted in increased mortality attributed to cardiac rupture. These findings suggest an important role of Girdin phosphorylation at serine 1416 in cardiac repair after acute myocardial infarction and provide insights into the complex mechanism of cardiac rupture through the Akt/Girdin-mediated regulation of cardiac myofibroblasts.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2015-09-24", "authors": ["ShinjiHayano", "MikitoTakefuji", "KengoMaeda", "TomonoriNoda", "HitoshiIchimiya", "KoichiKobayashi", "AtsushiEnomoto", "NaoyaAsai", "MasahideTakahashi", "ToyoakiMurohara"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.09.012"}

Diffusion properties of each heart were assessed with diffusion tensor imaging in terms of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (Da) and radial diffusivity (Dr). Tractography was performed to visualize the course of the cardiomyocytes, assuming greater diffusivity in the longitudinal than the transverse axis of individual cardiomyocytes. Significant differences in MD, Da and Dr were found, as well as in FA between groups (P\u2005<\u20050.001). Freezing of specimens resulted in the lowest mean FA of 0.21 (0.06) and highest Dr of 8.92 (1.5)\u2005mm2 s(-1) .

Calculated tractographies were indistinguishable among groups except in frozen specimens, where no fibres could be tracked. Perfusion fixation with formalin provided the best tractography, but immersion fixation yielded diffusion data most similar to fresh hearts.

Effect of DN in regulating some endogenous metabolites was beneficial for protecting peripheral system, while that in other endogenous metabolites produced potential toxicity to peripheral system. The metabolomic analysis revealed the coexistence of protective and toxic effects of DN on peripheral system, which may be a practical guidance for its safe application and beneficial to the expansion of its application scope.", "journal": "Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica", "date": "2015-09-24", "authors": ["Shuai-nanZhang", "Xu-zhaoLi", "YuWang", "Dong-huaYu", "FangLu", "Shu-minLiu"], "doi": null}

Compared to the well-characterized adverse cardiovascular effect of inhaled ambient ultrafine particles, research on the health response to orally administrated TiO2 NPs is still limited. In our study, we performed an in vivo study in Sprague-Dawley rats to understand the cardiovascular effect of TiO2 NPs after oral intake. After daily gastrointestinal administration of TiO2 NPs at 0, 2, 10, 50 mg/kg for 30 and 90 days, heart rate (HR), blood pressure, blood biochemical parameters and histopathology of cardiac tissues was assessed to quantify cardiovascular damage. Mild and temporary reduction of HR and systolic blood pressure as well as an increase of diastolic blood pressure was observed after daily oral administration of TiO2 NPs for 30 days. Injury of cardiac function was observed after daily oral administration of TiO2 NPs for 90 days as reflected in decreased activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) and creatine kinase (CK). Increased white blood cells count (WBC) and granulocytes (GRN) in blood as well as increased concentrations of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF \u03b1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the serum indicated inflammatory response initiated by TiO2 NPs exposure. It was hypothesize that cardiac damage and inflammatory response are the possible mechanisms of the adverse cardiovascular effects induced by orally administrated TiO2 NPs. Data from our study suggested that even at low dose of TiO2 NPs can induce adverse cardiovascular effects after 30 days or 90 days of oral exposure, thus warranting concern for the dietary intake of TiO2 NPs for consumers.", "journal": "Toxicology letters", "date": "2015-09-22", "authors": ["ZhangjianChen", "YunWang", "LinZhuo", "ShiChen", "LinZhao", "XianguoLuan", "HaifangWang", "GuangJia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.toxlet.2015.09.013"}

Incredible efforts have recently been made to study the regulation of glycoproteins for disease prognosis and diagnosis. It is essential to elucidate glycans and intact glycoproteins to understand the role of glycosylation in diseases. Sialylated N-glycans play crucial roles in physiological and pathological processes; however, it is laborious to study sialylated glycoproteins due to the labile nature of sialic acid residues. In this study, an integrated platform is developed for the analysis of intact glycoproteins and glycans using a chemoenzymatic approach for immobilization and derivatization of sialic acids. N-Glycans, deglycosylated proteins, and intact glycoproteins from heart tissues of wild type (WT) and transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mouse models were analyzed. We identified 291 unique glycopeptides from 195 glycoproteins; the comparative studies between WT and TAC mice indicate the overexpression of extracellular proteins for heart matrix remodeling and the down-regulation of proteins associated with energy metabolism in cardiac hypertrophy.

Previously, we reported that the pattern of N-glycan expression on murine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) changed toward that of the cardiac tissue during cardiomyogenic differentiation. In this study, N-glycans were isolated from human iPSCs, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), and human cardiomyocytes (hCMCs). Their structures were analyzed by a mapping technique based on high-performance liquid chromatography elution positions and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass-spectrometric data. Of 52 isolated N-glycans, the structures of 38 were clearly identified. In addition, 11 structures were partially identified because the binding style and fucose binding site at the nonreduced terminal could not be identified. Quantitation of each type of N-glycan, based on the terminal glycosylation process, revealed that the exposed N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and the nonreduced terminal fucose types decreased, whereas the exposed galactose or the \u03b12-3 NeuAc types increased in the iPSCs during cardiomyogenic differentiation. However, the bisecting GlcNAc and the triantennary structures were found in relative abundance in the iPSC-CMs in comparison with hCMCs or iPSCs. Expression of MGAT3, a glycosyltransferase-encoding gene that produces the bisecting GlcNAc structures, was higher in iPSCs and iPSC-CMs than in hCMCs. These findings will prove useful in understanding the directional precision of cardiomyogenic differentiation in vitro.\nThis study focused on N-glycans produced in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to investigate their change on cardiomyogenic differentiation in vitro. This shows that the expression pattern of N-glycans in human iPSCs changed toward the pattern observed in human cardiomyocytes upon cardiomyogenic differentiation.

However, the molecular mechanisms of the protective effect of ASI on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac dysfunction is yet to be elucidated.\nThis study was designed to investigate the therapeutic effects and possible mechanisms of ASI against LPS-induced septic cardiac dysfunction and inflammation in mice.\nMice were intraperitoneally injected with ASI (20\u2009mg/kg) for 1 week before LPS challenge (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p.).

This disease was named after Nicholaus Friedreich, Germany, who depicted the essential finding. Among ataxias, FRDA is the most common hereditary ataxia. It has the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The expansion of the GAA triplet repeat hinders the transcription, thereby reducing the level of the FXN transcript and consequently reducing the level of frataxin, a 210-amino acid protein. The disease pathogenesis is fundamentally due to a lack of frataxin, which is claimed to play a role in iron-sulfur cluster synthesis. Oxidative stress builds up as a result of Fe accumulation in the mitochondria, causing degeneration of the cells, which primarily occurs in the neurons and later in the cardiac tissues, and to some extent in the pancreas.

The patch environment can also yield increased survival. In the present study, we sought to assess the efficacy of a cardiac patch made from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to engraft and limit left ventricular (LV) remodeling acutely after infarction. Cardiac patches were created from hiPSC-CMs and human pericytes (PCs) entrapped in a fibrin gel and implanted acutely onto athymic rat hearts. hiPSC-CMs not only remained viable after in vivo culture, but also increased in number by as much as twofold, consistent with colocalization of human nuclear antigen, cardiac troponin T, and Ki-67 staining. CM+PC patches led to reduced infarct sizes compared with myocardial infarction-only controls at week 4, and CM+PC patch recipient hearts exhibited greater fractional shortening over all groups at both 1 and 4 weeks after transplantation. However, a decline occurred in fractional shortening for all groups over 4 weeks, and LV thinning was not mitigated. CM+PC patches became vascularized in vivo, and microvessels were more abundant in the host myocardium border zone, suggesting a paracrine mechanism for the improved cardiac function. PCs in a PC-only control patch did not survive 4 weeks in vivo. Our results indicate that cardiac patches containing hiPSC-CMs engraft onto acute infarcts, and the hiPSC-CMs survive, proliferate, and contribute to a reduction in infarct size and improvements in cardiac function.\nIn the present study, a cardiac patch was created from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and human pericytes entrapped in a fibrin gel, and it was transplanted onto infarcted rat myocardium.

ICT (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 10 min before reperfusion. ICT treatment at the dose of 10 and 30 mg/kg improved cardiac function and limited infarct size following MI/R. Meanwhile, ICT reduced plasma creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in I/R heart tissue. Moreover, ICT treatment not only inhibited the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 production and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level in myocardium but also reduced the increase in the generation of superoxide content and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and simultaneously increased the anti-oxidant capability in I/R hearts. Furthermore, ICT treatment increased Akt phosphorylation and inhibited PTEN expression in I/R hearts. PI3K inhibitor wortmannin inhibited ICT-enhanced Akt phosphorylation, and blunted ICT-mediated anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects and cardioprotection.

{"title": "Decorin is an autophagy-inducible proteoglycan and is required for proper in vivo autophagy.", "abstract": "We have recently discovered that soluble extracellular matrix constituents regulate autophagy via an outside-in signaling pathway. Decorin, a secreted proteoglycan, evokes autophagy in endothelial cells and mitophagy in breast carcinoma cells. However, it is not known whether decorin expression can be regulated by autophagic stimuli such as mTOR inhibition or nutrient deprivation. Thus, we tested whether pro-autophagic stimuli could affect decorin expression in mouse cardiac tissue and whether the absence of decorin could disrupt the in vivo autophagic response. We found that nutrient deprivation induced decorin at the mRNA and protein level in vivo and in vitro, a process regulated at the transcriptional level by inhibiting the canonical mTOR pathway. Moreover, Dcn-/- mice displayed an aberrant response to fasting compared to wild-type mice. Our study establishes a new role for an extracellular matrix proteoglycan and provides a mechanistic role for soluble decorin in regulating a fundamental intracellular catabolic process.", "journal": "Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology", "date": "2015-09-08", "authors": ["Maria AGubbiotti", "ThomasNeill", "HelenaFrey", "LilianaSchaefer", "Renato VIozzo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.matbio.2015.09.001"}

Signaling linking SGK1 activity to cardiac remodeling is, however, incompletely understood. SGK1 phosphorylation targets include cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27), a protein which suppresses cardiac hypertrophy. The present study explored how effects of SGK1 on nuclear p27 localization might modulate the hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes.\nExperiments were performed in HL-1 cardiomyocytes and in SGK1-deficient (sgk1-/-) and corresponding wild-type (sgk1+/+) mice following pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Transcript levels were quantified by RT-PCR, protein abundance by Western blotting and protein localization by confocal microscopy.\nIn HL-1 cardiomyocytes, overexpression of constitutively active SGK1 (SGK1S422D) but not of inactive SGK1 (SGK1K127N) increased significantly the cell size and transcript levels encoding Acta1, a molecular marker of hypertrophy. Those effects were paralleled by almost complete relocation of p27 in the cytoplasm. Treatment of HL-1 cardiomyocytes with isoproterenol was followed by up-regulation of SGK1 expression. Moreover, isoproterenol treatment stimulated the hypertrophic response and was followed by disappearance of p27 from the nuclei, effects prevented by the SGK1 inhibitor EMD638683. The effect of SGK1S422D overexpression on Acta1 mRNA levels was disrupted by overexpression of p27 and of the p27T197A mutant lacking the SGK1 phosphorylation site, but not of the phosphomimetic p27T197D mutant. In sgk1+/+ mice, TAC increased significantly SGK1 and Acta1 mRNA levels and decreased the nuclear to cytoplasmic protein ratio of p27 in cardiac tissue, effects blunted in the sgk1-/- mice.\nSGK1-induced hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes involves p27 phosphorylation at T197, which fosters cytoplasmic p27 localization.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2015-09-08", "authors": ["JakobVoelkl", "TatsianaCastor", "KatharinaMusculus", "RobertViereck", "SobujMia", "MartinaFeger", "IoanaAlesutan", "FlorianLang"], "doi": "10.1159/000430380"}

We showed the true ellipsoid nature of the myocardial capillary cross section and estimated the mean capillary diameter dcap. After correction for the ellipsoid shape, dcap was found to be 5.21\u00b11.41 \u00b5m. Effective widths of the endothelial cell and the pericapillary interstitium (is1), dimensions of importance in diffusion, amounted to 187\u00b17 and 160\u00b110 nm, respectively.

However, whether ZAP restricts the infection of enterovirus and the development of enterovirus mediated disease remains unknown. Here, we reported the antiviral properties of ZAP against coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), a single-stranded RNA virus of the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae as a major causative agent of viral myocarditis (VMC). We found that the expression of ZAP was significantly induced after CVB3 infection in heart tissues of VMC mice. ZAP potently inhibited CVB3 replication in cells after infection, while overexpression of ZAP in mice significantly increased the resistance to CVB3 replication and viral myocarditis by significantly reducing cardiac inflammatory cytokine production. The ZAP-responsive elements (ZREs) were mapped to the 3'UTR and 5'UTR of viral RNA. Taken together, ZAP confers resistance to CVB3 infection via directly targeting viral RNA and protects mice from acute myocarditis by suppressing viral replication and cardiac inflammatory cytokine production. Our finding further expands ZAP's range of viral targets, and suggests ZAP as a potential therapeutic target for viral myocarditis caused by CVB3.", "journal": "Antiviral research", "date": "2015-09-08", "authors": ["MinLi", "KepengYan", "LinWei", "JieYang", "ChenyuLu", "FeiXiong", "ChunfuZheng", "WeiXu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.09.001"}

The following study was designed to examine the effect of P. emblica treatment on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and identify the molecular targets and its underlying mechanism(s). Experimental animals were divided into four groups: control sham (CS), P. emblica sham (PS), control I/R (CIR), and P. emblica I/R (PIR). Rats in the P. emblica groups were gavaged with aqueous P. emblica solution (100 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days. After 30 days of gavaging, the I/R group underwent I/R surgery (45-min ischemia) followed by 4 or 30 days of reperfusion. Rats in the sham group underwent surgery without ligation. Left ventricular tissue samples, 4 and 30 days after I/R, were used for Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Western blot analysis showed upregulation of phosphorylated Akt and GSK3-\u03b2 and increased nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin in the PIR group versus CIR. PIR rats also indicated reduced 3-nitrotyrosine and Caspase-3 expression. Increased phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS) and upregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were found in the PIR group. Echocardiography showed increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening and decreased left ventricular internal diameter in experimental subjects compared to controls. There was decreased fibrosis in P. emblica-treated rats compared to controls.

Using a combination of mathematical modeling and in vitro experiments, we studied the failure of activation of action potentials in single ventricular cells and in tissue caused by Na(+) channel block. Our computations of block and unblock of sodium channels by a theoretical class-Ib antiarrhythmic agent predict differences in the concentrations required to cause activation failure in single cells as opposed to multicellular preparations. We tested and confirmed these in silico predictions with in vitro experiments on isolated guinea-pig ventricular cells and papillary muscles stimulated at various rates (2-6.67 Hz) and exposed to various concentrations (5 \u00d7 10(-6) to 500 \u00d7 10(-6) mol/l) of lidocaine. The most salient result was that whereas large doses (5 \u00d7 10(-4) mol/l or higher) of lidocaine were required to inhibit action potentials temporarily in single cells, much lower doses (5 \u00d7 10(-6) mol/l), i.e., therapeutic levels, were sufficient to have the same effect in papillary muscles: a hundredfold difference.

In susceptible persons, CAP sleep provokes clinically significant events, including hypertensive crises, sleep-disordered breathing, and cardiac arrhythmias. Here we explore the neurophysiology of CAP sleep and its impact on cardiovascular and respiratory functions. We show that: (i) an increase in neurophysiological recovery rate can explain the emergence of slow, self-sustained, hypersynchronized A1 CAP-sleep pattern and its transition to the faster A2-A3 CAP-sleep patterns; (ii) in a two-dimensional, continuous model of cardiac tissue with heterogeneous action potential duration (APD) distribution, heart rate accelerations during CAP sleep may encounter incompletely recovered electrical excitability in cell clusters with longer APD. If the interaction between short cycle length and incomplete, spatially heterogeneous repolarization persists over multiple cycles, irregularities and asymmetry of depolarization front may accumulate and ultimately lead to a conduction block, retrograde conduction, breakup of activation waves, reentrant activity, and arrhythmias; and (iii) these modeling results are consistent with the nighttime data obtained from patients with structural heart disease (N=13) that show clusters of atrial and ventricular premature beats occurring during the periods of unstable heart rhythm and respiration that accompany CAP sleep.

HS may play a key role in inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells in the heart, providing the reason for the low occurrence of tumor development.

After coronary artery ligation or cryoinjury in mice, Wnt10b is strongly and transiently induced in peri-infarct cardiomyocytes during granulation tissue formation. To determine the effect of Wnt10b on neovascularization and fibrosis, we generated a mouse line to increase endogenous Wnt10b levels in cardiomyocytes. We found that gain of Wnt10b function orchestrated a recovery phenotype characterized by robust neovascularization of the injury zone, less myofibroblasts, reduced scar size, and improved ventricular function compared with wild-type mice. Wnt10b stimulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 in endothelial cells and angiopoietin-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells through nuclear factor-\u03baB activation. These effects coordinated endothelial growth and smooth muscle cell recruitment, promoting robust formation of large, coronary-like blood vessels.\nWnt10b gain-of-function coordinates arterial formation and attenuates fibrosis in cardiac tissue after injury.

In cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts, H2O2-induced TGF\u03b21 expression and the phosphorylation of JNK were suppressed by luteolin pretreatment. In conclusion, food-derived luteolin has protective actions against Ang II-induced cardiac remodeling, which could be mediated through attenuation of oxidative stress.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-09-04", "authors": ["AtsukoNakayama", "HiroyukiMorita", "TomokoNakao", "ToshihiroYamaguchi", "TomokazuSumida", "YuichiIkeda", "HidetoshiKumagai", "YoshihiroMotozawa", "TsukasaTakahashi", "AtsushiImaizumi", "TadashiHashimoto", "RyozoNagai", "IsseiKomuro"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0137106"}

{"title": "Molecular changes induced by repeated restraint stress in the heart: the effect of oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban.", "abstract": "Even though stress belongs to the most common lifestyle risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, there are only limited data on direct influence of stressors on the heart. The aim of the present study was to explore selected protein signaling pathways in response to repeated immobilization stress in the heart tissue. Effects of simultaneous treatment with atosiban, an oxytocin receptor antagonist, on stress-induced changes in the heart were also investigated. Male Wistar rats were exposed to repeated immobilization (2 h daily, lasting 2 weeks). The results showed increased phosphorylation of Akt kinase, enhanced levels of Bcl-2, and decreased levels of cleaved caspase-3 in the left ventricle in response to chronic stress independently of the treatment. Exposure to restraint led to the rise of HSP-90 and p53 in vehicle-treated rats only. Stress failed to modify MMP-2 activity and ultrastructure of the heart tissue. Treatment with the oxytocin/vasopressin receptor antagonist atosiban reversed stress-induced rise in HSP-90 and p53 proteins. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that repeated restraint stress induces Akt kinase activation and this is associated with elevation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2) and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (cleaved caspase-3). These findings suggest that activation of pro-survival anti-apoptotic Akt kinase pathway plays an important role in molecular mechanisms underlying responses and adaptation of the rat heart to repeated stress exposure. The results further indicate a regulatory role of oxytocin/vasopressin in the control of stress-induced activation in HSP-90 and related proteins.", "journal": "Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology", "date": "2015-09-01", "authors": ["MonikaBartekova", "MiroslavBarancik", "MichalPokusa", "BarboraProkopova", "JanaRadosinska", "AndrejRusnak", "AlbertBreier", "DanielaJezova"], "doi": "10.1139/cjpp-2015-0096"}

NADPH oxidase (NOX) proteins produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in redox signalling, and our recent studies have found that an increase in Nox4 during pressure overload protects the heart against failure. We aimed to identify novel Nox4-driven cardioprotective mechanisms that promote adaptive cardiac remodelling.\nWe first undertook a proteomic comparison of heart tissue from cardiac-targeted Nox4-overexpressing mice and controls. The Nox4 cardiac metabolome was then investigated by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Effects on cardiac metabolism were assessed by ex-vivo working heart perfusions and isolated mitochondrial respiration studies. Ex-vivo cardiac energetics were assessed by (31)P NMR. Alterations to cardiac fatty acid oxidation were explored in primary cardiomyocytes (extracellular flux analysis).\nCardiac-targeted Nox4 overexpression profoundly remodelled the cardiac proteome in an isoform-specific manner, both in the unstressed and stressed heart. Glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation were identified as the most enriched pathways that were altered by Nox4. Metabolomic analysis showed a 2\u00b72 times increase in acetylcarnitine concentrations (p=0\u00b7002). Ex-vivo heart perfusions demonstrated a profound increase in palmitate oxidation relative to wild-type hearts (3\u00b76 times increase, p=0\u00b701), with opposite findings observed in primary cardiomyocytes with a knockdown of Nox4. A preference for fatty acid oxidation in Nox4 hearts correlated with a better energetic state (phosphocreatine:ATP ratio) when subjected to increasing doses of isoprenaline stress under baseline and pressure-overload.\nIn this study we identified a novel role for Nox4 in the regulation of cardiac fatty acid oxidation. Cardiomyocyte-targeted Nox4 hearts preferentially oxidised fatty acids for energy provision, improving myocardial energetics under stress. Enhancing fatty acid oxidation might have an adaptive role in the setting of pressure-overload hypertrophy.

Factor XIII-A deficiency causes a severe bleeding phenotype and impaired wound healing, but the cellular origin of Factor XIII-A is unknown. To identify the cells that maintain the plasma pool, we generated a mouse floxed in coding exon7 of the factor XIII-A gene (F13A1). These mice were crossed with mice transgenic for Pf4-Cre-recombinase (thrombopoietic deletion) or Cd11b-Cre-recombinase (myeloid deletion). The resultant mice were compared with a Mpl-/- (thrombopoietin receptor knockout) thrombocytopenic murine model.\nFactor XIII-A recombination was evaluated by quantitative PCR assay of genomic DNA from liver and spleen. Factor XIII-A enzyme activity was measured in plasma and platelets with a biotin incorporation assay. quantitative PCR was performed to determine factor XIII-A mRNA levels in aortic and cardiac tissue. Factor XIII-A transcripts were assayed in human umbilical blood haemopoietic cell lineages.\nSelectivity of Pf4-Cre and Cd11b-Cre mediated deletion was confirmed in liver and spleen. A 40% decrease in factor XIII-A plasma activity was observed in Cd11b mice, whereas plasma activity was decreased by 85% and absent in platelets from Pf4 mice. By contrast, plasma factor XIII-A was normal in Mpl mice. Cd11b mice showed no reduction in factor XIII-A mRNA in cardiac tissue and a 54\u00b76% reduction in aorta. A major decrease in factor XIII-A mRNA was observed in the aorta (91\u00b76%) and heart (99\u00b72%) of Pf4 mice, but there was no change in expression in either tissue from Mpl mice. In a human stem-cell study, factor XIII-A mRNA transcription increased as common myeloid progenitors committed to become granulocyte-macrophage progenitors and as megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors differentiated to both megakaryocytes and erythroblasts.\nThese results raise the possibility that a unique Pf4-dependent, Mpl-independent progenitor cell is the major source of the plasma pool.

Recent advances in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) allow for the quantitative assessment of the myocardial extracellular volume (ECV), which can be increased in conditions causing myocardial edema.

Several DTUs are known to circulate in Central America. It has been previously suggested that TcI infection is benign and does not lead to chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC).\nIn this study, we genotyped T. cruzi parasites circulating in the blood and from explanted cardiac tissue of an El Salvadorian patient who developed reactivation Chagas disease while on immunosuppressive medications after undergoing heart transplant in the U.S. as treatment for end-stage CCC.

{"title": "Wave trains induced by circularly polarized electric fields in cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "Clinically, cardiac fibrillation caused by spiral and turbulent waves can be terminated by globally resetting electric activity in cardiac tissues with a single high-voltage electric shock, but it is usually associated with severe side effects. Presently, a promising alternative uses wave emission from heterogeneities induced by a sequence of low-voltage uniform electric field pulses. Nevertheless, this method can only emit waves locally near obstacles in turbulent waves and thereby requires multiple obstacles to globally synchronize myocardium and thus to terminate fibrillation. Here we propose a new approach using wave emission from heterogeneities induced by a low-voltage circularly polarized electric field (i.e., a rotating uniform electric field). We find that, this approach can generate circular wave trains near obstacles and they propagate outwardly. We study the characteristics of such circular wave trains and further find that, the higher-frequency circular wave trains can effectively suppress spiral turbulence.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2015-08-26", "authors": ["XiaFeng", "XiangGao", "Juan-MeiTang", "Jun-TingPan", "HongZhang"], "doi": "10.1038/srep13349"}

Although the feasibility of cell reprogramming has been proven possible both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, the efficiency of the process remains extremely low. Here, we report a chemical-free technique in which topographical cues, more specifically parallel microgrooves, enhance the directed differentiation of cardiac progenitors into cardiomyocyte-like cells. Using a lentivirus-mediated direct reprogramming strategy for expression of Myocardin, Tbx5, and Mef2c, we showed that the microgrooved substrate provokes an increase in histone H3 acetylation (AcH3), known to be a permissive environment for reprogramming by \"stemness\" factors, as well as stimulation of myocardin sumoylation, a post-translational modification essential to the transcriptional function of this key co-activator. These biochemical effects mimicked those of a pharmacological histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid (VPA), and like VPA markedly augmented the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins by the genetically engineered cells. No instructive effect was seen in cells unresponsive to VPA.

This study was designed to investigate the influences of miR-497 on myocardial AR or IR injury. We noted that miR-497 was enriched in cardiac tissues, while its expression was dynamically changed in murine hearts subjected to myocardial infarction and in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCs) subjected to AR. Forced expression of miR-497 (miR-497 mimic) induced apoptosis in NRCs as determined by Hoechst staining and TUNEL assay. In response to AR, silencing of miR-497 using a miR-497 sponge significantly reduced cell apoptosis and enhanced autophagic flux. Furthermore, the infarct size induced by IR in adenovirus (Ad)-miR-497 sponge infected mice was significantly smaller than in mice receiving Ad-vector or vehicle treatment, while Ad-miR-497 increased infarct size.

Lab-on-a-chip systems may be the solution which could allow the creation of a heart muscle model, enabling the growth of cardiac cells in conditions similar to in vivo conditions. Microsystems can be also used for differentiation of stem cells into heart cells, successfully. It will help better understand of proliferation and regeneration ability of these cells.

However its clinical use has been limited due to cardiotoxic effects. One of the major concerns with DOX therapy is its toxicity in patients who are frail, particularly diabetics. Several studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to restore cardiac function after DOX-induced injury. However, limited data are available on the effects of MSC therapy on DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction in diabetics. Our objective was to test the efficacy of bone marrow-derived (BM-MSCs) and adipose-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) from age-matched humans in a non-immune compromised rat model.\nDiabetes mellitus was induced in rats by streptozotocin injection (STZ, 65 mg/kg b.w, i.p.). Diabetic rats were treated with DOX (doxorubicin hydrochloride, 2.5 mg/kg b.w, i.p) 3 times/wk for 2 weeks (DOX group); or with DOX+ GFP labelled BM-MSCs (2x106cells, i.v.) or with DOX\u2009+\u2009GFP labelled AT-MSCs (2x106cells, i.v.). Echocardiography and Langendorff perfusion analyses were carried out to determine the heart function. Immunostaining and western blot analysis of the heart tissue was carried out for CD31 and to assess inflammation and fibrosis. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS and data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.\nGlucose levels in the STZ treated groups were significantly greater than control group. After 4 weeks of intravenous injection, the presence of injected MSCs in the heart was confirmed through fluorescent microscopy and real time PCR for ALU transcripts. Both BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs injection prevented DOX-induced deterioration of %FS, LVDP, dp/dt max and rate pressure product. Staining for CD31 showed a significant increase in the number of capillaries in BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs treated animals in comparison to DOX treated group. Assessment of the inflammation and fibrosis revealed a marked reduction in the DOX-induced increase in immune cell infiltration, collagen deposition and \u03b1SMA in the BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs groups.\nIn conclusion BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs were equally effective in mitigating DOX-induced cardiac damage by promoting angiogenesis, decreasing the infiltration of immune cells and collagen deposition.", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2015-08-25", "authors": ["Hania IbrahimAmmar", "Glen LesterSequiera", "Mira BNashed", "Rasha IAmmar", "Hala MGabr", "Hany EElsayed", "NiketaSareen", "Ejlal Abu-ElRub", "Maha BZickri", "SanjivDhingra"], "doi": "10.1186/s13287-015-0142-x\n10.1007/s10552-012-9972-3\n10.4239/wjd.v5.i3.372\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.2012.01567.x\n10.1006/phrs.1999.0568\n10.1016/j.hfc.2011.08.008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243147\n10.1016/j.tcm.2011.12.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.222703\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2006.02.070\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024115\n10.1161/01.RES.0000118601.37875.AC\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0686\n10.4172/1948-5956.1000184\n10.4161/cc.11.2.18858\n10.1016/j.bone.2003.07.005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0074897\n10.1007/s12015-012-9365-8\n10.1186/s12917-014-0190-y\n10.1089/scd.2007.0217\n10.1089/107632701300062859\n10.1080/14653240600855905\n10.1152/ajpregu.91016.2008\n10.1080/14653240310000038\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.062\n10.1159/000110447\n10.1089/scd.2011.0722\n10.1016/j.jaut.2008.10.004\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.12.013\n10.1016/j.ahj.2009.12.029\n10.1161/01.CIR.57.3.549\n10.1016/S0735-1097(00)00908-6\n10.1067/mtc.2002.120716\n10.1016/S0003-4975(02)03517-8\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000151812.86142.45\n10.1631/jzus.2005.B0242\n10.1007/s00059-011-3470-3\n10.1159/000265166\n10.1038/cdd.2013.158\n10.1161/01.RES.0000135902.99383.6f\n10.1096/fj.06-6558com\n10.1111/j.1442-200X.2007.02491.x\n10.1152/ajpheart.01071.2003\n10.2217/rme.09.32\n10.4049/jimmunol.1202996\n10.1002/jcp.22322\n10.1073/pnas.1221972110\n10.1073/pnas.0706406104\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0329\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007412\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303180\n10.3346/jkms.2014.29.1.23\n10.1001/jama.2013.282909"}

However, continuum models may fail to reproduce many important physiological and physiopathological aspects of cardiac electrophysiology, for instance, those related to slow conduction. In this study, we develop a new mathematical model that combines characteristics of both continuum and discrete models. The new model was evaluated in scenarios of low gap-junctional coupling, where slow conduction is observed, and was able to reproduce conduction block, increase of the maximum upstroke velocity and of the repolarization dispersion. None of these features can be captured by continuum models.

Survival of transplanted cells was assessed using DiD-labeled hEPCs. Infarct size, cardiac function, and angiogenesis were measured 10 d after transplantation. Akt, eNOS, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expressions in cardiac tissues were detected by western blotting, and NO production was determined using an NO assay kit. The cell migration and tube formation in cultured hEPCs were determined using transwell chamber and matrigel tube formation assays, respectively. The VEGF levels in the cell supernatant were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. BK-PC-hEPCs improved cardiac function, decreased infarct size, and promoted neovascularization 10 d following transplantation. PC increased Akt and eNOS phosphorylation, VEGF expression, and NO production in the ischemic myocardium. The effects of BK-PC were abrogated by HOE140 (B2R antagonist) and LY294002 (Akt antagonist).

Guinea pigs underwent VNS implantation on the right cervical vagus. Two weeks later, MI was produced by ligating the ventral descending coronary artery. VNS stimulation started 7 days post-MI (20 Hz, 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 mA, 14 s on, 48 s off; VNS-MI, n = 7) and was compared with time-matched MI animals with sham VNS (MI n = 7) vs. untreated controls (n = 8). Echocardiograms were performed before and at 90 days post-MI. At termination, IC neuronal intracellular voltage recordings were obtained from whole-mount neuronal plexuses. MI increased left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) 30% (P = 0.027) and reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) 6.5% (P < 0.001) at 90 days post-MI compared with baseline. In the VNS-MI group, LVESV and LVEF did not differ from baseline. IC neurons showed depolarization of resting membrane potentials and increased input resistance in MI compared with VNS-MI and sham controls (P < 0.05). Neuronal excitability and sensitivity to norepinephrine increased in MI and VNS-MI groups compared with controls (P < 0.05). Synaptic efficacy, as determined by evoked responses to stimulating input axons, was reduced in VNS-MI compared with MI or controls (P < 0.05).

Asymptotic wave front propagation at maximal conduction velocity has been previously reported in the context of anisotropic cardiac tissue, but it is unknown whether this is a universal property of excitable tissues where conduction velocity can be locally modulated by mechanisms other than anisotropy. Here, we investigate the impact of conduction heterogeneities and boundary effects on wave propagation in excitable media. Following a theoretical analysis, we find that wave-front cusps occur where local velocity is reduced and that asymptotic wave fronts propagate at the maximal translational conduction velocity.

This work aimed to investigate the presence of putative pathogenic genetic variants in a broad spectrum of cardiomyopathy, channelopathy and aortic disease associated genes that may have increased these children's vulnerability to sudden cardiac death.\nWe performed molecular autopsy of 41 cases of sudden unexplained death in infants and children through massive parallel sequencing of up to 86 sudden cardiac death-related genes. Multiple in silico analyses were conducted together with a thorough review of the literature in order to prioritise the putative pathogenic variants.\nA total of 63 variants in 35 cases were validated. The largest proportion of these variants is located within cardiomyopathy genes although this would have been more expected of channelopathy gene variants. Subtle microscopic features of heart tissue may indicate the presence of an early onset cardiomyopathy as a predisposing condition to sudden unexpected death in some individuals.\nNext-generation sequencing technologies reveal the existence of a wide spectrum of rare and novel genetic variants in sarcomere genes, compared with that of cardiac ion channels, in sudden unexplained death in infants and children.

{"title": "Finite element implementation of a new model of slight compressibility for transversely isotropic materials.", "abstract": "Modelling transversely isotropic materials in finite strain problems is a complex task in biomechanics, and is usually addressed by using finite element (FE) simulations. The standard method developed to account for the quasi-incompressible nature of soft tissues is to decompose the strain energy function (SEF) into volumetric and deviatoric parts. However, this decomposition is only valid for fully incompressible materials, and its use for slightly compressible materials yields an unphysical response during the simulation of hydrostatic tension/compression of a transversely isotropic material. This paper presents the FE implementation as subroutines of a new volumetric model solving this deficiency in two FE codes: Abaqus and FEBio. This model also has the specificity of restoring the compatibility with small strain theory. The stress and elasticity tensors are first derived for a general SEF. This is followed by a successful convergence check using a particular SEF and a suite of single-element tests showing that this new model does not only correct the hydrostatic deficiency but may also affect stresses during shear tests (Poynting effect) and lateral stretches during uniaxial tests (Poisson's effect). These FE subroutines have numerous applications including the modelling of tendons, ligaments, heart tissue, etc. The biomechanics community should be aware of specificities of the standard model, and the new model should be used when accurate FE results are desired in the case of compressible materials.", "journal": "Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering", "date": "2015-08-08", "authors": ["BPierrat", "J GMurphy", "D BMacManus", "M DGilchrist"], "doi": "10.1080/10255842.2015.1061513"}

ASC injection resulted in a significant reduction in blood parasitemia, which was followed by a decrease in cardiac tissue inflammation, parasitism and fibrosis at 30 dpi. At the same time point, analyses of cytokine release in cells isolated from the heart and exposed to T. cruzi antigens indicated an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated animals. In parallel, splenocytes exposed to the same antigens produced a pro-inflammatory response, which is important for the control of parasite replication, in placebo and ASC-treated groups. However, splenocytes from the ASC group released higher levels of IL-10. At 60 dpi, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that right ventricular (RV) dilation was prevented in ASC-treated mice.\nIn conclusion, the injection of ASC early after T. cruzi infection prevents RV remodeling through the modulation of immune responses. Lymphoid organ response to the parasite promoted the control of parasite burden, while the heart, a target organ of Chagas disease, was protected from damage due to an improved control of inflammation in ASC-treated mice.", "journal": "PLoS neglected tropical diseases", "date": "2015-08-08", "authors": ["Debora BMello", "Isalira PRamos", "Fernanda C PMesquita", "Guilherme VBrasil", "Nazareth NRocha", "Christina MTakiya", "Ana Paula C ALima", "Antonio CCampos de Carvalho", "Regina SGoldenberg", "Adriana BCarvalho"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0003945\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.109\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60061-X\n10.1056/NEJMct1014204\n10.1086/526793\n10.1016/B978-0-12-385863-4.00003-4\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.067785\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.06.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176826\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.09.006\n10.1038/nri3209\n10.1155/2012/507874\n10.1186/scrt490\n10.4269/ajtmh.2010.09-0399\n10.1016/B978-0-12-385895-5.00008-6\n10.1111/j.1399-0012.2009.01202.x\n10.1093/infdis/jir840\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfp105\n10.4049/jimmunol.1003845\n10.1189/jlb.1108693\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0001971\n10.1016/j.micinf.2014.08.016\n10.5935/abc.20130058"}

Animals were killed 1, 3, or 5 days following treatment. Tumor growth and cardiac function were measured at each interval. DOX accumulation and multidrug resistance protein (MRP) expression were quantified in tumor and heart tissue. No significant difference (P > 0.05) existed between DOX-treated SED and WR groups for tumor measurements. Exercise preserved cardiac function up to 5 days following DOX treatment. Exercise reduced ventricular DOX accumulation and upregulated ventricular MPR1 and MPR2. In contrast, no differences were observed in DOX accumulation or MRP expression in tumors of SED and WR animals. Endurance exercise had no effect on DOX antitumor efficacy as evidenced by a definitive DOX-induced reduction in tumor growth in both the SED and WR groups. Although exercise did not affect the antitumor efficacy of DOX, it still provided protection against cardiac dysfunction.

{"title": "N-Acetyl Cysteine improves the diabetic cardiac function: possible role of fibrosis inhibition.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy is one of the leading causes of death in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic implication of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, an antioxidant and glutathione precursor) and the possible underlying mechanism.\nThirty five 12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were included. Twenty-five diabetic mice were induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin (STZ, 150\u00a0mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in a mix of citrate buffer after overnight fast. Mice with a blood glucose level above 13.5\u00a0mmol/L were considered diabetic. As a non-DM (diabetic) control, mice were injected with equal volume of citrate buffer. The 25 diabetic mice were divided into 5 groups with 5 animals in each group: including DM (diabetes without NAC treatment), and 4 different NAC treatment groups, namely NAC1, NAC3, NAC5 and NAC7, with the number defining the start time point of NAC treatment. In the 10 non-DM mice, mice were either untreated (Ctrl) or treated with NAC for 5\u00a0weeks (NAC only). Echocardiography was performed 12\u00a0weeks after STZ injection. Heart tissue were collected after echocardiography for Hematoxylin Eosin (HE) and Trichrome staining and ROS staining. Cardiac fibroblast cells were isolated, cultured and treated with high glucose plus NAC or the vehicle. qPCR analysis and CCK-8 assay were performed to observe fibrotic gene expression and cell proliferation.\nWe found that both cardiac systolic function and diastolic function were impaired, coupled with excessive reactive oxygen stress and cardiac fibrosis 12\u00a0weeks after STZ induction. NAC significantly reduced ROS generation and fibrosis, together with improved cardiac systolic function and diastolic function. Strikingly, NAC1 treatment, which had the earlier and longer treatment, produced significant improvement of cardiac function and less fibrosis. In the cardiac fibroblasts, NAC blocked cardiac fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis induced by hyperglycemia.\nOur study indicates that NAC treatment in diabetes effectively protects from diabetic cardiomyopathy, possibly through inhibiting the ROS production and fibrosis, which warrants further clarification.", "journal": "BMC cardiovascular disorders", "date": "2015-08-06", "authors": ["CongLiu", "Xiao-ZhaoLu", "Ming-ZhiShen", "Chang-YangXing", "JingMa", "Yun-YouDuan", "Li-JunYuan"], "doi": "10.1186/s12872-015-0076-3\n10.1016/j.diabres.2011.10.029\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00564.x\n10.4061/2011/535241\n10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.45.120403.095802\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.09.050\n10.1016/S0735-1097(00)01123-2\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000109499.00587.FF\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.07.008\n10.1172/JCI65268\n10.1186/2191-219X-2-44\n10.1016/S0894-7317(89)80014-8\n10.1152/ajpheart.91506.2007\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.06.022\n10.1186/1475-2840-12-169\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.646091\n10.1152/ajpheart.00514.2007\n10.1007/s10741-013-9379-6\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000122852.22604.78\n10.1046/j.1440-1681.2002.03717.x\n10.1139/h05-113\n10.1042/BST20140113\n10.1210/me.2010-0340"}

We have demonstrated previously that microRNAs encoded by the Gtl2-Dio3 noncoding RNA locus function downstream of the MEF2A transcription factor in skeletal muscle regeneration. We have also reported expression of these miRNAs in the heart. Here we investigated the role of two Gtl2-Dio3 miRNAs, miR-410 and miR-495, in cardiac muscle. Overexpression of miR-410 and miR-495 robustly stimulated cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation. Interestingly, unlike our findings in skeletal muscle, these miRNAs did not modulate the activity of the WNT signaling pathway. Instead, these miRNAs targeted Cited2, a coactivator required for proper cardiac development. Consistent with miR-410 and miR-495 overexpression, siRNA knockdown of Cited2 in neonatal cardiomyocytes resulted in robust proliferation. This phenotype was associated with reduced expression of Cdkn1c/p57/Kip2, a cell cycle inhibitor, and increased expression of VEGFA, a growth factor with proliferation-promoting effects. Therefore, miR-410 and miR-495 are among a growing number of miRNAs that have the ability to potently stimulate neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2015-08-05", "authors": ["Amanda LClark", "Francisco JNaya"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M115.672659"}

Here, we characterized the neuroprotective effect of PNU-282987 at the nerve fiber and retinal ganglion cell layer, determined that neuroprotection occurred when the agonist was applied as eye drops and verified detection of the agonist in the retina, using LC/MS/MS. To induce glaucoma-like conditions in adult Long Evans rats, hypertonic saline was injected into the episcleral veins to induce scar tissue and increase intraocular pressure. Within one month, this procedure produced significant loss of RGCs compared to untreated conditions. RGCs were quantified after immunostaining with an antibody against Thy 1.1 and imaged using a confocal microscope. In dose-response studies, concentrations of PNU-282987 were applied to the animal's right eye two times each day, while the left eye acted as an internal control. Eye drops of PNU-282987 resulted in neuroprotection against RGC loss in a dose-dependent manner using concentrations between 100\u00a0\u03bcM and 2\u00a0mM PNU-282987. LC/MS/MS results demonstrated that PNU-282987 was detected in the retina when applied as eye drops, relatively small amounts of PNU-282987 were measured in blood plasma and no PNU-282987 was detected in cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Modifications of myofilament protein phosphorylation and function in response to cardiac arrest induced in a swine model.", "abstract": "Cardiac arrest is a prevalent condition with a poor prognosis, attributable in part to persistent myocardial dysfunction following resuscitation. The molecular basis of this dysfunction remains unclear. We induced cardiac arrest in a porcine model of acute sudden death and assessed the impact of ischemia and reperfusion on the molecular function of isolated cardiac contractile proteins. Cardiac arrest was electrically induced, left untreated for 12 min, and followed by a resuscitation protocol. With successful resuscitations, the heart was reperfused for 2 h (IR2) and the muscle harvested. In failed resuscitations, tissue samples were taken following the failed efforts (IDNR). Actin filament velocity, using myosin isolated from IR2 or IDNR cardiac tissue, was nearly identical to myosin from the control tissue in a motility assay. However, both maximal velocity (25% faster than control) and calcium sensitivity (pCa50 6.57 \u00b1 0.04 IDNR vs. 6.34 \u00b1 0.07 control) were significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced using native thin filaments (actin+troponin+tropomyosin) from IDNR samples, suggesting that the enhanced velocity is mediated through an alteration in muscle regulatory proteins (troponin+tropomyosin). Mass spectrometry analysis showed that only samples from the IR2 had an increase in total phosphorylation levels of troponin (Tn) and tropomyosin (Tm), but both IR2 and IDNR samples demonstrated a significant shift from mono-phosphorylated to bis-phosphorylated forms of the inhibitory subunit of Tn (TnI) compared to control. This suggests that the shift to bis-phosphorylation of TnI is associated with the enhanced function in IDNR, but this effect may be attenuated when phosphorylation of Tm is increased in tandem, as observed for IR2. There are likely many other molecular changes induced following cardiac arrest, but to our knowledge, these data provide the first evidence that this form cardiac arrest can alter the in vitro function of the cardiac contractile proteins.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2015-08-04", "authors": ["MikeWoodward", "Michael JPrevis", "Timothy JMader", "Edward PDebold"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2015.00199\n10.1161/01.RES.60.2.153\n10.1007/s10741-011-9255-1\n10.1001/jama.281.13.1182\n10.1007/s00109-007-0181-6\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00775.2012\n10.1152/ajpregu.00772.2010\n10.1056/NEJM200104263441707\n10.1113/jphysiol.1992.sp019274\n10.1161/01.RES.0000099889.35340.6F\n10.1161/01.RES.76.6.1036\n10.1371/journal.pone.0009528\n10.1002/cm.20491\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.10.005\n10.1016/S0733-8651(03)00067-5\n10.1016/0735-1097(96)00130-1\n10.1006/jmbi.1995.0425\n10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.01.013\n10.1021/bi0495329\n10.1016/0076-6879(82)85009-X\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.07.004\n10.1161/01.RES.84.1.9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.190652\n10.1126/science.1223602\n10.1021/ac800337v\n10.1152/ajpheart.01314.2006\n10.1002/cm.20321\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31823ac046\n10.2217/bmm.11.100\n10.1172/JCI114495\n10.1001/archinte.1994.00420210069008\n10.1021/bi0518500\n10.1161/01.RES.86.7.737\n10.1097/00019501-200108000-00002\n10.1161/01.RES.82.2.261\n10.1007/s10974-012-9312-y\n10.1161/01.RES.70.2.302"}

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with L-NAME (40\u00a0mg/kg per day) for 3\u00a0weeks in order to induce hypertension. Hypertensive rats were administered asiatic acid (20\u00a0mg/kg per day) or vehicle for a further 2\u00a0weeks. It was found that hypertensive rats showed high systolic blood pressure, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, increases in LV fibrosis, aortic wall thickness and aortic collagen deposition (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, decreased plasma nitrate and nitrite (NOx) and increased plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were observed in hypertensive rats (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This was consistent with downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in heart and aortic tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma, aortic and heart tissues were significantly increased in hypertensive rats (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

{"title": "Generation of a Homozygous Transgenic Rat Strain Stably Expressing a Calcium Sensor Protein for Direct Examination of Calcium Signaling.", "abstract": "In drug discovery, prediction of selectivity and toxicity require the evaluation of cellular calcium homeostasis. The rat is a preferred laboratory animal for pharmacology and toxicology studies, while currently no calcium indicator protein expressing rat model is available. We established a transgenic rat strain stably expressing the GCaMP2 fluorescent calcium sensor by a transposon-based methodology. Zygotes were co-injected with mRNA of transposase and a CAG-GCaMP2 expressing construct, and animals with one transgene copy were pre-selected by measuring fluorescence in blood cells. A homozygous rat strain was generated with high sensor protein expression in the heart, kidney, liver, and blood cells. No pathological alterations were found in these animals, and fluorescence measurements in cardiac tissue slices and primary cultures demonstrated the applicability of this system for studying calcium signaling. We show here that the GCaMP2 expressing rat cardiomyocytes allow the prediction of cardiotoxic drug side-effects, and provide evidence for the role of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger and its beneficial pharmacological modulation in cardiac reperfusion. Our data indicate that drug-induced alterations and pathological processes can be followed by using this rat model, suggesting that transgenic rats expressing a calcium-sensitive protein provide a valuable system for pharmacological and toxicological studies.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2015-08-04", "authors": ["Korn\u00e9liaSzeb\u00e9nyi", "Andr\u00e1sF\u00fcredi", "OrsolyaKolacsek", "Enik\u0151Pergel", "ZsuzsannaB\u0151sze", "Bal\u00e1zsBender", "P\u00e9terVajdovich", "J\u00f3zsefT\u00f3v\u00e1ri", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3Homolya", "GergelySzak\u00e1cs", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3H\u00e9ja", "\u00c1gnesEnyedi", "Bal\u00e1zsSarkadi", "\u00c1gotaAp\u00e1ti", "Tam\u00e1s IOrb\u00e1n"], "doi": "10.1038/srep12645"}

However, most previous studies have been conducted in Western countries, and the predictors of mortality in Asian patients with AL amyloidosis have not been characterized. To address this issue, we aimed to determine the predictors of mortality in Asian patients with biopsy-confirmed AL amyloidosis.\nWe retrospectively enrolled 31 patients (59\u00b111 years, 55% men) in whom AL amyloidosis was confirmed by biopsies from cardiac or non-cardiac tissues. Of these patients, 15 (48%) met the international echocardiographic criteria for cardiac amyloidosis (mean LV wall thickness >12 mm without other causes of LV hypertrophy).\nDuring a mean follow-up period of 21\u00b120 months, 15 patients died. Non-survivors had a higher number of involved organs, lower e', and higher rates of E/e' >15, pericardial effusion (PE), low voltage on an electrocardiogram and a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class \u2265 III, compared with survivors. In multivariate analysis, a NYHA functional class \u2265 III (p=0.024) and cardiac involvement (p=0.032) were independent predictors of PE in patients with AL amyloidosis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis indicated that PE (hazard ratio: 21.9, p=0.025) and the number of involved organs (hazard ratio: 2.8, p=0.015), but not LV diastolic parameters of tissue Doppler echocardiography, independently predict mortality in patients with AL amyloidosis.\nPE and multiple organ involvement, compared with e' and E/e', are stronger predictors of mortality in patients with AL amyloidosis. The advanced disease stage of AL amyloidosis might underlie the strong association between PE and a poor outcome.", "journal": "Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "date": "2015-08-04", "authors": ["SatoshiYuda", "ToshiakiHayashi", "KenjiYasui", "AtsukoMuranaka", "HirofumiOhnishi", "AkiyoshiHashimoto", "TadaoIshida", "KazufumiTsuchihashi", "YasuhisaShinomura", "NaokiWatanabe", "TetsujiMiura"], "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.54.3500"}

While general features of the clinical symptoms and pathogenesis of salmonid viral diseases are relatively well studied, much less is known about molecular mechanisms associated with immunity and disease-specific changes. In this study, transcriptomic analyses of heart tissue from PD and HSMI challenged Atlantic salmon were done, focusing on the mature phases of both diseases at respectively 28-35 and 42-77 days post infection. A large number of immune genes was activated in both trials with prevalence of genes associated with early innate antiviral responses, their expression levels being slightly higher in PD challenged fish. Activation of the IFN axis was in parallel with inflammatory changes that involved diverse humoral and cellular factors. Adaptive immune response genes were more pronounced in fish with HSMI, as suggested by increased expression of a large number of genes associated with differentiation and maturation of B lymphocytes and cytotoxic T cells. A similar down-regulation of non-immune genes such as myofiber and mitochondrial proteins between diseases was most likely reflecting myocardial pathology. A suite of genes important for cardiac function including B-type natriuretic peptide and four neuropeptides displayed differential expression between PD and HSMI. Comparison of results revealed common and distinct features and added to the understanding of both diseases at their mature phases with typical clinical pictures.

{"title": "New insights into the acute actions from a high dosage of fluoxetine on neuronal and cardiac function: Drosophila, crayfish and rodent models.", "abstract": "The commonly used mood altering drug fluoxetine (Prozac) in humans has a low occurrence in reports of harmful effects from overdose; however, individuals with altered metabolism of the drug and accidental overdose have led to critical conditions and even death. We addressed direct actions of high concentrations on synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), neural properties, and cardiac function unrelated to fluoxetine's action as a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor. There appears to be action in blocking action potentials in crayfish axons, enhanced occurrences of spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion events in the presynaptic terminals at NMJs of both Drosophila and crayfish. In rodent neurons, cytoplasmic Ca(2+) rises by fluoxetine and is thapsigargin dependent. The Drosophila larval heart showed a dose dependent effect in cardiac arrest. Acute paralytic behavior in crayfish occurred at a systemic concentration of 2mM. A high percentage of death as well as slowed development occurred in Drosophila larvae consuming food containing 100\u03bcM fluoxetine. The release of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum in neurons and the cardiac tissue as well as blockage of voltage-gated Na(+) channels in neurons could explain the effects on the whole animal as well as the isolated tissues. The use of various animal models in demonstrating the potential mechanisms for the toxic effects with high doses of fluoxetine maybe beneficial for acute treatments in humans.

However, the functionality of these tissues is still unable to match that of native cardiac tissue and many of the stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes display an immature, fetal like phenotype. In this review, we seek to elucidate the biological underpinnings of both mechanical and electrical signaling, as identified via studies related to cardiac development and those related to an evaluation of cardiac disease progression. Next, we review the different types of bioreactors developed to individually deliver electrical and mechanical stimulation to cardiomyocytes in vitro in both two and three-dimensional tissue platforms. Reactors and culture conditions that promote functional cardiomyogenesis in vitro are also highlighted. We then cover the more recent work in the development of bioreactors that combine electrical and mechanical stimulation in order to mimic the complex signaling environment present in vivo.

Meantime, the available information on the cardiotoxic effects of ZEN is very much limited. In the present study, we investigated the toxic effects of ZEN in heart tissues of Balb/c mice. We demonstrated that ZEN (40 mg kg(-1) body weight (b.w.)) increased creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and induced oxidative stress as monitored by measuring the malondialdehyde level, the generation of protein carbonyls, the catalase and superoxide dismutase activity and the expression of the heat shock proteins (Hsp 70). We also demonstrated that acute administration of ZEN triggers apoptosis in cardiac tissue. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of crocin (CRO), a natural carotenoid, to prevent ZEN-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. In fact, combined treatment of ZEN with different doses of CRO (50, 100, and 250 mg kg(-1) b.w.) showed a significant reduction of ZEN-induced toxicity for all tested markers in a dose-dependent manner.

{"title": "Cardiovascular effects of low versus high-dose beta-carotene in a rat model.", "abstract": "\u03b2-carotene (BC), a lipid-soluble tetraterpene precursor to vitamin A, widely distributed in plants, including many used in human diet, has well-known health-enhancing properties, including reducing risk of and treatment for certain diseases. Nevertheless, BC may also act to promote disease through the activity of BC derivatives that form in the presence of external toxicants such as cigarette smoke and endogenously-produced reactive oxygen species. The present investigation evaluates the dose-dependent cardioprotective and possibly harmful properties of BC in a rat model. Adult male rats were gavage-fed BC for 4 weeks, at dosages of either 0, 30 or 150 mg/kg/day. Then, hearts excised from the animals were mounted in a \"working heart\" apparatus and subjected to 30 min of global ischemia, followed by 120 min of reperfusion. A panel of cardiac functional evaluations was conducted on each heart. Infarct size and total antioxidant capacity of the myocardium were assessed. Heart tissue content of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by Western blot analysis; and potential direct cytotoxic effects of BC by MTT assay were evaluated. Hearts taken from rats receiving 30 mg/kg/day BC exhibited significantly improved heart function at lower reperfusion times, but lost this protection at higher BC dosage and longer reperfusion times. Myocardial HO-1 content was significantly elevated dose-responsively to both BC dosage. Finally, in vitro evaluation of BC on H9c2 cells showed that the agent significantly improved vitality of these cells in a dose range of 2.5-10 \u03bcM. Although data presented here do not allow for a comprehensive mechanistic explanation for reduced cardioprotection at high dose BC, it is speculated that since Fe2+ produced as a metabolite of HO-1 activity, may determine whether BC acts as an antioxidant or prooxidant agent, the strong induction of this enzyme in response to ischemia/reperfusion-induced oxidative stress may account for the high-dose BC loss of cardioprotection.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2015-08-01", "authors": ["EvelinCsepanyi", "AttilaCzompa", "DavidHaines", "IstvanLekli", "EdinaBakondi", "GyorgyBalla", "ArpadTosaki", "IstvanBak"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2015.07.021"}

{"title": "Update on the Pathogenic Implications and Clinical Potential of microRNAs in Cardiac Disease.", "abstract": "miRNAs, a unique class of endogenous noncoding RNAs, are highly conserved across species, repress gene translation upon binding to mRNA, and thereby influence many biological processes. As such, they have been recently recognized as regulators of virtually all aspects of cardiac biology, from the development and cell lineage specification of different cell populations within the heart to the survival of cardiomyocytes under stress conditions. Various miRNAs have been recently established as powerful mediators of distinctive aspects in many cardiac disorders. For instance, acute myocardial infarction induces cardiac tissue necrosis and apoptosis but also initiates a pathological remodelling response of the left ventricle that includes hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes and fibrotic deposition of extracellular matrix components. In this regard, recent findings place various miRNAs as unquestionable contributing factors in the pathogenesis of cardiac disorders, thus begging the question of whether miRNA modulation could become a novel strategy for clinical intervention. In the present review, we aim to expose the latest mechanistic concepts regarding miRNA function within the context of CVD and analyse the reported roles of specific miRNAs in the different stages of left ventricular remodelling as well as their potential use as a new class of disease-modifying clinical options.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2015-07-30", "authors": ["MarioNotari", "Juli\u00e1nPulecio", "\u00c1ngelRaya"], "doi": "10.1155/2015/105620\n10.1002/msj.21345\n10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68074-4\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.010908.163111\n10.1056/nejm200106073442303\n10.1186/1755-1536-5-15\n10.1161/01.cir.0000441139.02102.80\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.05.008\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.09.003\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.06.003\n10.1101/gad.1306705\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.060\n10.1161/circresaha.112.271452\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.01.002\n10.1073/pnas.0608791103\n10.1126/science.1174381\n10.1073/pnas.0805038105\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.687947\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00144.2007\n10.1038/nrd3864\n10.1002/emmm.201100191\n10.1161/circulationaha.109.889048\n10.1152/ajpheart.00191.2012\n10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.057\n10.1038/ncb2441\n10.1002/jcp.24344\n10.1172/jci70577\n10.1038/ncb1274\n10.1042/BST0380242\n10.1038/ncb0309-228\n10.1038/nature07242\n10.1038/nature07228\n10.1242/jcs.069104\n10.1002/stem.1800\n10.1093/nar/gkq1027\n10.1093/nar/gkt1181\n10.1101/gad.9.13.1654\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.03.030\n10.1161/circulationaha.108.769984\n10.1038/nature03817\n10.1038/ng1725\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.01.016\n10.1101/gad.1738708\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.09.069\n10.1161/atvbaha.109.197434\n10.1073/pnas.0804549105\n10.1161/circresaha.111.260752\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019481\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.02.019\n10.1016/j.devcel.2010.10.022\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.10.012\n10.1161/circulationaha.110.982918\n10.1161/circulationaha.111.017954\n10.1006/dbio.2000.9667\n10.1038/248145a0\n10.1126/science.276.5309.81\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.24.110707.175336\n10.1089/clo.2004.6.345\n10.1038/nature08899\n10.1073/pnas.0803713105\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1186/jbiol224\n10.1101/gad.1641808\n10.1073/pnas.0804673105\n10.1161/circresaha.111.248880\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2011.02.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.244442\n10.1038/nature11682\n10.1038/nature11739\n10.4161/cc.11.5.19421\n10.1073/pnas.1102281108\n10.1016/j.cmet.2013.08.009\n10.1161/circresaha.112.300658\n10.1101/gad.1861409\n10.2353/ajpath.2007.061170\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.200451\n10.1161/circulationaha.108.813576\n10.1074/jbc.m113.538702\n10.1161/01.cir.74.5.1124\n10.1038/cddis.2011.130\n10.1093/cvr/cvn243\n10.1172/jci59327\n10.1074/jbc.m109.027896\n10.1073/pnas.0707493105\n10.1126/scisignal.2000610\n10.1038/nm.2282\n10.1084/jem.20101547\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2010.10.008\n10.1093/cvr/cvp015\n10.1161/01.res.0000013290.12884.a3\n10.1038/nature07511\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.04.004\n10.1091/mbc.e08-02-0159\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.01.008\n10.1165/rcmb.2010-0323oc\n10.1126/science.1139089\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.07.087\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.030932\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.029\n10.1146/annurev.genom.6.080604.162132\n10.1038/nm1569\n10.1161/01.cir.93.5.841\n10.1016/j.exger.2013.02.017\n10.1186/1475-2840-13-44\n10.1042/cs20130079\n10.1042/CS20130203\n10.1093/eurheartj/eht392\n10.1073/pnas.0710228105\n10.1261/rna.2414110\n10.1016/j.addr.2014.05.010\n10.1093/nar/gkr148\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.10.009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0044138\n10.1093/nar/gnh140\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.02.031\n10.1038/sj.gt.3302777\n10.1161/circresaha.111.247452\n10.1056/NEJMoa1209026\n10.1038/nature11044\n10.2183/pjab.89.118\n10.1038/nature11139\n10.1016/j.molcel.2007.02.011"}

It was particularly examined whether pretreatment with dietary fenugreek, garlic or fenugreek + garlic would be beneficial under hypercholesterolemic conditions by their influence on the tissue lipid profile. Four groups each of male Wistar rats were maintained on either a basal diet or a high cholesterol diet for 8 weeks. Dietary interventions with fenugreek, garlic and the combination of fenugreek and garlic were made by including 10% fenugreek seed powder, 2% freeze-dried garlic powder, and 10% fenugreek seed powder + 2% garlic powder. At the end of the diet regimen, myocardial infarction was induced with isoproterenol (i.p. 80 mg kg(-1)) twice at intervals of 12 h. The disturbed activities of cardiac marker enzymes in serum and the heart confirmed isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction. Dietary fenugreek, garlic or fenugreek + garlic was found to ameliorate the pathological changes in heart tissue and lipid abnormalities in serum and the heart, the beneficial effect being higher with the combination of fenugreek and garlic, invariably amounting to an additive effect. The results also indicated that the hypercholesterolemic situation aggravated the myocardial damage during isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction.

New therapeutic modalities are thus needed that will target the underlying causes and not only the symptoms of the disease.

{"title": "Partial inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system ameliorates cardiac dysfunction following ischemia-reperfusion in the presence of high glucose.", "abstract": "Acute hyperglycemia co-presenting with myocardial infarction (in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals) is often associated with a poor prognosis. Although acute hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress that can lead to dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), it is unclear whether increased/decreased UPS is detrimental with ischemia-reperfusion under such conditions. As our earlier data implicated the UPS in cardiac damage, we hypothesized that its inhibition results in cardioprotection with ischemia-reperfusion performed under conditions that simulate acute hyperglycemia.\nEx vivo rat heart perfusions were performed with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 33\u00a0mM glucose vs. controls (11\u00a0mM glucose) for 60\u00a0min stabilization, followed by 20\u00a0min global ischemia and 60\u00a0min reperfusion\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0\u00b5M lactacystin and 10\u00a0\u00b5M MG-132, respectively. The UPS inhibitors were added during the first 20\u00a0min of the reperfusion phase and various cardiac functional parameters evaluated. In parallel experiments, infarct sizes were assessed following 20\u00a0min regional ischemia and 120\u00a0min reperfusion\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0each of the respective UPS inhibitors (added during reperfusion). Heart tissues were collected and analyzed for markers of oxidative stress, UPS activation, inflammation and autophagy.\nThe proteasome inhibitor doses and treatment duration here employed resulted in partial UPS inhibition during the reperfusion phase. Both lactacystin and MG-132 administration resulted in cardioprotection in our experimental system, with MG-132 showing a greater effect. The proteasome inhibitors also enhanced cardiac superoxide dismutase protein levels (SOD1, SOD2), attenuated pro-inflammatory effects and caused an upregulation of autophagic markers.\nThis study established that partial proteasome inhibition elicits cardioprotection in hearts exposed to ischemia-reperfusion with acute simulated hyperglycemia. These data reveal that protease inhibition triggered three major protective effects, i.e. (a) enhancing myocardial anti-oxidant defenses, (b) attenuating inflammation, and (c) increasing the autophagic response. Thus the UPS emerges as a unique therapeutic target for the treatment of ischemic heart disease under such conditions.", "journal": "Cardiovascular diabetology", "date": "2015-07-29", "authors": ["BuinAdams", "Rudo FMapanga", "M FaadielEssop"], "doi": "10.1186/s12933-015-0258-4\n10.2337/diacare.29.04.06.dc05-1433\n10.4103/0972-5229.146315\n10.4239/wjd.v5.i4.444\n10.1089/dia.2010.0146\n10.1016/S0140-6736(98)07019-6\n10.1056/NEJM199309303291401\n10.1016/0002-9149(74)90089-7\n10.1016/S0140-6736(99)08415-9\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.01.041\n10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01729.x\n10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09089-X\n10.1152/ajpheart.00062.2006\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08456.x\n10.1152/ajpheart.00650.2012\n10.1016/j.carpath.2008.09.008\n10.1152/ajpheart.00765.2007\n10.1074/jbc.M100142200\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.12.021\n10.1152/ajpheart.00604.2012\n10.1371/journal.pone.0047322\n10.1111/apha.12184\n10.1002/med.20251\n10.1126/science.7732382\n10.1021/cr0502504\n10.1074/jbc.272.20.13437\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.09.022\n10.1089/ars.2005.7.538\n10.1111/j.1748-1716.2011.02275.x\n10.1152/ajpcell.00020.2010\n10.1093/cvr/cvp309\n10.1006/jmcc.1998.0880\n10.1152/ajpheart.00851.2002\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.02.049\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.11.006\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.270983\n10.1016/S1074-5521(01)00056-4\n10.1016/j.bcp.2011.03.009\n10.1006/bbrc.2002.6476\n10.1016/j.pcad.2007.11.005\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.14.1355\n10.1074/jbc.M405071200\n10.2337/diabetes.54.6.1615\n10.1007/s001250050729\n10.1023/A:1006876607566\n10.1016/j.advenzreg.2003.11.013\n10.1074/jbc.M300931200\n10.1128/MCB.24.16.7130-7139.2004\n10.1074/jbc.M501279200\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.208801\n10.1016/j.febslet.2009.12.047\n10.1111/jcmm.12312"}
{"title": "Cardiac Extracellular Matrix Scaffold Generated Using Sarcomeric Disassembly and Antigen Removal.", "abstract": "Xenogeneic cardiac extracellular matrix (cECM) scaffolds for reconstructive cardiac surgery applications have potential to overcome the limitations of current clinically utilized patch materials. A potentially ideal cECM scaffold would be immunologically acceptable while preserving the native cECM niche. Production of such a scaffold necessitates removal of cellular and antigenic components from cardiac tissue while preserving cECM structure/function properties. Existing decellularization methodologies predominantly utilize denaturing detergents which might irreversibly alter cECM material properties. To overcome potential deficiencies of current approaches, the effect of sarcomere relaxation and disassembly on resultant cECM scaffold cellularity was investigated. Additionally, the ability of sequential differential protein solubilization (antigen removal-AR) to reduce cECM scaffold antigenicity was examined. Sarcomeric relaxation and disassembly were necessary to achieve scaffold acellularity. All groups in which AR was employed displayed statistically significant decreases in residual antigenicity regardless of their degree of acellularity. AR combined with sarcomeric disassembly preserved structural, biochemical, mechanical and recellularization properties of the cECM scaffold. However, sodium dodecyl sulfate significantly altered cECM properties. This study demonstrates the importance of solubilizing cellular elements and antigenic components in a stepwise manner for production of a potentially ideal cECM scaffold and may have implications for future tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2015-07-29", "authors": ["AngelaPapalamprou", "Leigh GGriffiths"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-015-1404-6"}
{"title": "Computational Modeling of Healthy Myocardium in Diastole.", "abstract": "In order to better understand the mechanics of the heart and its disorders, engineers increasingly make use of the finite element method (FEM) to investigate healthy and diseased cardiac tissue. However, FEM is only as good as the underlying constitutive model, which remains a major challenge to the biomechanics community. In this study, a recently developed structurally based constitutive model was implemented to model healthy left ventricular myocardium during passive diastolic filling. This model takes into account the orthotropic response of the heart under loading. In-vivo strains were measured from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of porcine hearts, along with synchronous catheterization pressure data, and used for parameter identification of the passive constitutive model. Optimization was performed by minimizing the difference between MRI measured and FE predicted strains and cavity volumes. A similar approach was followed for the parameter identification of a widely used phenomenological constitutive law, which is based on a transversely isotropic material response. Results indicate that the parameter identification with the structurally based constitutive law is more sensitive to the assigned fiber architecture and the fit between the measured and predicted strains is improved with more realistic sheet angles. In addition, the structurally based model is capable of generating a more physiological end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship in the ventricle.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2015-07-29", "authors": ["AmirNikou", "Shauna MDorsey", "Jeremy RMcGarvey", "Joseph HGorman", "Jason ABurdick", "James JPilla", "Robert CGorman", "Jonathan FWenk"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-015-1403-7"}

The full-length cDNA of MnCTLDcp2 was of 1582 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 972 bp encoding a polypeptide of 323 amino acids. The complete nucleotide sequence of MnCTLDcp3 cDNA was 583 bp, containing a 555 bp ORF encoding a putative protein of 184 deduced amino acids.

This study was designed to explore long-term benefits of Levosimendan (LEVO) along with Ramipril and Insulin. Diabetic cardiomyopathy was induced using streptozotocin (STZ) at the dose of 25\u2009mg/kg/body weight/day for three consecutive days in Wistar rats. Rats were randomly divided into 10 groups and treatments were started after 2 weeks of STZ administration. A gradual but severe hyperglycemia ((\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7)p\u2009<\u20090.001) was observed in all STZ-treated groups except those received insulin (2\u2009\u2009U/day). LEVO alone and in combination with Ramipril and Insulin normalized (**p\u2009<\u20090.01) mean arterial pressure and heart rate, restored catalase, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, glutathione level and also attenuated (***p\u2009<\u20090.001) the raised serum levels of creatine kinase-heart type, lactate dehydrogenase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, and caspase-3 level in heart tissue altered after STZ treatment. Myofibril degeneration, mitochondrial fibrosis and vacuolization occurred after STZ treatment, were also reversed by LEVO in combination with Ramipril and Insulin.

With inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways as important mediators, targeting inflammation may be a new avenue for treating diabetic complications. Chalcones are a class of natural products with various pharmacological activities. Previously, we identified L2H17 as a chalcone with good anti-inflammatory activity, inhibiting LPS-induced inflammatory response in macrophages. In this study, we examined L2H17's effect on hyperglycemia-induced inflammation both in mouse peritoneal macrophages and a streptozotocin-induced T1D mouse model. Our results indicate that L2H17 exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, chemokines and macrophage adhesion via modulation of the MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathway. Furthermore, in vivo oral administration of L2H17 resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules, contributing to a reduction of key markers for renal and cardiac dysfunction and improvements in fibrosis and pathological changes in both renal and cardiac tissues of diabetic mice. These findings provide the evidence supporting targeting MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathway may be effective therapeutic strategy for diabetic complications, and suggest that L2H17 may be a promising anti-inflammatory agent with potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of renal and cardiac diabetic complications.", "journal": "Toxicology and applied pharmacology", "date": "2015-07-25", "authors": ["QiluFang", "JingyingWang", "LintaoWang", "YaliZhang", "HaiminYin", "YunzhouLi", "ChaoTong", "GuangLiang", "ChaoZheng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.taap.2015.07.009"}

Iron-overload induced cardiomyopathy is the commonest cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with \u03b2-thalassaemia. Chronic iron-overload due to blood transfusion can cause cardiac failure. Decreased antioxidant defence and increased ROS production may lead to oxidative stress and cell injury. Iron-overload may lead to heart tissue damage through lipid peroxidation in response to oxidative stress, and a great diversity of toxic aldehydes are formed when lipid hydroperoxides break down in heart and plasma.\nIron entry into embryonic heart H9C2 cells was determined by calcein assay using a fluorometer. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cells treated with FeCl3 or thrombopoietin (TPO) was monitored by using the fluorescent probe H2DCFDA. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential of H9C2 cells were quantified by using flow cytometry.\nWe demonstrated that iron induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, and that iron increased ROS production and reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Iron treatment increased the proportion of cells with JC-1 monomers, indicating a trend of drop in the mitochondrial membrane potential. TPO exerted a cardio-protective effect on iron-induced apoptosis.\nThese findings suggest that iron-overload leads to the generation of ROS and further induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via mitochondrial pathways.

{"title": "Integrative Analysis of the Developing Postnatal Mouse Heart Transcriptome.", "abstract": "In mammals, cardiomyocytes rapidly proliferate in the fetus and continue to do so for a few more days after birth. These cardiomyocytes then enter into growth arrest but the detailed molecular mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated. We have addressed this issue by comparing the transcriptomes of 2-day-old (containing dividing cardiomyocytes) with 13-day-old (containing growth arrested cardiomyocytes) postnatal mouse hearts. We performed comparative microarray analysis on the heart tissues and then conducted Functional annotation, Gene ontology, KEGG pathway and Gene Set enrichment analyses on the differentially expressed genes. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that gene ontology categories associated with the \"cell cycle\", \"DNA replication\", \"chromosome segregation\" and \"microtubule cytoskeleton\" were down-regulated. Inversely, \"immune response\", \"extracellular matrix\", \"cell differentiation\" and \"cell membrane\" were up-regulated. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) has revealed that GATA4, MYH7 and IGF1R were the key drivers of the gene interaction networks. In addition, Regulator Effects network analysis suggested that TASP1, TOB1, C1orf61, AIF1, ROCK1, TFF2 and miR503-5p may be acting on the cardiomyocytes in 13-day-old mouse hearts to inhibit cardiomyocyte proliferation and G1/S phase transition. RT-qPCR was used to validate genes which were differentially expressed and genes that play a prominent role in the pathways and interaction networks that we identified. In sum, our integrative analysis has provided more insights into the transcriptional regulation of cardiomyocyte exit from the cell cycle during postnatal heart development.

{"title": "Photoluminescent Mesoporous Silicon Nanoparticles with siCCR2 Improve the Effects of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Transplantation after Acute Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Despite the benefits of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) transplantation in cardiac tissue, detailed in vivo observations have shown that MSCs only survive for a brief period after transplantation due to harsh microenvironmental conditions, including ischemia, inflammation and anoikis, in the infarcted myocardium. Thus, new strategies are needed to enhance MSC survival and inhibit cardiac remodeling. Studies have now demonstrated that chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2 (CCL2) and its cognate receptor C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) promote excessive Ly6C(high) inflammatory monocyte infiltration at the infarct in response to ischemic myocardial injury. Therefore, decreasing the activities of these monocytes immediately after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) could be beneficial for AMI patients.\nThis study tested the hypothesis that therapeutic siRNA-loaded photoluminescent mesoporous silicon nanoparticles (PMSNs) targeting CCR2 expression in Ly6C(high) inflammatory monocytes decrease the accumulation of these cells in the infarct, improve the efficacy of MSC transplantation and attenuate myocardial remodeling.\nPMSNs carrying therapeutic siCCR2 were first synthesized without the inclusion of fluorescent materials or dyes. After AMI BALB/c mice were established, 10(5) 5-ethynyl-2'- deoxyuridine (EdU)-labeled MSCs suspended in 100 \u00b5l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the border zone of the infarct of each mouse. PMSNs-siCCR2 (25 \u00b5g/g) were also intravenously injected via the tail vein immediately following AMI induction. Control mice were injected with an equal amount of PMSNs without siCCR2. PMSNs-siCCR2 were examined in vivo using near-infrared imaging technology. The therapeutic effects of PMSNs-siCCR2 for MSC transplantation were determined at the mRNA, protein and functional levels.\nPMSNs-siCCR2 circulated freely in vivo and were cleared in a relatively short period of time (t(\u00bd)=37 min) with no evidence of toxicity. The therapeutic PMSNs-siCCR2 showed higher levels of cellular accumulation in Ly6C(high) monocytes in the spleen and more efficient degradation of CCR2 compared with the control (8.04%\u00b12.17% vs. 20.02%\u00b14.55%, p<0.001). Subsequently, the PMSNs-siCCR2 decreased the accumulation of CD11b-positive monocytes at the infarct (49.3%\u00b117.34% vs. 61.32%\u00b122.43%, p<0.001) on day 1. Increased survival of transplanted MSCs (13\u00b13/mm(2) vs. 4\u00b11/mm(2), p<0.001) and significantly decreased TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)(+) cardiac myocytes (17.44%\u00b16.26% vs. 39.49%\u00b113.28%, p<0.001) were then identified in the infarct zone three days after AMI induction in the PMSNs-siCCR2 group. Three weeks after MSC injection, significant increases were observed in the vascular density (235.5\u00b139.6/mm(2) vs. 147.4\u00b120.3/mm(2), p<0.001) and the cardiac myosin-positive area (21.7%\u00b18.4% vs. 13.2%\u00b14.4%, p<0.001) of the infarct border zone. In addition, significant amelioration of left ventricular (LV) remodeling (thickness of the LV posterior walls) (0.84\u00b10.11 mm vs. 0.61\u00b10.08 mm, p<0.001) was also observed at the same time compared with the control group.\nPMSNs-siCCR2-mediated CCR2 gene silencing in Ly6C(high) monocytes improved the effectiveness of MSC transplantation and selectively ameliorated myocardial remodeling after AMI.

{"title": "Profibrotic Role for Interleukin-4 in Cardiac Remodeling and Dysfunction.", "abstract": "Elevated interleukin-4 (IL-4) levels are associated with cardiac fibrosis in hypertension and heart failure in both patients and experimental animals. We hypothesized that chronically elevated IL-4 induces cardiac fibrosis, resulting in a predisposition of the heart to angiotensin II-induced damage. Wild-type Balb/c (WT, high circulating IL-4) and IL-4-deficient Balb/c mice (IL-4(-/-)) were used. WT mice exhibited cardiac fibrosis (evidenced by an increase in expression of procollagen genes/interstitial collagen fraction), enlarged left ventricle chamber, and declined cardiac function associated with a greater number of mast cells and macrophages in the heart compared with IL-4(-/-). In contrast, IL-4(-/-) mice had normal cardiac architecture/function while showing a 57.9% reduction in heart interstitial collagen compared with WT, despite elevated proinflammatory cytokines in heart tissue. In response to angiotensin II administration, IL-4(-/-) had reduced interstitial myocardial fibrosis and were protected from developing dilated cardiomyopathy, which was seen in WT mice. This was associated with increased macrophage infiltration into the hearts of WT mice, despite a similar degree of hypertension and increased cardiac transforming growth factor-\u03b21 in both groups. In vitro data demonstrated that IL-4 upregulates procollagen genes and stimulates collagen production in mouse cardiac fibroblasts. This process is mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 signaling pathway via IL-4 receptor alpha. This study not only establishes a causal relationship between IL-4 and cardiac fibrosis/dysfunction, but also reveals a critical role for IL-4 in angiotensin II-induced cardiac damage.

Although mechanisms for these vary, monocytes/macrophages are increasingly demonstrated to be key players.\nWe directly blocked monocyte/macrophage traffic to the heart in an SIV model of AIDS using an anti-alpha-4 integrin antibody (natalizumab). Nineteen Rhesus macaques were SIVmac251 infected and CD8-lymphocyte depleted for the development of rapid AIDS. Ten animals received natalizumab once a week, for 3 weeks, and were sacrificed 1 week later. Six animals began treatment at the time of infection (early) and the remaining 4 began treatment 28 days post-infection (late), a time point we have previously established when significant cardiac inflammation occurs. Nine animals were untreated controls; of these, 3 were sacrificed early and 6 were sacrificed late. At necropsy, we found decreased SIV-associated cardiac pathology in late natalizumab-treated animals, compared to untreated controls. Early and late treatment resulted in significant reductions in numbers of CD163(+) and CD68(+) macrophages in cardiac tissues, compared to untreated controls, and a trend in decreasing numbers of newly recruited MAC387(+) and BrdU(+) (recruited) monocytes/macrophages. In late treated animals, decreased macrophage numbers in cardiac tissues correlated with decreased fibrosis. Early and late treatment resulted in decreased cardiomyocyte damage.\nThese data demonstrate a role for macrophages in the development of cardiac inflammation and fibrosis, and suggest that blocking monocyte/macrophage traffic to the heart can alleviate HIV- and SIV-associated myocarditis and fibrosis.

The study cohort included frozen and FFPE cardiac tissues as well as blood samples from 85 Chinese children with CHD who had the cardiac operations. The right atrial appendage far from the diseased heart was used as normal control. Genomic DNA was isolated from cardiac tissues and blood samples using TIANamp Blood DNA kit. Two exons and exon-intron boundaries of NKX2-5 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced by dideoxynucleotide chain termination approach. The acquired sequences were aligned with GenBank sequences to identify the sequence variations. No somatic mutation in the NKX2-5 gene was observed in both frozen and FFPE cardiac tissues in 85 Chinese children with CHD. Nonetheless, a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), c.63 A > G (E21E), was identified in all the three kinds of DNA samples with the same allele frequency 82.3%. Moreover, another common SNP c.606 G > C (L202L) was found in 2.3% of our patients.

{"title": "Magnetic susceptibility anisotropy of myocardium imaged by cardiovascular magnetic resonance reflects the anisotropy of myocardial filament \u03b1-helix polypeptide bonds.", "abstract": "A key component of evaluating myocardial tissue function is the assessment of myofiber organization and structure. Studies suggest that striated muscle fibers are magnetically anisotropic, which, if measurable in the heart, may provide a tool to assess myocardial microstructure and function.\nTo determine whether this weak anisotropy is observable and spatially quantifiable with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), both gradient-echo and diffusion-weighted data were collected from intact mouse heart specimens at 9.4 Tesla. Susceptibility anisotropy was experimentally calculated using a voxelwise analysis of myocardial tissue susceptibility as a function of myofiber angle. A myocardial tissue simulation was developed to evaluate the role of the known diamagnetic anisotropy of the peptide bond in the observed susceptibility contrast.\nThe CMR data revealed that myocardial tissue fibers that were parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field direction appeared relatively paramagnetic and diamagnetic, respectively. A linear relationship was found between the magnetic susceptibility of the myocardial tissue and the squared sine of the myofiber angle with respect to the field direction. The multi-filament model simulation yielded susceptibility anisotropy values that reflected those found in the experimental data, and were consistent that this anisotropy decreased as the echo time increased.\nThough other sources of susceptibility anisotropy in myocardium may exist, the arrangement of peptide bonds in the myofilaments is a significant, and likely the most dominant source of susceptibility anisotropy. This anisotropy can be further exploited to probe the integrity and organization of myofibers in both healthy and diseased heart tissue.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance", "date": "2015-07-17", "authors": ["RussellDibb", "YiQi", "ChunleiLiu"], "doi": "10.1186/s12968-015-0159-4\n10.1073/pnas.44.1.1\n10.1016/0014-5793(84)80814-5\n10.1016/0021-9290(92)90069-D\n10.1620/tjem.117.289\n10.1161/01.CIR.85.1.259\n10.1002/nbm.1299\n10.1063/1.166311\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.005841\n10.1002/mrm.10346\n10.1148/radiology.198.1.8539373\n10.1002/mrm.22482\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.10.050\n10.1073/pnas.0910222107\n10.1002/mrm.25219\n10.1073/pnas.37.4.205\n10.1073/pnas.75.11.5475\n10.1073/pnas.76.5.2293\n10.1186/s12968-014-0077-x\n10.1002/nbm.3056\n10.1002/cmr.b.10083\n10.1002/mrm.22135\n10.1002/mrm.21828\n10.1002/mrm.23000\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.11.088\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.01.015\n10.1016/S0006-3495(92)81956-2\n10.1016/0040-8166(86)90016-9\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030115\n10.1038/347037a0\n10.1021/ja971623o\n10.1021/ja00757a005\n10.1002/mrm.20199\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00474-6\n10.1002/mrm.1910130207\n10.1016/0022-2828(92)93381-S\n10.1073/pnas.1211075109\n10.1002/mrm.25082\n10.1002/mrm.1910110205\n10.1002/mrm.10043\n10.1186/s12968-014-0062-4\n10.1002/mrm.21977\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.019\n10.1161/01.RES.19.3.662\n10.1172/JCI18067\n10.1152/ajpheart.00474.2009\n10.1002/chem.200204562\n10.1242/jeb.043075\n10.1309/054C-QV78-MTVF-YACW\n10.1016/S0005-2736(01)00420-5\n10.1002/aja.1001500105\n10.1242/jeb.00243\n10.1016/j.jsb.2004.12.003\n10.1083/jcb.95.3.816\n10.1242/jcs.1991.Supplement_14.2\n10.1083/jcb.32.3.557\n10.1016/0022-2836(76)90313-2\n10.1038/171059a0"}

Sur dramatically increased the parasitemia, cardiac content of parasite DNA, inflammation, oxidative tissue damage, and mortality.

When Sur and Bz were combined, the infection severity was attenuated, showing a dose-dependent Bz response. Sur therapy had a more harmful effect on the host than on the parasite and reduced the efficacy of Bz against T. cruzi infection.

High glucose exposure also reduced miR-144 levels in cultured cardiomyocytes. Moreover, miR-144 modulated high glucose-induced oxidative stress in cultured cardiomyocytes by directly targeting nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which was a central regulator of cellular response to oxidative stress. The miR-144 mimics aggravated high glucose-induced ROS formation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, which could be attenuated by treatment with Dh404, an activator of Nrf2. Meanwhile, inhibition of miR-144 suppressed ROS formation and apoptosis induced by high glucose in cultured cardiomyocytes. What was more important is that reduced myocardial oxidative stress and apoptosis and improved cardiac function were identified in STZ-induced diabetic mice when treated with miR-144 antagomir.\nAlthough miR-144 cannot explain the increased oxidative stress in STZ, therapeutic interventions directed at decreasing miR-144 may help to decrease oxidative stress in these hearts.

The endpoint of efficacy: the absolute changes in myocardial viability and perfusion of the infarcted region from baseline to four months, global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline to 18 months were measured using F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (F-18-FDG-PET) and 99mTc-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (99mTc-SPECT), and two-dimensional echocardiography, respectively.\nDuring 18 months follow-up, AEs rates and laboratory tests including tumor, immune, and hematologic indexes were not different between the two groups. The absolute increase in the myocardial viability (PET) and perfusion within the infarcted territory (SPECT) was significantly greater in the WJMSC group [6.9 \u00b1 0.6 % (95 %CI, 5.7 to 8.2)] and [7.1 \u00b1 0.8 % (95 %CI, 5.4 to 8.8) than in the placebo group [3.3 \u00b1 0.7 % (95 %CI, 1.8 to 4.7), P <0.0001] and 3.9 \u00b1 0.6(95 %CI, 2.8 to 5.0), P = 0.002] at four months. The absolute increase in the LVEF at 18 months in the WJMSC group was significantly greater than that in the placebo group [7.8 \u00b1 0.9 (6.0 to approximately 9.7) vs. 2.8 \u00b1 1.2 (0.4 to approximately 5.1), P = 0.001]. Concomitantly, the absolute decreases in LV end-systolic volumes and end-diastolic volumes at 18 months in the WJMSC group were significantly greater than those in the placebo group (P = 0.0004, P = 0.004, respectively).\nIntracoronary infusion of WJMSCs is safe and effective in patients with AMI, providing clinically relevant therapy within a favorable time window. This study encourages additional clinical trials to determine whether WJMSCs may serve as a novel alternative to BMSCs for cardiac stem cell-based therapy.\nClinical Trials NCT01291329 (02/05/2011).", "journal": "BMC medicine", "date": "2015-07-15", "authors": ["Lian RGao", "YuChen", "Ning KZhang", "Xi LYang", "Hui LLiu", "Zhi GWang", "Xiao YYan", "YuWang", "Zhi MZhu", "Tian CLi", "Li HWang", "Hai YChen", "Yun DChen", "Chao LHuang", "PengQu", "ChenYao", "BinWang", "Guang HChen", "Zhong MWang", "Zhao YXu", "JingBai", "DiLu", "Yan HShen", "FengGuo", "Mu YLiu", "YongYang", "Yan CDing", "YeYang", "Hai TTian", "Qing ADing", "Li NLi", "Xin CYang", "XiangHu"], "doi": "10.1186/s12916-015-0399-z\n10.1056/NEJMoa0908610\n10.1126/science.1228951\n10.1161/hc0102.101442\n10.1369/jhc.2008.952507\n10.1371/journal.pone.0022949\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243147\n10.1056/NEJMoa060186\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.575118\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2004.03.034\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.055\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.086074\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.04.112\n10.1089/rej.2009.0986\n10.1634/stemcells.2004-0013\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0439\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0286\n10.3390/ijms140611692\n10.3727/096368912X662444\n10.1159/000331714\n10.1097/MCA.0b013e3283640f00\n10.2174/1574888X11308010007\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0417\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-1028\n10.1007/s12015-012-9418-z\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2012.03.012\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.192663\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2006.03.034\n10.1056/NEJMhpr063086\n10.1161/hc0402.102975\n10.1097/MNM.0b013e32832b529e\n10.1007/s12410-011-9074-8\n10.1089/scd.2009.0177\n10.1007/s12015-010-9166-x\n10.1016/j.placenta.2004.10.008\n10.1016/S1472-6483(10)60539-1"}

To test the ability of engineered heart tissues to electrically integrate with the host, 10 million human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cardiomyocytes were used to form either scaffold-free tissue patches implanted on the epicardium or micro-tissue particles (~1000 cells/particle) delivered by intramyocardial injection into the left ventricular wall of the ischemia/reperfusion injured athymic rat heart. Results were compared to intramyocardial injection of 10 million dispersed hESC-cardiomyocytes. Graft size was not significantly different between treatment groups and correlated inversely with infarct size. After implantation on the epicardial surface, hESC-cardiac tissue patches were electromechanically active, but they beat slowly and were not electrically coupled to the host at 4 weeks based on ex vivo fluorescent imaging of their graft-autonomous GCaMP3 calcium reporter. Histologically, scar tissue physically separated the patch graft and host myocardium. In contrast, following intramyocardial injection of micro-tissue particles and suspended cardiomyocytes, 100% of the grafts detected by fluorescent GCaMP3 imaging were electrically coupled to the host heart at spontaneous rate and could follow host pacing up to a maximum of 300-390 beats per minute (5-6.5 Hz). Gap junctions between intramyocardial graft and host tissue were identified histologically. The extensive coupling and rapid response rate of the human myocardial grafts after intramyocardial delivery suggest electrophysiological adaptation of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes to the rat heart's pacemaking activity. These data support the use of the rat model for studying electromechanical integration of human cardiomyocytes, and they identify lack of electrical integration as a challenge to overcome in tissue engineered patches.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-07-15", "authors": ["Kaytlyn AGerbin", "XiulanYang", "Charles EMurry", "Kareen L KCoulombe"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0131446\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.1016/j.scr.2007.06.001\n10.1136/hrt.2006.093161\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.07.054\n10.1038/nature11317\n10.1177/1074248413520344\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.4061/2011/845170\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071910-124701\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300522\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.01.045\n10.1088/1758-5082/6/2/024109\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(20000405)68:1<106::AID-BIT13>3.0.CO;2-3\n10.1073/pnas.0908381106\n10.1038/nm1394\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2009.0130\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2010.0557\n10.1073/pnas.1006442107\n10.1073/pnas.0812242106\n10.1002/jbm.a.31578\n10.2217/rme.10.91\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0151\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs096\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1073/pnas.0905729106\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00740.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303613\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.03.009\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0659\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.022\n10.1089/ten.tea.2012.0286\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0341\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237206\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026397PONE-D-11-08333\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.026\n10.1073/pnas.1311120110\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071812-152344"}

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Calhex231, a CaSR inhibitor, on the hypertrophic response via autophagy modulation.\nCardiac hypertrophy was induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in 40 male Wistar rats, while 10 rats underwent a sham operation and served as controls. Cardiac function was monitored by transthoracic echocardiography, and the hypertrophy index was calculated. Cardiac tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Masson\u2019s trichrome reagent and examined by transmission electron microscopy. An angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy model was established and used to test the involvement of active molecules.

Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6- methylanthraquinone), which is commonly found in the roots of rhubarb plant, has strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its possible protective effect on the cardiovascular effect of particulate air pollutants has never been reported before.\nWe tested, in Tuck-Ordinary mice, the possible ameliorative effect of emodin on the acute (24h) cardiovascular effects of diesel exhaust particles (DEP, 1 mg/kg) or saline (control). Emodin (4 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 1h before and 7h after pulmonary exposure to DEP. Twenty four h following DEP exposure, several cardiovascular endpoints were assessed.\nEmodin significantly prevented the increase of leukocyte (n=8, P<0.001) and erythrocyte (n=8, P<0.01) numbers caused by DEP. Likewise, emodin abrogated DEP-induced increase of heart tissue levels of interleukin 1\u03b2 (n=8, P<0.01) and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (n=8, P<0.05), and significantly mitigated the change of the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (n=8, P<0.001) and glutathione reductase (n=8, P<0.05). Emodin abolished the in vivo prothrombotic effect of DEP in pial arterioles (n=6, P<0.01) and venules (n=6, P<0.001). Similarly, emodin prevented platelet aggregation in vitro in whole blood (n=4-5, P<0.01), and the shortening of activated partial thromboplastin time (n=4, P<0.001) and prothrombin time (n=4, P<0.01) caused by DEP.\nWe conclude that emodin treatment has consistently protected against DEP-induced impairment of vascular and cardiac homeostasis in mice.

{"title": "Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in heart regeneration.", "abstract": "The ability to repair damaged or lost tissues varies significantly among vertebrates. The regenerative ability of the heart is clinically very relevant, because adult teleost fish and amphibians can regenerate heart tissue, but we mammals cannot. Interestingly, heart regeneration is possible in neonatal mice, but this ability is lost within 7\u00a0days after birth. In zebrafish and neonatal mice, lost cardiomyocytes are regenerated via proliferation of spared, differentiated cardiomyocytes. While some cardiomyocyte turnover occurs in adult mammals, the cardiomyocyte production rate is too low in response to injury to regenerate the heart. Instead, mammalian hearts respond to injury by remodeling of spared tissue, which includes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling plays important roles during vertebrate heart development, and it is re-activated in response to cardiac injury. In this review, we discuss the known functions of this signaling pathway in injured hearts, its involvement in cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy, and potential therapeutic approaches that might promote cardiac repair after injury by modifying Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Regulation of cardiac remodeling by this signaling pathway appears to vary depending on the injury model and the exact stages that have been studied. Thus, conflicting data have been published regarding a potential role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway in promotion of fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In addition, the Wnt inhibitory secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFrps) appear to have Wnt-dependent and Wnt-independent roles in the injured heart. Thus, while the exact functions of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activity in response to injury still need to be elucidated in the non-regenerating mammalian heart, but also in regenerating lower vertebrates, manipulation of the pathway is essential for creation of therapeutically useful cardiomyocytes from stem cells in culture. Hopefully, a detailed understanding of the in vivo role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in injured mammalian and non-mammalian hearts will also contribute to the success of current efforts towards developing regenerative therapies.", "journal": "Cell regeneration (London, England)", "date": "2015-07-15", "authors": ["GunesOzhan", "GilbertWeidinger"], "doi": "10.1186/s13619-015-0017-8"}

CF and CMF express different levels of B1 and B2 kinin receptors, whose stimulation by their respective agonists activates common signaling transduction pathways that decrease the synthesis and secretion of collagen through nitric oxide and prostacyclin I2 secretion. Besides these classical functions, CF can also participate in the inflammatory response of cardiac repair, through the expression of receptors commonly associated to immune cells such as Toll like receptor 4, NLRP3 and interferon receptor. The activation by their respective agonists modulates the cellular functions already described and the release of cytokines and chemokines. Thus, CF and CMF act as sentinel cells responding to a plethora of stimulus, modifying their own behavior, and that of neighboring cells.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2015-07-08", "authors": ["GD\u00edaz-Araya", "RVivar", "CHumeres", "PBoza", "SBolivar", "CMu\u00f1oz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2015.07.001"}

{"title": "Simvastatin prevents isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy through modulation of the JAK/STAT pathway.", "abstract": "Simvastatin (SIM) is a lipid-soluble inhibitor of hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase with multiple reported therapeutic benefits. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of pretreatment with SIM on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats. Twenty-four male albino Wistar rats weighing 180-200 g were divided into four groups. Groups I and III received normal saline while groups II and IV received SIM (10 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days per gavage. In the last 7 days, rats of groups III and IV were administered ISO (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Administration of ISO induced an increase in heart-to-body weight (HW/BW) ratio, an increase in serum interleukin-6, and elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Serum levels of lipids, cardiovascular risk indices, and cardiac troponin I and creatine phosphokinase-MB showed significant increase in ISO-induced hypertrophic rats. Histopathological examination of heart tissue revealed focal areas of subendocardium degeneration, mononuclear cellular infiltrations, fibrous tissue deposition, and increased thickness of the myocardium of left ventricle. In addition, ISO-administered rats exhibited significant upregulation of cardiac Janus kinase, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription, and nuclear factor-kappa B. Pretreatment with SIM significantly prevented ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy, alleviated the altered biochemical parameters, and improved the heart architecture. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that SIM prevented the development of cardiac hypertrophy via modulation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription-signaling pathway in the heart of ISO-administered animals.", "journal": "Drug design, development and therapy", "date": "2015-07-08", "authors": ["Nouf MAl-Rasheed", "Maha MAl-Oteibi", "Reem ZAl-Manee", "Sarah AAl-Shareef", "Nawal MAl-Rasheed", "Iman HHasan", "Raeesa AMohamad", "Ayman MMahmoud"], "doi": "10.2147/DDDT.S86431"}

Additionally, revA mutants led to increased evidence of arthritis, with increased fibrotic collagen deposition in tibiotarsal joints. The mutants also induced increased levels of the chemokine CCL2, a monocyte chemoattractant, in serum, and this increase was abolished in the complemented strain.

We initially identified BB0744 (also known as p83/100) by screening for B. burgdorferi strain B31 proteins that bind to \u03b11\u03b21 integrin and hypothesized that, given the presence of a signal peptide, BB0744 may be a surface-exposed protein. In contrast to this expectation, localization studies suggested that BB0744 resides in the periplasm. Despite its subsurface location, we were interested in testing whether BB0744 is required for borrelial pathogenesis. To this end, a bb0744 deletion was isolated in a B. burgdorferi strain B31 infectious background, complemented, and queried for the role of BB0744 following experimental infection. A combination of bioluminescent imaging, cultivation of infected tissues, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that \u0394bb0744 mutant B. burgdorferi bacteria were attenuated in the ability to colonize heart tissue, as well as skin locations distal to the site of infection. Furthermore, qPCR indicated a significantly reduced spirochetal load in distal skin and joint tissue infected with \u0394bb0744 mutant B. burgdorferi. Complementation with bb0744 restored infectivity, indicating that the defect seen in \u0394bb0744 mutant B. burgdorferi was due to the loss of BB0744. Taken together, these results suggest that BB0744 is necessary for tissue tropism, particularly in heart tissue, alters the ability of B. burgdorferi to disseminate efficiently, or both.

{"title": "Di-Ras2 Protein Forms a Complex with SmgGDS Protein in Brain Cytosol in Order to Be in a Low Affinity State for Guanine Nucleotides.", "abstract": "The Ras family of small GTPases function in a wide variety of biological processes as \"molecular switches\" by cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms. Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2 were originally identified as small GTPases forming a distinct subgroup of the Ras family. Di-Ras1/Di-Ras2 mRNAs are detected predominantly in brain and heart tissues. Biochemical analysis of Di-Ras1/Di-Ras2 has revealed that they have little GTPase activity and that their intrinsic guanine-nucleotide exchange rates are much faster than that of H-Ras. Yet little is known about the biological role(s) of Di-Ras1/Di-Ras2 or of how their activities are regulated. In the present study we found that endogenous Di-Ras2 co-purifies with SmgGDS from rat brain cytosol. Size-exclusion chromatography of purified recombinant proteins showed that Di-Ras2 forms a high affinity complex with SmgGDS. SmgGDS is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor with multiple armadillo repeats and has recently been shown to specifically activate RhoA and RhoC. In contrast to the effect on RhoA, SmgGDS does not act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Di-Ras2 but instead tightly associates with Di-Ras2 to reduce its binding affinity for guanine nucleotides. Finally, pulse-chase analysis revealed that Di-Ras2 binds, in a C-terminal CAAX motif-dependent manner, to SmgGDS immediately after its synthesis. This leads to increased Di-Ras2 stability. We thus propose that isoprenylated Di-Ras2 forms a tight complex with SmgGDS in cytosol immediately after its synthesis, which lowers its affinity for guanine nucleotides.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2015-07-08", "authors": ["YoshitakaOgita", "SachikoEgami", "ArisaEbihara", "NamiUeda", "ToshiakiKatada", "KenjiKontani"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M115.637769"}

VEGF165 is the most abundant and predominant isoform of VEGF. This study investigates whether this effect could be strengthened by local intramyocardial injection of VEGF165 along with a novel biodegradable Dex-PCL-HEMA/PNIPAAm hydrogel and ascertains its possible mechanism of action. Rat models of myocardial infarction were induced by coronary artery ligation.

The sham group was thoracic but without myocardial infarction. The injection of VEGF165 along with a hydrogel induced angiogenesis, reduced collagen content and MI area, inhibited cell apoptosis, increased the level of VEGF165 protein and the expression of flk-1 and flt-1, and improved cardiac function compared with the injection of either alone after MI in rats.

{"title": "Biomechanical properties and microstructure of human ventricular myocardium.", "abstract": "In the multidisciplinary field of heart research it is of utmost importance to identify accurate myocardium material properties for the description of phenomena such as mechano-electric feedback or heart wall thickening. A rationally-based material model is required to understand the highly nonlinear mechanics of complex structures such as the passive myocardium under different loading conditions. Unfortunately, to date there are no experimental data of human heart tissues available to estimate material parameters and to develop adequate material models. This study aimed to determine biaxial extension and triaxial shear properties and the underlying microstructure of the passive human ventricular myocardium. Using new state-of-the-art equipment, planar biaxial extension tests were performed to determine the biaxial extension properties of the passive ventricular human myocardium. Shear properties of the myocardium were examined by triaxial simple shear tests performed on small cubic specimens excised from an adjacent region of the biaxial extension specimens. The three-dimensional microstructure was investigated through second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy on optically cleared tissues, which emphasized the 3D orientation and dispersion of the myofibers and adjacent collagen fabrics. The results suggest that the passive human LV myocardium under quasi-static and dynamic multiaxial loadings is a nonlinear, anisotropic (orthotropic), viscoelastic and history-dependent soft biological material undergoing large deformations. Material properties of the tissue components along local microstructural axes drive the nonlinear and orthotropic features of the myocardium. SHG microscopy investigation revealed detailed information about the myocardial microstructure due to its high resolution. It enabled the identification of structural parameters such as the fiber and the sheet orientations and corresponding dispersions. With this complete set of material data, a sophisticated material model and associated material parameters can be defined for a better description of the biomechanical response of the ventricular myocardium in humans. Such a model will lead to more accurate computational simulations to better understand the fundamental underlying ventricular mechanics, a step needed in the improvement of medical treatment of heart diseases.\nUnfortunately, to date there are no experimental data of human heart tissues available for material parameter estimation and the development of adequate material models. In this manuscript novel biaxial tensile and shear test data at different specimen orientations are presented, which allowed to adequately capture the direction-dependent material response.

Although the use of drugs during pregnancy should generally be avoided, exposure of the developing foetus to teratogens may occur unknowingly since these compounds may be hidden in products that are being marketed as \"all natural.\" The aim of the current study was to investigate the possible teratogenic and cellular effects of sibutramine-a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used in the treatment of obesity-on the heart and liver tissue of chick embryos. Ephedrine was used as a positive control. The chick embryo model was chosen because it has been used in studying developmental and experimental biology and teratology with great success. The embryos were exposed to three different concentrations of sibutramine and ephedrine respectively. The results obtained revealed that both compounds exhibited embryotoxicity when compared to the control groups. Liver and heart tissue of the exposed embryos was severely affected by these compounds in a dose-related manner. Morphology similar to that of muscle dystrophy was observed in the heart, where the muscle tissue was infiltrated by adipose and connective tissue. Severe liver steatosis was also noted. A more in-depth investigation into the molecular pathways involved might provide more information on the exact mechanism of toxicity of these products influencing embryonic development.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2015-07-04", "authors": ["Hester MagdalenaOberholzer", "CiskaVan Der Schoor", "HelenaTaute", "Megan JeanBester"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.22539"}

Understanding the mechanisms underlying cardiomyocytes death under these conditions can be helpful to identify strategies to abrogate such detrimental effects. Stem cell-specific proteins and regulatory pathways become important in understanding reparative processes in the myocardium. One such regulatory protein named nucleostemin (NS) has vital roles in cardiac ischemia. Although the relationship between NS and cell apoptosis has been studied, it is unknown how NS is controlled and how it participates in cardiomyocytes apoptosis induced by ischemia reperfusion (I/R). In the present study, we aimed to investigate the direct role of NS in myocardial I/R. In vivo, NS was highly expressed in cardiac tissues after I/R. Double immunofluorescent staining showed that NS located in the nucleolar of cardiomyocytes and correlated with cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Furthermore, in vitro primary rat cardiomyocytes increased NS expression induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) treatment, in line with results in vivo. Suppression of NS expression by siNS promoted the expression of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells p53 and cleaved caspase-3, which demonstrates I/R may require increased expression of NS to suppress p53 activation and maintain cardiomyocytes survival.", "journal": "In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

We report here on our work, where distinct 3D fibrous scaffolds, each of them recapitulating the dimension scales of a single fiber population in the heart matrix, were fabricated. We have assessed the mechanical properties of these scaffolds and the contribution of each fiber population to cardiomyocyte morphogenesis, tissue assembly and function. Our results show that the nanoscale fiber scaffolds were more elastic than the microscale scaffolds, however, cardiomyocytes cultured on microscale fiber scaffolds exhibited enhanced spreading and elongation, both on the single cell and on the engineered tissue levels. In addition, lower fibroblast proliferation rates were observed on these microscale topographies. Based on the collected data we have fabricated composite scaffolds containing micro and nanoscale fibers, promoting superior tissue morphogenesis without compromising tissue contraction.

However, it causes cardiac cytotoxicity, and this limits its clinical applications. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) plays a vital role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. While miR-21 is preferentially expressed in adult cardiomyocytes and involved in cardiac development and heart disease, little is known regarding its biological functions in responding to DOX-induced cardiac cytotoxicity. In this study, the effects of DOX on mouse cardiac function and the expression of miR-21 were examined in both mouse heart tissues and rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes. The results showed that the cardiac functions were more aggravated in chronic DOX injury mice compared with acute DOX-injury mice; DOX treatment significantly increased miR-21 expression in both mouse heart tissue and H9C2 cells. Over-expression of miR-21 attenuated DOX-induced apoptosis in cardiamyocytes whereas knocking down its expression increased DOX-induced apoptosis. These gain- and loss- of function experiments showed that B cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) was a target of miR-21. The expression of BTG2 was significantly decreased both in myocardium and H9C2 cells treated with DOX.

{"title": "Chick Heart Invasion Assay for Testing the Invasiveness of Cancer Cells and the Activity of Potentially Anti-invasive Compounds.", "abstract": "The goal of the chick heart assay is to offer a relevant organ culture method to study tumor invasion in three dimensions. The assay can distinguish between invasive and non-invasive cells, and enables study of the effects of test compounds on tumor invasion. Cancer cells - either as aggregates or single cells - are confronted with fragments of embryonic chick heart. After organ culture in suspension for a few days or weeks the confronting cultures are fixed and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. The three-dimensional interaction between the cancer cells and the normal tissue is then reconstructed from serial sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin or after immunohistochemical staining for epitopes in the heart tissue or the confronting cancer cells. The assay is consistent with the recent concept that cancer invasion is the result of molecular interactions between the cancer cells and their neighbouring stromal host elements (myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, extracellular matrix components, etc.). Here, this stromal environment is offered to the cancer cells as a living tissue fragment. Supporting aspects to the relevance of the assay are multiple. Invasion in the assay is in accordance with the criteria of cancer invasion: progressive occupation and replacement in time and space of the host tissue, and invasiveness and non-invasiveness in vivo of the confronting cells generally correlates with the outcome of the assay. Furthermore, the invasion pattern of cells in vivo, as defined by pathologists, is reflected in the histological images in the assay. Quantitative structure-activity relation (QSAR) analysis of the results obtained with numerous potentially anti-invasive organic congener compounds allowed the study of structure-activity relations for flavonoids and chalcones, and known anti-metastatic drugs used in the clinic (e.g., microtubule inhibitors) inhibit invasion in the assay as well.

However, it has not been clarified whether energy provision is preserved in patients with CD36 deficiency. The aims of the current study were to investigate the myocardial uptake of glucose and alterations in myocardial metabolites in wild-type (WT) and CD36 knockout (KO) mice.\nHigh-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated markedly enhanced glucose uptake in KO mouse hearts compared with those of WT mice in real-time. The myocardial protein expression of glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT1) was significantly enhanced in KO mice compared to WT mice, whereas that of GLUT4 was not altered. While the myocardial expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism did not increase in KO mice, that of genes related to glucose utilization compensatorily increased in KO mice. The metabolomic analysis of cardiac tissues revealed that the myocardial concentrations of ATP and phosphocreatine were maintained, even in KO mice. The concentration of 3-hydroxybutyric acid and mRNA expression of hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in the heart were significantly higher in KO than in WT mice.\nThese data suggest that high-energy phosphate might be preserved by the increased utilization of glucose and ketone bodies in CD36KO mouse hearts under conditions of deficient LCFA uptake.", "journal": "Metabolism: clinical and experimental", "date": "2015-07-02", "authors": ["KazuhiroNakatani", "TadashiWatabe", "DaisakuMasuda", "MasaoImaizumi", "EkuShimosegawa", "TakuyaKobayashi", "MasamiSairyo", "YinghongZhu", "TakeshiOkada", "RyotaKawase", "HajimeNakaoka", "AtsuhikoNaito", "TohruOhama", "MasahiroKoseki", "ToruOka", "HiroshiAkazawa", "MakotoNishida", "IsseiKomuro", "YasushiSakata", "JunHatazawa", "ShizuyaYamashita"], "doi": "10.1016/j.metabol.2015.05.017"}

Moreover, the functional role of SGLTs in the heart remains to be fully elucidated. We herein investigated whether SGLT1 is expressed in human hearts and whether SGLTs significantly contribute to cardiac energy metabolism during ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) via enhanced glucose utilization in mice.\nWe determined that SGLT1 was highly expressed in both human autopsied hearts and murine perfused hearts, as assessed by immunostaining and immunoblotting with membrane fractionation. To test the functional significance of the substantial expression of SGLTs in the heart, we studied the effects of a non-selective SGLT inhibitor, phlorizin, on the baseline cardiac function and its response to ischemia-reperfusion using the murine Langendorff model. Although phlorizin perfusion did not affect baseline cardiac function, its administration during IRI significantly impaired the recovery in left ventricular contractions and rate pressure product, associated with an increased infarct size, as demonstrated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and creatine phosphokinase activity released into the perfusate. The onset of ischemic contracture, which indicates the initiation of ATP depletion in myocardium, was earlier with phlorizin. Consistent with this finding, there was a significant decrease in the tissue ATP content associated with reductions in glucose uptake, as well as lactate output (indicating glycolytic flux), during ischemia-reperfusion in the phlorizin-perfused hearts.\nCardiac SGLTs, possibly SGLT1 in particular, appear to provide an important protective mechanism against IRI by replenishing ATP stores in ischemic cardiac tissues via enhancing availability of glucose.

{"title": "Gene Expression Profiling of H9c2 Myoblast Differentiation towards a Cardiac-Like Phenotype.", "abstract": "H9c2 myoblasts are a cell model used as an alternative for cardiomyocytes. H9c2 cells have the ability to differentiate towards a cardiac phenotype when the media serum is reduced in the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), creating multinucleated cells with low proliferative capacity. In the present study, we performed for the first time a transcriptional analysis of the H9c2 cell line in two differentiation states, i.e. embryonic cells and differentiated cardiac-like cells. The results show that RA-induced H9c2 differentiation increased the expression of genes encoding for cardiac sarcomeric proteins such as troponin T, or calcium transporters and associated machinery, including SERCA2, ryanodine receptor and phospholamban as well as genes associated with mitochondrial energy production including respiratory chain complexes subunits, mitochondrial creatine kinase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and uncoupling proteins. Undifferentiated myoblasts showed increased gene expression of pro-survival proteins such as Bcl-2 as well as cell cycle-regulating proteins. The results indicate that the differentiation of H9c2 cells lead to an increase of transcripts and protein levels involved in calcium handling, glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, confirming that H9c2 cell differentiation induced by RA towards a more cardiac-like phenotype involves remodeled mitochondrial function. PI3K, PDK1 and p-CREB also appear to be involved on H9c2 differentiation.

This myocardial depression was associated with a significant increase in TLR4 expression (p<0.01), MyD88 activity (p<0.01) and TNF-\u03b1 (p<0.05) concentration in the heart tissue.\nThe results of this study show that heart is capable of producing TNF-\u03b1 through TLR4 and MyD88 activation independent of classic immune system and suggest a local immune response.", "journal": "Iranian journal of immunology : IJI", "date": "2015-06-30", "authors": ["MaryamRameshrad", "NasrinMaleki-Dizaji", "HalehVaez", "HamidSoraya", "AilarNakhlband", "AlirezaGarjani"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Unstable spiral waves and local Euclidean symmetry in a model of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "This paper investigates the properties of unstable single-spiral wave solutions arising in the Karma model of two-dimensional cardiac tissue. In particular, we discuss how such solutions can be computed numerically on domains of arbitrary shape and study how their stability, rotational frequency, and spatial drift depend on the size of the domain as well as the position of the spiral core with respect to the boundaries. We also discuss how the breaking of local Euclidean symmetry due to finite size effects as well as the spatial discretization of the model is reflected in the structure and dynamics of spiral waves. This analysis allows identification of a self-sustaining process responsible for maintaining the state of spiral chaos featuring multiple interacting spirals.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2015-06-29", "authors": ["Christopher DMarcotte", "Roman OGrigoriev"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4922596"}
{"title": "A thioredoxin fold protein Sh3bgr regulates Enah and is necessary for proper sarcomere formation.", "abstract": "The sh3bgr (SH3 domain binding glutamate-rich) gene encodes a small protein containing a thioredoxin-like fold, SH3 binding domain, and glutamate-rich domain. Originally, it was suggested that increased expression of Sh3bgr may cause the cardiac phenotypes in Down's syndrome. However, it was recently reported that the overexpression of Sh3bgr did not cause any disease phenotypes in mice. In this study, we have discovered that Sh3bgr is critical for sarcomere formation in striated muscle tissues and also for heart development. Sh3bgr is strongly expressed in the developing somites and heart in Xenopus. Morpholino mediated-knockdown of sh3bgr caused severe malformation of heart tissue and disrupted segmentation of the somites. Further analysis revealed that Sh3bgr specifically localized to the Z-line in mature sarcomeres and that knockdown of Sh3bgr completely disrupted sarcomere formation in the somites. Moreover, overexpression of Sh3bgr resulted in abnormally discontinues thick firmaments in the somitic sarcomeres. We suggest that Sh3bgr does its function at least partly by regulating localization of Enah for the sarcomere formation. In addition, we provide the data supporting Sh3bgr is also necessary for proper heart development in part by affecting the Enah protein level.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2015-06-28", "authors": ["Dong GilJang", "Hyo JungSim", "Eun KyungSong", "SofiaMedina-Ruiz", "Jeong KonSeo", "Tae JooPark"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.06.005"}
{"title": "The Effects of 17-Methoxyl-7-Hydroxy-Benzene-Furanchalcone on Pressure Overload-Induced Cardiac Remodeling in Rats and the Endothelial Mechanisms Based on PGI2.", "abstract": "The primary objective of this study was to study the effects of 17-methoxyl-7-hydroxy-benzene-furanchalcone (MHBFC) on pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling in rats, as well as the endothelial mechanisms based on PGI2.\nSix weeks following surgery, rats were divided randomly into the following groups: a sham group, a model group, an MHBFC 12 mg/kg/day group (MHBFC 12), an indomethacin 2 mg/kg/day group (Indo 2), and an Indo 2+ MHBFC 12 group. The MS 4000 organism signal system was used to record the rats' hemodynamic indices. Additionally, the heart weight was determined, and the cardiac remodeling index was calculated. HE and Masson's stains were utilized to perform histological analyses; the immunofluorescence was used to observe the microvessel density of myocardial tissue; the colorimetric method was used to determine the hydroxyproline content of cardiac tissue; the ELISA method was used to measure the plasma PGI2 content; and transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the ultrastructure of the myocardium.\nA hyperdynamic circulation state, cardiac remodeling, decreased microvessel density and decreased plasma PGI2 content were each observed in the model group compared with the sham group, in which any changes in the above parameters were effectively reversed by MHBFC. Single-use Indo administration resulted in the progression of these pathophysiological changes; however, MHBFC prevented the worsening of these parameters.\nMHBFC significantly reverses pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling, and its mechanism may partially contribute to the amelioration of endothelial cell function and the augmentation of PGI2 synthesis and secretion.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2015-06-27", "authors": ["JianchunHuang", "XiaojunTang", "XingmeiLiang", "QingweiWen", "ShijunZhang", "FeifeiXuan", "JieJian", "XingLin", "RenbinHuang"], "doi": "10.1159/000430274"}
{"title": "Strategies for the chemical and biological functionalization of scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering: a review.", "abstract": "The development of biomaterials for cardiac tissue engineering (CTE) is challenging, primarily owing to the requirement of achieving a surface with favourable characteristics that enhances cell attachment and maturation. The biomaterial surface plays a crucial role as it forms the interface between the scaffold (or cardiac patch) and the cells. In the field of CTE, synthetic polymers (polyglycerol sebacate, polyethylene glycol, polyglycolic acid, poly-l-lactide, polyvinyl alcohol, polycaprolactone, polyurethanes and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)) have been proven to exhibit suitable biodegradable and mechanical properties. Despite the fact that they show the required biocompatible behaviour, most synthetic polymers exhibit poor cell attachment capability. These synthetic polymers are mostly hydrophobic and lack cell recognition sites, limiting their application. Therefore, biofunctionalization of these biomaterials to enhance cell attachment and cell material interaction is being widely investigated. There are numerous approaches for functionalizing a material, which can be classified as mechanical, physical, chemical and biological. In this review, recent studies reported in the literature to functionalize scaffolds in the context of CTE, are discussed. Surface, morphological, chemical and biological modifications are introduced and the results of novel promising strategies and techniques are discussed.", "journal": "Journal of the Royal Society,

{"title": "Effect of N-acetylcysteine in hearts of rats submitted to controlled hemorrhagic shock.", "abstract": "Pharmacological therapy is a strategy for the prevention of complications associated with ischemia and reperfusion injury that occurs after volume replacement in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of N-acetylcysteine associated with fluid resuscitation in cardiac injury in a rat hemorrhagic shock model.\nMice Wister male rats were randomly and subjected to controlled hemorrhagic shock for 60 min. and then, subjected to resuscitation with Ringer lactate. In a group of six animals, 150 mg/kg of N-acetylcysteine were added to fluid volume replacement. The animals were observed for 120 min and after this period, were euthanized and cardiac tissue was collected for histopathological analysis and measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and pro-and anti-inflammatory interleukin.\nCardiac tissue of the group treated with N-acetylcysteine showed lower concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (0.20 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 0.27 \u00b1 0.05, P = 0.014) and reduced histopathological damage and edema when compared to the group whose volume replacement occurred only with Ringer lactate. There was no difference in the expression of cytokines interleukin 6 (2,138.29 \u00b1 316.89 vs. 1,870.16 \u00b1 303.68, P = 0.091) and interleukin 10 (1.019,83 \u00b1 262,50 vs. 848.60 \u00b1 106.5, P = 0.169) between the treated groups.\nThe association of N-acetylcysteine on volume replacement attenuates oxidative stress in the heart, as well myocardial damage and edema, but does not modify the expression of inflammatory cytokines.\nA terapia farmacol\u00f3gica \u00e9 uma estrat\u00e9gia de preven\u00e7\u00e3o das complica\u00e7\u00f5es associadas \u00e0 les\u00e3o de isquemia e reperfus\u00e3o tecidual que ocorre ap\u00f3s a reposi\u00e7\u00e3o vol\u00eamica no tratamento do choque hemorr\u00e1gico.\nO objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a repercuss\u00e3o da N-acetilciste\u00edna associada \u00e0 reposi\u00e7\u00e3o vol\u00eamica na les\u00e3o card\u00edaca em modelo de choque hemorr\u00e1gico em ratos.\nRatos Wistar, machos, foram randomizados e submetidos ao choque hemorr\u00e1gico controlado por 60 minutos e, depois, submetidos \u00e0 reposi\u00e7\u00e3o vol\u00eamica com Ringer Lactato.

{"title": "Deciphering the Epigenetic Code of Cardiac Myocyte Transcription.", "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms are crucial for cell identity and transcriptional control. The heart consists of different cell types, including cardiac myocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and others. Therefore, cell type-specific analysis is needed to gain mechanistic insight into the regulation of gene expression in cardiac myocytes. Although cytosolic mRNA represents steady-state levels, nuclear mRNA more closely reflects transcriptional activity. To unravel epigenetic mechanisms of transcriptional control, cell type-specific analysis of nuclear mRNA and epigenetic modifications is crucial.\nThe aim was to purify cardiac myocyte nuclei from hearts of different species by magnetic- or fluorescent-assisted sorting and to determine the nuclear and cellular RNA expression profiles and epigenetic marks in a cardiac myocyte-specific manner.\nFrozen cardiac tissue samples were used to isolate cardiac myocyte nuclei. High sorting purity was confirmed for cardiac myocyte nuclei isolated from mice, rats, and humans. Deep sequencing of nuclear RNA revealed a major fraction of nascent, unspliced RNA in contrast to results obtained from purified cardiac myocytes. Cardiac myocyte nuclear and cellular RNA expression profiles showed differences, especially for metabolic genes. Genome-wide maps of the transcriptional elongation mark H3K36me3 were generated by chromatin-immunoprecipitation. Transcriptome and epigenetic data confirmed the high degree of cardiac myocyte-specificity of our protocol. An integrative analysis of nuclear mRNA and histone mark occurrence indicated a major impact of the chromatin state on transcriptional activity in cardiac myocytes.\nThis study establishes cardiac myocyte-specific sorting of nuclei as a universal method to investigate epigenetic and transcriptional processes in cardiac myocytes of different origins. These data sets provide novel insight into cardiac myocyte transcription.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2015-06-25", "authors": ["SebastianPreissl", "MartinSchwaderer", "AlexandraRaulf", "MichaelHesse", "Bj\u00f6rn AGr\u00fcning", "ClaudiaK\u00f6bele", "RolfBackofen", "Bernd KFleischmann", "LutzHein", "RalfGilsbach"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306337"}

{"title": "BMP protein-mediated crosstalk between inflammatory cells and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Following cardiac injury, the ischaemic heart tissue is characterized by the invasion of pro-inflammatory (M1) and pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Any engineered cardiac tissue will inevitably interact with the inflammatory environment found at the site of myocardial infarction at the time of implantation. However, the interactions between the inflammatory and the cardiac repair cells remain poorly understood. Here we recapitulated in vitro some of the important cellular events found at the site of myocardial injury, such as macrophage recruitment and their effect on cardiac differentiation and maturation, by taking into account the involvement of paracrine-mediated signalling. By using a 3D inverted invasion assay, we found that cardiomyocyte (CM) conditioned medium can trigger the recruitment of pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages, through a mechanism that involves, in part, CM-derived BMP4. Pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages were also found to affect CM proliferation and differentiation potential, in part due to BMP molecules secreted by macrophages. These effects involved the activation of the canonical outside-in signalling pathways, such as SMAD1,5,8, which are known to be activated during myocardial injury in vivo. In the present study we propose a new role for CM- and macrophage-derived BMP proteins during the recruitment of macrophage subtypes and the maturation of repair cells, representing an important step towards creating a functional cardiac patch with superior therapeutic properties.

This mycotoxin is suspected to affect several organs including kidney and liver. However, its toxic effect on heart remains unknown. The present study investigated for the first time the cardiotoxic effect of PAT in mice. We demonstrated that PAT increased creatinin phosphokinase (CPK) level, induced lipoperoxydation and protein oxidation, and triggered the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. We also demonstrated that acute administration of PAT triggers apoptosis via P53 overexpression and caspase 3 activation. We further investigated the antioxidant efficiency of crocin (CRO), a carotenoid pigment, against PAT-induced cardiotoxicity. We found that pretreatment with CRO prevents cardiac impairment by reducing CPK levels, restoring the redox statute and suppressing apoptosis.

The effects of genistein on blood glucose, % glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF- \u03b1), transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b21), and total antioxidant were studied. Ultrastructural and histopathological assessment of injury were also undertaken using transmission electron microscope. STZ-induced diabetes resulted in significant increase in the levels of blood glucose, HbA1c, C-reactive protein, TNF- \u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21, and a decline in total antioxidant reserve of the myocardium. Administration of genistein to diabetic rats resulted in a decrease in blood glucose (p < 0.001), % HbA1c (p < 0.0001), C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), and expression of TNF- \u03b1 (p < 0.001) and TGF-\u03b21 (p < 0.0001) proteins. In addition, genistein treatment results in augmentation of total antioxidant (p < 0.01) reserve of the hearts. The above findings were supported by histological as well as immunohistochemical localization of NF-\u03baB (p65) in the heart. Genistein treatment ameliorated the ultrastructural degenerative changes in the cardiac tissues as compared to the diabetic control.

{"title": "In Vivo Protective Effects of Diosgenin against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) induces oxidative stress leading to cardiotoxicity. Diosgenin, a steroidal saponin of Dioscorea opposita, has been reported to have antioxidant activity. Our study was aimed to find out the protective effect of diosgenin against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. DOX treatment led to a significant decrease in the ratio of heart weight to body weight, and increases in the blood pressure and the serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and creatine kinase myocardial bound (CK-MB), markers of cardiotoxicity. In the heart tissue of the DOX-treated mice, DOX reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), were recovered by diosgenin. Diosgenin also decreased the serum levels of cardiotoxicity markers, cardiac levels of thiobarbituric acid relative substances (TBARS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), caspase-3 activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), an inflammatory factor. Moreover, diosgenin had the effects of increasing the cardiac levels of cGMP via modulation of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) activity, and in improving myocardial fibrosis in the DOX-treated mice. Molecular data showed that the protective effects of diosgenin might be mediated via regulation of protein kinase A (PKA) and p38.

{"title": "Trypanosoma cruzi Infection through the Oral Route Promotes a Severe Infection in Mice: New Disease Form from an Old Infection?", "abstract": "Oral transmission of Chagas disease has been documented in Latin American countries. Nevertheless, significant studies on the pathophysiology of this form of infection are largely lacking. The few studies investigating oral route infection disregard that inoculation in the oral cavity (Oral infection, OI) or by gavage (Gastrointestinal infection, GI) represent different infection routes, yet both show clear-cut parasitemia and heart parasitism during the acute infection. Herein, BALB/c mice were subjected to acute OI or GI infection using 5x10(4) culture-derived Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes. OI mice displayed higher parasitemia and mortality rates than their GI counterparts. Heart histopathology showed larger areas of infiltration in the GI mice, whereas liver lesions were more severe in the OI animals, accompanied by higher Alanine Transaminase and Aspartate Transaminase serum contents. A differential cytokine pattern was also observed because OI mice presented higher pro-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-\u03b3, TNF) serum levels than GI animals. Real-time PCR confirmed a higher TNF, IFN-\u03b3, as well as IL-10 expression in the cardiac tissue from the OI group compared with GI. Conversely, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-17 serum levels were greater in the GI animals. Immunolabeling revealed macrophages as the main tissue source of TNF in infected mice. The high mortality rate observed in the OI mice paralleled the TNF serum rise, with its inhibition by an anti-TNF treatment. Moreover, differences in susceptibility between GI versus OI mice were more clearly related to the host response than to the effect of gastric pH on parasites, since infection in magnesium hydroxide-treated mice showed similar results. Overall, the present study provides conclusive evidence that the initial site of parasite entrance critically affects host immune response and disease outcome.

Cystatins are thiol protease inhibitors and found to be involved in various important physiological processes. Functional inactivation of BHC was observed upon crowding, which varied as a function of concentration and molecular weight of crowding agents as well as incubation time. Structural changes of BHC at tertiary and secondary level were detected with the help of fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. CD analysis showed changes of \u03b1-helix to \u03b2-sheet, which could be due to aggregation. The ANS-fluorescence study suggested the unfolding and presence of some partially folded intermediates. Increase in ThT-fluorescence and absorption of Congo red spectra with red shift, confirmed the amyloid type aggregation of BHC in the presence of various crowding agents. Finally, electron microscopy provided the physical evidence about the formation of amyloid fibrils.

Their suitability for such roles may seem obvious, but assessments of their contractile behavior suggest that they have not achieved a completely mature cardiac muscle phenotype.

In this commentary, we review evidence that supports this hypothesis and discuss prospects for ultimately generating engineered heart tissue specimens that behave similarly to adult human myocardium.

{"title": "Crosstalk of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts in co-cultures.", "abstract": "Electromechanical function of cardiac muscle depends critically on the crosstalk of myocytes with non-myocytes. Upon cardiac fibrosis, fibroblasts translocate into infarcted necrotic tissue and alter their communication capabilities. In the present in vitro study, we determined a multiple parameter space relevant for fibrotic cardiac tissue development comprising the following essential processes: (i) adhesion to substrates with varying elasticity, (ii) dynamics of contractile function, and (iii) electromechanical connectivity. By combining electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) with conventional optical microscopy, we could measure the impact of fibroblast-cardiomyocyte ratio on the aforementioned parameters in a non-invasive fashion. Adhesion to electrodes was quantified via spreading rates derived from impedance changes, period analysis allowed us to measure contraction dynamics and modulations of the barrier resistance served as a measure of connectivity.

(ii) Beat frequency decreases nonlinearly with increasing fraction of fibroblasts, while (iii) the intercellular resistance increases with a maximal functional connectivity at 75% fibroblasts.

Recent studies have injected dissociated, suspended cardiac cells into coronary arteries to restore function with limited results attributed to poor cell retention and cell death. Extracellular matrix (ECM) injected into damaged cardiac tissue sites show some promising effects. However, combined use of human cardiac ECM and cardiac cells may produce superior benefits to restore cardiac function.\nThis study was designed to assess use of new three-dimensional human heart ECM-derived scaffolds to serve as vehicles to deliver cardiac-derived cells directly to damaged heart tissue and improve cell retention at these sites while also providing biomechanical support and attracting host cell recruitment.\nECM-derived porous protein scaffolds were fabricated from human heart tissues. These scaffolds were designed to carry, actively promote and preserve cardiac cell phenotype, viability and functional retention in tissue sites. ECM scaffolds were optimized and were seeded with human cardiomyocytes, cultured and subsequently implanted ex vivo onto infarcted murine epicardium. Seeded human cardiomyocytes readily adhered to human cardiac-derived ECM scaffolds and maintained representative phenotypes including expression of cardiomyocyte-specific markers, and remained electrically synchronous within the scaffold in vitro. Ex vivo, cardiomyocyte-seeded ECM scaffolds spontaneously adhered and incorporated into murine ventricle.\nDecellularized human cardiac tissue-derived 3D ECM scaffolds are effective delivery vehicles for human cardiac cells to directly target ischemic heart tissue and warrant further studies to assess their therapeutic potential in restoring essential cardiac functions.", "journal": "Journal of translational medicine", "date": "2015-06-19", "authors": ["DollyHolt-Casper", "Jeff MTheisen", "Alonso PMoreno", "MarkWarren", "FranciscoSilva", "David WGrainger", "David ABull", "Amit NPatel"], "doi": "10.1186/s12967-015-0559-0\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31828124ad\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.5966/sctm.2012-0030\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60195-0\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61590-0\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000034046.87607.1C\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.028\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.09.004\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.208991\n10.1152/ajpheart.00768.2011\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000163546.27639.AA\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.812693\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.000521\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0143\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.03.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.084343\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0659\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.927293\n10.1126/science.1177350\n10.1016/j.lfs.2012.08.034\n10.1016/j.lfs.2010.07.010\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0425\n10.1371/journal.pone.0013039\n10.1038/nm1619\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.08.037\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.045\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.888\n10.3727/000000006783982368\n10.1159/000331400\n10.1002/jbm.a.35000\n10.1007/s12265-011-9304-0\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.06.052\n10.1016/j.addr.2010.03.001\n10.1007/s12265-011-9304-0\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0061\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.519\n10.1002/jbm.b.31711\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.057\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.080\n10.1016/0925-4773(93)90015-P\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfn009\n10.1007/s13239-013-0167-1\n10.1002/jbm.10167\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00630-6\n10.1006/bbrc.2001.4321\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19990905)64:5<580::AID-BIT8>3.0.CO;2-X\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.2174/138161209788923822\n10.1007/s10856-010-3986-8\n10.1073/pnas.71.12.4826\n10.1002/stem.1595\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026397\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.04.017\n10.1111/j.1525-1594.2005.29020.x\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101"}

But what bridges the remote organ insult and the cardioprotective effect in heart remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to found that whether TRPV1 may mediate the cardioprotective effect from remote organ to heart and the role of CGRP and SP in this process. We found that RIPostC effectively ameliorated cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury in terms of limiting infarct size, lowering CK and cTnI release and improving cardiac function. In addition, these cardioprotective effects could be significantly abolished by inhibition of either CGRP or SP receptors with corresponding antagonists (CGRP8-37 for CGRP and RP-67580 for SP) injected before reperfusion. Besides, RIPostC resulted in significantly increase in the levels of CGRP and SP in plasma and hearts, as well as the levels and mRNA expression of CGRP and SP in DRG. The increase in CGRP and SP levels in plasma and hearts were markedly inhibited by TRPV1 receptor antagonist capsazepine. These findings indicate that limb remote ischemic postconditioning could attenuate cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats, and the cardioprotective mechanism is via TRPV1-mediated upregulation of CGRP and SP, which could subsequently act on their corresponding receptors in heart tissue.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2015-06-17", "authors": ["YuanfengGao", "JunxianSong", "HongChen", "ChengfuCao", "ChongyouLee"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.06.054"}

{"title": "A New Paradigm in Cardiac Regeneration: The Mesenchymal Stem Cell Secretome.", "abstract": "The potentialities to apply mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in regenerative medicine have been extensively studied over the last decades. In the cardiovascular disease (CVD) field, MSCs-based therapy is the subject of great expectations. Its therapeutic potential has been already shown in several preclinical models and both the safety and efficacy of MSCs-based therapy are being evaluated in humans. It is now clear that the predominant mechanism by which MSCs participate in heart tissue repair is through a paracrine activity.

{"title": "Genetic variants associated with risk of atrial fibrillation regulate expression of PITX2, CAV1, MYOZ1, C9orf3 and FANCC.", "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants in a number of chromosomal regions that are associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). The mechanisms underlying these associations are unknown, but are likely to involve effects of the risk haplotypes on expression of neighbouring genes. To investigate the association between genetic variants at AF-associated loci and expression of nearby candidate genes in human atrial tissue and peripheral blood. Right atrial appendage (RAA) samples were collected from 122 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, of these, 12 patients also had left atrial appendage samples taken. 22 patients had a history of AF. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 405 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterisation. In order to tag genetic variation at each of nine loci, a total of 367 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using the Sequenom platform. Total expression of 16 candidate genes in the nine AF-associated regions was measured by quantitative PCR. The relative expression of each allele of the candidate genes was measured on the Sequenom platform using one or more transcribed SNPs to distinguish between alleles in heterozygotes. We tested association between the SNPs of interest and gene expression using total gene expression (integrating cis and trans acting sources of variation), and allelic expression ratios (specific for cis acting influences), in atrial tissue and peripheral blood. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using a Bonferroni approach. In subsidiary analyses, we compared the expression of candidate genes between patients with and without a history of AF. Total expression of 15 transcripts of 14 genes and allelic expression ratio of 14 transcripts of 14 genes in genomic regions associated with AF were measured in right atrial appendage tissue. 8 of these transcripts were also expressed in peripheral blood. Risk alleles at AF-associated SNPs were associated in cis with an increased expression of PITX2a (2.01-fold, p=6.5\u00d710(-4)); and with decreased expression of MYOZ1 (0.39 fold; p=5.5\u00d710(-15)), CAV1 (0.89 fold; p=5.9\u00d710(-8)), C9orf3 (0.91 fold; 1.5\u00d710(-5)), and FANCC (0.94-fold; p=8.9\u00d710(-8)) in right atrial appendage. Of these five genes, only CAV1 was expressed in peripheral blood; association between the same AF risk alleles and lower expression of CAV1 was confirmed (0.91 fold decrease; p=4.2\u00d710(-5)). A history of AF was also associated with a decrease in expression of CAV1 in both right and left atria (0.84 and 0.85 fold, respectively; p=0.03), congruent with the magnitude of the effect of the risk SNP on expression, and independent of genotype. The analyses in peripheral blood showed association between AF risk SNPs and decreased expression of KCNN3 (0.85-fold; p=2.1\u00d710(-4)); and increased expression of SYNE2 (1.12-fold; p=7.5\u00d710(-24)); however, these associations were not detectable in atrial tissue. We identified novel cis-acting associations in atrial tissue between AF risk SNPs and increased expression of PITX2a/b; and decreased expression of CAV1 (an association also seen in peripheral blood), C9orf3 and FANCC. We also confirmed a previously described association between AF risk variants and MYOZ1 expression. Analyses of peripheral blood illustrated tissue-specificity of cardiac eQTLs and highlight the need for larger-scale genome-wide eQTL studies in cardiac tissue. Our results suggest novel aetiological roles for genes in four AF-associated genomic regions.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2015-06-16", "authors": ["Ruairidh I RMartin", "Mahsa SheikhaliBabaei", "Mun-KitChoy", "W AndrewOwens", "Timothy J AChico", "DanielKeenan", "NizarYonan", "Mauro Santib\u00e1\u00f1ezKoref", "Bernard DKeavney"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.06.005"}
{"title": "The Quest for the Adult Cardiac Stem Cell.", "abstract": "Over the past 2 decades, cardiac regeneration has evolved from an exotic fringe of cardiovascular biology to the forefront of molecular, genetic, epigenetic, translational, and clinical investigations. The unmet patient need is the paucity of self-repair following infarction. Robust regeneration seen in models such as zebrafish and newborn mice has inspired the field, along with encouragement from modern methods that make even low levels of restorative growth discernible, changing the scientific and technical landscape for effective counter-measures. Approaches under study to augment cardiac repair complement each other, and encompass grafting cells of diverse kinds, restarting the cell cycle in post-mitotic ventricular myocytes, reprogramming non-myocytes, and exploiting the dormant progenitor/stem cells that lurk within the adult heart. The latter are the emphasis of the present review. Cardiac-resident stem cells (CSC) can be harvested from heart tissue, expanded, and delivered to the myocardium as a therapeutic product, whose benefits may be hoped to surpass those achieved in human trials of bone marrow. However, important questions are prompted by such cells' discovery. How do they benefit recipient hearts? Do they contribute, measurably, as an endogenous population, to self-repair? Even if \"no,\" might CSCs be targets for activation in situ by growth factors and other developmental catalysts? And, what combination of distinguishing markers best demarcates the cells with robust clonal growth and cardiogenic potential?", "journal": "Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society", "date": "2015-06-16", "authors": ["MichelaNoseda", "MartaAbreu-Paiva", "Michael DSchneider"], "doi": "10.1253/circj.CJ-15-0557"}

The cellular DAD amplitude was varied by changing the strength of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release. Random DAD latency and amplitude in different cells were simulated using gaussian distributions.\nDepending on the strength of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and other conditions, random DADs in cardiac tissue resulted in the following behaviors: (1) triggered activity (TA); (2) a vulnerable tissue substrate causing unidirectional conduction block and reentry by inactivating sodium channels; (3) both triggers and a vulnerable substrate simultaneously by generating TA in regions next to regions with subthreshold DADs susceptible to unidirectional conduction block and reentry. The probability of the latter 2 behaviors was enhanced by reduced sodium channel availability, reduced gap junction coupling, increased tissue heterogeneity, and less synchronous DAD latency.\nDADs can self-organize in tissue to generate arrhythmia triggers, a vulnerable tissue substrate, and both simultaneously. Reduced sodium channel availability and gap junction coupling potentiate this mechanism of arrhythmias, which are relevant to a variety of heart disease conditions.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2015-06-15", "authors": ["Michael BLiu", "Ennode Lange", "AlanGarfinkel", "James NWeiss", "ZhilinQu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2015.06.019"}
{"title": "Control of cardiac alternans in an electromechanical model of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Electrical alternations in cardiac action potential duration have been shown to be a precursor to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Through the mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling, the presence of electrical alternans induces alternations in the heart muscle contractile activity. Also, contraction of cardiac tissue affects the process of cardiac electric wave propagation through the mechanism of the so-called mechanoelectrical feedback. Electrical excitation and contraction of cardiac tissue can be linked by an electromechanical model such as the Nash-Panfilov model. In this work, we explore the feasibility of suppressing cardiac alternans in the Nash-Panfilov model which is employed for small and large deformations. Several electrical pacing and mechanical perturbation feedback strategies are considered to demonstrate successful suppression of alternans on a one-dimensional cable. This is the first attempt to combine electrophysiologically relevant cardiac models of electrical wave propagation and contractility of cardiac tissue in a synergistic effort to suppress cardiac alternans.

{"title": "The mTOR inhibitor sirolimus suppresses renal, hepatic, and cardiac tissue cellular respiration.", "abstract": "The purpose of this in vitro study was to develop a useful biomarker (e.g., cellular respiration, or mitochondrial O2 consumption) for measuring activities of mTOR inhibitors. It measured the effects of commonly used immunosuppressants (sirolimus - rapamycin, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine) on cellular respiration in target tissues (kidney, liver, and heart) from C57BL/6 mice. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase that supports nutrient-dependent cell growth and survival, is known to control energy conversion processes within the mitochondria. Consistently, inhibitors of mTOR (e.g., rapamycin, also known as sirolimus or Rapamune\u00ae) have been shown to impair mitochondrial function. Inhibitors of the calcium-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (e.g., tacrolimus and cyclosporine), on the other hand, strictly prevent lymphokine production leading to a reduced T-cell function. Sirolimus (10 \u03bcM) inhibited renal (22%, p = 0.002), hepatic (39%, p < 0.001), and cardiac (42%, p = 0.005) cellular respiration. Tacrolimus and cyclosporine had no or minimum effects on cellular respiration in these tissues. Thus, these results clearly demonstrate that impaired cellular respiration (bioenergetics) is a sensitive biomarker of the immunosuppressants that target mTOR.", "journal": "International journal of physiology, pathophysiology and pharmacology", "date": "2015-06-13", "authors": ["AliaAlbawardi", "SaeedaAlmarzooqi", "DhanyaSaraswathiamma", "Hidaya MohammedAbdul-Kader", "Abdul-KaderSouid", "Ali SAlfazari"], "doi": null}

Methods are presented for the infection of H9c2 rat cardiac myoblasts in tissue culture as well as for the determination of bacterial colonization of the hearts of infected mice. These methods are useful not only for identifying strains with the potential to colonize cardiac tissue in infected animals, but may also facilitate the identification of bacterial gene products that serve to enhance cardiac cell invasion and/or drive changes in heart pathology.

Following ischemic injury a part of the heart muscle is replaced by a scar tissue, reducing its functioning capacity. Recent advancements in surgical intervention and pharmacotherapy only provide symptomatic relief and do not address the root cause of the problem which is the massive loss of cardiomyocytes (CM). Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic intervention for the repair and regeneration of ischemic myocardium remains an area of intense research. While existing CM in zebra fish and neonatal mice are known to proliferate and replenish the infarcted heart, it has been shown that adult mammalian CM lose this ability, thus preventing regeneration of the scar tissue. There have been many attempts to facilitate regeneration of ischemic heart but have met with limited success.

{"title": "Animal Models in Cardiovascular Research: Hypertension and Atherosclerosis.", "abstract": "Hypertension and atherosclerosis are among the most common causes of mortality in both developed and developing countries. Experimental animal models of hypertension and atherosclerosis have become a valuable tool for providing information on etiology, pathophysiology, and complications of the disease and on the efficacy and mechanism of action of various drugs and compounds used in treatment. An animal model has been developed to study hypertension and atherosclerosis for several reasons. Compared to human models, an animal model is easily manageable, as compounding effects of dietary and environmental factors can be controlled. Blood vessels and cardiac tissue samples can be taken for detailed experimental and biomolecular examination.

If so, we further unraveled possible molecular mechanisms of cardiac protection under treatment with the herbal formula B307.\nBefore the animal experiment, we examined relative viabilities of Huh7 cancer cells under treatment with the herbal formula B307. To test whether oral treatment with the herbal formula B307 could alleviate cardiotoxicity, equal volumes of B307 (50 mg/kg) or saline (sham treatment) were administered to 20-week-old male mice once daily for 14 consecutive days. Then, DOX (10 mg/kg; ip) was administered to male mice under B307 and sham treatments at 22-23 weeks of age. Cardiac functions in these mice were assessed via echocardiography at 23-24 weeks of age. Then, expressions of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis-related proteins were examined in the heart tissue by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting at 24-25 weeks of age. Apart from this, mortality rate and body weight were measured during the experiment.\nIn vitro, the relative viabilities of Huh7 cancer cells under treatment with the herbal formula B307 had shown no obvious change at doses of 10-160 ng/mL. Furthermore, the relative viabilities of Huh7 cancer cells were significantly reduced under DOX treatment but showed no significant change under DOX only and DOX plus B307 treatment. In vivo, the mortality rate, body weight, and cardiac function of DOX-treated mice were obviously improved under oral treatment with the herbal formula B307. Furthermore, cardiac expressions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, superoxide dismutase 2, and B-cell lymphoma 2 were significantly enhanced, but tumor necrosis factor alpha, NFKB1 (p50 and its precursor, p105), neurotrophin-3, Bcl-2-associated X protein, calpain, caspase 12, caspase 9, and caspase 3 were significantly suppressed in DOX-treated mice under oral treatment with the herbal formula B307.\nOur results revealed that oral treatment with the herbal formula B307 may provide cardioprotection in DOX-treated mice via suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in heart tissue.

{"title": "Electrical Pacing of Cardiac Tissue Including Potassium Inward Rectification.", "abstract": "In this study cardiac tissue is stimulated electrically through a small unipolar electrode. Numerical simulations predict that around an electrode are adjacent regions of depolarization and hyperpolarization. Experiments have shown that during pacing of resting cardiac tissue the hyperpolarization is often inhibited. Our goal is to determine if the inward rectifying potassium current (IK1) causes the inhibition of hyperpolarization. Numerical simulations were carried out using the bidomain model with potassium dynamics specified to be inward rectifying. In the simulations, adjacent regions of depolarization and hyperpolarization were observed surrounding the electrode. For cathodal currents the virtual anode produces a hyperpolarization that decreases over time. For long duration pulses the current-voltage curve is non-linear, with very small hyperpolarization compared to depolarization. For short pulses, the hyperpolarization is more prominent. Without the inward potassium rectification, the current voltage curve is linear and the hyperpolarization is evident for both long and short pulses. In conclusion, the inward rectification of the potassium current explains the inhibition of hyperpolarization for long duration stimulus pulses, but not for short duration pulses.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-06-10", "authors": ["SuranGalappaththige", "Bradley JRoth"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0127837\n10.1152/ajpheart.00706.2008\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.06.009"}

Our approach produces anisotropic cultures with conduction velocity (CV) profiles that closer resemble native heart tissue; the fastest impulse propagation is along the long axis of the aligned cardiomyocytes (CVL) and the slowest propagation is perpendicular (CVT), in contrast to standard cultures where action potential propagates isotropically (CVL\u2009\u2248\u2009CVT).

LDH and CK concentrations were significantly lower in RIPoC treated pigs 24h after ROSC (P \u2264 0.001), suggesting tissue and/or cardioprotective effects of RIPoC. End-systolic pressure volume relationship was significantly increased in RIPoC treated animals 4h after ROSC (P \u2264 0.05). Neurological testing revealed a trend towards an improved outcome in RIPoC treated animals.\nWe propose that RIPoC applied immediately after ROSC reduces serum concentrations of markers for cell damage and improves end-systolic pressure volume relationship 4h after ROSC.", "journal": "Resuscitation", "date": "2015-06-09", "authors": ["MartinAlbrecht", "PatrickMeybohm", "OleBroch", "KarinaZitta", "MarcHein", "Jan-ThorstenGr\u00e4sner", "JochenRenner", "BertholdBein", "MatthiasGruenewald"], "doi": "10.1016/j.resuscitation.2015.05.019"}
{"title": "Physical exercise affects slow cycling cells in the rat heart and reveals a new potential niche area in the atrioventricular junction.", "abstract": "Physical exercise has several beneficial effects on the heart. In other tissues it has been shown to activate endogenous stem cells. There is however a lack of knowledge how exercise affects the distribution of progenitor cells as well as overall cell turnover within the heart. Therefore, proliferating cells were identified using BrdU DNA labeling in a rat exercise model. Slow cycling cells were identified by label retention. BrdU+ nuclei were counted in apex, ventricle and atrioventricular junction (AV junction), as well as in skin tissue where label retaining cells (LRC) have been described previously. After 13 weeks of chasing, the cells with the highest intensity were identified and considered as LRC. Heart tissue showed slower proliferation compared to skin. The highest number of BrdU+ cells was found in the AV junction. Here, a sub region in close proximity to the valvular insertion point was observed, where density of BrdU+ cells was high at all time points. Physical exercise increased proliferation in AV junction at the early stage. Furthermore, the sub region was found to harbor a significant higher number of LRC compared to other regions of the heart in the exercised animals. Progenitor markers MDR1 and Sca-1 were detected in the same area by immunohistochemistry. In conclusions, our data shows that physical exercise affects cell turnover and distribution of LRC in the heart. Furthermore, it reveals a region within the AV junction of the heart that shows features of a stem cell niche.", "journal": "Journal of molecular histology", "date": "2015-06-07", "authors": ["KristinaVukusic", "JuliaAsp", "Helena BarretoHenriksson", "HelenaBrisby", "AndersLindahl", "JoakimSandstedt"], "doi": "10.1007/s10735-015-9626-3"}
{"title": "MicroRNA Stability in Postmortem FFPE Tissues: Quantitative Analysis Using Autoptic Samples from Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are very short (18-24 nucleotides) nucleic acids that are expressed in a number of biological tissues and have been shown to be more resistant to extreme temperatures and pH compared to longer RNA molecules, like mRNAs. As miRNAs contribute to diverse biological process and respond to various kinds of cellular stress, their utility as diagnostic biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets has recently been explored. Here, we have evaluated the usefulness of miRNA quantification during postmortem examination of cardiac tissue from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. Cardiac tissue was collected within one week of the patient's death and either frozen (19 samples) or fixed in formalin for up to three years (36 samples). RNA integrity was evaluated with an electropherogram, and it appears that longer RNAs are fragmented after death in the long-term fixed samples. Quantitative PCR was also performed for seven miRNAs and three other small RNAs in order to determine the appropriate controls for our postmortem analysis. Our data indicate that miR-191 and miR-26b are more suitable than the other types of small RNA molecules as they are stably detected after death and long-term fixation. Further, we also applied our quantitation method, using these endogenous controls, to evaluate the expression of three previously identified miRNA biomarkers, miR-1, miR-208b, and miR-499a, in formalin-fixed tissues from AMI patients. Although miR-1 and miR-208b decreased (1.4-fold) and increased (1.2-fold), respectively, in the AMI samples compared to the controls, the significance of these changes was limited by our sample size. In contrast, the relative level of miR-499a was significantly decreased in the AMI samples (2.1-fold). This study highlights the stability of miRNAs after death and long-term fixation, validating their use as reliable biomarkers for AMI during postmortem examination.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-06-06", "authors": ["YuKakimoto", "HiroshiKamiguchi", "ErikoOchiai", "FumikoSatoh", "MotokiOsawa"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0129338\n10.1097/PAF.0b013e31828879cd\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000565\n10.1007/s12265-013-9493-9\n10.1038/nrg2843\n10.1038/srep05150\n10.1038/nrm3313\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.247452\n10.1016/j.gde.2013.01.004\n10.1073/pnas.0804549105\n10.1038/cr.2008.282\n10.1016/j.yexmp.2011.09.013\n10.1371/journal.pone.0064393\n10.1007/s00414-014-1066-1\n10.1261/rna.939908\n10.1155/2014/985408\n10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797\n10.1007/s00428-013-1485-2\n10.1016/j.jpba.2012.04.031\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082753\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.01.010\n10.1016/j.scijus.2012.11.005\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.957415\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.01.075\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.11.005\n10.7150/ijbs.4439\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.958975\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.200451\n10.3390/ijms15045774\n10.1159/000268088\n10.1172/JCI36154\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2010.01.002\n10.1016/j.jflm.2007.12.019"}
{"title": "The mTOR inhibitor sirolimus suppresses renal, hepatic, and cardiac tissue cellular respiration.", "abstract": "The purpose of this in vitro study was to develop a useful biomarker (e.g., cellular respiration, or mitochondrial O2 consumption) for measuring activities of mTOR inhibitors. It measured the effects of commonly used immunosuppressants (sirolimus-rapamycin, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine) on cellular respiration in target tissues (kidney, liver, and heart) from C57BL/6 mice. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/ threonine kinase that supports nutrient-dependent cell growth and survival, is known to control energy conversion processes within the mitochondria. Consistently, inhibitors of mTOR (e.g., rapamycin, also known as sirolimus or Rapamune\u00ae) have been shown to impair mitochondrial function. Inhibitors of the calcium-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (e.g., tacrolimus and cyclosporine), on the other hand, strictly prevent lymphokine production leading to a reduced T-cell function. Sirolimus (10 \u03bcM) inhibited renal (22%, P=0.002), hepatic (39%, P<0.001), and cardiac (42%, P=0.005) cellular respiration. Tacrolimus and cyclosporine had no or minimum effects on cellular respiration in these tissues.

{"title": "Disruption of the NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 connection by melatonin requires retinoid-related orphan receptor-\u03b1 and blocks the septic response in mice.", "abstract": "We determined the NF-\u03baB- and NOD-like receptor (NLR)P3-dependent molecular mechanisms involved in sepsis and evaluated the role of retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-\u03b1 in melatonin's anti-inflammatory actions. Western blot, RT-PCR, ELISA, and spectrophotometric analysis revealed that NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 closely interact, leading to proinflammatory and pro-oxidant status in heart tissue of septic C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, mitochondrial oxygen consumption was reduced by 80% in septic mice. In vivo and in vitro analysis showed that melatonin administration blunts NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity through a sirtuin1-dependent NF-\u03baB deacetylation in septic mice. Melatonin also decreased NF-\u03baB-dependent proinflammatory response and restored redox balance and mitochondrial homeostasis, thus inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome. In an important finding, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB by melatonin, but not that of NLRP3, was blunted in ROR\u03b1 (sg/sg) mice, indicating that functional ROR\u03b1 transcription factor is necessary for the initiation of the innate immune response against inflammation. Our results are evidence of the NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 connection during sepsis and identify NLRP3 as a novel molecular target for melatonin.

{"title": "Novel perspectives on the PHD-HIF oxygen sensing pathway in cardioprotection mediated by IPC and RIPC.", "abstract": "Reperfusion of ischemic cardiac tissue is the standard treatment for improving clinical outcome following myocardial infarction but is inevitably associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Ischemic myocardial injury can be alleviated by exposing the heart to brief episodes of sublethal ischemia-reperfusion prior to the ischemic insult, a phenomenon that has been termed ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Similarly, remote IPC (RIPC) is defined as transient episodes of ischemia at a distant site before a subsequent prolonged injury of the target organ. In this setting, adaptive responses to hypoxia/ischemia in peripheral tissues include the release of soluble factors that have the potential to protect cardiomyocytes remotely. Oxygen fluctuations is a hallmark of insufficient tissue perfusion and ischemic episodes. Emerging evidence indicates that prolyl hydroxylase oxygen sensors (PHDs) and hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) are critical regulators of IPC and RIPC. In this review, we discuss recent findings concerning the role of the PHD-HIF axis in IPC and RIPC-mediated cardioprotection and examine molecular pathways and cell types that might be involved.

The aim of this study was to explore whether and by what mechanisms anti-HMGB1 mAb attenuates hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HS/R)-induced cardiac injury. Employing rat HS/R models, we found that anti-HMGB1 mAb treatment improved HS/R-induced cardiac function deterioration, attenuated cardiac enzyme elevation, improved ATP loss, and protected cardiac tissue. Anti-HMGB1 mAb also inhibited the production of inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Moreover, anti-HMGB1 mAb reduced apoptotic responses by suppressing activated caspase-3 and reversing apoptotic gene expression of capase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 in rat cardiac tissue. Moreover, anti-HMGB1 mAb decreased HS/R-induced HMGB1 and TLR4 expression elevation. We further confirmed that anti-HMGB1 mAb inhibited lipopolysaccharide-activated HGMB1 and TLR4 expression and decreased inflammatory factors IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 at the cellular level.

Herein we report the first tubular heart valve made from two decellularized, engineered tissue tubes attached with absorbable sutures, which can meet this need, in principle. Engineered tissue tubes were fabricated by allowing ovine dermal fibroblasts to replace a sacrificial fibrin gel with an aligned, cell-produced collagenous matrix, which was subsequently decellularized. Previously, these engineered tubes became extensively recellularized following implantation into the sheep femoral artery. Thus, a tubular valve made from these tubes may be amenable to recellularization and, ideally, somatic growth. The suture line pattern generated three equi-spaced leaflets in the inner tube, which collapsed inward when exposed to back pressure, per tubular valve design. Valve testing was performed in a pulse duplicator system equipped with a secondary flow loop to allow for root distention. All tissue-engineered valves exhibited full leaflet opening and closing, minimal regurgitation (<5%), and low systolic pressure gradients (<2.5 mmHg) under pulmonary conditions.

{"title": "Spatiotemporal stability of neonatal rat cardiomyocyte monolayers spontaneous activity is dependent on the culture substrate.", "abstract": "In native conditions, cardiac cells must continuously comply with diverse stimuli necessitating a perpetual adaptation. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is commonly used in cell culture to study cellular response to changes in the mechanical environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of using PDMS substrates on the properties of spontaneous activity of cardiomyocyte monolayer cultures. We compared PDMS to the gold standard normally used in culture: a glass substrate. Although mean frequency of spontaneous activity remained unaltered, incidence of reentrant activity was significantly higher in samples cultured on glass compared to PDMS substrates.

{"title": "DNA-Protein Cross-Links: Formation, Structural Identities, and Biological Outcomes.", "abstract": "Noncovalent DNA-protein interactions are at the heart of normal cell function. In eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA is wrapped around histone octamers to allow for chromosomal packaging in the nucleus. Binding of regulatory protein factors to DNA directs replication, controls transcription, and mediates cellular responses to DNA damage. Because of their fundamental significance in all cellular processes involving DNA, dynamic DNA-protein interactions are required for cell survival, and their disruption is likely to have serious biological consequences. DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) form when cellular proteins become covalently trapped on DNA strands upon exposure to various endogenous, environmental and chemotherapeutic agents. DPCs progressively accumulate in the brain and heart tissues as a result of endogenous exposure to reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation products, as well as normal cellular metabolism. A range of structurally diverse DPCs are found following treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs, transition metal ions, and metabolically activated carcinogens. Because of their considerable size and their helix-distorting nature, DPCs interfere with the progression of replication and transcription machineries and hence hamper the faithful expression of genetic information, potentially contributing to mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Mass spectrometry-based studies have identified hundreds of proteins that can become cross-linked to nuclear DNA in the presence of reactive oxygen species, carcinogen metabolites, and antitumor drugs. While many of these proteins including histones, transcription factors, and repair proteins are known DNA binding partners, other gene products with no documented affinity for DNA also participate in DPC formation. Furthermore, multiple sites within DNA can be targeted for cross-linking including the N7 of guanine, the C-5 methyl group of thymine, and the exocyclic amino groups of guanine, cytosine, and adenine. This structural complexity complicates structural and biological studies of DPC lesions. Two general strategies have been developed for creating DNA strands containing structurally defined, site-specific DPCs. Enzymatic methodologies that trap DNA modifying proteins on their DNA substrate are site specific and efficient, but do not allow for systematic studies of DPC lesion structure on their biological outcomes. Synthetic methodologies for DPC formation are based on solid phase synthesis of oligonucleotide strands containing protein-reactive unnatural DNA bases. The latter approach allows for a wider range of protein substrates to be conjugated to DNA and affords a greater flexibility for the attachment sites within DNA. In this Account, we outline the chemistry of DPC formation in cells, describe our recent efforts to identify the cross-linked proteins by mass spectrometry, and discuss various methodologies for preparing DNA strands containing structurally defined, site specific DPC lesions. Polymerase bypass experiments conducted with model DPCs indicate that the biological outcomes of these bulky lesions are strongly dependent on the peptide/protein size and the exact cross-linking site within DNA. Future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of DPC repair and their biological outcomes in living cells.", "journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "date": "2015-06-03", "authors": ["Natalia YTretyakova", "ArnoldGroehler", "ShaofeiJi"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.accounts.5b00056"}

Therefore, the event of readily available human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CM) has raised hopes that this human test bed could improve preclinical safety pharmacology as well as drug discovery approaches. However, hiPSC-CM are immature and exhibit peculiarities in terms of ion channel function, gene expression, structural organization and functional responses to drugs that limit their present usefulness. Current efforts are thus directed towards improving hiPSC-CM maturity and high-content readouts. Culturing hiPSC-CM as 3-dimensional engineered heart tissue (EHT) improves CM maturity and anisotropy and, in a 24-well format using silicone racks, enables automated, multiplexed high content readout of contractile function.

Autophagy is a cellular self-digestion process and is one of the first lines of defense against oxidative stress. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that autophagy can selectively eliminate damaged mitochondria. This study investigated the role of autophagy in TP-induced cardiotoxicity. We investigated the effects of autophagy in combination with TP on apoptosis, ROS and mitochondrial function. Rat cardiomyocytes were pre-treated with chloroquine or rapamycin followed by TP. The augmentation of autophagy with rapamycin in the presence of TP substantially ameliorated the detrimental effects induced by TP, while suppression of autophagy by chloroquine accelerates TP-induced cellular damage. In addition, pre-treated with rapamycin before TP administration also attenuated TP-induced damage in Balb/c mice heart tissues. Taken together, these results suggest that TP-induced cell death can be modified by autophagy. Furthermore, induction of autophagy by rapamycin may be a potential cardioprotective role against TP-induced cardiotoxicity by facilitating removal of dysfunctional mitochondria.", "journal": "Toxicology letters", "date": "2015-05-27", "authors": ["JieZhou", "ChenXi", "WenwenWang", "YanqinYang", "YuwenQiu", "ZhiyingHuang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.toxlet.2015.05.013"}
{"title": "Normothermic versus hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in children undergoing open heart surgery (thermic-2): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.", "abstract": "During open heart surgery, patients are connected to a heart-lung bypass machine that pumps blood around the body (\"perfusion\") while the heart is stopped. Typically the blood is cooled during this procedure (\"hypothermia\") and warmed to normal body temperature once the operation has been completed. The main rationale for \"whole body cooling\" is to protect organs such as the brain, kidneys, lungs, and heart from injury during bypass by reducing the body's metabolic rate and decreasing oxygen consumption. However, hypothermic perfusion also has disadvantages that can contribute toward an extended postoperative hospital stay. Research in adults and small randomized controlled trials in children suggest some benefits to keeping the blood at normal body temperature throughout surgery (\"normothermia\"). However, the two techniques have not been extensively compared in children.\nThe Thermic-2 study will test the hypothesis that the whole body inflammatory response to the nonphysiological bypass and its detrimental effects on different organ functions may be attenuated by maintaining the body at 35\u00b0C-37\u00b0C (normothermic) rather than 28\u00b0C (hypothermic) during pediatric complex open heart surgery.\nThis is a single-center, randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness and acceptability of normothermic versus hypothermic bypass in 141 children with congenital heart disease undergoing open heart surgery. Children having scheduled surgery to repair a heart defect not requiring deep hypothermic circulatory arrest represent the target study population. The co-primary clinical outcomes are duration of inotropic support, intubation time, and postoperative hospital stay. Secondary outcomes are in-hospital mortality and morbidity, blood loss and transfusion requirements, pre- and post-operative echocardiographic findings, routine blood gas and blood test results, renal function, cerebral function, regional oxygen saturation of blood in the cerebral cortex, assessment of genomic expression changes in cardiac tissue biopsies, and neuropsychological development.\nA total of 141 patients have been successfully randomized over 2 years and 10 months and are now being followed-up for 1 year. Results will be published in 2015.\nWe believe this to be the first large pragmatic study comparing clinical outcomes during normothermic versus hypothermic bypass in complex open heart surgery in children. It is expected that this work will provide important information to improve strategies of cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion and therefore decrease the inevitable organ damage that occurs during nonphysiological body perfusion.\nISRCTN Registry: ISRCTN93129502, http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN93129502 (Archived by WebCitation at http://www.webcitation.org/6Yf5VSyyG).", "journal": "JMIR research protocols", "date": "2015-05-27", "authors": ["SarahBaos", "KarenSheehan", "LucyCulliford", "KatiePike", "LucyEllis", "Andrew JParry", "SerbanStoica", "Mohamed TGhorbel", "MassimoCaputo", "Chris ARogers"], "doi": "10.2196/resprot.4338\n10.1053/j.jvca.2013.03.009\n10.1093/icvts/ivt016\n10.1111/j.1755-5922.2009.00114.x\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2006.07.032\n10.1097/01.mat.0000242597.92625.e9\n10.1016/0003-4975(95)00881-0\n10.1016/0003-4975(96)00092-6\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2004.01.037\n10.1053/j.jvca.2006.02.030\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.01.059\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2007.10.062\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2005.03.062\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2006.10.004\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2003.11.071\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.03.047\n10.1159/000286352\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.08.008\n10.1053/j.jvca.2012.01.001\n10.1016/S0140-6736(05)74811-X\n10.1111/cns.12127\n10.1097/TA.0b013e3181bbd485\n10.1089/neu.2004.21.1553\n10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181fd62d2\n10.1053/jcan.2001.26532"}

PAH exposure causes developmental toxicity in multiple fish species, while acute adult fish toxicity is thought to be minimal. The literature increasingly suggests sublethal PAH effects may occur, but differences in exposure route may confound conclusions. We hypothesized that acute PAH exposure in adult fish will cause cardiorespiratory impairment that will not differ with exposure route. In order to investigate this hypothesis, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were injected intraperitoneal (i.p.) twice with increasing concentrations of the prototypical PAH, benzo-a-pyrene (BaP; 0.1, 10, and 1000\u03bcg/kg) or exposed aqueously (static, renewal at 24h; 16.2 and 162\u03bcg/L) for 48h and compared to corresponding dimethylsulfoxide controls. No mortalities or significant effects on weight of the fish were noted at any exposure concentration or route. At 48h, fish were subjected to swimming tests with concurrent oxygen consumption measurement (n=10 fish/treatment) or echocardiography (n=12 fish/treatment). Oxygen consumption (MO2) was increased at three swimming speeds in BaP-injected groups compared to control (p<0.01 in Fisher's LSD tests after two-way ANOVA). In contrast, aqueously BaP-exposed fish showed increased MO2 under only basal conditions. Despite increased oxygen demand, ventricular heart rate was significantly decreased in BaP-exposed fish, both injected and aqueously-exposed. Analysis of BaP body burdens in fish tissue allowed for identification of an overlapping dose group between exposure routes, through which comparisons of cardiorespiratory toxicity were then made. This comparison revealed most effects were similar between the two exposures routes, although minor differences were noted. At similar BaP body burdens, injected fish suffered from more severe bradycardia than aqueously exposed fish and had greater levels of increases in cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) mRNA levels in liver and heart tissue compared to aqueous exposed fish. In conclusion, acute BaP exposure in adult zebrafish had negative effects on cardiorespiratory function. Differences in effect between exposure routes were attributed primarily to differences in bioavailability, since overall, similar effects were noted between the two exposure routes when similar BaP body burdens were achieved.", "journal": "Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "date": "2015-05-26", "authors": ["Courtney JGerger", "Lynn PWeber"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.05.008"}

Improved sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function with enhanced Ca(2+) resequestration appears critical for S100A1's cyclic adenosine monophosphate-independent inotropic effects but raises concerns about potential diastolic SR Ca(2+) leakage that might trigger fatal arrhythmias. This study shows for the first time a diminished interaction between S100A1 and ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) in experimental HF. Restoring this link in failing cardiomyocytes, engineered heart tissue and mouse hearts, respectively, by means of adenoviral and adeno-associated viral S100A1 cDNA delivery normalizes diastolic RyR2 function and protects against Ca(2+)- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-triggered proarrhythmogenic SR Ca(2+) leakage in vitro and in vivo. S100A1 inhibits diastolic SR Ca(2+) leakage despite aberrant RyR2 phosphorylation via protein kinase A and calmodulin-dependent kinase II and stoichiometry with accessory modulators such as calmodulin, FKBP12.6 or sorcin. Our findings demonstrate that S100A1 is a regulator of diastolic RyR2 activity and beneficially modulates diastolic RyR2 dysfunction.

As a macromolecule (conjugated to styrene-maleic acid [SMA]), SMA-pirarubicin is selective to tumors resulting in improved survival with decreased systemic toxicity. Tumor destruction is, however incomplete, and resistant cells at the periphery of the tumor contribute to recurrence. Tumor hypoxia is a major factor in tumor resistance. Understanding the effect of oxidative stress induced by SMA-pirarubicin on the tumor microenvironment may be key to overcoming resistance. This study investigated the pattern of ROS production and tumor hypoxia after treatment with SMA-pirarubicin in a murine model of colorectal liver metastases.\nLiver metastases were induced in male, CBA mice using a murine-derived colon cancer cell line. SMA-pirarubicin (maximum tolerated dose, 100 mg/kg) or pirarubicin, (maximum tolerated dose, 10 mg/kg) were administered intravenously 14 days after tumor induction. Systemic oxidative stress in serum, liver, and cardiac tissue was quantified using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were used to assess ROS production for 48 hours after treatment. Tumor hypoxia was quantified using immunohistochemistry for pimonidazole adducts.\nSMA-pirarubicin (100 mg/kg) induced ROS exclusively in tumors with minimal levels in serum and cardiac tissue. ROS levels were induced in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner optimal between 4 and 24 hours after drug administration. Although tumor hypoxia was decreased overall, residual tumor cells adjacent to patent vessels were hypoxic.\nThis study provides insight into the tumor microenvironment after chemotherapy. SMA-pirarubicin inhibits the growth of colorectal liver metastases by inducing ROS, which seems to be largely tumor selective. The temporal pattern of ROS production can be used to improve future dosing regimens.

We tested the hypothesis that lactate would increase cardiac levels of reactive oxygen species and up-regulate the expression of genes related to lactate oxidation complex.\nIsolated hearts from male adult Wistar rats were perfused with control, lactate or acetate (20mM) added Krebs-Henseleit solution during 120 min in modified Langendorff apparatus. Reactive oxygen species (O2\u25cf-/H2O2) levels, and NADH and NADPH oxidase activities (in enriched microsomal or plasmatic membranes, respectively) were evaluated by fluorimetry while SOD and catalase activities were evaluated by spectrophotometry. mRNA levels of lactate oxidation complex and energetic enzymes MCT1, MCT4, HK, LDH, PDH, CS, PGC1\u03b1 and COXIV were quantified by real time RT-PCR. Mitochondrial DNA levels were also evaluated. Hemodynamic parameters were acquired during the experiment. The key findings of this work were that lactate elevated cardiac NADH oxidase activity but not NADPH activity.

This hiPSC-CMs seeded patch was compared with hiPSC-CMs cultured on standard flat cell culture plates.\nhiPSC-CMs were cultured on; 1) a highly aligned polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) nanofiber scaffold (~50 microns thick) and 2) on a standard flat culture plate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to determine alignment of PLGA nanofibers and orientation of the cells on the respective surfaces. Analysis of gap junctions (Connexin-43) was performed by confocal imaging in both the groups. Calcium cycling and patch-clamp technique were performed to measure calcium transients and electrical coupling properties of cardiomyocytes.\nSEM demonstrated >90% alignment of the nanofibers in the patch which is similar to the extracellular matrix of decellularized rat myocardium. Confocal imaging of the cardiomyocytes demonstrated symmetrical alignment in the same direction on the aligned nanofiber patch in sharp contrast to the random appearance of cardiomyocytes cultured on a tissue culture plate. The hiPSC-CMs cultured on aligned nanofiber cardiac patches showed more efficient calcium cycling compared with cells cultured on standard flat surface culture plates. Quantification of mRNA with qRT-PCR confirmed that these cardiomyocytes expressed \u03b1-actinin, troponin-T and connexin-43 in-vitro.\nOverall, our results demonstrated changes in morphology and function of human induced pluripotent derived cardiomyocytes cultured in an anisotropic environment created by an aligned nanofiber patch.

Confluent cultured cells are harvested as an intact cell sheet using a temperature-responsive culture surface. By layering cardiac cell sheets, it is possible to form electrically communicative three-dimensional cardiac constructs. Cell sheet transplantation onto damaged hearts in several animal models has revealed improvements in heart functions.

Epidemiological studies have shown that BPA exposure in humans is associated with cardiovascular disease; however, the direct effects of BPA on cardiac physiology are largely unknown. Previously, we have shown that BPA exposure slows atrioventricular electrical conduction, decreases epicardial conduction velocity, and prolongs action potential duration in excised rat hearts. In the present study, we tested if BPA exposure also adversely affects cardiac contractile performance. We examined the impact of BPA exposure level, sex, and pacing rate on cardiac contractile function in excised rat hearts. Hearts were retrogradely perfused at constant pressure and exposed to 10(-9)-10(-4) M BPA. Left ventricular developed pressure and contractility were measured during sinus rhythm and during pacing (5, 6.5, and 9 Hz). Ca(2+) transients were imaged from whole hearts and from neonatal rat cardiomyocyte layers. During sinus rhythm in female hearts, BPA exposure decreased left ventricular developed pressure and inotropy in a dose-dependent manner. The reduced contractile performance was exacerbated at higher pacing rates. BPA-induced effects on contractile performance were also observed in male hearts, albeit to a lesser extent. Exposure to BPA altered Ca(2+) handling within whole hearts (reduced diastolic and systolic Ca(2+) transient potentiation) and neonatal cardiomyocytes (reduced Ca(2+) transient amplitude and prolonged Ca(2+) transient release time). In conclusion, BPA exposure significantly impaired cardiac performance in a dose-dependent manner, having a major negative impact upon electrical conduction, intracellular Ca(2+) handing, and ventricular contractility.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

In vivo gene and protein expression studies, as well as in vitro cell culture assays, were developed to characterize EPDC and BMC interaction and properties.\nEPDCs, which colonize the cardiac interstitium during embryogenesis, massively differentiate into CFs after MI. This response is disease-specific, because angiotensin II-induced pressure overload does not trigger significant EPDC fibroblastic differentiation. The expansion of epicardial-derived CFs follows BMC infiltration into the infarct site; the number of EPDCs equals that of BMCs 1 week post-infarction. BMC-EPDC interaction leads to cell polarization, packing, massive collagen deposition, and scar formation. Moreover, epicardium-derived CFs display stromal properties with respect to BMCs, contributing to the sustained recruitment of circulating cells to the damaged zone and the cardiac persistence of hematopoietic progenitors/stem cells after MI.\nEPDCs, but not BMCs, are the main origin of CFs in the ischemic heart.

{"title": "Approximate analytical solutions for excitation and propagation in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "It is well known that a variety of cardiac arrhythmias are initiated by a focal excitation in heart tissue. At the single cell level these currents are typically induced by intracellular processes such as spontaneous calcium release (SCR). However, it is not understood how the size and morphology of these focal excitations are related to the electrophysiological properties of cardiac cells. In this paper a detailed physiologically based ionic model is analyzed by projecting the excitation dynamics to a reduced one-dimensional parameter space. Based on this analysis we show that the inward current required for an excitation to occur is largely dictated by the voltage dependence of the inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)), and is insensitive to the detailed properties of the sodium current. We derive an analytical expression relating the size of a stimulus and the critical current required to induce a propagating action potential (AP), and argue that this relationship determines the necessary number of cells that must undergo SCR in order to induce ectopic activity in cardiac tissue. Finally, we show that, once a focal excitation begins to propagate, its propagation characteristics, such as the conduction velocity and the critical radius for propagation, are largely determined by the sodium and gap junction currents with a substantially lesser effect due to repolarizing potassium currents.

{"title": "Let-7 family of microRNA is required for maturation and adult-like metabolism in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "In metazoans, transition from fetal to adult heart is accompanied by a switch in energy metabolism-glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation. The molecular factors regulating this metabolic switch remain largely unexplored. We first demonstrate that the molecular signatures in 1-year (y) matured human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) are similar to those seen in in vivo-derived mature cardiac tissues, thus making them an excellent model to study human cardiac maturation. We further show that let-7 is the most highly up-regulated microRNA (miRNA) family during in vitro human cardiac maturation. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses of let-7g in hESC-CMs demonstrate it is both required and sufficient for maturation, but not for early differentiation of CMs. Overexpression of let-7 family members in hESC-CMs enhances cell size, sarcomere length, force of contraction, and respiratory capacity. Interestingly, large-scale expression data, target analysis, and metabolic flux assays suggest this let-7-driven CM maturation could be a result of down-regulation of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT protein kinase/insulin pathway and an up-regulation of fatty acid metabolism. These results indicate let-7 is an important mediator in augmenting metabolic energetics in maturing CMs. Promoting maturation of hESC-CMs with let-7 overexpression will be highly significant for basic and applied research.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2015-05-13", "authors": ["Kavitha TKuppusamy", "Daniel CJones", "HenrikSperber", "AnupMadan", "Karin AFischer", "Marita LRodriguez", "LilPabon", "Wei-ZhongZhu", "Nathaniel LTulloch", "XiulanYang", "Nathan JSniadecki", "Michael ALaflamme", "Walter LRuzzo", "Charles EMurry", "HanneleRuohola-Baker"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1424042112"}

Collagen is one of the most preferred biopolymers, due to its widespread occurrence in nature and its biocompatibility. Electrospinning of collagen alone has been reported, with fluoroalcohols such as hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and trifluoroethanol (TFE), but the resultant collagen lost its characteristic ultrastructural integrity of D-periodicity 67 nm banding, confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the fluoroalcohols used were toxic to the environment. In this study, we describe the use of glacial acetic acid and DMSO to dissolve collagen and generate electrospun nanofibers of collagen type 1, which is non-toxic and economical. TEM analysis revealed the characteristic feature of native collagen triple helical repeats, showing 67 nm D-periodicity banding pattern and confirming that the ultrastructural integrity of the collagen was maintained. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed fiber diameters in the range of 200-1100 nm. Biocompatibility of the three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds was established by MTT assays using rat skeletal myoblasts (L6 cell line) and confocal microscopic analysis of immunofluorescent-stained sections of collagen scaffolds for muscle-specific markers such as desmin and actin. Primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCM) seeded onto the collagen scaffolds were able to maintain their contractile function for a period of 17 days and also expressed higher levels of desmin when compared with 2D cultures.

During the CT simulation and intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning process undertaken in free breathing, it was apparent that an unusually large volume of normal liver tissue (134\u2009cc) was in the high-dose region of the tangential radiation field. This raised concern for risk of liver side effects and was considered suboptimal for this excellent prognosis patient. A deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique using three-dimensional (3D) surface monitoring-primarily developed and applied in left breast cancer to displace cardiac tissue from the target field-was investigated to determine potential benefit to optimize radiotherapy delivery. Resimulation of DIBH resulted in considerable displacement of the liver, reducing the volume of liver tissue in the target field by 63% (to 50\u2009cc) and the mean liver dose by 46% (to 2.6\u2009Gy). As the patient was deemed suitable for the DIBH technique, treatment was delivered according to the DIBH plan. A total of 40.05\u2009Gy in 15 fractions was successfully delivered in the DIBH position using a technique that incorporated 3D body surface imaging with automated radiation beam hold-off when out of tolerance. Additional advantages were optimal set up without extensive immobilization and the elimination of respiratory motion.

{"title": "How to improve the overall quality of cardiac morphometric data.", "abstract": "By the mid-1990s, experts realized that drugs leading to improved ventricular remodeling were doing something remarkable in cardiac patients. The \"age of cardiac remodeling\" had begun. This created an experimental need for high-quality assessment of changes in cardiac tissue composition, including myocyte shape, myocardial fibrosis/collagen, and vascular remodeling. Many working in the field today have little or no training related to recognition of fixation artifacts or common errors associated with quantitative morphology. Unfortunately, such skills had become somewhat of a lost art during the ages of cardiac physiology in the mid-20th century and molecular biology, gaining prominence by the mid-1970s. Consequently, cardiac remodeling studies today are often seriously flawed to the point where data are not reproducible and subsequent researchers may be chasing the molecular basis of a nonexistent or erroneous phenotype. The current unacceptably high incidence of irreproducible data is a serious waste of time and resources as recently noted in comments by the National Institutes of Health director. The goal of this \"how to\" article is to share some lessons I have learned during nearly 40 years of assessing morphological changes in the heart.

Based on our published findings of elevated plasma concentrations of inosine/hypoxanthine in animal laboratory and clinical settings, since 2006 we have originally proposed that these two purine molecules can be used as rapid and sensitive biomarkers for acute cardiac ischemia at its very early onset (within 15\u2009min), hours prior to the release of heart tissue necrosis biomarkers such as cardiac troponins. We further developed a chemiluminescence technology, one of the most affordable and sensitive analytical techniques, and we were able to reproducibly quantify and differentiate total hypoxanthine concentrations in the plasma samples from healthy individuals versus patients suffering from ischemic heart disease.

Investigating proteomic responses to temperature in cardiac tissues may provide insights into mechanisms supporting the thermal plasticity of cardiac function. Here, we utilized a global proteomic analysis to investigate changes in cardiac protein abundance in response to temperature acclimation (transfer from 13\u00b0C to 9, 19 and 26\u00b0C) in a eurythermal goby, Gillichthys mirabilis. Proteomic data revealed 122 differentially expressed proteins across acclimation groups, 37 of which were identified using tandem mass-spectrometry. These 37 proteins are involved in energy metabolism, mitochondrial regulation, iron homeostasis, cytoprotection against hypoxia, and cytoskeletal organization. Compared with the 9 and 26\u00b0C groups, proteins involved in energy metabolism increased in 19\u00b0C-acclimated fish, indicating an overall increase in the capacity for ATP production. Creatine kinase abundance increased in 9\u00b0C-acclimated fish, suggesting an important role for the phosphocreatine energy shuttle in cold-acclimated hearts. Both 9 and 26\u00b0C fish also increased abundance of hexosaminidase, a protein directly involved in post-hypoxia stress cytoprotection of cardiac tissues. Cytoskeletal restructuring appears to occur in all acclimation groups; however, the most prominent effect was detected in 26\u00b0C-acclimated fish, which exhibited significantly increased actin levels. Overall, proteomic analysis of cardiac tissue suggests that the capacity to adjust ATP-generating processes is crucial to the thermal plasticity of cardiac function.

{"title": "[The efficacy of ivabradine in chronic heart failure (review)].", "abstract": "This review article is devoted to the treatment of chronic heart failure (HF) with a new generation drug - ivabradine. It is well known that HF is one of the most frequent reason of high mortality worldwide. HF is characterised by cardiac remodeling, which is central in the pathophysiology of HF including hemodynamic, neurohumoral and neurohormonal mechanisms during its development and established prognostic factor in patients suffered with this disease. Despite the introduction in medical practice of many drugs for the treatment of chronic HF the lethal outcome associated with HF remains high nowadays, which can be explained by complexity of remodeling mechanisms characteristic for development of HF. Ivabradine that has been introduced in medical practice in last decade is a pure heart rate-slowing agent. A large number of studies in patients with cardiovascular disease have demonstrated that heart rate (HR) is a very important and major independent risk factor for prognosis, because lowering of HR reduces cardiac work and diminished myocardial oxygen requirement. It was shown that ivabradine a selective inhibitor of the hyperpolarisation activated sodium chanel (If) is involved in pacemaker generation and responsiveness of the sino-atrial node resulting in HR reduction without negative inotropic action. Ivabradine in chronic HF improves diastolic function and attenuates cardiac tissue hypoxia. Long-term reduction of HR induced by ivabradine reduced remodeling and preserved nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, resulting from processes triggered early after reduction of HR. The complex therapy including ivabradine promotes HR fall, leading in reduction of attacks of a stable angina and improved quality of life. Ivabradine may target the endothelial NO production via inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B leading to endothelial protection. HR reduction by ivabradine reduces oxidative stress, improves endothelial function and prevents development of atherosclerostic changes in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. In multicenter clinical trials it has been proved that ivabradine is superior to beta-blocking agents during complex therapy of chronic HF accompanied with its beneficial effects related to cardiac remodeling, improvement of the currency of HF and diminution of patients rehospitalisation. It is suggested that ivabradine as a newer agent is a valuable perspective drug for the treatment of congestive HF.", "journal": "Georgian medical news", "date": "2015-05-09", "authors": ["AIsakadze", "TMakharadze", "MGvishiani"], "doi": null}

A significant association between serum galectin-3 values and the risk of atrial fibrillation was found in 4 studies (1 nested case-control, 2 case-control, 1 prospective), whereas the association could not be confirmed in a single case-control investigation. Serum galectin-3 value was also found to be a significant predictor of left atrium fibrosis, reduced left atrial volume, or decreased left ventricle ejection fraction in four studies (2 nested case-control, 2 case-control). A reliable biological explanation may be brought in support of these findings. Activated macrophages release galectin-3, which not only contributes to increase macrophages accumulation in cardiac tissue and perpetuates their activation, but also promotes fibroblast activation and proliferation, thus leading to cardiac fibrosis, cardiac remodeling, myocardiocyte dysfunction and ultimately atrial fibrillation. The onset of atrial fibrillation further amplifies macrophage activation, thus completing a vicious circle that is mirrored by evidence of substantially increased galectin-3 values in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.\nIt seems reasonable to suggest that galectin-3 measurement holds promise for stratifying risk and outcome of atrial fibrillation.", "journal": "Clinical biochemistry", "date": "2015-05-09", "authors": ["GiuseppeLippi", "GianfrancoCervellin", "FabianSanchis-Gomar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2015.04.021"}

We previously examined this pathway in the myocardium via manipulation of the unique E2F repressor, E2F6, which is believed to repress gene activity independently of Rb. Mice with targeted expression of E2F6 in postnatal myocardium developed dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without hypertrophic growth. We assessed the mechanisms of the apparent failure of compensatory hypertrophic growth as well as their response to the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. As early as 2 weeks, E2F6 transgenic (Tg) mice present with dilated thinner left ventricles and significantly reduced ejection fraction and fractional shortening which persists at 6 weeks of age, but with no apparent increase in left ventricle weight: body weight (LVW:BW). E2F6-Tg mice treated with isoproterenol (6.1 mg/kg/day) show double the increase in LVW:BW than their Wt counterparts (32% vs 16%, p-value: 0.007). Western blot analysis revealed the activation of the adrenergic pathway in Tg heart tissue under basal conditions with ~2-fold increase in the level of \u03b22-adrenergic receptors (p-value: 8.9E-05), protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA-C) (p-value: 0.0176), activated c-Src tyrosine-protein kinase (p-value: 0.0002), extracellular receptor kinase 2 (ERK2) (p-value: 0.0005), and induction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 (p-value 0. 0.00001). In contrast, a ~60% decrease in the cardiac growth regulator: AKT1 (p-value 0.0001) and a ~four fold increase in cyclic AMP dependent phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), the negative regulator of PKA activity, were evident in the myocardium of E2F6-Tg mice. The expression of E2F3 was down-regulated by E2F6, but was restored by isoproterenol. Further, Rb expression was down-regulated in Tg mice in response to isoproterenol implying a net activation of the E2F pathway. Thus the unique regulation of E2F activity by E2F6 renders the myocardium hypersensitive to adrenergic stimulus resulting in robust hypertrophic growth. These data reveal a novel interplay between the E2F pathway, \u03b22-adrenergic/PKA/PDE4D, and ERK/c-Src axis in fine tuning the pathological hypertrophic growth response. E2F6 deregulates E2F3 such that pro-hypertrophic growth and survival are enhanced via \u03b22-adrenergic signaling however this response is outweighed by the induction of anti-hypertrophic signals so that left ventricle dilation proceeds without any increase in muscle mass.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2015-05-07", "authors": ["Jennifer LMajor", "MaysoonSalih", "Balwant STuana"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.04.026"}
{"title": "Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 causes a decrease in coronary flow in diabetic mice. The possible role of PGE2 and dysfunctional vasodilation mediated by prostacyclin receptor.", "abstract": "Several lines of evidence suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity can have a beneficial role in the maintenance of vascular tone of the blood vessels in diabetes. Specifically, the increased production of prostacyclin (PGI2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), mediated by COX-2, has been suggested to compensate for decreased synthesis of nitric oxide (NO). The study investigates whether inhibition of COX-2 may reduce the coronary flow in diabetic animals and may also lead to decreased synthesis of prostaglandins. Mice aged 18-20\u00a0weeks were used for the study: those with leptin receptor deficiency (db/db) served as a model of diabetes while heterozygous (db/+) mice served as controls. Coronary flow was measured by the Langendorff method, and prostaglandin synthesis by myocardia was assayed in heart perfusates. COX-2 inhibition was found to reduce basal coronary flow in db/db mice but had no effect in db/+ mice. Secretion of PGE2 was found to be higher in db/db mice, while prostacyclin synthesis did not differ. COX-2 inhibition decreased production of both prostaglandins to similar levels in both groups. The use of ONO-1301, a specific agonist for the prostacyclin receptor revealed that vasodilating responses mediated by the receptor were impaired in db/db mice. The expression levels of the receptor in cardiac tissue did not differ between the groups.

Allogeneic transplanted stem cells (SCs) from young donors are usually rejected. Maintaining transplanted SC immunoprivilege may dramatically improve regenerative outcomes. The uterus has distinct immune characteristics, and we showed that reparative uterine SCs home to the myocardium post-MI. Here, we identify immunoprivileged uterine SCs and assess their effects on cardiac regeneration after allogeneic transplantation. We found more than 20% of cells in the mouse uterus have undetectable MHC I expression by flow cytometry. Uterine MHC I((neg)) and MHC I((pos)) cells were separated by magnetic cell sorting. The MHC I((neg)) population expressed the SC markers CD34, Sca-1 and CD90, but did not express MHC II or c-kit. In vitro, MHC I((neg)) and ((pos)) SCs show colony formation and endothelial differentiation capacity. In mixed leukocyte co-culture, MHC I((neg)) cells showed reduced cell death and leukocyte proliferation compared to MHC I((pos)) cells. MHC I((neg)) and ((pos)) cells had significantly greater angiogenic capacity than mesenchymal stem cells. The benefits of intramyocardial injection of allogeneic MHC I((neg)) cells after MI were comparable to syngeneic bone marrow cell transplantation, with engraftment in cardiac tissue and limited recruitment of CD4 and CD8 cells up to 21 days post-MI. MHC I((neg)) cells preserved cardiac function, decreased infarct size and improved regeneration post-MI. This new source of immunoprivileged cells can induce neovascularization and could be used as allogeneic cell therapy for regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2015-05-06", "authors": ["AnaLudke", "JunWu", "MansorehNazari", "KotaHatta", "ZhengboShao", "Shu-HongLi", "HuifangSong", "Nathan CNi", "Richard DWeisel", "Ren-KeLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.04.019"}

However, the role of IL-17 has not been studied using the experimental Lyme borreliosis model of infection of C3H mice with Borrelia burgdorferi. In the current study, we investigated the role of IL-17 in the development of experimental Lyme borreliosis by infecting C3H mice devoid of the common IL-17 receptor A subunit (IL-17RA) and thus deficient in most IL-17 signaling. Infection of both C3H and C3H IL-17RA(-/-) mice led to the production of high levels of IL-17 in the serum, low levels in the heart tissue, and no detectable IL-17 in the joint tissue. The development and severity of arthritis and carditis in the C3H IL-17RA(-/-) mice were similar to what was seen in wild-type C3H mice. In addition, development of antiborrelia antibodies and clearance of spirochetes from tissues were similar for the two mouse strains.

Increasing availability of autopsy-confirmed cases of LBD prompted us to quantify residual cardiac sympathetic axons to establish their relationship to cardiac MIBG uptake.\nWe collected cardiac tissue samples from 23 patients with autopsy-confirmed LBD and two non-LBD control patients who underwent (123)I-MIBG cardiac scintigraphy in life. Samples of the left ventricular anterior wall were stained with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and anti-neurofilament (NF) antibodies as markers of cardiac nerve axons. We quantified the immunolabelled areas and assessed their correlation to standardised heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratios of (123)I-MIBG cardiac scintigraphy.\nCardiac MIBG uptake in the early and delayed phases was reduced in 90.9% and 95.7% of patients with LBD, respectively. The area of TH-immunoreactive axons correlated significantly with the H/M ratio in the early (p=0.036) as well as in the delayed (p=0.018) phases.

In this study we present engineered heart slices (EHS), which consist of neonatal rat ventricular cells (NRVCs) seeded onto thin slices of decellularized cardiac tissue that retain important aspects of native extracellular matrix (ECM). To form EHS, rat or pig ventricular tissue was sectioned into 300\u00a0\u03bcm-thick, 5 to 16\u00a0mm-diameter disks, which were subsequently decellularized using detergents, spread on coverslips, and seeded with NRVCs. The organized fiber structure of the ECM remained after decellularization and promoted cell elongation and alignment, resulting in an anisotropic, functional tissue that could be electrically paced. Contraction decreased at higher pacing rates, and optical mapping revealed electrical conduction that was anisotropic with a ratio of approximately 2.0, rate-dependent shortening of the action potential and slowing of conduction, and slowing of conduction by the sodium channel blocker lidocaine. Reentrant arrhythmias could also be pace-induced and terminated.

However, little is known about how CNTs enhance the mechanical integrity and electrophysiological function of cardiac myocytes. To address this issue, we investigated the regularity and precise mechanism of the influence of CNTs on the assembly of intercalated disc (IDs). Here, single walled CNTs incorporated into collagen substrates were utilized as growth supports for neonatal cardiomyocytes, which enhanced cardiomyocyte adhesion and maturation. Furthermore, through the use of immunohistochemical staining, western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, and intracellular calcium transient measurement, we discovered that the addition of CNTs remarkably increased ID-related protein expression and enhanced ID assembly and functionality. On that basis, we further explored the underlying mechanism for how CNTs enhanced ID assembly through the use of immunohistochemical staining and western blotting. We found that the \u03b21-integrin-mediated signaling pathway mediated CNT-induced upregulation of electrical and mechanical junction proteins. Notably, CNTs remarkably accelerated gap junction formation via activation of the \u03b21-integrin-mediated FAK/ERK/GATA4 pathway.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of PMI on Troponin-T protein degradation in cardiac tissues of cadavers through quantitative analysis of Troponin-T degradation by easily electrophoretic method and its association with PMI in case of deaths due to burn.\nAn efficient extraction protocol to analyze the banding pattern of cTnT in post-mortem tissue was developed. The analysis involves extraction of the protein (at different PMI (~7.30, 18.20, 30.30, 41.20, 41.40, 54.30..................88.40h), from the heart muscles of cadavers (burn cases), separation by denaturing gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualization by Western blot using cTnT specific monoclonal antibodies.\nThe results specify a characteristic banding pattern amongst human cadavers (n=9), a pseudo-linear relationship between percent cTnT degraded and the time since death (r=0.87, p=0.0001). The area of the bands within a lane was quantified by scanning and digitizing the image using commonly available scanners.\nThe present research used a simple, easy, applicable and highly informative electrophoresis method that make it an ideal for the busy forensic laboratory.

{"title": "Computational chemical imaging for cardiovascular pathology: chemical microscopic imaging accurately determines cardiac transplant rejection.", "abstract": "Rejection is a common problem after cardiac transplants leading to significant number of adverse events and deaths, particularly in the first year of transplantation. The gold standard to identify rejection is endomyocardial biopsy. This technique is complex, cumbersome and requires a lot of expertise in the correct interpretation of stained biopsy sections. Traditional histopathology cannot be used actively or quickly during cardiac interventions or surgery. Our objective was to develop a stain-less approach using an emerging technology, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging to identify different components of cardiac tissue by their chemical and molecular basis aided by computer recognition, rather than by visual examination using optical microscopy. We studied this technique in assessment of cardiac transplant rejection to evaluate efficacy in an example of complex cardiovascular pathology. We recorded data from human cardiac transplant patients' biopsies, used a Bayesian classification protocol and developed a visualization scheme to observe chemical differences without the need of stains or human supervision. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, we observed probabilities of detection greater than 95% for four out of five histological classes at 10% probability of false alarm at the cellular level while correctly identifying samples with the hallmarks of the immune response in all cases. The efficacy of manual examination can be significantly increased by observing the inherent biochemical changes in tissues, which enables us to achieve greater diagnostic confidence in an automated, label-free manner.

{"title": "Transgenic systems for unequivocal identification of cardiac myocyte nuclei and analysis of cardiomyocyte cell cycle status.", "abstract": "Even though the mammalian heart has been investigated for many years, there are still uncertainties in the fields of cardiac cell biology and regeneration with regard to exact fractions of cardiomyocytes (CMs) at different developmental stages, their plasticity after cardiac lesion and also their basal turnover rate. A main shortcoming is the accurate identification of CM and the demonstration of CM division. Therefore, an in vivo model taking advantage of a live reporter-based identification of CM nuclei and their cell cycle status is needed. In this technical report, we describe the generation and characterization of embryonic stem cells and transgenic mice expressing a fusion protein of human histone 2B and the red fluorescence protein mCherry under control of the CM specific \u03b1MHC promoter. This fluorescence label allows unequivocal identification and quantitation of CM nuclei and nuclearity in isolated cells and native tissue slices. In ventricles of adults, we determined a fraction of <20 % CMs and binucleation of 77-90 %, while in atria a CM fraction of 30 % and a binucleation index of 14 % were found. We combined this transgenic system with the CAG-eGFP-anillin transgene, which identifies cell division and established a novel screening assay for cell cycle-modifying substances in isolated, postnatal CMs. Our transgenic live reporter-based system enables reliable identification of CM nuclei and determination of CM fractions and nuclearity in heart tissue. In combination with CAG-eGFP-anillin-mice, the cell cycle status of CMs can be monitored in detail enabling screening for proliferation-inducing substances in vitro and in vivo.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2015-05-01", "authors": ["AlexandraRaulf", "HannesHorder", "LauraTarnawski", "CarolineGeisen", "AnnikaOttersbach", "WilhelmR\u00f6ll", "StefanJovinge", "Bernd KFleischmann", "MichaelHesse"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-015-0489-2\n10.1152/ajpcell.00435.2009\n10.1152/ajpheart.00514.2007\n10.1152/ajpheart.00023.2006\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.08.017\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.060\n10.1007/BF02890430\n10.1073/pnas.0607382103\n10.1038/nature11739\n10.1073/pnas.0609277104\n10.1038/ncomms6288\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00140-5\n10.1038/ncomms2089\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60107-0\n10.1073/pnas.0903089106\n10.1038/nm1618\n10.1073/pnas.1208114109\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000085658.98621.49\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0163\n10.1083/jcb.111.6.2427\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.02.017\n10.1073/pnas.1214608110\n10.1073/pnas.90.18.8424\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.02.006\n10.1002/aja.1001790310\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0137\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1097/00007890-200202150-00022\n10.1038/nature11682\n10.1161/hh1301.092687\n10.1161/01.RES.83.1.15\n10.1126/science.8140423\n10.1016/0022-2828(90)90090-O\n10.1126/science.1092436\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.113.000330\n10.1093/cvr/cvq005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.909093"}

We have performed whole exome sequencing on five parent-proband trios and identified nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein mutations in three cases. The molecular genetic basis of Histiocytoid CM remains unknown despite several hypotheses in medical literature. The findings presented in this manuscript may represent components of genetic etiologies for this heterogeneous disease. Two probands had de novo non-sense mutations in the second exon of the X-linked nuclear gene NDUFB11. A third proband was doubly heterozygous for inherited rare variants in additional components of complex I, NDUFAF2 and NDUFB9, confirming that Histiocytoid CM is genetically heterogeneous. In a fourth case, the proband with Histiocytoid CM inherited a mitochondrial mutation from her heteroplasmic mother, as did her brother who presented with cardiac arrhythmia. Strong candidate recessive or compound heterozygous variants were not found for this individual or for the fifth case. Although NDUFB11 has not been implicated before in cardiac pathology, morpholino-mediated knockdown of ndufb11 in zebrafish embryos generated defective cardiac tissue with cardiomegaly, looping defects, and arrhythmia which suggests the role of NDUFB11 in the pathogenesis of this abnormal cardiac pathology. Taken together, the unbiased whole exome sequencing approach confirms the suspected genetic heterogeneity of Histiocytoid CM. Therefore, the novel NDUFB11 mutation may cause a complex 1 deficiency in synergy with additional unknown mtDNA variants.", "journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

{"title": "Graphene oxide flakes as a cellular adhesive: prevention of reactive oxygen species mediated death of implanted cells for cardiac repair.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) implantation has emerged as a potential therapy for myocardial infarction (MI). However, the poor survival of MSCs implanted to treat MI has significantly limited the therapeutic efficacy of this approach. This poor survival is primarily due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the ischemic myocardium after the restoration of blood flow. ROS primarily causes the death of implanted MSCs by inhibiting the adhesion of the MSCs to extracellular matrices at the lesion site (i.e., anoikis). In this study, we proposed the use of graphene oxide (GO) flakes to protect the implanted MSCs from ROS-mediated death and thereby improve the therapeutic efficacy of the MSCs. GO can adsorb extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The survival of MSCs, which had adhered to ECM protein-adsorbed GO flakes and were subsequently exposed to ROS in vitro or implanted into the ischemia-damaged and reperfused myocardium, significantly exceeded that of unmodified MSCs. Furthermore, the MSC engraftment improved by the adhesion of MSCs to GO flakes prior to implantation enhanced the paracrine secretion from the MSCs following MSC implantation, which in turn promoted cardiac tissue repair and cardiac function restoration. This study demonstrates that GO can effectively improve the engraftment and therapeutic efficacy of MSCs used to repair the injury of ROS-abundant ischemia and reperfusion by protecting implanted cells from anoikis.", "journal": "ACS nano", "date": "2015-04-29", "authors": ["JooyeonPark", "BokyoungKim", "JinHan", "JaewonOh", "SubeomPark", "SeungmiRyu", "SubinJung", "Jung-YounShin", "Beom SeobLee", "Byung HeeHong", "DonghoonChoi", "Byung-SooKim"], "doi": "10.1021/nn507149w"}
{"title": "Engineering muscle tissue for the fetus: getting ready for a strong life.", "abstract": "Congenital malformations frequently involve either skeletal, smooth or cardiac tissues. When large parts of those tissues are damaged, the repair of the malformations is challenged by the fact that so much autologous tissue is missing. Current treatments require the use of prostheses or other therapies and are associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. Nonetheless, affected children have generally good survival rates and mostly normal schooling. As such, new therapeutic modalities need to represent significant improvements with clear safety profiles. Regenerative medicine and tissue engineering technologies have the potential to dramatically improve the treatment of any disease or disorder involving a lack of viable tissue. With respect to congenital soft tissue anomalies, the development of, for example, implantable muscle constructs would provide not only the usual desired elasticity and contractile proprieties, but should also be able to grow with the fetus and/or in the postnatal life. Such an approach would eliminate the need for multiple surgeries. However, the more widespread clinical applications of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering technologies require identification of the optimal indications, as well as further elucidation of the precise mechanisms and best methods (cells, scaffolds/biomaterials) for achieving large functional tissue regeneration in those clinical indications. In short, despite some amazing scientific progress, significant safety and efficacy hurdles remain. However, the rapid preclinical advances in the field bode well for future applications. As such, translational researchers and clinicians alike need be informed and prepared to utilize these new techniques for the benefit of their patients, as soon as they are available.

{"title": "A new combination of sitagliptin and furosemide protects against remote myocardial injury induced by renal ischemia/reperfusion in rats.", "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high mortality resulting from extra-renal organ damage, particularly the heart. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, against renal and remote cardiac damage induced by ischemia/reperfusion (IR), a leading cause of AKI. In this attempt, we compared the effects of sitagliptin to furosemide, a loop diuretic. Furosemide is commonly used clinically in AKI however, there is a lack of evidence regarding its beneficial effects in AKI. In addition, the combined administration of both drugs was also investigated. Ischemia was induced in anesthetized male Wistar rats by occluding both renal pedicles for 30min followed by reperfusion for 24h. Sitagliptin (5mg kg(-1)), furosemide (245mg kg(-1)) or their combination were administered orally at 5h post-IR and 2h before euthanasia. Administration of sitagliptin or furosemide ameliorated renal and cardiac deterioration induced by renal IR. This was manifested as significant reduction of serum creatinine, urea, cystatin c, creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponin-I and lactate dehydrogenase (P<0.05). Drug treatment significantly inhibited IR-induced elevation of TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB and caspase-3 (P<0.05) in kidney and heart tissue. In addition, they significantly suppressed malondialdehyde, NO and iNOS content, whereas they increased glutathione and antioxidative enzymes activity (P<0.05) in both tissues. Interestingly, a superior protection was observed with the combination compared to the individual drugs. We assume that this combination represents a promising regimen for managing AKI, particularly with the poor clinical outcome obtained with furosemide alone.", "journal": "Biochemical pharmacology", "date": "2015-04-29", "authors": ["Mahmoud IYoussef", "Amr A AMahmoud", "Rasha HAbdelghany"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bcp.2015.04.010"}

We exposed brown trout to normoxic and hypoxic water in the absence and presence of added ambient nitrite to decipher the cellular metabolism and effects of nitrite at basal and elevated concentrations under different oxygen regimes. We also tested hypotheses concerning the influence of nitrite on branchial nitric oxide synthase (NOS), Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (nka) and heat shock protein (hsp70) mRNA expression. Basal plasma and erythrocyte nitrite levels were higher in hypoxia than normoxia, suggesting increased NOS activity. Nitrite exposure strongly elevated nitrite concentrations in plasma, erythrocytes, heart tissue and white muscle, which was associated with an extensive metabolism of nitrite to nitrate and to iron-nitrosylated and S-nitrosated compounds. Nitrite uptake was slightly higher in hypoxia than normoxia, and high internal nitrite levels extensively converted blood hemoglobin to methemoglobin and nitrosylhemoglobin. Hypoxia increased inducible NOS (iNOS) mRNA levels in the gills, which was overruled by a strong inhibition of iNOS expression by nitrite in both normoxia and hypoxia, suggesting negative-feedback regulation of iNOS gene expression by nitrite. A similar inhibition was absent for neuronal NOS. Branchial NKA activity stayed unchanged, but mRNA levels of the nka\u03b11a subunit increased with hypoxia and nitrite, which may have countered an initial NKA inhibition. Nitrite also increased hsp70 gene expression, probably contributing to the cytoprotective effects of nitrite at low concentrations.

{"title": "Integrated Immune and Cardiovascular Function in Pancrustacea: Lessons from the Insects.", "abstract": "When pathogens invade the insect hemocoel (body cavity) they immediately confront two major forces: immune-responses and circulatory currents. The immune response is mediated by circulating and sessile hemocytes, the fat body, the midgut, and the salivary glands. These tissues drive cellular and humoral immune processes that kill pathogens via phagocytosis, melanization, lysis, encapsulation, and nodulation. Moreover, immune-responses take place within a three-dimensional and dynamic space that is governed by the forces of the circulatory system. The circulation of hemolymph (insect blood) is primarily controlled by the wave-like contraction of a dorsal vessel, which is a muscular tube that extends the length of the insect and is divided into a thoracic aorta and an abdominal heart. Distributed along the heart are valves, called ostia, that allow hemolymph to enter the vessel. Once inside the heart, hemolymph is sequentially propelled to the anterior and to the posterior of the body. During an infection, circulatory currents sweep small pathogens to all regions of the body. As they circulate, pathogens encounter immune factors of the insect that range from soluble cytotoxic peptides to phagocytic hemocytes. A prominent location for these encounters is the surface of the heart. Specifically, periostial hemocytes aggregate in the extracardiac regions that flank the heart's ostia (the periostial regions) and phagocytoze pathogens in areas of high flow of hemolymph. This review summarizes the biology of the immune and circulatory systems of insects, including how these two systems have co-adapted to fight infection. This review also compares the immune and circulatory systems of insects to that of crustaceans, and details how attachment of hemocytes to cardiac tissues and the biology of the lymphoid organ demonstrate that dynamic interactions between the immune and circulatory systems also occur in lineages of crustaceans.", "journal": "Integrative and comparative biology", "date": "2015-04-23", "authors": ["Juli\u00e1n FHillyer"], "doi": "10.1093/icb/icv021"}

The SDF-1\u03b1 incorporated PLGA particles exhibited distinct core-shell structure, confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Controlled release of SDF-1\u03b1 was obtained for at least 40days, and the release rate was tailored by co-encapsulation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) into the core of the particles.

{"title": "Contribution of microRNA to pathological fibrosis in cardio-renal syndrome: impact of uremic toxins.", "abstract": "Progressive reduction in kidney function in patients following myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with an increase in circulating uremic toxins levels leading to increased extracellular matrix deposition. We have recently reported that treatment with uremic toxin adsorbent AST-120 in rats with MI inhibits serum levels of uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS) and downregulates expression of cardiac profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b21). In this study, we examined the effect of uremic toxins post-MI on cardiac microRNA-21 and microRNA-29b expression, and also the regulation of target genes and matrix remodeling proteins involved in TGF\u03b21 and angiotensin II signaling pathways. Sixteen weeks after MI, cardiac tissues were assessed for pathological and molecular changes. The percentage area of cardiac fibrosis was 4.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17 in vehicle-treated MI, 2.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.26 in sham, and 3.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38 in AST-120-treated MI, group of rats. Compared to sham group, we found a twofold increase in the cardiac expression of microRNA-21 and 0.5-fold decrease in microRNA-29b in heart tissue from vehicle-treated MI. Treatment with AST-120 lowered serum IS levels and attenuated both, cardiac fibrosis and changes in expression of these microRNAs observed after MI. We also found increased mRNA expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin receptor 1a (Agtr1a) in cardiac tissue collected from MI rats. Treatment with AST-120 attenuated both, expression of ACE and Agtr1a mRNA. Exposure of rat cardiac fibroblasts to IS upregulated angiotensin II signaling and altered the expression of both microRNA-21 and microRNA-29b. These results collectively suggest a clear role of IS in altering microRNA-21 and microRNA-29b in MI heart, via a mechanism involving angiotensin signaling pathway, which leads to cardiac fibrosis.", "journal": "Physiological reports", "date": "2015-04-22", "authors": ["IndrajeetsinhRana", "Andrew RKompa", "JoannaSkommer", "Bing HWang", "SureeLekawanvijit", "Darren JKelly", "HenryKrum", "Fadi JCharchar"], "doi": "10.14814/phy2.12371"}

This TCR, originally obtained from a melanoma patient, recognizes the well-described HLA-A*0201 restricted 26-35 epitope of MART-1, and was not affinity enhanced. Patient 1 with metastatic melanoma experienced a cerebral hemorrhage, epileptic seizures, and a witnessed cardiac arrest 6 days after cell infusion. Three days later, the patient died from multiple organ failure and irreversible neurologic damage. After T-cell infusion, levels of IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin increased to extreme levels, indicative of a cytokine release syndrome or T-cell-mediated inflammatory response. Infused T cells could be recovered from blood, broncho-alveolar lavage, ascites, and after autopsy from tumor sites and heart tissue. High levels of NT-proBNP indicate semi-acute heart failure. No cross reactivity of the modified T cells toward a beating cardiomyocyte culture was observed. Together, these observations suggest that high levels of inflammatory cytokines alone or in combination with semi-acute heart failure and epileptic seizure may have contributed substantially to the occurrence of the acute and lethal event.

{"title": "Reduction of cardiac and aortic cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic rats fed esters of phytosterol and omega-3 fatty acids.", "abstract": "Sterol esters are currently gaining importance because of their recent recognition and application in the food and nutraceutical industries. Phytosterol esters have an advantage over phytosterols, naturally occurring antioxidants, with better fat solubility and compatibility. Antioxidants and hypocholesterolemic agents are known to reduce hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of different sterol esters on cardiac and aortic lipid profile and oxidative stress parameters and on the development of atherosclerosis in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet. Thirty six rats were divided into six groups: control group, hypercholesterolemic group and four experimental groups fed with EPA-DHA rich sitosterol ester in two different doses, 0.25\u00a0g/kg body wt/day and 0.5\u00a0g/kg body wt/day, and ALA rich sitosterol ester in two different doses, 0.25\u00a0g/kg body wt/day and 0.5\u00a0g/kg body wt/day. The sterol esters were gavaged to the rats once daily for 32\u00a0days. The cardiac and aortic total cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride level which were elevated in hypercholesterolemia were significantly lowered by both the doses of sterol esters. Antioxidant enzyme activities were significantly decreased and peroxidation product, malondialdehyde was increased in hypercholesterolemia. But administration of both the sterol esters was able to increase enzyme activities and decrease MDA level in the tissues. Histological study of cardiac tissues showed fatty changes in hypercholesterolemic group which was reduced by treatment with sterol esters.

Bone marrow- derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been used effectively to heal damaged tissue after MI. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) can induce transcription of numerous pro-angiogenic genes and enhance stem cell survival. Here, we investigated whether HIF-1\u03b1-transduced BMSCs could enhance tissue repair after MI, and compared the value of micro-PET/CT and echocardiography for evaluation of therapeutic effects. Rat BMSCs were transduced with a lentivirus expressing HIF-1\u03b1 and NIS (Lenti-HIF-1\u03b1-NIS). Sodium iodide symporter (NIS) functioned as effective reporter gene, allowing monitoring of BMSCs transplanted into the rat heart for up to 2 weeks using micro-SPECT/CT imaging. In a rat MI model, after transplantation of HIF-1\u03b1-NIS-transduced BMSCs to the MI zone, more expression of HIF-1\u03b1,VEGF and Ang-4, more improvement of metabolism, less fibrotic tissue and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were detected in the MI zone. Moreover, we found that most of the transplanted HIF-1\u03b1-NIS-transduced BMSCs differentiated into endothelial cells, and engineered new blood vessels in MI zone. Metabolic activity significantly increased at an early time point (2 weeks after transplantation) and lead to a sustained increase (4 weeks), as indicated by (18)F-FDG uptake in micro-PET/CT imaging.

In response to any (patho) physiological cue, responses of each cell type in any given tissue may be unique and cannot be homogenized across cell-types and spatial co-ordinates. For example, in response to myocardial infarction, on one hand myocytes and fibroblasts of the heart tissue respond differently. On the other hand, myocytes in the infarct core respond differently compared to those in the peri-infarct zone. Therefore, isolation of pure targeted cells is an important and essential step for the molecular analysis of cells involved in the progression of disease. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is powerful to obtain a pure targeted cell subgroup, or even a single cell, quickly and precisely under the microscope, successfully tackling the problem of tissue heterogeneity in molecular analysis.

{"title": "Natural cardiac extracellular matrix sheet as a biomaterial for cardiomyocyte transplantation.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases associated with myocardial infarction are among the major causes of death worldwide due to the limited regenerative capacity of cardiac tissues. Although various approaches, such as biosynthetic biomaterials, have been developed to promote postinfarction cardiac regeneration, a number of limitations, including the immune complications caused by biodegradation of these scaffolds and insufficient cell migration, need to be overcome prior to their clinical application. Hence, the development of natural biomaterials to support myocardial regeneration is crucial. Here, we investigated the effects of a natural biomaterial, cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) on the proliferation and maintenance of cardiomyocytes in order to assess its suitability for cardiomyocyte expansion. The ECM components not only provide mechanical support, but also induce and preserve the required phenotypic and functional characteristics of the cells. We prepared ECM sheets from decellularized cardiac sections. Cardiomyocytes were then cultured with and without these cardiac ECM sheets. We compared the proliferation rates and phenotypes, and cardiac gene and protein expression, of the cultured cardiomyocytes by automatic cell counting and the MTT assay, microscopy, and RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The cardiomyocytes cultured with the natural cardiac ECM sheets exhibited higher proliferation rates and cardiac gene and protein expression than those cultured without the ECM sheets. Our results demonstrate that the ECM sheets are suitable for use in cardiomyocyte transplantation and can provide a novel in vitro model for investigating cell and ECM interactions. We hypothesize that these ECM sheets can be used in the future to improve cardiac transplantation strategies.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2015-04-22", "authors": ["K MLee", "HKim", "J GNemeno", "WYang", "JYoon", "SLee", "J ILee"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.12.030"}

Although cardiac cryoablation offers a gentler treatment than radiofrequency ablation, longer interventions and higher recurrence rates reduce the clinical acceptance of this technique. Computer models of ablation scenarios allow for a closer examination of temperature distributions in the myocardium and evaluation of specific effects of applied freeze-thaw protocols in a controlled environment.\nIn this work multiple intervention scenarios with two freeze-thaw cycles were simulated with varying durations and starting times of the interim thawing phase using a finite element model verified by in-vivo measurements and data from literature. To evaluate the effects of different protocols, transmural temperature distributions and iceball dimensions were compared over time. Cryoadhesion durations of the applicator were estimated in the interim thawing phase with varying thawing phase starting times. In addition, the increase of cooling rates was compared between the freezing phases, and the thawing rates of interim thawing phases were analyzed over transmural depth.\nIt could be shown that the increase of cooling rate, the regions undergoing additional phase changes and depths of selected temperatures depend on the chosen ablation protocol. Only small differences of the estimated cryoadhesion duration were found for ablation scenarios with interim thawing phase start after 90 s freezing.\nBy the presented model a quantification of effects responsible for cell death is possible, allowing for the analysis and optimization of cryoablation scenarios which contribute to a higher clinical acceptance of cardiac cryoablation.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering online", "date": "2015-04-18", "authors": ["MichaelHandler", "GeraldFischer", "MichaelSeger", "RolandKienast", "FriedrichHanser", "ChristianBaumgartner"], "doi": "10.1186/s12938-015-0005-9\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2004.15106.x\n10.1093/europace/euq294\n10.1161/CIRCEP.112.973651\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970350\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2009.10.001\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2007.00726.x\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2012.04.007\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2013.07.006\n10.1006/cryo.1998.2115\n10.1007/s00231-006-0138-2\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2009.07.001\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2005.40559.x\n10.1017/S0305004100023197\n10.1109/TBME.2007.900818\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2008.01224.x\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.1999.tb00353.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000058706.82623.A1\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2012.08.001\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.11.005"}

The actual profile of the transmural AP upstroke across the LV wall, together with the OAP upstroke, allowed for calculations of the probing-depth constant (k ~2.1 mm, n = 24) of the fluorescence measurements. In addition, the transmural AP recordings aided the quantitative evaluation of the influences of depth-weighted and lateral-scattering components on the OAP upstroke. These components correspond to the components of the propagating electrical wave that are transmural and parallel to the epicardium. The calculated mean values for the depth-weighted and lateral-scattering components, whose sum comprises the OAP upstroke, were (in ms) 10.18 \u00b1 0.62 and 0.0 \u00b1 0.56 for atrial stimulation, 9.37 \u00b1 1.12 and 3.01 \u00b1 1.30 for endocardial stimulation, and 6.09 \u00b1 0.79 and 8.16 \u00b1 0.98 for epicardial stimulation; (n = 8 for each).

NRVMs were divided into similar groups as rats. The results showed that combination of APS with Iso significantly attenuated the pathological changes, reduced the ratios of heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) and left ventricular weight/BW (LVW/BW), improved the cardiac hemodynamics, down-regulated mRNA and protein expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), increased the ratios of ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP, and decreased the content of free fatty acid (FFA) in heart tissue of rats compared with Iso alone. In addition, pretreatment with APS significantly decreased the surface area and protein content, down-regulated mRNA and protein expression of ANP, increased the ratios of ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP, and decreased the content of FFA in NRVMs compared with Iso alone.

The mice were genotyped using PCR and DNA sequencing. Protein expression was measured by western blot analysis. qPCR was used to determine the copy number of the transgenes. The heart tissue was fixed and sectioned by conventional procedures. The Vevo 2000 system was used to perform echocardiography on the mice. The expression of GATA4 target genes was measured using the real-time PCR system. The incidence of ASD in the heterozygous transgenic mice was found to be greater than that in the wild-type control mice (P<0.05).

After exposure to heat stress at 42\u00b0C for different durations, we observed a significant induction of CK, CK-MB, and LDH as well as pathologic lesions characterized by acute degeneration, suggesting that cell damage occurs from the onset of heat stress.

Hsp70-positive signals in the cytoplasm were more prominent in intact areas than in degenerated areas after 60 min of heat stress. Hsp70 protein levels in myocardial cells in vitro decreased from the beginning to the end of heat stress. Hsp70 protein levels in rat heart tissues in vivo decreased gradually with prolonged heat stress, with a slight increase at the beginning of heat stress. These results indicate that Hsp70 plays a role in the response of cardiac cells to heat stress and that decreased Hsp70 levels are associated with damage to rat myocardial cells in vitro and in vivo.

This review discusses how the function and electrophysiology of isolated perfused hearts are affected by oxygenation and energy utilization. The impact of oxygenation on fluorescence measurements in perfused hearts is also discussed. What advances does it highlight? Recent studies have illuminated the inherent differences in electromechanical function, energy utilization rate and oxygen requirements between the primary types of excised heart preparations. A summary and analysis of how these variables affect experimental results are necessary to elevate the physiological relevance of these approaches in order to advance the field of whole-heart research. The ex vivo perfused heart recreates important aspects of in vivo conditions to provide insight into whole-organ function. In this review we discuss multiple types of ex vivo heart preparations, explain how closely each mimic in vivo function, and discuss how changes in electromechanical function and inadequate oxygenation of ex vivo perfused hearts may affect measurements of physiology. Hearts that perform physiological work have high oxygen demand and are likely to experience hypoxia when perfused with a crystalloid perfusate. Adequate myocardial oxygenation is critically important for obtaining physiologically relevant measurements, so when designing experiments the type of ex vivo preparation and the capacity of perfusate to deliver oxygen must be carefully considered. When workload is low, such as during interventions that inhibit contraction, oxygen demand is also low, which could dramatically alter a physiological response to experimental variables. Changes in oxygenation also alter the optical properties of cardiac tissue, an effect that may influence optical signals measured from both endogenous and exogenous fluorophores. Careful consideration of oxygen supply, working condition, and wavelengths used to acquire optical signals is critical for obtaining physiologically relevant measurements during ex vivo perfused heart studies.", "journal": "Experimental physiology", "date": "2015-04-14", "authors": ["SarahKuzmiak-Glancy", "RafaelJaimes", "Anastasia MWengrowski", "Matthew WKay"], "doi": "10.1113/EP085042"}

{"title": "Use of mesenchymal stem cells for therapy of cardiac disease.", "abstract": "Despite substantial clinical advances over the past 65 years, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in America. The past 15 years has witnessed major basic and translational interest in the use of stem and precursor cells as a therapeutic agent for chronically injured organs. Among the cell types under investigation, adult mesenchymal stem cells are widely studied, and in early stage, clinical studies show promise for repair and regeneration of cardiac tissues. The ability of mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into mesoderm- and nonmesoderm-derived tissues, their immunomodulatory effects, their availability, and their key role in maintaining and replenishing endogenous stem cell niches have rendered them one of the most heavily investigated and clinically tested type of stem cell. Accumulating data from preclinical and early phase clinical trials document their safety when delivered as either autologous or allogeneic forms in a range of cardiovascular diseases, but also importantly define parameters of clinical efficacy that justify further investigation in larger clinical trials. Here, we review the biology of mesenchymal stem cells, their interaction with endogenous molecular and cellular pathways, and their modulation of immune responses. Additionally, we discuss factors that enhance their proliferative and regenerative ability and factors that may hinder their effectiveness in the clinical setting.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2015-04-11", "authors": ["VasileiosKarantalis", "Joshua MHare"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303614"}

High-field cardiac magnetic resonance over a 10-month postinfection follow-up did not detect an overt right ventricular (RV) phenotype in nonexercised (sedentary) mice. In contrast, endurance exercise training (initiated 2 weeks after AAV9-R735X injection) resulted in clear RV dysfunction that resembled the ARVC phenotype (impaired global RV systolic function and RV regional wall motion abnormalities on cardiac magnetic resonance). At the histological level, RV samples from endurance-trained R735X-infected mice displayed connexin 43 delocalization at intercardiomyocyte gap junctions, a change not observed in sedentary mice.\nThe introduction of the PKP2 R735X mutation into mice resulted in an exercise-dependent ARVC phenotype. The R735X mutation appears to function as a dominant-negative variant.

However, its role in this process is unresolved. Our goal was to delineate the pathogenic role of the complement system in a new animal model of ACM and in human disease. Using cardiac histology, echocardiography, and electrocardiography, we have demonstrated that the desmin-null mouse (Des-/-) recapitulates most of the pathognomonic features of human ACM. Massive complement activation was observed in the Des-/- myocardium in areas of necrotic cells debris and inflammatory infiltrate. Analysis of C5aR-/-Des-/- double-null animals and a pharmaceutical approach using a C5a inhibitor were used to delineate the pathogenic role of the complement system in the disease progression. Our findings indicate that inhibiting C5aR (CD88) signaling improves cardiac function, histopathology, arrhythmias, and survival after endurance. Containment of the inflammatory reaction at the initiation of cardiac tissue injury (2-3 weeks of age), with consequently reduced myocardial remodeling and the absence of a direct long-lasting detrimental effect of C5a-C5aR signaling on cardiomyocytes, could explain the beneficial action of C5aR ablation in Des-/- cardiomyopathy.

Theorems were proven to illustrate the properties and boundaries of the COOP, which was then applied to both synthetic and experimental data. We showed the COOP to be useful for quantifying the correlation of orientation of constructs such as actin filaments and sarcomeric Z-lines. As expected, cardiac tissues showed perfect correlation between actin filaments and Z-lines. We also demonstrated the use of COOP to quantify the consistency of construct orientation within cells of the same shape.

{"title": "Tracking fusion of human mesenchymal stem cells after transplantation to the heart.", "abstract": "Evidence suggests that transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can aid recovery of damaged myocardium caused by myocardial infarction. One possible mechanism for MSC-mediated recovery is reprogramming after cell fusion between transplanted MSCs and recipient cardiac cells. We used a Cre/LoxP-based luciferase reporter system coupled to biophotonic imaging to detect fusion of transplanted human pluripotent stem cell-derived MSCs to cells of organs of living mice. Human MSCs, with transient expression of a viral fusogen, were delivered to the murine heart via a collagen patch. At 2 days and 1 week later, living mice were probed for bioluminescence indicative of cell fusion. Cell fusion was detected at the site of delivery (heart) and in distal tissues (i.e., stomach, small intestine, liver). Fusion was confirmed at the cellular scale via fluorescence in situ hybridization for human-specific and mouse-specific centromeres. Human cells in organs distal to the heart were typically located near the vasculature, suggesting MSCs and perhaps MSC fusion products have the ability to migrate via the circulatory system to distal organs and engraft with local cells. The present study reveals previously unknown migratory patterns of delivered human MSCs and associated fusion products in the healthy murine heart. The study also sets the stage for follow-on studies to determine the functional effects of cell fusion in a model of myocardial damage or disease.\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are transplanted to the heart, cartilage, and other tissues to recover lost function or at least limit overactive immune responses. Analysis of tissues after MSC transplantation shows evidence of fusion between MSCs and the cells of the recipient. To date, the biologic implications of cell fusion remain unclear. A newly developed in vivo tracking system was used to identify MSC fusion products in living mice. The migratory patterns of fusion products were determined both in the target organ (i.e., the heart) and in distal organs.

As characterized through SEM and AFM, FDM exhibits unique surface texture and biomechanical property. Immunofluorescence also found fibronectin, collagen, and laminin in the FDM. Cells on FDM showed a more circular shape and slightly less proliferation in a growth medium. After being cultured in a differentiation medium for 7 days, H9c2 cells on FDM differentiated into cardiomyocytes, as identified by stronger positive markers, such as \u03b1-actinin and cTnT, along with more elevated gene expression of Myl2 and Tnnt compared to the cells on gelatin and fibronectin. The gap junction protein connexin 43 was also significantly upregulated for the cells differentiated on FDM. A successive work enabled matrix stiffness tunable; FDM crosslinked by 2wt% genipin increased the stiffness up to 8.5\u2009kPa, 100 times harder than that of natural FDM. The gene expression of integrin subunit \u03b15 was significantly more upregulated on FDM than on crosslinked FDM (X-FDM), whereas no difference was observed for \u03b21 expression.

{"title": "Transient receptor potential melastatin-4 is involved in hypoxia-reoxygenation injury in the cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease still remains the most common cause of cardiac death. During ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in excess in cardiac tissue, where they induce cell death. Our previous study showed that 9-phenanthrol (9-Phe), a specific inhibitor of the TRPM4 channel, preserves cardiac contractile function and protects the heart from I/R injury-related infarction in the excised rat heart. Accordingly, we hypothesized that TRPM4 channels are involved in the 9-Phe-mediated cardioprotection against ROS-induced injury. In rats, intravenous 9-Phe mitigated the development of myocardial infarction caused by the occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that TRPM4 proteins are expressed in ventricular myocytes susceptible to I/R injury. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is among the main ROS overproduced during I/R. In the cardiomyocyte cell line H9c2, pretreatment with 9-Phe prevented cell death induced by conditions mimicking I/R, namely 200 \u03bcM H2O2 and hypoxia-reoxygenation. Gene silencing of TRPM4 preserved the viability of H9c2 cardiomyocytes exposed to 200 \u03bcM H2O2. These results suggest that the cardioprotective effects of 9-Phe are mediated through the inhibition of the TRPM4 channels.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-04-04", "authors": ["HulinPiao", "KenTakahashi", "YoheiYamaguchi", "ChenWang", "KexiangLiu", "KeijiNaruse"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0121703\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.11.004\n10.1007/s00395-013-0392-7\n10.1016/j.tcm.2014.03.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0070587\n10.1038/bjp.2008.38\n10.1152/ajpcell.00269.2010\n10.1152/ajpheart.00553.2011\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.11.142\n10.1007/s12272-012-1016-8\n10.1074/jbc.M110.155390\n10.1093/cvr/cvr135\n10.1016/j.bcp.2012.06.021"}

Given the physiological similarities between nonhuman primates and humans, isolated primate cardiac muscle cells are an ideal animal model for such in vitro testing. The aims of this chapter are to describe two methods for isolating and culturing primate cardiac muscle cells.

The other method also uses mechanical dissociation but is then followed by enzymatic digestion and culturing of the cell suspension.

The ability of native heart muscle to regenerate in response to myocardial infarct is minimal. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches represent one promising response to this difficulty. Here, we present methods for the construction of a cell-seeded cardiac patch with the potential to promote regenerative outcomes in heart muscle with damage secondary to myocardial infarct. This method leverages iPS cells and a fibrin-based scaffold to create a simple and commercially viable tissue-engineered cardiac patch. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can, in principle, be differentiated into cells of any lineage. However, most of the protocols used to generate hiPSC-derived endothelial cells (ECs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs) are unsatisfactory because the yield and phenotypic stability of the hiPSC-ECs are low, and the hiPSC-CMs are often purified via selection for expression of a promoter-reporter construct. In this chapter, we describe an hiPSC-EC differentiation protocol that generates large numbers of stable ECs and an hiPSC-CM differentiation protocol that does not require genetic manipulation, single-cell selection, or sorting with fluorescent dyes or other reagents.

The toxic mechanisms through which these adverse effects occur are currently unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the bioenergetic and cytotoxic effects of MeHg on AC16 and H9C2 cardiomyocyte cell lines. Both cell lines exhibit significantly decreased mitochondrial function, cell viability and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Decreases in maximal respiration and reserve capacity was observed in both cell lines at 1\u03bcM. Bioenergetic profile experiments were also performed in tandem with cells exposed to diamide or menadione, compounds which accumulate in mitochondria and disrupt oxidative phosphorylation. AC16 cells show MeHg dose dependant sensitivities with Stateapparent and ATP production values, but H9C2 cells do not show these trends. H9C2 cells may be more resistant to MeHg toxicity than AC16 cells as reflected in the increases of proton leak and Stateapparent. No changes in expression of respiratory complexes were observed.

Direct reprogramming of endogenous cardiac fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes via the delivery of transcription factor mRNAs has the potential to regenerate cardiac tissue and to treat heart failure. Even though mRNA delivery to cardiac fibroblasts has the therapeutic potential, mRNA transfection in cardiac fibroblasts has been challenging. Herein, we develop an efficient mRNA transfection in cultured mouse cardiac fibroblasts via a polyarginine-fused heart-targeting peptide and lipofectamine complex, termed C-Lipo and demonstrate the partial direct reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts towards cardiomyocyte cells. C-Lipo enabled the mRNA-induced direct cardiac reprogramming due to its efficient transfection with low toxicity, which allowed for multiple transfections of Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT) mRNAs for a period of 2 weeks. The induced cardiomyocyte-like cells had \u03b1-MHC promoter-driven GFP expression and striated cardiac muscle structure from \u03b1-actinin immunohistochemistry. GMT mRNA transfection of cultured mouse cardiac fibroblasts via C-Lipo significantly increased expression of the cardiomyocyte marker genes, Actc1, Actn2, Gja1, Hand2, and Tnnt2, after 2 weeks of transfection. Moreover, this study provides the first direct evidence that the stoichiometry of the GMT reprogramming factors influence the expression of cardiomyocyte marker genes.

In particular, in turbulent fluid flows, such unstable solutions are referred to as exact coherent structures (ECS) and play an important role in both initiating and sustaining turbulence. The nature of ECS and their role in organizing spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics, however, is reasonably well understood only for systems on relatively small spatial domains lacking continuous Euclidean symmetries. Construction of ECS on large domains and in the presence of continuous translational and/or rotational symmetries remains a challenge. This is especially true for models of excitable media which display spiral turbulence and for which the standard approach to computing ECS completely breaks down.

We tested the hypothesis that the administration of GHRH-As prevents ventricular remodeling in a swine subacute MI model.\nTwelve female Yorkshire swine (25 to 30 kg) underwent transient occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (MI). Two weeks post MI, swine were randomized to receive injections of either 30 \u03bcg/kg GHRH-A (MR-409) (GHRH-A group; n=6) or vehicle (placebo group; n=6).

In both of these cases, a decrease in the number of functional cardiomyocytes often results in improper growth of heart tissue, wound healing complications, and poor tissue repair. The field of cardiac tissue engineering seeks to address these concerns by developing cardiac patches created from a variety of biomaterial scaffolds to be used in surgical repair of the heart. These scaffolds should be fully degradable biomaterial systems with tunable properties such that the materials can be altered to meet the needs of both in vitro culture (e.g. disease modeling) and in vivo application (e.g. cardiac patch). Current platforms do not utilize both structural anisotropy and proper cell-matrix contacts to promote functional cardiac phenotypes and thus there is still a need for critically sized scaffolds that mimic both the structural and adhesive properties of native tissue. To address this need, we have developed a silk-based scaffold platform containing cardiac tissue-derived extracellular matrix (cECM). These silk-cECM composite scaffolds have tunable architectures, degradation rates, and mechanical properties. Subcutaneous implantation in rats demonstrated that addition of the cECM to aligned silk scaffold led to 99% endogenous cell infiltration and promoted vascularization of a critically sized scaffold (10 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 2.5\u2009mm) after 4\u2009weeks in vivo. In vitro, silk-cECM scaffolds maintained the HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and promoted a more functional phenotype in both cell types.

Diabetic cardiovascular complications are unequivocally benefitted from exercise; however, the molecular mechanisms need exploration. This novel study is based on our observation that exercise brings down the levels of activated (Matrix Metalloprotease 9) in db/db mice in a model of type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that exosomes that are released during exercise contain microRNAs (mir455, mir29b, mir323-5p and mir466) that bind to the 3' region of MMP9 and downregulate its expression, hence mitigating the deleterious downstream effects of MMP9, which causes extracellular matrix remodeling. First, we confirmed the presence of exosomes in the heart tissue and serum by electron microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively, in the four treatment groups: (i) db/control, (ii) db/control+exercise, (iii) db/db and (iv) db/db+exercise. Use of exosomal markers CD81, Flottilin 1, and acetylcholinesterase activity in the isolated exosomes confirmed enhanced exosomal release in the exercise group. The microRNAs isolated from the exosomes contained mir455, mir29b, mir323-5p and mir466 as quantified by qRTPCR, however, mir29b and mir455 showed highest upregulation. We performed 2D zymography which revealed significantly lowered activity of MMP9 in the db/db exercise group as compared to non-exercise group.

{"title": "Upregulated microRNA-214 enhances cardiac injury by targeting ITCH during coxsackievirus infection.", "abstract": "Viral myocarditis (VM), a severe clinical condition characterized by cardiac inflammation, is most frequently induced as a result of coxsackievirus infection. Evidence suggests that microRNAs may have significant roles in the progression of cardiac injury during coxsackievirus infection. Concurrently, microRNA (miR)-214 was found to be upregulated in the plasma and myocardial cells during this process. In the present study, eight candidate miRNAs, the functions of which are associated with myocarditis, were selected and their expression levels were evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. miR-146b and miR-214 were found to have significantly upregulated expression levels in the heart tissues of patients with VM compared with those of the control subjects. Predictions via the use of online bioinformatics tools and confirmed by dual-luciferase assay and western blot analysis, revealed that ITCH, an NF-\u03baB signaling suppressor, was a target gene of miR-214. To investigate the biological function of miR-214, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 expression levels were evaluated in HeLa cell culture supernatant. The results revealed that miR-214 overexpression enhanced the expression of the two cytokines. In addition, the function of miR-214 was partially rescued by ITCH overexpression. Subsequently, concurrent results were obtained following experiments in murine cardiac myocytes. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that miR-214 contributed to the adverse inflammatory response to viral infection of the heart during coxsackievirus infection and is therefore a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of viral myocarditis.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2015-03-31", "authors": ["Zhi-GangChen", "HuiLiu", "Jun-BiaoZhang", "Shao-LiZhang", "Li-HuaZhao", "Wan-QianLiang"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2015.3539"}
{"title": "The differential effects of a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist, U50488, in guinea pig heart tissues.", "abstract": "The differential effects of a selective kappa- (\u03ba-) opioid receptor agonist, U50488, were elucidated by monitoring the contraction of isolated guinea pig atrial and ventricular muscles. In electrically driven left atria, U50488 in nanomolar concentration range decreased the contractile force. Norbinaltorphimine (norBNI), a selective \u03ba-receptor antagonist, and pertussis toxin (PTX) abolished the negative inotropic effect of U50488. In contrast, the inhibitory effect was not affected by the pretreatment of atropine or propranolol. Even though U50488 exerted a negative inotropic effect in the left atrium, it did not affect the contractile force of the right atrium and ventricles paced at 2\u2009Hz. Similarly, the beating rate of the spontaneously beating right atrium was also unaffected by U50488. These results indicate that the activation of \u03ba-opioid receptors can only produce negative inotropic effect in left atria via activation of PTX-sensitive G protein in guinea pigs. The absence of negative inotropic effects in right atria and ventricles suggests that there may be a greater distribution of functional \u03ba-opioid receptors in guinea pig left atria than in right atria and ventricles, and the distribution of the receptors may be species-specific.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2015-03-31", "authors": ["Chi-FengHung", "Hsin-JuLi", "Hsun-HaoChang", "Gon-AnnLee", "Ming JaiSu"], "doi": "10.1155/2015/906039\n10.1007/s00380-013-0456-5\n10.1016/j.phrs.2014.04.008\n10.1007/s10517-010-0840-4\n10.1152/ajpheart.00091.2013\n10.1111/j.1472-8206.2000.tb00420.x\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.06.016\n10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181fa0437\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.11.012\n10.1007/s10517-007-0046-6\n10.1007/s00380-007-0983-z\n10.1016/0014-2999(96)00280-4\n10.1007/s00424-001-0743-3\n10.1016/0006-8993(95)01049-3\n10.1097/AAP.0b013e318274a8a1\n10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.12.007\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0705475\n10.1152/ajpregu.00893.2007\n10.3109/00365513.2011.589009\n10.1080/00207450500514219\n10.1007/BF03168225\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.031\n10.1002/jnr.23050\n10.1111/bcpt.12274\n10.1248/bpb.b12-00655\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.03.008\n10.1007/s00232-008-9113-9\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2009.05.030\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0704225\n10.1136/hrt.2006.102434\n10.1093/icvts/ivt516"}

By utilising conventional fluorescence dyes the same cellular structures can be imaged with both modalities. Human cardiac tissue was first imaged at the nanoscale to identify macro-molecular membrane complexes containing the cardiac muscle proteins junctophilin (JPH) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The distribution of these proteins and an additional cell membrane marker (wheat germ agglutinin, WGA) were subsequently imaged by confocal microscopy. By segmenting dSTORM data into membrane and non-membrane components we demonstrate increased colocalization of RyR with JPH at the plasma-membrane as compared to intracellular compartments.

{"title": "Unbreak my heart: targeting mitochondrial autophagy in diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Diabetes is strongly associated with increased incidence of heart disease and mortality due to development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Even in the absence of cardiovascular disease, cardiomyopathy frequently arises in diabetic patients. Current treatment options for cardiomyopathy in diabetic patients are the same as for nondiabetic patients and do not address the causes underlying the loss of contractility.\nAlthough there are numerous distinctions between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, recent evidence suggests that the two disease states converge on mitochondria as an epicenter for cardiomyocyte damage.\nAccumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria contributes to cardiac tissue injury in both acute and chronic conditions. Removal of damaged mitochondria by macroautophagy, termed \"mitophagy,\" is critical for maintaining cardiomyocyte health and contractility both under normal conditions and during stress. However, very little is known about the involvement of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. A growing interest in this topic has given rise to a wave of publications that aim at deciphering the status of autophagy and mitophagy in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.\nThis review summarizes these recent studies with the goal of drawing conclusions about the activation or suppression of autophagy and mitophagy in the diabetic heart.

The results indicated proliferation of heart muscle and coronary smooth muscle cells along with heart structural alteration, protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, inflammatory reaction, and hyperhomocysteinemia in offspring after 21 and 90 days of birth compared with the controls. Vitamin E treatment significantly decreased cell proliferation and heart structural alteration, compared with the group treated by ethanol alone. Furthermore, it reduced the elevation of protein carbonyl, lipid peroxidation, and increased inflammatory proteins to levels as those of the controls.

Body weight gain, biochemical markers and molecular markers for inflammation and cardiovascular disease in heart tissue were quantified. Results show that peach and plum juice consumption protected against a combination of obesity-induced metabolic disorders including hyperglycemia, insulin and leptin resistance, dyslipidemia and low-density lipoprotein oxidation. This was accompanied by a decreased expression of pro-atherogenic and pro-inflammatory biomarkers in plasma and heart tissues including intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, NF-\u03baB and foam cell adherence to aortic arches. In addition, peach and plum juice consumption decreased the levels of angiotensin II in plasma and its receptor Agtr1 in heart tissues, suggesting a role of peach and plum polyphenols as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 agonists. Furthermore, only plum juice significantly prevented body weight gain and increased the ratio high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol in plasma. This effect is most likely attributed to the plum's higher content of polyphenols (three times that of peach).

{"title": "An electrocardiographic, molecular and biochemical approach to explore the cardioprotective effect of vasopressin and milrinone against phosphide toxicity in rats.", "abstract": "The present study was conducted to identify the protective effect of vasopressin (AVP) and milrinone on cardiovascular function, mitochondrial complex activities, cellular ATP reserve, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in rats poisoned by aluminum phosphide (AlP). Rats were divided into five groups (n\u2009=\u200912) including control, AlP (12.5\u2009mg/kg), AlP\u2009+\u2009AVP (2.0\u2009Units/kg), AlP\u2009+\u2009milrinone (0.25\u2009mg/kg) and AlP\u2009+\u2009AVP\u2009+\u2009milrinone. After treatment, the animals were connected to an electronic cardiovascular monitoring device to monitor electrocardiographic (ECG) parameter. Finally, oxidative stress biomarkers, mitochondrial complex activities, ADP/ATP ratio and apoptosis were evaluated on the heart tissues. Results indicated that AlP administration induced ECG abnormalities along with a decline in blood pressure and heart rate. AVP and milrinone significantly ameliorated these changes in all treated groups. Considerable protective effects on oxidative stress biomarkers, complex IV activity, ADP/ATP ratio and caspase-3 and -9 activities in treated groups were also found. These findings were supported by flow cytometry assay of cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, administration of AVP and milrinone, not only improve cardiovascular functions in AlP poisoned rats in the short time, but after a long time can also restore mitochondrial function and ATP level and reduce the oxidative damage, which prevent cardiomyocytes from entering the apoptotic phase.", "journal": "Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association", "date": "2015-03-23", "authors": ["AbbasJafari", "AmirBaghaei", "RezaSolgi", "MaryamBaeeri", "MohsenChamanara", "ShokoufehHassani", "MahdiGholami", "Seyed NasserOstad", "MoahmmadSharifzadeh", "MohammadAbdollahi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fct.2015.02.022"}
{"title": "Suppression of TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling pathway by sesamin contributes to the attenuation of myocardial fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of sesamin on myocardial fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and the possible mechanisms involved. Twenty-eight male SHRs were randomly allocated to SHR group, Ses160 group (sesamin 160 mg/kg), Ses80 group (sesamin 80 mg/kg) and Cap30 group (captopril 30 mg/kg). Seven male WKY rats were used as control. Sesamin and captopril were administered intragastrically for 12 weeks. Captopril significantly reduced systolic blood pressure and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels in SHRs, accompanied by a marked attenuation of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and collagen deposition (P <0.05 or P <0.01). Though sesamin had no significant influence on Ang II levels, and the hypotensive effect was also significantly inferior to that of captopril (P <0.05 or P <0.01), however, the improvement of LVH and collagen deposition was similar to that in captopril group. Sesamin markedly reduced transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) content in cardiac tissues, with Smad3 phosphorylation decreased and Smad7 protein expression increased notably (P <0.05 or P <0.01). Protein expression of type I collagen and type III collagen, target genes of Smad3, was down-regulated markedly by sesamin (P <0.05 or P <0.01). In addition, sesamin significantly increased total antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase protein in cardiac tissues (P <0.05 or P <0.01), while the expression of NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox and malondialdehyde content were reduced markedly (P <0.05 or P <0.01). In vitro studies also demonstrated that sesamin was able to suppress Ang II induced phosphorylation of Smad3 and secretion of TGF-\u03b21 and type I and type III collagen in cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts.

Pentoxifylline (PTX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has immunoregulatory and cardioprotective properties. Here, we tested PTX effects on CD8+ T-cell abnormalities and cardiac alterations using a model of experimental Chagas' heart disease.\nC57BL/6 mice chronically infected by the Colombian Trypanosoma cruzi strain and presenting signs of CCC were treated with PTX. The downmodulation of T-cell receptors on CD8+ cells induced by T. cruzi infection was rescued by PTX therapy. Also, PTX reduced the frequency of CD8+ T-cells expressing activation and migration markers in the spleen and the activation of blood vessel endothelial cells and the intensity of inflammation in the heart tissue. Although preserved interferon-gamma production systemically and in the cardiac tissue, PTX therapy reduced the number of perforin+ cells invading this tissue. PTX did not alter parasite load, but hampered the progression of heart injury, improving connexin 43 expression and decreasing fibronectin overdeposition. Further, PTX reversed electrical abnormalities as bradycardia and prolonged PR, QTc and QRS intervals in chronically infected mice. Moreover, PTX therapy improved heart remodeling since reduced left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and restored the decreased LV ejection fraction.\nPTX therapy ameliorates critical aspects of CCC and repositioned CD8+ T-cell response towards homeostasis, reinforcing that immunological abnormalities are crucially linked, as cause or effect, to CCC. Therefore, PTX emerges as a candidate to treat the non-beneficial immune deregulation associated with chronic Chagas' heart disease and to improve prognosis.", "journal": "PLoS neglected tropical diseases", "date": "2015-03-20", "authors": ["Isabela ResendePereira", "GlauciaVilar-Pereira", "Otacilio CruzMoreira", "Isalira PerobaRamos", "DanielGibaldi", "Constan\u00e7aBritto", "Milton Oz\u00f3rioMoraes", "JoseliLannes-Vieira"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0003659\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61671-2\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60061-X\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1002645\n10.1159/000329494\n10.1016/j.coi.2009.07.006\n10.1155/2014/798078\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfn040\n10.1016/j.meegid.2011.12.009\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002000\n10.1007/s00210-012-0729-z\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2008.08.007\n10.1016/j.micinf.2008.11.012\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.802918\n10.4049/jimmunol.0903701\n10.1146/annurev-immunol-032713-120145\n10.3109/08958378.2010.493900\n10.1128/IAI.01459-08\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1004594\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0001644\n10.1136/hrt.2010.210047\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.653584\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2012.06.003"}

Polycaprolactone and a poly(ester-ether-ester) block copolymer synthesized in our lab, polycaprolactone-poly(ethylene oxide)-polycaprolactone (PCL-PEO-PCL), were used as the substrates to be modified. Two pentapeptides, H-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-OH (GRGDS) from fibronectin and H-Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg-OH (YIGSR) from laminin, were used for the functionalization. Polymeric membranes were obtained by casting from solutions and then functionalized by means of alkaline hydrolysis and subsequent coupling of the bioactive molecules through 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry. The hydrolysis conditions, in terms of hydrolysis time, temperature, and sodium hydroxide concentration, were optimized for the two materials. The occurrence of the coupling reaction was demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy, as the presence on the functionalized materials of the absorption peaks typical of the two peptides. The peptide surface density was determined by chromatographic analysis and the distribution was studied by infrared chemical imaging. The results showed a nearly homogeneous peptide distribution, with a density above the minimum value necessary to promote cell adhesion.

This study aims to investigate the protective effects of the total flavonoids from Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Ktze (TFCC) against doxorubicin- (DOX-) induced cardiotoxicity. Male rats were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of DOX (3\u2009mg/kg) every 2 days for three injections. Heart samples were collected 2 weeks after the last DOX dose and then analyzed. DOX delayed body and heart growth and caused cardiac tissue injury, oxidative stress, apoptotic damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Bcl-2 expression disturbance. Similar experiments in H9C2 cardiomyocytes showed that doxorubicin reduced cell viability, increased ROS generation and DNA fragmentation, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, and induced apoptotic cell death. However, TFCC pretreatment suppressed all of these adverse effects of doxorubicin. Signal transduction studies indicated that TFCC suppressed DOX-induced overexpression of p53 and phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and ERK.

Cells were treated with inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and Wnt production and secretion in a time-dependent and sequential manner, as has been demonstrated successful for cardiac differentiation of embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. Cells were then analyzed for gene and protein expression of markers along the cardiac lineage at multiple days during the differentiation protocol.

The discovery of the cardiac secretomes, collectively known as \"cardiokines\", has significantly enhanced appreciation of the local microenvironment's influence on disease development. Recent studies demonstrated that C1q-TNF-related protein-9 (CTRP9), a newly discovered adiponectin (APN) paralog, is highly expressed in the heart. However, its relationship with APN (concerning diabetic cardiovascular injury in particular) remains unknown. Plasma CTRP9 levels are elevated in APN knockout and reduced in diabetic mice. In contrast to APN, which circulates as full-length multimers, CTRP9 circulates in the plasma primarily in the globular domain isoform (gCTRP9). Recombinant full-length CTRP9 (fCTRP9) was cleaved when incubated with cardiac tissue extracts, generating gCTRP9, a process inhibited by protease inhibitor cocktail. gCTRP9 rapidly activates cardiac survival kinases, including AMPK, Akt, and endothelial NOS. However, fCTRP9-mediated kinase activation is much less potent and significantly delayed. Kinase activation by fCTRP9, but not gCTRP9, is inhibited by protease inhibitor cocktail. These results demonstrate for the first time that the novel cardiokine CTRP9 undergoes proteolytic cleavage to generate gCTRP9, the dominant circulatory and actively cardioprotective isoform.

{"title": "Downregulation of beta-microglobulin to diminish T-lymphocyte lysis of non-syngeneic cell sources of engineered heart tissue constructs.", "abstract": "The presence of non-autologous major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules on the surface of the grafted cells is one of the main reasons for their rejection in non-syngeneic hosts. We present a straightforward strategy to decrease the presence of MHC-I by shRNA inhibition of beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), a conservative light chain of MHC-I, on the surface of two main cell types that are used to engineer heart tissue constructs. Engineered heart tissue constructs can be generated by combining mouse WT19 fibroblasts and mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (mESC-CM). WT19 fibroblasts were stably transduced with an anti-B2M shRNA, which yielded a cell line with dramatically reduced B2M expression levels (16 \u00b1 11% of mock treated control cell line). Interferon gamma treatment increased the levels of B2M expression by >3-fold in both control and transduced fibroblasts; yet, B2M expression levels still remained very low in the transduced cells. When compared with their unmodified counterparts, transduced fibroblasts caused 5.7-fold lesser activation of cognate T-cells. B2M depletion in mESC-CM was achieved by 72\u2009h transduction with anti-B2M shRNA lentiviral particles. Transduced mESC-CM exhibited regular beating and expressed classical cardiac markers. When compared with their unmodified counterparts, transduced mESC-CM caused 2.5-fold lesser activation of cognate T-cells. In vivo assessment of B2M downregulation was performed by analyzing the preferential survival of B2M-downregulated cells in the intraperitoneal cavity of allogeneic mice. Both B2M-downregulated fibroblasts and B2M-downregulated myocytes survived significantly better when compared to their unmodified counterparts (2.01 \u00b1 0.4 and 5.07 \u00b1 1.6 fold increase in survival, respectively).

The application of this technology to biological structures that match the complexity of native tissue is of great interest to researchers. This mini-review highlights the current progress of 3D printing for fabricating artificial tissues of the cardiovascular system, specifically the myocardium, heart valves, and coronary arteries. In addition, how 3D printed sensors and actuators can play a role in tissue engineering is discussed. To date, all the work with building 3D cardiac tissues have been proof-of-principle demonstrations, and in most cases, yielded products less effective than other traditional tissue engineering strategies.

{"title": "CREG1 ameliorates myocardial fibrosis associated with autophagy activation and Rab7 expression.", "abstract": "In cardiomyocytes subjected to stress, autophagy activation is a critical survival mechanism that preserves cellular energy status while degrading damaged proteins and organelles. However, little is known about the mechanisms that govern this autophagic response. Cellular repressor of E1A genes (CREG1) is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal protein, and an important new factor in regulating tissues homeostasis that has been shown to antagonize injury of tissues or cells. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the regulatory role of CREG1 in cardiac autophagy, and to clarify autophagy activation mechanisms. First, we generated a CREG1 haploinsufficiency (Creg1(+/-)) mouse model, and identified that CREG1 deficiency aggravates myocardial fibrosis in response to aging or angiotensin II (Ang II). Conversely, exogenous infusion of recombinant CREG1 protein complete reversed cardiac damage. CERG1 deficiency in Creg1(+/-) mouse heart showed a market accumulation of autophagosome that acquired LC3II and beclin-1, and a decrease in autophagic flux clearance as indicated by upregulating the level of p62. Inversely, restoration of CREG1 activates cardiac autophagy, Furthermore, chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification, was used to confirm that CREG1 protected the heart tissue against Ang II-induced fibrosis by activating autophagy. Using adenoviral infection of primary cardiomyocytes, overexpression of CREG1 with concurrent resveratrol treatment significantly increased autophagy, while silencing CREG1 blocked the resveratrol-induced autophagy. These results suggest that CREG1-induced autophagy is required to maintain heart function in the face of stress-induced myocardiac damage. Both in vitro and in vivo studies identified that CREG1 deficiency influenced the maturation of lysosomes and reduced the espression of Rab7, which might be involved in CREG1-induced cardiomyocyte autophagy. These findings suggest that autophagy activation via CREG1 may be a viable therapeutic strategy autophagy for improving cardiac performance under pathologic conditions.

The incidence and duration of VA were monitored among different groups. The ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), the ERP dispersion and the ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) were measured during the experiments. Norepinephrine (NE) levels in CS blood and cardiac tissue were also detected in this study.\nThe incidence and duration of VA in MI-ablation group were significantly reduced as compared to the MI dogs (p<0.05). Furthermore, local cardiac denervation drastically prolonged the ventricular ERP in the ischemia area, decreased the ERP dispersion, and reduced NE levels in CS blood (P<0.05). VFT also showed an increased trend in the AMI-ablation group.\nThe results of this study indicate that, in the canine AMI model, local ablation of CS and GCV peripheral nerves reduces VA occurrence and improves ventricular electrical stability with no obvious effects on heart rate, mean arterial pressure and infarct size.

Recently, Serine 199 (Ser199) was identified as a target for PKC phosphorylation and increased Ser199 phosphorylation occurs in end-stage failing compared with non-failing human myocardium. The functional consequences of cTnI-Ser199 phosphorylation in the heart are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the impact of phosphorylation of cTnI-Ser199 on myofilament function in human cardiac tissue and the susceptibility of cTnI to proteolysis. cTnI-Ser199 was replaced by aspartic acid (199D) or alanine (199A) to mimic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively, with recombinant wild-type (Wt) cTn as a negative control. Force development was measured at various [Ca(2+)] and at sarcomere lengths of 1.8 and 2.2 \u03bcm in demembranated cardiomyocytes in which endogenous cTn complex was exchanged with the recombinant human cTn complexes. In idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy samples, myofilament Ca(2+)-sensitivity (pCa50) at 2.2 \u03bcm was significantly higher in 199D (pCa50 = 5.79 \u00b1 0.01) compared to 199A (pCa50 = 5.65 \u00b1 0.01) and Wt (pCa50 = 5.66 \u00b1 0.02) at ~63% cTn exchange. Myofilament Ca(2+)-sensitivity was significantly higher even with only 5.9 \u00b1 2.5% 199D exchange compared to 199A, and saturated at 12.3 \u00b1 2.6% 199D exchange. Ser199 pseudo-phosphorylation decreased cTnI binding to both actin and actin-tropomyosin. Moreover, altered susceptibility of cTnI to proteolysis by calpain I was found when Ser199 was pseudo-phosphorylated. Our data demonstrate that low levels of cTnI-Ser199 pseudo-phosphorylation (~6%) increase myofilament Ca(2+)-sensitivity in human cardiomyocytes, most likely by decreasing the binding affinity of cTnI for actin-tropomyosin.

However, the limited availability of these cells restricts their utility for cardiac cellular therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into a wide variety of tissues, but it is not simple to accurately direct cell differentiation into a specific lineage, such as cardiac tissue; this renders a low efficiency for cardiac regeneration therapy. Given the heterogeneity of mesenchymal stem cells, it may be possible to find specific stem cell subpopulations with a definite differentiation capacity toward cardiac lineage. A parameter to assess cardiac differentiation specificity could be surface marker expression; a population with an immunophenotype similar to cardiac stem cells may have a superior therapeutic value than unsorted mesenchymal stem cells.

We used a computational model to simulate episodes of fibrillation, which we then characterized in terms of both their duration and the population dynamics of the electrical waves which drove them. Monte Carlo sampling revealed that episode durations followed an exponential decay distribution and wave population sizes followed a normal distribution. Half-lives of reentrant episodes increased exponentially with either increasing tissue area to boundary length ratio (A/BL) or decreasing action potential duration (APD), resistance (R) or capacitance (C). We found that the qualitative form of fibrillatory activity (e.g., multi-wavelet reentry (MWR) vs. rotors) was dependent on the ratio of resistance and capacitance to APD; MWR was reliably produced below a ratio of 0.18. We found that a composite of these electrophysiologic parameters, which we term the fibrillogenicity index (Fb = A/(BL*APD*R*C)), reliably predicted the duration of MWR episodes (r2 = 0.93).

{"title": "Plasma vs heart tissue concentration in humans - literature data analysis of drugs distribution.", "abstract": "Little is known about the uptake of drugs into the human heart, although it is of great importance nowadays, when science desires to predict tissue level behavior rather than to measure it. Although the drug concentration in cardiac tissue seems a better predictor for physiological and electrophysiological changes than its level in plasma, knowledge of this value is very limited. Tissue to plasma partition coefficients (Kp) come to rescue since they characterize the distribution of a drug among tissues as being one of the input parameters in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. The article reviews cardiac surgery and forensic medical studies to provide a reference for drug concentrations in human cardiac tissue. Firstly, the focus is on whether a drug penetrates into heart tissue at a therapeutic level; the provided values refer to antibiotics, antifungals and anticancer drugs. Drugs that directly affect cardiomyocyte electrophysiology are another group of interest. Measured levels of amiodarone, digoxin, perhexiline and verapamil in different sites in human cardiac tissue where the compounds might meet ion channels, gives an insight into how these more lipophilic drugs penetrate the heart. Much data are derived from postmortem studies and they provide insight to the cardiac distribution of more than 200 drugs. The analysis depicts potential problems in defining the active concentration location, what may indirectly suggest multiple mechanisms involved in the drug distribution within the heart.

{"title": "Extrapolating histone marks across developmental stages, tissues, and species: an enhancer prediction case study.", "abstract": "Dynamic activation and inactivation of gene regulatory DNA produce the expression changes that drive the differentiation of cellular lineages. Identifying regulatory regions active during developmental transitions is necessary to understand how the genome specifies complex developmental programs and how these processes are disrupted in disease. Gene regulatory dynamics are mediated by many factors, including the binding of transcription factors (TFs) and the methylation and acetylation of DNA and histones. Genome-wide maps of TF binding and DNA and histone modifications have been generated for many cellular contexts; however, given the diversity and complexity of animal development, these data cover only a small fraction of the cellular and developmental contexts of interest. Thus, there is a need for methods that use existing epigenetic and functional genomics data to analyze the thousands of contexts that remain uncharacterized.\nTo investigate the utility of histone modification data in the analysis of cellular contexts without such data, I evaluated how well genome-wide H3K27ac and H3K4me1 data collected in different developmental stages, tissues, and species were able to predict experimentally validated heart enhancers active at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) in mouse. Using a machine-learning approach to integrate the data from different contexts, I found that E11.5 heart enhancers can often be predicted accurately from data from other contexts, and I quantified the contribution of each data source to the predictions. The utility of each dataset correlated with nearness in developmental time and tissue to the target context: data from late developmental stages and adult heart tissues were most informative for predicting E11.5 enhancers, while marks from stem cells and early developmental stages were less informative. Predictions based on data collected in non-heart tissues and in human hearts were better than random, but worse than using data from mouse hearts.\nThe ability of these algorithms to accurately predict developmental enhancers based on data from related, but distinct, cellular contexts suggests that combining computational models with epigenetic data sampled from relevant contexts may be sufficient to enable functional characterization of many cellular contexts of interest.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2015-03-15", "authors": ["John ACapra"], "doi": "10.1186/s12864-015-1264-3\n10.1038/nrg2957\n10.1038/nrg2814\n10.1038/nature07829\n10.1073/pnas.1016071107\n10.1038/nrg3682\n10.1038/nature11247\n10.1038/nbt1010-1045\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.08.027\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.07.035\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.04.022\n10.1038/nature12433\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.12.033\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.07.020\n10.1016/j.molcel.2012.06.019\n10.1101/gr.152140.112\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003677\n10.1093/nar/gkl822\n10.1038/ng.650\n10.1038/ng.1006\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1002531\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002968\n10.1242/dev.101709\n10.1023/A:1010933404324\n10.1126/science.1186176\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1001316\n10.1038/nature10532\n10.1126/science.1124070\n10.1073/pnas.1315155110\n10.1098/rstb.2012.0366\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.11.033\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btu445\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btq033\n10.1006/jcss.1997.1504"}

Alterations thereof are linked to a number of human disorders including diabetes and cardiomyopathy. The MICOS complex was recently reported to be a central player determining cristae structure and formation of crista junctions. Here we investigated the functional role of MIC26, a lipoprotein formerly termed APOO. Its levels are increased in diabetic heart tissue and in blood plasma of patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome. We demonstrate that human MIC26 exists in three distinct forms: (1) a glycosylated and secreted 55kDa protein, (2) an ER/Golgi-resident form thereof, and (3) a non-glycosylated 22kDa mitochondrial protein. The latter isoform spans the mitochondrial inner membrane and physically interacts with several MICOS complex subunits such as MIC60, MIC27, and MIC10. We further demonstrate that MIC26 and MIC27, a homologous protein formerly termed APOOL, regulate their levels in an antagonistic manner. Both proteins are positively correlated with the levels of MIC10 as well as tafazzin, an enzyme required for cardiolipin remodeling. Overexpression of MIC26 induced fragmentation of mitochondria, promoted ROS formation and resulted in impaired mitochondrial respiration. Downregulation of MIC26 induced a decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, whereas mitochondrial network morphology and ROS levels remained unaffected. MIC26 depletion led to alterations in mitochondrial ultrastructure and caused a significant reduction in the number of crista junctions.

Increased normalized ventricle weights and fibrosis were detected after intraperitoneal administration of PMT in combination with the GPCR agonist phenylephrine. In neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, PMT stimulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which is crucial for the development of cellular hypertrophy. The toxin induced phosphorylation of the canonical phosphorylation sites of the extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 and, additionally, caused phosphorylation of the recently recognized autophosphorylation site, which appears to be important for the development of cellular hypertrophy. Moreover, PMT stimulated the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA. Both switch proteins are involved in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In addition, PMT stimulated RhoA and Rac1 in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts. RhoA and Rac1 have been implicated in the regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) secretion and expression.

{"title": "RoY peptide-modified chitosan-based hydrogel to improve angiogenesis and cardiac repair under hypoxia.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) still represents the \"Number One Killer\" in the world. The lack of functional vasculature of the infracted myocardium under hypoxia is one of the main problems for cardiac repair. In this study, a thermosensitive chitosan chloride-RoY (CSCl-RoY) hydrogel was developed to improve angiogenesis under hypoxia after MI. First, RoY peptides were conjugated onto the CSCl chain via amide linkages, and our data show that the conjugation of RoY peptide to CSCl does not interfere with the temperature sensitivity. Then, the effect of CSCl-RoY hydrogels on vascularization in vitro under hypoxia was investigated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Results show that CSCl-RoY hydrogels can promote the survival, proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs under hypoxia compared with CSCl hydrogel. Further investigations suggest that CSCl-RoY hydrogels can modulate the expression of membrane surface GRP78 receptor of HUVECs under hypoxia and then activate Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways related to cell survival/proliferation, thereby enhancing angiogenic activity of HUVECs under hypoxia. To assess its therapeutic properties in vivo, a MI model was induced in rats by the left anterior descending artery ligation. CSCl or CSCl-RoY hydrogels were injected into the border of infracted hearts. The results demonstrate that the introduction of RoY peptide can not only improve angiogenesis at MI region but also improve the cardiac functions. Overall, we conclude that the CSCl-RoY may represent an ideal scaffold material for injectable cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2015-03-11", "authors": ["YaoShu", "TongHao", "FanglianYao", "YufengQian", "YanWang", "BoguangYang", "JunjieLi", "ChangyongWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.5b01234"}
{"title": "Structural defects lead to dynamic entrapment in cardiac electrophysiology.", "abstract": "Biological networks are typically comprised of many parts whose interactions are governed by nonlinear dynamics. This potentially imbues them with the ability to support multiple attractors, and therefore to exhibit correspondingly distinct patterns of behavior. In particular, multiple attractors have been demonstrated for the electrical activity of the diseased heart in situations where cardioversion is able to convert a reentrant arrhythmia to a stable normal rhythm. Healthy hearts, however, are typically resilient to abnormal rhythms. This raises the question as to how a healthy cardiac cell network must be altered so that it can support multiple distinct behaviors. Here we demonstrate how anatomic defects can give rise to multi-stability in the heart as a function of the electrophysiological properties of the cardiac tissue and the timing of activation of ectopic foci. This leads to a form of hysteretic behavior, which we call dynamic entrapment, whereby the heart can become trapped in aberrant attractor as a result of a transient change in tissue properties. We show that this can lead to a highly inconsistent relationship between clinical symptoms and underlying pathophysiology, which raises the possibility that dynamic entrapment may underlie other forms of chronic idiopathic illness.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-03-11", "authors": ["Oliver R JBates", "BelaSuki", "Peter SSpector", "Jason H TBates"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0119535\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2009.07.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0014413\n10.1143/PTPS.139.83\n10.1063/1.2740673\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150106\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.961524\n10.1053/euhj.1999.1842\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.03.018\n10.1038/nm0303-241\n10.1073/pnas.1210047110\n10.1016/S0006-3495(81)84778-9\n10.1073/pnas.0504511102\n10.1209/0295-5075/103/50003\n10.1103/PhysRevE.75.011929\n10.1371/journal.pone.0004738\n10.1103/PhysRevE.61.6448\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.656504\n10.1056/NEJM199809033391003\n10.1103/PhysRevE.66.061903\n10.1063/1.1501176\n10.1161/01.CIR.92.7.1954\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e318214876d\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb48723.x\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.03.033"}

Even subtle alterations of Na(V)1.5 function, as caused by mutations in its gene SCN5A, may lead to many different arrhythmic phenotypes in carrier patients. In addition, acquired malfunctions of Na(V)1.5 that are secondary to cardiac disorders such as heart failure and cardiomyopathies, may also play significant roles in arrhythmogenesis. While it is clear that the regulation of Na(V)1.5 protein expression and function tightly depends on genetic mechanisms, recent studies have demonstrated that Na(V)1.5 is the target of various post-translational modifications that are pivotal not only in physiological conditions, but also in disease. In this review, we examine the recent literature demonstrating glycosylation, phosphorylation by Protein Kinases A and C, Ca(2+)/Calmodulin-dependent protein Kinase II, Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase, Serum- and Glucocorticoid-inducible Kinases, Fyn and Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase, methylation, acetylation, redox modifications, and ubiquitylation of Na(V)1.5. Modern and sensitive mass spectrometry approaches, applied directly to channel proteins that were purified from native cardiac tissues, have enabled the determination of the precise location of post-translational modification sites, thus providing essential information for understanding the mechanistic details of these regulations. The current challenge is first, to understand the roles of these modifications on the expression and the function of Na(V)1.5, and second, to further identify other chemical modifications.

{"title": "The emperor's new clothes: PDE5 and the heart.", "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) is highly expressed in the pulmonary vasculature, but its expression in the myocardium is controversial. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) activates protein kinase G (PKG), which has been hypothesized to blunt cardiac hypertrophy and negative remodeling in heart failure. Although PDE5 has been suggested to play a significant role in the breakdown of cGMP in cardiomyocytes and hence PKG regulation in the myocardium, the RELAX trial, which tested effect of PDE5 inhibition on exercise capacity in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) failed to show a beneficial effect. These results highlight the controversy regarding the role and expression of PDE5 in the healthy and failing heart. This study used one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting to examine PDE5 expression in mouse (before and after trans-aortic constriction), dog (control and HFpEF) as well as human (healthy and failing) heart. We were unable to detect PDE5 in any cardiac tissue lysate, whereas PDE5 was present in the murine and bovine lung samples used as positive controls. These results indicate that if PDE5 is expressed in cardiac tissue, it is present in very low quantities, as PDE5 was not detected in either humans or any model of heart failure examined. Therefore in cardiac muscle, it is unlikely that PDE5 is involved the regulation of cGMP-PKG signaling, and hence PDE5 does not represent a suitable drug target for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.

Emerging evidence suggests a significant role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AF. That evidence includes elevated serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers in AF subjects, the expression of inflammatory markers in cardiac tissues of AF patients and animal models of AF, and beneficial effects of anti-inflammatory drugs in experimental AF paradigms. Inflammation is suggested to be linked to various pathological processes, such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis, that promote AF substrate formation. Inflammation has also been associated with endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, and coagulation cascade activation, leading to thrombogenesis. Thus, inflammation may contribute to both the occurrence/maintenance of AF and its thromboembolic complications.

The results showed that combination with ASIV significantly attenuated the pathological changes, reduced the ratios of heart weight/body weight and Left ventricular weight/body weight, improved the cardiac hemodynamics, down-regulated mRNA expression of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), increased the ratio of ATP/AMP, and decreased the content of Free Fat Acid (FFA) in heart tissue of rats compared with Iso alone. In addition, pretreatment with ASIV significantly decreased the surface area and protein content, down-regulated mRNA expression of ANP and BNP, increased the ratio of ATP/AMP, and decreased the content of FFA in NRVMs compared with Iso alone. Furthermore, ASIV increased the protein expression of ATP5D, subunit of ATP synthase and PGC-1\u03b1, inhibited translocation of p65, subunit of NF-\u03baB into nuclear fraction in both rats and NRVMs compared with Iso alone. Parthenolide (Par), the specific inhibitor of p65, exerted similar effects as ASIV in NRVMs. Knockdown of p65 with siRNA decreased the surface areas and increased PGC-1\u03b1 expression of NRVMs compared with Iso alone. The results suggested that ASIV protects against Iso-induced cardiac hypertrophy through regulating NF-\u03baB/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling mediated energy biosynthesis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-03-05", "authors": ["SupingZhang", "FutianTang", "YuhongYang", "MeiliLu", "AinaLuan", "JingZhang", "JuanYang", "HongxinWang"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0118759\n10.4149/gpb_2012_015\n10.1093/cvr/cvq376\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.09.002\n10.1101/sqb.2011.76.011965\n10.1016/j.tibs.2012.04.002\n10.1055/s-0033-1360129\n10.1111/micc.12074\n10.1002/ptr.3331\n10.1155/2013/480597\n10.1155/2013/378298\n10.1093/cvr/cvn301\n10.1093/cvr/cvq080\n10.1093/cvr/cvq185\n10.1093/cvr/cvn327"}
{"title": "Mitochondrial dynamics in diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Cardiac function is energetically demanding, reliant on efficient well-coupled mitochondria to generate adenosine triphosphate and fulfill the cardiac demand. Predictably then, mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with cardiac pathologies, often related to metabolic disease, most commonly diabetes. Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), characterized by decreased left ventricular function, arises independently of coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis. Dysregulation of Ca(2+) handling, metabolic changes, and oxidative stress are observed in DCM, abnormalities reflected in alterations in mitochondrial energetics. Cardiac tissue from DCM patients also presents with altered mitochondrial morphology, suggesting a possible role of mitochondrial dynamics in its pathological progression.\nAbnormal mitochondrial morphology is associated with pathologies across diverse tissues, suggesting that this highly regulated process is essential for proper cell maintenance and physiological homeostasis. Highly structured cardiac myofibers were hypothesized to limit alterations in mitochondrial morphology; however, recent work has identified morphological changes in cardiac tissue, specifically in DCM.\nMitochondrial dysfunction has been reported independently from observations of altered mitochondrial morphology in DCM. The temporal relationship and causative nature between functional and morphological changes of mitochondria in the establishment/progression of DCM is unclear.\nAltered mitochondrial energetics and morphology are not only causal for but also consequential to reactive oxygen species production, hence exacerbating oxidative damage through reciprocal amplification, which is integral to the progression of DCM. Therefore, targeting mitochondria for DCM will require better mechanistic characterization of morphological distortion and bioenergetic dysfunction.", "journal": "Antioxidants & redox signaling", "date": "2015-03-05", "authors": ["Chad AGalloway", "YisangYoon"], "doi": "10.1089/ars.2015.6293"}

By modulating the level of NPs, NPR3 plays an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis. Although the physiological functions of NPR3 have been explored, little is known about its regulation in health or disease. MicroRNAs play an essential role in the post-transcriptional expression of many genes. Our aim was to investigate potential microRNA-based regulation of NPR3 in multiple models. Hypoxic challenge elevated levels of NPPB and ADM mRNA, as well as NT-proBNP and MR-proADM in human left ventricle derived cardiac cells (HCMa), and in the corresponding conditioned medium, as revealed by qRT-PCR and ELISA. NPR3 was decreased while NPR1 was increased by hypoxia at mRNA and protein levels in HCMa. Down-regulation of NPR3 mRNA was also observed in infarct and peri-infarct cardiac tissue from rats undergoing myocardial infarction. From microRNA microarray analyses and microRNA target predictive databases, miR-100 was selected as a candidate regulator of NPR3 expression. Further analyses confirmed up-regulation of miR-100 in hypoxic cells and associated conditioned media. Antagomir-based silencing of miR-100 enhanced NPR3 expression in HCMa. Furthermore, miR-100 levels were markedly up-regulated in rat hearts and in peripheral blood after myocardial infarction and in the blood from heart failure patients.

The Ca(2+) sequestering activity of SERCA facilitates muscular relaxation in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. There are more than 10 distinct isoforms of SERCA expressed in different tissues. SERCA2a is the primary isoform expressed in cardiac tissue, whereas SERCA1a is the predominant isoform expressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscle. The Ca(2+) sequestering activity of SERCA is regulated at the level of protein content and is further modified by the endogenous proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Additionally, several novel mechanisms, including post-translational modifications and microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as integral regulators of Ca(2+) transport activity. These regulatory mechanisms are clinically relevant, as dysregulated SERCA function has been implicated in the pathology of several disease states, including heart failure. Currently, several clinical trials are underway that utilize novel therapeutic approaches to restore SERCA2a activity in humans. The purpose of this review is to examine the regulatory mechanisms of the SERCA pump, with a particular emphasis on the influence of exercise in preventing the pathological conditions associated with impaired SERCA function.", "journal": "Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology", "date": "2015-03-03", "authors": ["Andrew NStammers", "Shanel ESusser", "Naomi CHamm", "Michael WHlynsky", "Dustin EKimber", "D ScottKehler", "Todd ADuhamel"], "doi": "10.1139/cjpp-2014-0463"}

However, the molecular mechanism underlying Fbxo25-mediated ubiquitination of cardiac transcription factors remains elusive. We report that an Fbxo25-mediated SCF ubiquitination pathway regulates the protein levels and activities of Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 based on our studies using MG132, proteasome inhibitor, and the temperature sensitive ubiquitin system in ts20 cells. Our data indicate that Fbxo25 directly interacts with Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 in vitro and in vivo. In support of our findings, a dominant-negative mutant of Fbxo25, Fbxo251-236, prevents Tbx5 degradation and increases Tbx5 transcriptional activity in a Tbx5 responsive luciferase assay. Therefore, Fbxo25 facilitates Tbx5 degradation in an SCF-dependent manner. In addition, the silencing of endogenous Fbxo25 increases Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 mRNA levels and suppresses mESC-derived cardiomyocyte differentiation. Likewise, the exogenous expression of FBXO25 downregulates NKX2-5 level in human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes. In myocardial infarction model, Fbxo25 mRNA decreases, whereas the mRNA and protein levels of Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 increase. The protein levels of Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 are regulated negatively by Fbxo25-mediated SCF ubiquitination pathway. Thus, our findings reveal a novel mechanism for regulation of SCFFbox25-dependent Nkx2-5 and Tbx5 ubiquitination in cardiac development and provide a new insight into the regulatory mechanism of Nkx2-5 and Tbx5 transcriptional activity.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2015-03-01", "authors": ["Hoe-SuJeong", "Eun-ShilJung", "Ye-JiSim", "Su-JinKim", "Jae-WooJang", "Ki-SungHong", "Won-YoungLee", "Hyung-MinChung", "Kyung-TaePark", "Yi-SookJung", "Chang-HoonKim", "Kye-SeongKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbagrm.2015.02.002"}

Cardiac tissue specimens were collected and subjected to pathologic assessment, metallothionein (MT) concentration measurement and Western blot analysis of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), the marker of autophagy, and glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78), an oxidative stress marker. High-fat diet feeding followed by STZ administration resulted in weight loss, hyperglycemia, polydipsia, polyphagia, hemodynamic anomalies and a significant increase in the myocardial content of LC3 and GRP78 proteins, but not in MT protein. Zn supplementation effectively attenuated all these aberrations induced by high-fat diet and STZ.

Using a ghrelin receptor agonist (GSK894281), a compound that produces myocardial degeneration/necrosis in rats after 28 days at doses of 0.3, 1, 10, or 60 mg/kg/d, we dosed rats across a range of similar doses (0, 0.3, 60, or 150 mg/kg/d) for 7 days to determine whether CV toxicity could be detected in a shorter study.

This is of great importance when manufacturing tissue-engineering scaffolds using an electrospinning process. In this study, we report the development of a novel process whereby additional aluminum foil layers were applied to the accumulated electrospun fibers of an existing aluminum foil collector, effectively reducing the incidence of charge buildup. Using this process, we fabricated an electrospun scaffold with a large pore (pore size >40 \u03bcm) while simultaneously controlling the thickness. We demonstrate that the large pore size triggered rapid infiltration (160 \u03bcm in 4 hours of cell culture) of individual endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and rapid cell colonization after seeding EPC spheroids. We confirmed that the 3D, but not two-dimensional, scaffold structures regulated tubular structure formation by the EPCs. Thus, incorporation of stem cells into a highly porous 3D scaffold with tunable thickness has implications for the regeneration of vascularized thick tissues and cardiac patch development.", "journal": "International journal of nanomedicine", "date": "2015-02-25", "authors": ["Jong KyuHong", "Ju YupBang", "GuanXu", "Jun-HeeLee", "Yeon-JuKim", "Ho-JunLee", "Han SeongKim", "Sang-MoKwon"], "doi": "10.2147/IJN.S73096"}

In both ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, myocardial dysfunction or damage frequently results in the development of heart failure, characterized by dyspnea, fatigue and reduced survival. As one of the least regenerative organs in the human body, current standards of care are limited to mitigating loss and preventing recurrence of damage, rather than stimulating actual regeneration of functional heart tissue. Cell based therapies using progenitor cells from bone marrow and the heart itself have been evaluated in preclinical models, and have demonstrated some promise. Accordingly, several clinical trials using autologous stem and progenitor cells have been performed, showing that these cells can be used safely in humans, and suggesting that they may improve relevant clinical parameters in patients with heart disease. Two specific cell populations that are particularly promising are the bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and the heart muscle derived cardiac stem cell (CSC). This review will summarize preclinical studies evaluating these stem cell populations and will discuss the clinical application of these cells in contemporary clinical trials, and potential future investigations.", "journal": "Pharmacology & therapeutics", "date": "2015-02-25", "authors": ["JiyeonKim", "LindaShapiro", "AidanFlynn"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pharmthera.2015.02.003"}

A synthetic prostacyclin agonist, ONO-1301, has been developed as a long-acting drug for acute and chronic pathologies related to regional ischaemia, inflammation and/or interstitial fibrosis by pre-clinical studies. In addition, poly-lactic co-glycolic acid-polymerised form of ONO-1301, ONO-1301SR, was generated to achieve a further sustained release of this drug into the targeted region. This unique reagent has been shown to act on fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in the tissue via the prostaglandin IP receptor to exert paracrinal release of multiple protective factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor or stromal cell-derived factor-1, into the adjacent damaged tissue, which is salvaged and/or regenerated as a result. Our laboratory developed a new surgical approach to treat acute and chronic cardiac failure using a variety of animal models, in which ONO-1301SR is directly placed over the cardiac surface to maximise the therapeutic effects and minimise the systemic complications. This review summarises basic and pre-clinical information of ONO-1301 and ONO-1301SR as a new reagent to enhance tissue salvage and/or regeneration, with a particular focus on the therapeutic effects on acute and chronic cardiac failure and underlying mechanisms, to explore a potential in launching the clinical study.", "journal": "Heart failure reviews", "date": "2015-02-25", "authors": ["SatsukiFukushima", "ShigeruMiyagawa", "YoshikiSakai", "YoshikiSawa"], "doi": "10.1007/s10741-015-9477-8\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01738-7\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.178\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.59\n10.1038/nrcardio.2012.196\n10.1042/CS20130294\n10.1038/nrcardio.2013.212\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000119\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.06.010\n10.2217/fca.12.85\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.9\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300219\n10.1007/s12265-011-9291-1\n10.1152/ajpheart.00349.2009\n10.1155/2012/926968\n10.1254/jphs.13073FP\n10.1124/jpet.103.056432\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.01.046\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.05.020\n10.1371/journal.pone.0069302\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.02.045\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.05.035\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.10.003\n10.3109/02652048.2012.720721\n10.1042/CS20060301\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000128046.54681.97\n10.1016/j.bone.2004.01.002\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.04.080\n10.2174/1874467211205020174\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.10.021\n10.1097/BRS.0b013e318154c5b6\n10.1016/j.bone.2007.06.013\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2005.10.026\n10.1016/j.bone.2006.02.054\n10.1302/0301-620X.87B8.15886\n10.1016/j.bone.2004.12.013\n10.1002/jor.20327\n10.1097/01.brs.0000209256.96186.a7\n10.1016/S1386-6346(01)00103-6\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.06.006\n10.1038/ki.2012.115\n10.1002/ibd.21080\n10.1093/cvr/cvn254\n10.1097/TP.0b013e3181a5c84c\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e31820b7be1\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.58\n10.4330/wjc.v6.i3.100\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.28\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.10.041\n10.1177/1074248413499973\n10.1016/j.coph.2003.10.012\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehl094\n10.1080/14017430802180449\n10.1053/j.jvca.2009.09.012\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr309\n10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61634-1\n10.1001/jama.2011.592\n10.1001/jama.298.20.2399\n10.1093/bja/aei026\n10.1016/S0140-6736(88)91906-X\n10.1016/j.jcin.2009.11.021\n10.1038/nrd3871\n10.1056/NEJMoa071142\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.07.051\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.10.008\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.000794\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.10.038\n10.1016/j.lfs.2009.06.002\n10.1016/j.biopha.2009.09.003\n10.1536/ihj.53.64\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.045\n10.1038/mt.2014.225\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.06.014\n10.1016/j.healun.2010.09.002\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.662577\n10.1097/TP.0b013e3181e6f201\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.07.002\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303827\n10.1164/rccm.200501-102OC\n10.1517/13543784.15.3.327\n10.1164/rccm.200703-349OC\n10.1253/circj.CJ-13-0107\n10.1152/ajplung.00042.2005\n10.1111/j.1365-2222.2009.03418.x\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.09.051\n10.1254/jjp.73.73\n10.1016/j.plefa.2010.11.005\n10.1152/ajprenal.00538.2011\n10.3109/02652048.2011.622054\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.2011.01416.x\n10.1152/ajpgi.00216.2011\n10.2220/biomedres.34.241\n10.1016/j.pan.2014.02.009\n10.1056/NEJMoa1207481\n10.1053/ejvs.1999.0867\n10.1136/heartjnl-2014-306254"}
{"title": "Polymeric electrospun scaffolds: neuregulin encapsulation and biocompatibility studies in a model of myocardial ischemia.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease represents one of the major health challenges in modern times and is the number one cause of death globally. Thus, numerous studies are under way to identify effective cell- and/or growth factor (GF)-based therapies for repairing damaged cardiac tissue. In this regard, improving the engraftment or survival of regenerative cells and prolonging GF exposure have become fundamental goals in advancing these therapeutic approaches. Biomaterials have emerged as innovative scaffolds for the delivery of both cells and proteins in tissue engineering applications. In the present study, electrospinning was used to generate smooth homogenous polymeric fibers, which consisted of a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) polymer blend encapsulating the cardioactive GF, Neuregulin-1 (Nrg). We evaluated the biocompatibility and degradation of this Nrg-containing biomaterial in a rat model of myocardial ischemia. Histological analysis revealed the presence of an initial acute inflammatory response after implantation, which was followed by a chronic inflammatory phase, characterized by the presence of giant cells. Notably, the scaffold remained in the heart after 3 months. Furthermore, an increase in the M2:M1 macrophage ratio following implantation suggested the induction of constructive tissue remodeling. Taken together, the combination of Nrg-encapsulating scaffolds with cells capable of inducing cardiac regeneration could represent an ambitious and promising therapeutic strategy for repairing diseased or damaged myocardial tissue.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Herein, we developed an effective stimulus system -- GNRs and doxorubicin co-loaded polymersomes (P-GNRs-DOX) -- to facilitate co-therapy of photothermal and chemotherapy. DOX can be triggered to release once the polymersomes are corrupted under local hyperthermic condition of GNRs induced by NIR laser irradiation. Also, the cytotoxicity of GNRs caused by the residual cetyltrimethylacmmonium bromide (CTAB) was reduced by shielding the polymersomes. The GNRs-loaded polymersomes (P-GNRs) can be efficiently taken up by the tumor cells. The distribution of the nanomaterial was imaged by IR-820 and quantitatively analyzed by ICP-AES. We studied the ablation of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, and found that co-therapy offers significantly improved therapeutic efficacy (tumors were eliminated without regrowth.) compared with chemotherapy or photothermal therapy alone. By TUNEL immunofluorescent staining of tumors after NIR laser irradiation, we found that the co-therapy showed more apoptotic tumor cells than the other groups. Furthermore, the toxicity study by pathologic examination of the heart tissues demonstrated a lower systematic toxicity of P-GNRs-DOX than free DOX. Thus, the chemo-photothermal treatment based on polymersomes loaded with DOX and GNRs is a useful strategy for maximizing the therapeutic efficacy and minimizing the dosage-related side effects in the treatment of solid tumors.", "journal": "Theranostics", "date": "2015-02-24", "authors": ["JinFengLiao", "WenTingLi", "JinRongPeng", "QianYang", "HeLi", "YuQuanWei", "XiaoNingZhang", "ZhiYongQian"], "doi": "10.7150/thno.10731"}

TCs have previously been identified in different anatomic structures of the heart, and have also been isolated and cultured from heart tissues in vitro. TCs and fibroblasts, both located in the interstitial spaces of the heart, have different morphologies and functionality. However, other than microscopic observation, a reliable means to make differential diagnosis of cardiac TCs from fibroblasts remains unclear. In the present study, we isolated and cultured cardiac TCs and fibroblasts from heart tissues, and observed their different morphological features and immunophenotypes in primary culture. Morphologically, TCs had extremely long and thin telopodes with moniliform aspect, stretched away from cell bodies, while cell processes of fibroblasts were short, thick and cone shaped. Furthermore, cardiac TCs were positive for CD34/c-kit, CD34/vimentin, and CD34/PDGFR-\u03b2, while fibroblasts were only vimentin and PDGFR-\u03b2 positive. In addition, TCs were also different from pericytes as TCs were CD34 positive and \u03b1-SMA weak positive while pericytes were CD34 negative but \u03b1-SMA positive. Besides that, we also showed cardiac TCs were homogenously positive for mesenchymal marker CD29 but negative for hematopoietic marker CD45, indicating that TCs could be a source of cardiac mesenchymal cells.

To test the possible underlying mechanisms, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers, gene expressions of cardiac hypertrophic and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and ultrastructural changes were measured, respectively, using standard, ELISA-based, real-time PCR, and transmission electron microscope procedures in heart tissues of Wistar rats after chronically exposing to Arabian incense. Malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis alpha (TNF)-\u03b1, and IL-4 levels were significantly increased, while catalase and glutathione levels were significantly declined in incense smoke-exposed rats. Incense smoke exposure also resulted in a significant increase in atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Rats exposed to incense smoke displayed marked ultrastructural changes in heart muscle with distinct cardiac hypertrophy, which correlated with the augmented hypertrophic gene expression as well as markers of cardiac damage including creatine kinase-myocardial bound (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Increased oxidative stress, inflammation, altered cardiac hypertrophic gene expression, tissue damage, and architectural changes in the heart may collectively contribute to increased cardiovascular disease risk in individuals exposed to incense smoke. Increased gene expressions of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 may be instrumental in the incense smoke-induced oxidative stress and inflammation.

To examine E-domain function, we delivered a synthetic peptide corresponding to the unique E-domain region of the human MGF (IGF-1Ec) via peptide eluting polymeric microstructures to the heart. The microstructures were made of poly (ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate hydrogel and bioengineered to be the same size as an adult cardiac myocyte (100 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 15 \u03bcm) and with a stiffness of 20 kPa. Peptide eluting microrods and empty microrods were delivered via intramuscular injection following coronary artery ligation in mice. To examine the physiologic consequences, we assessed the impact of peptide delivery on cardiac function and cardiovascular hemodynamics using pressure-volume loops and gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR. A significant decline in both systolic and diastolic function accompanied by pathologic hypertrophy occurred by 2 weeks which decompensated further by 10 weeks post-infarct in the untreated groups. Delivery of the E-domain peptide eluting microrods decreased mortality, ameliorated the decline in hemodynamics, and delayed decompensation. This was associated with the inhibition of pathologic hypertrophy despite increasing vascular impedance. Delivery of the empty microrods had limited effects on hemodynamics and while pathologic hypertrophy persisted there was a decrease in ventricular stiffness.

{"title": "Agonists of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids reduce infarct size and ameliorate cardiac dysfunction via activation of HO-1 and Wnt1 canonical pathway.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is complicated by ventricular fibrosis and associated diastolic and systolic failure. Emerging studies implicate Wnt1 signaling in the formation of new blood vessels. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)-mediated up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protects against the detrimental consequences of MI in several animal models, however, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine these mechanisms in the LAD ligation animal model of post infarcted heart failure. Specifically, we sought to clarify the mechanistic basis of the interactions of the Wnt1 canonical pathway, HO-1 and associated angiogenesis. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were exposed to anoxia and treated with the EET agonist, NUDSA, in the presence and absence of tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP). Increased capillary density, and Wnt1 and HO-1 expression occurred in cells treated with NUDSA. Anoxic HMECs treated with NUDSA and Wnt1 siRNA, exhibited decreased in the expression of \u03b2-catenin and the Wnt1 target gene, PPAR\u03b4 (p<0.05 vs. NUDSA). Furthermore, blocking the Wnt 1 antagonist, Dickkopf 1, by siRNA increased \u03b2-catenin and PPAR\u03b4 expression, and this effect was further enhanced by the concurrent administration of NUDSA. In in vivo experiments, C57B16 mice were divided into 4 groups: sham, mice with MI via LAD ligation and mice with MI treated with NUDSA, with and without SnMP. Increased fractional area change (FAC) and myocardial angiogenesis were observed in mice treated with NUDSA (p<0.05 vs. MI). Increased expression of HO-1, Wnt1, \u03b2-catenin, adiponectin, and phospho-endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (p-eNOS), and a decrease in the glycosylated subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, gp91(phox) expression occurred in cardiac tissue of mice treated with NUDSA (p<0.05 vs. MI). SnMP reversed these effects. This novel study demonstrates that increasing the canonical Wnt1 signaling cascade with the subsequent increase in HO-1, adiponectin and angiogenesis ameliorates fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction in a mouse model of MI and supports the hypothesis that HO-1 is an integral component of the EETs-adiponectin axis and is central for the control of resistance to fibrosis and vascular dysfunction and in part determine how they influence the cellular/vascular homeostasis and provides insight into the mechanisms involved in vascular dysfunction as well as potential targets for the treatment of CVD.", "journal": "Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators", "date": "2015-02-14", "authors": ["JianCao", "Peter LTsenovoy", "Ellen AThompson", "John RFalck", "RobertTouchon", "KomalSodhi", "RitaRezzani", "Joseph IShapiro", "Nader GAbraham"], "doi": "10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2015.01.002"}

The timing and magnitude of immune activation following CVB3 infection can mediate a positive host outcome or increase tissue pathology. To better elucidate the role of endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in acute CVB3 infection, we studied mice with a loss-of-function mutation, known as Letr for 'loss of endosomal TLR response', in Unc93b1, which is a chaperone protein for TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9. Using Unc93b1(Letr/)(Letr) mice, we determined that Unc93b1-dependent TLR activation was essential for the survival of acute CVB3-induced myocarditis. We also determined that a lack of endosomal TLR signaling was associated with a higher viral load in target organs and that it increased inflammation, necrosis and fibrosis in cardiac tissue. Loss of Unc93b1 function was also associated with increased cardiac expression of Ifn-b and markers of tissue injury and fibrosis including Lcn2 and Serpina3n early after CVB3 infection.

In this study, neonatal rat cardiac cells were cultured in a fibrin gel to drive the formation of 3D-AHM. Once the tissues were fully formed, the customized electrocardiogram (EKG) sensing system was used to obtain the different electrophysiological characteristics of the muscle constructs. Additionally, this system was used to evaluate the electrical properties of native rat hearts, for comparison to the fabricated tissues and native values found in the literature. Histological evaluation showed extensive cellularization and cardiac tissue formation. EKG data analysis yielded time delays between the signals ranging from 0 to 7 ms. Optical maps exhibited slight trends in impulse propagation throughout the fabricated tissue. Conduction velocities were calculated longitudinally at 277.81 cm/s, transversely at 300.79 cm/s, and diagonally at 285.68 cm/s for 3D-AHM.

{"title": "Protective effects of endothelin receptor A and B inhibitors against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "The clinical efficiency of the highly potent antitumor agent doxorubicin is limited by cardiotoxic effects. In a murine doxorubicin cardiotoxicity model, increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression and cardioprotective effects of the dual ET-1 blocker bosentan were demonstrated. To date it is unclear if combined blocking of endothelin A/B receptors is necessary or whether selective inhibition of one of the ET-1 receptors is sufficient for the observed cardioprotection. Therefore, we investigated the impact of dual (bosentan) and single endothelin receptor antagonism through sitaxentan (receptor A blocker) or BQ788 (receptor B blocker) in a murine doxorubicin cardiotoxicity model (C57BL/6N). Simultaneous administration of each endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with doxorubicin resulted in a significantly improved hemodynamic performance in comparison to the impaired cardiac function in control mice with bosentan being most effective but closely followed by sitaxentan and also BQ788. This cardioprotection was not caused by diminished doxorubicin levels in heart since the doxorubicin content in cardiac tissue was not altered by ERAs significantly. However, whole transcript expression profiling showed partly different effects of the ERAs on doxorubicin-modulated cardiac gene expression of genes involved in signal transduction (e.g. Stat3, Pim1, Akt1, Plcb2), fibrosis (e.g. Myl4), energy production (e.g. Ant1) or oxidative stress (e.g. Aox1). Furthermore, doxorubicin-mediated gene regulations were verified in the murine cardiomyocyte model HL-1 showing partly reversed expression patterns after co-administration of the ERAs.

{"title": "EMILIN2 regulates platelet activation, thrombus formation, and clot retraction.", "abstract": "Thrombosis, like other cardiovascular diseases, has a strong genetic component, with largely unknown determinants. EMILIN2, Elastin Microfibril Interface Located Protein2, was identified as a candidate gene for thrombosis in mouse and human quantitative trait loci studies. EMILIN2 is expressed during cardiovascular development, on cardiac stem cells, and in heart tissue in animal models of heart disease. In humans, the EMILIN2 gene is located on the short arm of Chromosome 18, and patients with partial and complete deletion of this chromosome region have cardiac malformations. To understand the basis for the thrombotic risk associated with EMILIN2, EMILIN2 deficient mice were generated. The findings of this study indicate that EMILIN2 influences platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate, collagen, and thrombin with both EMILIN2-deficient platelets and EMILIN2-deficient plasma contributing to the impaired aggregation response. Purified EMILIN2 added to platelets accelerated platelet aggregation and reduced clotting time when added to EMILIN2-deficient mouse and human plasma. Carotid occlusion time was 2-fold longer in mice with platelet-specific EMILIN2 deficiency, but stability of the clot was reduced in mice with both global EMILIN2 deficiency and with platelet-specific EMILIN2 deficiency. In vitro clot retraction was markedly decreased in EMILIN2 deficient mice, indicating that platelet outside-in signaling was dependent on EMILIN2. EMILIN1 deficient mice and EMILIN2:EMILIN1 double deficient mice had suppressed platelet aggregation and delayed clot retraction similar to EMILIN2 mice, but EMILIN2 and EMILIN1 had opposing affects on clot retraction, suggesting that EMILIN1 may attenuate the effects of EMILIN2 on platelet aggregation and thrombosis.

While TASK-3, the closest relative of TASK-1, was previously not described in cardiac tissue, we found a very prominent expression of TASK-3 in right human auricles. Immunocytochemistry experiments of human right auricular cardiomyocytes showed that TASK-3 is primarily localized at the plasma membrane. Single-channel recordings of right human auricles in the cell-attached mode, using divalent-cation-free solutions, revealed a TASK-1-like channel with a single-channel conductance of about 30pS. While homomeric TASK-3 channels were not found, we observed an intermediate single-channel conductance of about 55pS, possibly reflecting the heteromeric channel formed by TASK-1 and TASK-3. Subsequent experiments with TASK-1/TASK-3 tandem channels or with co-expressed TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels in HEK293 cells or Xenopus oocytes, supported that the 55pS channels observed in right auricles have electrophysiological characteristics of TASK-1/TASK-3 heteromers. In addition, co-expression experiments and single-channel recordings suggest that heteromeric TASK-1/TASK-3 channels have a predominant surface expression and a reduced affinity for TASK-1 blockers.

One obvious consequence of obesity is a decrease in circulating levels of adiponectin, which are associated with cardiovascular disorders and associated vascular comorbidities. Human and animal studies have demonstrated decreased adiponectin to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, in animal studies, increased circulating adiponectin alleviates obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction and hypertension, and also prevents atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and diabetic cardiac tissue disorders. Further, metabolism of a number of foods and medications are affected by induction of adiponectin. Adiponectin has beneficial effects on cardiovascular cells via its antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, antiatherogenic, vasodilatory, and antithrombotic activity, and consequently has a favorable effect on cardiac and vascular health. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of adiponectin secretion and signaling is critical for designing new therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes the recent evidence for the physiological role and clinical significance of adiponectin in vascular health, identification of the receptor and post-receptor signaling events related to the protective effects of the adiponectin system on vascular compartments, and its potential use as a target for therapeutic intervention in vascular disease.", "journal": "Vascular health and risk management", "date": "2015-02-06", "authors": ["MehrangizEbrahimi-Mamaeghani", "SomayehMohammadi", "Seyed RafieArefhosseini", "ParvizFallah", "ZahraBazi"], "doi": "10.2147/VHRM.S48753"}
{"title": "The KCNQ1 channel - remarkable flexibility in gating allows for functional versatility.", "abstract": "The KCNQ1 channel (also called Kv7.1 or KvLQT1) belongs to the superfamily of voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels. KCNQ1 shares several general features with other Kv channels but also displays a fascinating flexibility in terms of the mechanism of channel gating, which allows KCNQ1 to play different physiological roles in different tissues. This flexibility allows KCNQ1 channels to function as voltage-independent channels in epithelial tissues, whereas KCNQ1 function as voltage-activated channels with very slow kinetics in cardiac tissues. This flexibility is in part provided by the association of KCNQ1 with different accessory KCNE \u03b2-subunits and different modulators, but also seems like an integral part of KCNQ1 itself. The aim of this review is to describe the main mechanisms underlying KCNQ1 flexibility.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2015-02-06", "authors": ["Sara ILiin", "ReneBarro-Soria", "H PeterLarsson"], "doi": "10.1113/jphysiol.2014.287607"}

Xuebijing injection (XBJ), a traditional Chinese medicine used to sepsis, has been reported to suppress inflammatory responses and restore coagulation disturbances. However, little is known about the role of XBJ in heatstroke.\nMice were treated with indicated dose of XBJ before and/or after the induction of heatstroke. Serum inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and endothelial markers, von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and E-selectin, were measured by ELISA. Liver, kidney and heart profiles including alanine aminotransferase, aspartic aminotransferase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate dehydrogenase, were evaluated by UniCel DxC 800 Synchron Clinical Systems, and troponin was measured by ELISA. Coagulation profiles, including thrombin time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, and fibrinogen were examined by STA Compact\u00ae Hemostasis System. Jejunum injury was evaluated with H&E staining. Changes in mitochondrial structure in cardiac tissue were assesed by electron microscopy.\nPretreatment with XBJ decreased serum pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, as well as endothelial injury markers, vWF and E-selectin, in a dose-dependent manner in heatstroke mice. Similar protective effects were observed when XBJ was administered after, or both before and after heat insult. These protective effects lasted for over 12\u00a0h in mice receiving XBJ before and after heat insult. XBJ also improved survival rates in heatstroke mice, ameliorated liver, heart, and kidney injuries, including mitochondrial damage to the heart, and reduced coagulation disturbances.\nXBJ prevents organ injuries and improves survival in heatstroke mice by attenuating inflammatory responses and endothelial injury.

Cardiac mRNA expression was quantified using real-time RT-PCR and protein expression was quantified using Western blotting. DNA methylation and histone acetylation were assessed by combined bisulfite restriction analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation, respectively. There were increased plasma renin activity, angiotensin I (ANGI), and ANGII concentrations in LBW compared to ABW lambs at day 20. In LBW lambs, there was increased expression of cardiac ACE2 mRNA, decreased ANGII receptor type 1 (AT1R) protein, and acetylation of histone H3K9 of the AT1R promoter but no changes in AT1R mRNA expression and AT1R promoter DNA methylation. There was no difference in the abundance of proteins involved in autophagy or fibrosis. BIRC5 and VEGF mRNA expression was increased; however, the total length of the capillaries was decreased in the hearts of LBW lambs. Activation of the circulating and local cardiac RAS in neonatal LBW lambs may be expected to increase cardiac fibrosis, autophagy, and capillary length. However, we observed only a decrease in total capillary length, suggesting a dysregulation of the RAS in the heart of LBW lambs and this may have significant implications for heart health in later life.", "journal": "Physiological reports", "date": "2015-02-05", "authors": ["Kimberley C WWang", "Doug ABrooks", "BrookeSummers-Pearce", "LarisaBobrovskaya", "Darran NTosh", "Jaime ADuffield", "Kimberley JBotting", "SongZhang", "ICaroline McMillen", "Janna LMorrison"], "doi": "10.14814/phy2.12270"}
{"title": "The varying faces of IL-6: From cardiac protection to cardiac failure.", "abstract": "IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is made in response to perturbations in homeostasis. IL6 becomes elevated in the acute response to host injury and can activate immune cells, direct immune cell trafficking, signal protective responses in local tissue, initial the acute phase response or initiate wound healing. In the short term this proinflammatory response is protective and limits host damage. It is when this acute response remains chronically activated that IL6 becomes pathogenic to the host. Chronically elevated IL6 levels lead to chronic inflammation and fibrotic disorders. The heart is a tissue where this temporal regulation of IL6 is very apparent. Studies from myocardial infarction show how short-term IL6 signaling can protect and preserve the heart tissue in response to acute damage, where long term IL6 signaling or an over-production of IL6R protein plays a causal role in cardiovascular disease.

{"title": "Delivery of lipid micelles into infarcted myocardium using a lipid-linked matrix metalloproteinase targeting peptide.", "abstract": "There is a great need for delivery strategies capable of efficiently localizing drugs to the damaged myocardium that do not require direct intramyocardial injection of therapeutic molecules. In the work discussed here, we exploited the myocardium-specific upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that occurs during myocardium remodeling by designing a micellar vehicle containing an MMP-targeting peptide (MMP-TP). The binding of MMP-TP to MMP was evaluated with purified MMP-2 protein and U-937 cells induced to overexpress MMP. Inhibition of MMP-2 activity was not observed in the presence of unmodified micelles but was pronounced at a 5 mol % MMP-TP ligand density. In a FACS analysis, MMP-TP micelles containing 5 mol % of the MMP-targeting peptide showed \u223c10-fold higher binding to activated U937 cells than plain micelles and micelles containing a control peptide with two amino acid replacements. MMP-TP-micelles and plain micelles were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice 1, 3, and 7 days after the induction of a myocardial infarction (MI). Immunohistochemistry performed on heart tissue sections revealed that MMP-TP-micelles colocalize with both MMP and infiltrating macrophages. MMP-TP micelles showed significantly enhanced accumulation to the necrotic area of the heart after MI on days 3 and 7 when compared to plain micelles and negative control peptide micelles. This is coincident with the measured temporal profile of MMP gene expression in the heart after MI.

Multiple CM differentiation protocols have been developed to individually address specific requirements of these diverse applications, such as enhanced purity at a small scale or mass production at a larger scale. However, there is no universal high-efficiency procedure for generating CMs both in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) culture formats, and undefined or complex media additives compromise functional analysis or cost-efficient upscaling. Using systematic combinatorial optimization, we have narrowed down the key requirements for efficient cardiac induction of hPSCs. This implied differentiation in simple serum and serum albumin-free basal media, mediated by a minimal set of signaling pathway manipulations at moderate factor concentrations. The method was applicable both to 2D and 3D culture formats as well as to independent hPSC lines. Global time-course gene expression analyses over extended time periods and in comparison with human heart tissue were used to monitor culture-induced maturation of the resulting CMs. This suggested that hPSC-CMs obtained with our procedure reach a rather stable transcriptomic state after approximately 4 weeks of culture. The underlying gene expression changes correlated well with a decline of immature characteristics as well as with a gain of structural and physiological maturation features within this time frame. These data link gene expression patterns of hPSC-CMs to functional readouts and thus define the cornerstones of culture-induced maturation.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2015-02-03", "authors": ["MiaoZhang", "Jan SebastianSchulte", "AlexanderHeinick", "IlariaPiccini", "JyotiRao", "RobertoQuaranta", "DagmarZeuschner", "DanielaMalan", "Kee-PyoKim", "AlbrechtR\u00f6pke", "PhilippSasse", "MarcosAra\u00fazo-Bravo", "GuiscardSeebohm", "HansSch\u00f6ler", "LarissaFabritz", "PaulusKirchhof", "Frank UlrichM\u00fcller", "BorisGreber"], "doi": "10.1002/stem.1964"}

In exercised hearts, the \u03b4-opioid receptor appears to trigger cardioprotection against ischaemia-reperfusion-induced tissue necrosis but not apoptosis.\nEndogenous opioids mediate exercise-induced cardioprotection against ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, although the opioid receptor subtype mediating this effect is unknown. We investigated whether the \u03b4-opioid receptor mediates exercise-induced cardioprotection against IR injury. Endogenous opioids are produced in various tissues, including the heart and skeletal muscle; therefore, we also sought to identify the effect of exercise on circulating endogenous opioid as well as transcript, protein and receptor expression in heart and skeletal muscle. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n\u00a0=\u00a073) were assigned randomly to treadmill exercise or sedentary treatments. Cardiac tissue and serum were harvested 0, 20 and 120\u00a0min following exercise and from sedentary animals (n\u00a0=\u00a032) to quantify effects on proenkephalin and \u03b4-opioid receptor mRNA and protein levels, as well as serum enkephalin. Skeletal muscle (soleus) was harvested at identical time points for determination of proenkephalin protein and mRNA. A separate group of rats (n\u00a0=\u00a041) were randomly assigned to sham operation (Sham; surgical control), sedentary (Sed), exercise (Ex) or exercise\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b4-opioid receptor antagonist (ExD; naltrindole, 5\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) i.p.) and received IR by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation\u00a0in vivo.\u00a0After IR, tissues were harvested to quantify treatment effects on necrosis and apoptosis. Cardiac proenkephalin mRNA expression increased following exercise (0\u00a0min, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03; 120\u00a0min, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021), while soleus expression was unaffected. Exercise-induced changes in serum enkephalin were undetectable. After IR, tissue necrosis was elevated in Sed and ExD hearts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.003, respectively) compared with the Sham group, while the Ex group was partly protected. After IR, apoptosis was evident in Sed hearts (P\u00a0=\u00a00.016), while Ex and ExD hearts were protected. Data suggest that cardioprotective opioids are produced by the heart, but not by the soleus. After IR, the \u03b4-opioid receptor may mediate, in part, cardioprotection against necrosis but not apoptosis.", "journal": "Experimental physiology", "date": "2015-02-03", "authors": ["Lindsey EMiller", "Graham RMcGinnis", "Bridget APeters", "Christopher GBallmann", "GayaniNanayakkara", "RajeshAmin", "John CQuindry"], "doi": "10.1113/expphysiol.2014.083436"}

Here, we aimed at precisely analyzing the microRNA signature of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by RNA sequencing in a standardized in vitro hypertrophy model based on engineered heart tissue (EHT). Spontaneously beating, force-generating fibrin EHTs from neonatal rat heart cells were subjected to afterload enhancement for 7days (AE-EHT), and EHTs without intervention served as controls. AE resulted in reduced contractile force and relaxation velocity, fibrotic changes and reactivation of the fetal gene program. Small RNAs were extracted from control and AE-EHTs and sequencing yielded almost 750 different mature microRNAs, many of which have never been described before in rats. The detection of both arms of the precursor stem-loop (pre-miRNA), namely -3p and -5p miRs, was frequent. 22 abundantly sequenced microRNAs were >1.3\u00d7 upregulated and 15 abundantly sequenced microRNAs downregulated to <0.77\u00d7. Among the upregulated microRNAs were 3 pairs of guide and passenger strand microRNAs (miR-21-5p/-3p, miR-322-5p/-3p, miR-210-3p/-5p) and one single passenger strand microRNA (miR-140-3p). Among downregulated microRNAs were 3 pairs (miR-133a-3p/-5p, miR-30e-5p/3p, miR-30c-5p/-3p). Preincubating EHTs with anti-miR-21-5p markedly attenuated the AE-induced contractile failure, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrotic response, recapitulating prior results in whole animals. Taken together, AE-induced pathological hypertrophy in EHTs is associated with 37 differentially regulated microRNAs, including many passenger strands.

Recent evidence indicated that cardiac tissue expressed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3).

The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between PPAR\u03b3 activation and pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling.\nCardiac remodeling model was successfully established by abdominal aorta ligation.

PTSD diagnostic criteria include trauma exposure history and self-reported symptoms. Individuals who meet PTSD diagnostic criteria often meet criteria for additional psychiatric diagnoses. Biomarkers promise to contribute to reliable phenotypes of PTSD and comorbidities by linking biological system alterations to behavioral symptoms. Here we have analyzed unbiased plasma metabolomics and other stress effects in a mouse model with behavioral features of PTSD. In this model, C57BL/6 mice are repeatedly exposed to a trained aggressor mouse (albino SJL) using a modified, resident-intruder, social defeat paradigm. Our recent studies using this model found that aggressor-exposed mice exhibited acute stress effects including changed behaviors, body weight gain, increased body temperature, as well as inflammatory and fibrotic histopathologies and transcriptomic changes of heart tissue. Some of these acute stress effects persisted, reminiscent of PTSD. Here we report elevated proteins in plasma that function in inflammation and responses to oxidative stress and damaged tissue at 24 hrs post-stressor. Additionally at this acute time point, transcriptomic analysis indicated liver inflammation. The unbiased metabolomics analysis showed altered metabolites in plasma at 24 hrs that only partially normalized toward control levels after stress-withdrawal for 1.5 or 4 wks. In particular, gut-derived metabolites were altered at 24 hrs post-stressor and remained altered up to 4 wks after stress-withdrawal. Also at the 4 wk time point, hyperlipidemia and suppressed metabolites of amino acids and carbohydrates in plasma coincided with transcriptomic indicators of altered liver metabolism (activated xenobiotic and lipid metabolism). Collectively, these system-wide sequelae to repeated intense stress suggest that the simultaneous perturbed functioning of multiple organ systems (e.g., brain, heart, intestine and liver) can interact to produce injuries that lead to chronic metabolic changes and disorders that have been associated with PTSD.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-01-30", "authors": ["AartiGautam", "PeterD'Arpa", "Duncan EDonohue", "SeidMuhie", "NabarunChakraborty", "Brian TLuke", "DmitryGrapov", "Erica ECarroll", "James LMeyerhoff", "RashaHammamieh", "MartiJett"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0117092\n10.1002/jts.20486\n10.1016/j.amsu.2013.12.001\n10.1093/jxb/erm028\n10.2105/AJPH.2008.150284\n10.4088/JCP.11m06956\n10.1016/j.bbr.2012.07.022\n10.1073/pnas.1400113111\n10.1080/08977190903137736\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.11.050\n10.1371/journal.pone.0076817\n10.1016/j.biocel.2010.10.013\n10.1371/journal.pone.0055766\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016185\n10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181960e7f\n10.1073/pnas.0812874106\n10.1002/mnfr.200900276\n10.1021/pr400263n\n10.1038/ismej.2013.89\n10.1021/pr300429x\n10.2119/molmed.2010.00146\n10.1016/j.fct.2012.03.049\n10.1016/j.bbr.2010.08.049\n10.1007/s00441-010-1050-0\n10.4161/19490976.2014.973349\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.010908.163221\n10.1016/j.bbi.2010.10.023\n10.3390/jpm1010005\n10.1093/nar/gks1065\n10.1016/j.aca.2008.11.058\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010883\n10.1530/JOE-13-0027\n10.1016/j.metabol.2011.06.012\n10.1016/j.cmet.2013.01.003\n10.1016/j.plipres.2013.12.001\n10.1126/science.1214935\n10.1194/jlr.M002196\n10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.07.022\n10.1371/journal.pone.0047416\n10.1002/cphy.c120018\n10.1126/science.1179721\n10.1038/nature10809\n10.1089/met.2013.0010\n10.2174/1874192401105010164\n10.3109/09540261.2012.736367\n10.1016/j.janxdis.2012.08.004\n10.1021/ac901536h\n10.1073/pnas.1118726109\n10.2202/1544-6115.1600"}

Herein, we review the specific host-pathogen interactions that contribute to cardiac dysfunction during invasive pneumococcal disease: (1) cell wall-mediated inhibition of cardiomyocyte contractility; (2) the new observation that S. pneumoniae is capable of translocation into the myocardium and within the heart, forming discrete, nonpurulent, microscopic lesions that are filled with pneumococci; and (3) the bacterial virulence determinants, pneumolysin and hydrogen peroxide, that are most likely responsible for cardiomyocyte cell death. Pneumococcal invasion of heart tissue is dependent on the bacterial adhesin choline-binding protein A that binds to laminin receptor on vascular endothelial cells and binding of phosphorylcholine residues on pneumococcal cell wall to platelet-activating factor receptor. These are the same interactions responsible for pneumococcal translocation across the blood-brain barrier during the development of meningitis. We discuss these interactions and how their neutralization, either with antibody or therapeutic agents that modulate platelet-activating factor receptor expression, may confer protection against cardiac damage and meningitis. Considerable collagen deposition was observed in hearts of mice that had recovered from invasive pneumococcal disease. We discuss the possibility that cardiac scar formation after severe pneumococcal infection may explain why individuals who are hospitalized for pneumonia are at greater risk for sudden death up to 1 year after infection.", "journal": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "date": "2015-01-30", "authors": ["Armand OBrown", "Elizabeth R CMillett", "Jennifer KQuint", "Carlos JOrihuela"], "doi": "10.1164/rccm.201411-1951PP"}

A better approach is to make human cardiac tissues. We developed an original cell sheet-based tissue-engineering technology to fabricate human cardiac tissue by layering myocardial cell sheets. Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were differentiated into cardiomyocytes to fabricate cardiomyocyte sheets. Initially, three-layer human iPS cardiomyocyte (hiPSCM) sheets were transplanted on subcutaneous tissues of nude rats. Next, to fabricate thicker tissue, three-layer sheets were transplanted on one day, then additional three-layer sheets were transplanted onto them the following day, after the first sheets were vascularized. On day 3, the final three-layer sheets were again transplanted, creating a nine-layer graft (multi-step transplantation procedure). In the last step, six-layer sheets were transplanted on fat tissues of the inguinal portion, which were subsequently resected together with the femoral arteries and veins to make transplantable grafts with connectable vessels. They were then transplanted ectopically to the neck portion of other rats by anastomosing vessels with the host's jugular arteries and veins. Transplanted three-layer hiPSCMs were beating and, histologically, showed a cardiac muscle-like structure with vascular systems. Moreover, transplanted hiPSCMs proliferated and matured in vivo. Significantly thicker tissues were fabricated by a multi-step transplantation procedure. The ectopically transplanted graft survived and continued to beat. We succeeded in fabricating functional human cardiac tissue with cell sheet technology. Transplanting this cardiac tissue may become a new treatment option for severe heart failure.

The infiltration of immune cells and proteins that mediate the inflammatory response in cardiac tissue and circulatory processes is associated with AF. Furthermore, the presence of inflammation in the heart or systemic circulation can predict the onset of AF and recurrence in the general population, as well as in patients after cardiac surgery, cardioversion, and catheter ablation. Mediators of the inflammatory response can alter atrial electrophysiology and structural substrates, thereby leading to increased vulnerability to AF. Inflammation also modulates calcium homeostasis and connexins, which are associated with triggers of AF and heterogeneous atrial conduction. Myolysis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and the activation of fibrotic pathways via fibroblasts, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and matrix metalloproteases are also mediated by inflammatory pathways, which can all contribute to structural remodelling of the atria.

As skeletal muscle Hsp72 overexpression can protect against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance, alterations in substrate metabolism may be a mechanism by which Hsp72 is cardioprotective. We investigated the impact of transgenically overexpressing (Hsp72 Tg) or deleting Hsp72 (Hsp72 KO) on various aspects of cardiac metabolism. Mice were fed a normal chow (NC) or HFD for 12\u00a0weeks from 8\u00a0weeks of age to examine the impact of diet-induced obesity on metabolic parameters in the heart. The HFD resulted in an increase in cardiac fatty acid oxidation and a decrease in cardiac glucose oxidation and insulin-stimulated cardiac glucose clearance; however, there was no difference in Hsp72 Tg or Hsp72 KO mice in these rates compared with their respective wild-type control mice. Although HFD-induced cardiac insulin resistance was not rescued in the Hsp72 Tg mice, it was preserved in the skeletal muscle, suggesting tissue-specific effects of Hsp72 overexpression on substrate metabolism. Comparison of two different strains of mice (BALB/c vs. C57BL/6J) also identified strain-specific differences in regard to HFD-induced cardiac lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. These strain differences suggest that cardiac lipid accumulation can be dissociated from cardiac insulin resistance.

{"title": "A human type 5 adenovirus-based Trypanosoma cruzi therapeutic vaccine re-programs immune response and reverses chronic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Chagas disease (CD), caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a prototypical neglected tropical disease. Specific immunity promotes acute phase survival. Nevertheless, one-third of CD patients develop chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) associated with parasite persistence and immunological unbalance. Currently, the therapeutic management of patients only mitigates CCC symptoms. Therefore, a vaccine arises as an alternative to stimulate protective immunity and thereby prevent, delay progression and even reverse CCC. We examined this hypothesis by vaccinating mice with replication-defective human Type 5 recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) carrying sequences of amastigote surface protein-2 (rAdASP2) and trans-sialidase (rAdTS) T. cruzi antigens. For prophylactic vaccination, na\u00efve C57BL/6 mice were immunized with rAdASP2+rAdTS (rAdVax) using a homologous prime/boost protocol before challenge with the Colombian strain. For therapeutic vaccination, rAdVax administration was initiated at 120 days post-infection (dpi), when mice were afflicted by CCC. Mice were analyzed for electrical abnormalities, immune response and cardiac parasitism and tissue damage. Prophylactic immunization with rAdVax induced antibodies and H-2Kb-restricted cytotoxic and interferon (IFN)\u03b3-producing CD8+ T-cells, reduced acute heart parasitism and electrical abnormalities in the chronic phase. Therapeutic vaccination increased survival and reduced electrical abnormalities after the prime (analysis at 160 dpi) and the boost (analysis at 180 and 230 dpi). Post-therapy mice exhibited less heart injury and electrical abnormalities compared with pre-therapy mice. rAdVax therapeutic vaccination preserved specific IFN\u03b3-mediated immunity but reduced the response to polyclonal stimuli (anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28), CD107a+ CD8+ T-cell frequency and plasma nitric oxide (NO) levels. Moreover, therapeutic rAdVax reshaped immunity in the heart tissue as reduced the number of perforin+ cells, preserved the number of IFN\u03b3+ cells, increased the expression of IFN\u03b3 mRNA but reduced inducible NO synthase mRNA.

Minipigs with DP therapy (DP+, n=4) or placebo (DP-, n=4) and controls (C-SHAM, n=4) underwent 2D-EchoDoppler examination and blood collection before and after 4 weeks of pacing, when cardiac tissue was collected.

Cell death in the graft early after transplantation represents the main cause of unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy, but tissue-engineered cell sheets grown in temperature-responsive cell culture dishes may enable improved engraftment of transplanted cells. We investigated the therapeutic potential of this method in chronic myocardial ischemia in swine. We created a porcine model of chronic heart failure by implanting an ameroid constrictor around the main trunk of the left anterior descending artery, just distal to the circumflex branch. Simultaneously, ASCs were obtained from a piece of subcutaneous adipose tissue and expanded to form ASC sheets using temperature-responsive dishes. Four weeks after ameroid constrictor placement, triple-layered ASC sheets were transplanted onto the area of the ischemic myocardium (sheet group, n\u00a0=\u00a07). Controls (n\u00a0=\u00a07) received no sheet. Just before and 4\u00a0weeks after transplantation, left ventriculography (LVG) and coronary angiography (CAG) were performed. LVG revealed a significant improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction of the sheet group compared with controls (47.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9% vs 41.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, development of collateral vessels was only detected in the sheet group with right CAG. Histologic analysis demonstrated that engrafted ASC sheets grew to form a thickened layer that included newly formed vessels. ASC sheet transplantation therapy is an intriguing therapeutic method for ischemic heart failure.", "journal": "Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine", "date": "2015-01-24", "authors": ["OsamuIshida", "IkuoHagino", "NoritoshiNagaya", "TatsuyaShimizu", "TeruoOkano", "YoshikiSawa", "HidezoMori", "ToshikatsuYagihara"], "doi": "10.1016/j.trsl.2014.12.005"}

As a first investigation, we tested the feasibility of in vivo atrioventricular node ablation, in Langendorff-perfused porcine hearts, using a scanned 12C beam.\nIntact hearts were explanted from 4 (30-40 kg) pigs and were perfused in a Langendorff organ bath. Computed tomographic scans (1 mm voxel and slice spacing) were acquired and (12)C ion beam treatment planning (optimal accelerator energies, beam positions, and particle numbers) for atrioventricular node ablation was conducted. Orthogonal x-rays with matching of 4 implanted clips were used for positioning. Ten Gray treatment plans were repeatedly administered, using pencil beam scanning. After delivery, positron emission tomography-computed tomographic scans for detection of \u03b2(+) ((11)C) activity were obtained. A (12)C beam with a full width at half maximum of 10 mm was delivered to the atrioventricular node. Delivery of 130 Gy caused disturbance of atrioventricular conduction with transition into complete heart block after 160 Gy. Positron emission computed tomography demonstrated dose delivery into the intended area. Application did not induce arrhythmias. Macroscopic inspection did not reveal damage to myocardium. Immunostaining revealed strong \u03b3H2AX signals in the target region, whereas no \u03b3H2AX signals were detected in the unirradiated control heart.\nThis is the first report of the application of a (12)C beam for ablation of cardiac tissue to treat arrhythmias.

{"title": "Telocytes transfer extracellular vesicles loaded with microRNAs to stem cells.", "abstract": "Telocytes (TCs) are cells ubiquitously distributed in the body and characterized by very long and thin prolongations named telopodes (Tps). Cardiac TCs are the best characterized TCs for the moment. Tps release extracellular vesicles (EVs) in vivo and in vitro suggesting that TCs regulate the activity of other cells by vesicular paracrine signals. TCs have been found within the stem cell niche of several organs. Electron microscopy or electron tomography has shown that Tps are located in close vicinity of stem cells (SC). Since stem cell regulation by niche components involves paracrine signalling, we have investigated if TCs could be part of this mechanism. Using fluorescent labelling of cells and EVs with calcein and Cy5-miR-21 oligos, we provide evidence that TCs can modulate SC through EVs loaded with microRNAs. TCs deliver microRNA to cardiac stem cells (CSCs), as well as to other types of SCs (e.g. hematopoietic SC) indicating that this mechanism is not restricted to cardiac tissue. We also found that CSCs deliver microRNA loaded EVs to TCs, suggesting that there is a continuous, post-transcriptional regulatory signal back and forth between TCs and SC. In conclusion, our data reveal the existence of a reciprocal (bidirectional) epigenetic signalling between TCs and SC.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2015-01-21", "authors": ["Valeriu BCisma\u015fiu", "Laurentiu MPopescu"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.12529\n10.1111/jcmm.12509"}

Here, we describe in detail the preparation, handling, and optical mapping of transmembrane potential and intracellular free calcium concentration transients (CaT) in ventricular tissue slices from guinea pigs and rabbits. Slices cut in the epicardium-tangential plane contained well-aligned in-slice myocardial cell strands (\"fibers\") in subepicardial and midmyocardial sections. Cut with a high-precision slow-advancing microtome at a thickness of 350 to 400 \u03bcm, tissue slices preserved essential action potential (AP) properties of the precutting Langendorff-perfused heart. We identified the need for a postcutting recovery period of 36 min (guinea pig) and 63 min (rabbit) to reach 97.5% of final steady-state values for AP duration (APD) (identified by exponential fitting). There was no significant difference between the postcutting recovery dynamics in slices obtained using 2,3-butanedione 2-monoxime or blebistatin as electromechanical uncouplers during the cutting process. A rapid increase in APD, seen after cutting, was caused by exposure to ice-cold solution during the slicing procedure, not by tissue injury, differences in uncouplers, or pH-buffers (bicarbonate; HEPES). To characterize intrinsic patterns of CaT, AP, and conduction, a combination of multipoint and field stimulation should be used to avoid misinterpretation based on source-sink effects.

In this study, we measured the effect of EndoIII, a fusion protein construct that traffics Endonuclease III, a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase, to the mitochondria, on infarct size in a rat model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Open-chest, anesthetized rats were subjected to 30 min of occlusion of a coronary artery followed by 2 h of reperfusion. An intravenous bolus of EndoIII, 8 mg/kg, just prior to reperfusion reduced infarct size from 43.8 \u00b1 1.4% of the risk zone in control animals to 24.0 \u00b1 1.3% with no detectable hemodynamic effect. Neither EndoIII's vehicle nor an enzymatically inactive EndoIII mutant (K120Q) offered any protection. The magnitude of EndoIII's protection was comparable to that seen with the platelet aggregation inhibitor cangrelor (25.0 \u00b1 1.8% infarction of risk zone). Because loading with a P2Y12 receptor blocker to inhibit platelets is currently the standard of care for treatment of acute myocardial infarction, we tested whether EndoIII could further reduce infarct size in rats treated with a maximally protective dose of cangrelor. The combination reduced infarct size to 15.1 \u00b1 0.9% which was significantly smaller than that seen with either cangrelor or EndoIII alone. Protection from cangrelor but not EndoIII was abrogated by pharmacologic blockade of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase or adenosine receptors indicating differing cellular mechanisms. We hypothesized that EndoIII protected the heart from spreading necrosis by preventing the release of proinflammatory fragments of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the heart tissue. In support of this hypothesis, an intravenous bolus at reperfusion of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) which should degrade any DNA fragments escaping into the extracellular space was as protective as EndoIII. Furthermore, the combination of EndoIII and DNase I produced additive protection. While EndoIII would maintain mitochondrial integrity in many of the ischemic cardiomyocytes, DNase I would further prevent mtDNA released from those cells that EndoIII could not save from propagating further necrosis. Thus, our mtDNA hypothesis would predict additive protection. Finally to demonstrate the toxicity of mtDNA, isolated hearts were subjected to 15 min of global ischemia. Infarct size doubled when the coronary vasculature was filled with mtDNA fragments during the period of global ischemia. To our knowledge, EndoIII and DNase are the first agents that can both be given at reperfusion and add to the protection of a P2Y12 blocker, and thus should be effective in today's patient with acute myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2015-01-18", "authors": ["Xi-MingYang", "LinCui", "JamesWhite", "JamieKuck", "Mykhaylo VRuchko", "Glenn LWilson", "MikhailAlexeyev", "Mark NGillespie", "James MDowney", "Michael VCohen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-014-0459-0\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.04.047\n10.1016/j.dnarep.2003.10.002\n10.1016/S0027-5107(99)00006-8\n10.1186/1471-2407-6-235\n10.1152/ajplung.00210.2011\n10.1152/ajplung.00443.2001\n10.1074/jbc.M000831200\n10.1371/journal.pone.0095073\n10.1016/j.lfs.2007.08.019\n10.1016/S0008-6363(03)00533-9\n10.1152/ajplung.00071.2012\n10.3390/ph7080894\n10.1016/S0022-2828(03)00043-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60916-7\n10.1016/0378-1119(89)90358-2\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.300627\n10.1074/jbc.M109.036020\n10.1038/485179a\n10.1007/s003950050105\n10.1016/S0735-1097(96)00522-0\n10.1038/nature10992\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.06.010\n10.1074/jbc.275.17.12509\n10.1093/nar/gkh648\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.09.028\n10.1074/jbc.M208770200\n10.1152/ajpcell.00362.2007\n10.1007/s00395-012-0275-3\n10.1152/ajplung.00255.2004\n10.1182/blood-2013-07-514992\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182a4ea46\n10.1093/cvr/cvu098.93\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.09.041\n10.1152/ajpcell.00140.2013\n10.1152/ajpheart.00157.2011\n10.1007/s10557-013-6474-9\n10.1177/1074248412467692\n10.1038/nature08780"}

We also measured (99m)Tc-MIBI signals in the hearts of SD rats administered CCCP (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or vehicle. (99m)Tc-MIBI signals decreased in rat hearts administered CCCP, and the ATP content, as measured by (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, decreased simultaneously. Next, we administered (99m)Tc-MIBI to Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high-salt diet, which leads to hypertension and heart failure.

{"title": "Strategies for recruitment of stem cells to treat myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Heart failure is one of the most prominent causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (MI) are responsible for 29% of deaths worldwide. MI results in obstruction of the blood supply to the heart and scar formation, and causes substantial death of cardiomyocytes in the infarct zone followed by an inflammatory response. Current treatment methodologies of MI and heart failure include organ transplantation, coronary artery bypass grafting, ventricular remodeling, cardiomyoplasty, and cellular therapy. Each of these methodologies has associated risks and benefits. Cellular cardiomyoplasty is a viable option to decrease the fibrosis of infarct scars, adverse post-ischemic remodeling, and improve heart function. However, the low rate of cell survival, shortage of cell sources and donors, tumorigenesis, and ethical issues hamper full exploitation of cell therapy for MI treatment. Consequently, the mobilization and recruitment of endogenous stem/progenitor cells from bone marrow, peripheral circulation, and cardiac tissues has immense potential through harnessing the host's own reparative capacities that result from interplay among cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Therapeutic treatments to enhance the mobilization and homing of stem cells are under development.

In vertebrates, multiple HSFs (HSF1-4) have been reported to have different roles in response to a range of stresses. This paper reports the cDNA cloning of two goldfish (Carassius auratus) HSF gene families, HSF1 and three isoforms of HSF2. Both HSF1 and HSF2s showed high homology to the known HSFs from other organisms, particularly the zebrafish. Different patterns of HSF1 and HSF2 mRNA expression were detected in several goldfish tissues, highlighting their distinct roles. In cadmium (Cd)-treated tissues, the responses of HSP70 showed less difference. However, the increase in HSF1 and HSF2 in these tissues differs considerable. In particular, HSF2 was induced strongly in the heart and liver. On the other hand, in heart tissue, HSF1 showed the smallest increment. These results suggest the potential role of HSF2 in assisting HSF1 in these tissues. In another in\u00a0vitro experiment of hepatocyte cultures, Cd exposure caused similar patterns of goldfish HSF1 and HSF2 mRNA expression and induction of the HSP70 protein. On the other hand, an examination of the characterization of recombinant proteins showed that HSF1 undergoes a conformation change induced by heat shock above 30\u00a0\u00b0C and approaches each other in the trimer, whereas HSF2 could not sense thermal stress directly. Furthermore, immune-blot analysis of HSFs showed that both monomers and trimmers of HSF1 were observed in cadmium-induced tissues, whereas HSF2 were all in monomeric.

Therefore, current study was performed to evaluate the protective effect of defatted methanol extract of A. augusta leaves (AA) against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its associated nephropathy and cardiomyopathy in experimental rats.\nAntidiabetic activity of AA extracts (100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) was measured in streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced type 2 diabetic (T2D) rat. Fasting blood glucose level (at specific interval) and serum biochemical markers (after sacrifice) were measured. Redox status, transcription levels of signal proteins (NF-\u03baB and PKCs), mitochondria dependent apoptotic pathway (Bad, Bcl-2, caspase cascade) and histological studies were performed in kidneys and hearts of controls and AA treated diabetic rats.\nPhytochemical screening of extracts revealed the presence of taraxerol, flavonoids and phenolic compounds in the AA.

Alteration in serum lipid profile and release of membrane bound enzymes like lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase, which ensured the participation of hyperlipidemia and cell membrane disintegration in diabetic pathophysiology. T2DM caused alteration in the serum biochemical markers related to diabetic complications. T2DM altered the redox status, decreased the intracellular NAD and ATP concentrations in renal and myocardial tissues of experimental rats. Investigating the molecular mechanism, activation PKC isoforms was observed in the selected tissues. T2D rats also exhibited an up-regulation of NF-\u03baB and increase in the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) in the renal and cardiac tissues. The activation of mitochondria dependent apoptotic pathway was observed in renal and myocardial tissues of the T2D rats. However, Oral administration of AA at the doses of 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg body weight per day could reduce hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, membrane disintegration, oxidative stress, vascular inflammation and prevented the activation of oxidative stress induced signaling cascades leading to cell death.

The proteomics data were further studied by bioinformatics tools and validated by targeted transcriptomics, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and serum profiling. Radiation-induced endothelial dysfunction was characterized by impaired energy metabolism and perturbation of the insulin/IGF-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

However, realization of this opportunity has been hindered by the burden of TTN-truncating variants (TTNtv) in the general population and uncertainty about their consequences in health or disease. To elucidate the effects of TTNtv, we coupled TTN gene sequencing with cardiac phenotyping in 5267 individuals across the spectrum of cardiac physiology and integrated these data with RNA and protein analyses of human heart tissues. We report diversity of TTN isoform expression in the heart, define the relative inclusion of TTN exons in different isoforms (using the TTN transcript annotations available at http://cardiodb.org/titin), and demonstrate that these data, coupled with the position of the TTNtv, provide a robust strategy to discriminate pathogenic from benign TTNtv. We show that TTNtv is the most common genetic cause of DCM in ambulant patients in the community, identify clinically important manifestations of TTNtv-positive DCM, and define the penetrance and outcomes of TTNtv in the general population. By integrating genetic, transcriptome, and protein analyses, we provide evidence for a length-dependent mechanism of disease.

This phenomenon, known as \"no-reflow\" contributes to reperfusion injury, poor prognosis and to unfavorable clinical outcome. In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that the synthetic 17\u03b2-aminoestrogen Prolame, may confer cardioprotection and prevent against no-reflow. In an open-chest model of 30-min ischemia and 90-min reperfusion, male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to different groups: Control, Prolame, Prolame followed by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME), and 17\u03b2-estradiol. Areas of risk, infarct size and no-reflow were determined by planimetry with triphenyltetrazolium chloride and thioflavin-S stains. Structural damage of the vasculature was measured as capillary compression in clarified tissue after intra-atrial injection of Microfil. Hemodynamic function was obtained at the end of stabilization, ischemia and reperfusion; nitric oxide (NO\u00b7) content was determined indirectly using the Griess reaction. Activation of the eNOS signaling cascade was determined by western blot. Prolame reduced the infarcted area, decreased the zones of no-reflow and capillary compression by activating the PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway in correlation with NO\u00b7 increase. Prolame also activated endothelial cells augmenting NO\u00b7 production, which was inhibited by ICI182780 (a selective estrogen receptor down-regulator), supporting the notion that the cardioprotective effect of Prolame involves the preservation of endothelium through the activation of estrogen receptor downstream signaling.

Congenital heart defects are thought to have multifactorial etiology, but the main causes are largely unknown. We have explored the global methylation profile of fetal heart DNA in comparison to blood DNA from control subjects: an absolute correlation with the type of tissue was detected. Pathway analysis revealed a significant enrichment of differential methylation at genes related to muscle contraction and cardiomyopathies in the developing heart DNA. We have also searched for abnormal methylation profiles on developing heart-tissue DNA of syndromic and non-syndromic congenital heart defects. On average, 3 regions with aberrant methylation were detected per sample and 18 regions were found differentially methylated between groups. Several epimutations were detected in candidate genes involved in growth regulation, apoptosis and folate pathway. A likely pathogenic hypermethylation of several intragenic sites at the MSX1 gene, involved in outflow tract morphogenesis, was found in a fetus with isolated heart malformation. In addition, hypermethylation of the GATA4 gene was present in fetuses with Down syndrome with or without congenital heart defects, as well as in fetuses with isolated heart malformations. Expression deregulation of the abnormally methylated genes was detected.

{"title": "Mathematical modeling improves EC50 estimations from classical dose-response curves.", "abstract": "The \u03b2-adrenergic response is impaired in failing hearts. When studying \u03b2-adrenergic function in vitro, the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50 ) is an important measure of ligand response. We previously measured the in vitro contraction force response of chicken heart tissue to increasing concentrations of adrenaline, and observed a decreasing response at high concentrations. The classical interpretation of such data is to assume a maximal response before the decrease, and to fit a sigmoid curve to the remaining data to determine EC50 . Instead, we have applied a mathematical modeling approach to interpret the full dose-response curve in a new way. The developed model predicts a non-steady-state caused by a short resting time between increased concentrations of agonist, which affect the dose-response characterization. Therefore, an improved estimate of EC50 may be calculated using steady-state simulations of the model. The model-based estimation of EC50 is further refined using additional time-resolved data to decrease the uncertainty of the prediction. The resulting model-based EC50 (180-525 nm) is higher than the classically interpreted EC50 (46-191 nm). Mathematical modeling thus makes it possible to re-interpret previously obtained datasets, and to make accurate estimates of EC50 even when steady-state measurements are not experimentally feasible.\nThe mathematical models described here have been submitted to the JWS Online Cellular Systems Modelling Database, and may be accessed at http://jjj.bio.vu.nl/database/nyman.", "journal": "The FEBS journal", "date": "2015-01-15", "authors": ["ElinNyman", "IsaLindgren", "WilliamL\u00f6vfors", "KarinLundeng\u00e5rd", "IdaCervin", "Theresia ArbringSj\u00f6str\u00f6m", "JordiAltimiras", "GunnarCedersund"], "doi": "10.1111/febs.13194"}

In skeletal muscle myofibrils, Ankrd2 has a structural role as a component of a titin associated stretch-sensing complex, while in the nucleus it exerts regulatory function as transcriptional co-factor. It is also involved in myogenic differentiation and coordination of myoblast proliferation. Although expressed in the heart, the role of Ankrd2 in the cardiac muscle is completely unknown. Recently, we have shown that hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy pathways are altered upon Ankrd2 silencing suggesting the importance of this protein in cardiac tissue. Here we provide the underlying basis for the functional investigation of Ankrd2 in the heart. We confirmed reduced Ankrd2 expression levels in human heart in comparison with Ankrd1 using RNAseq and Western blot. For the first time we demonstrated that, apart from the sarcomere and nucleus, both proteins are localized to the intercalated disks of human cardiomyocytes. We further tested the expression and localization of endogenous Ankrd2 in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, a well-established model for studying cardiac-specific proteins. Ankrd2 was found to be expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, independently from maturation status of cardiomyocytes. In contrast to Ankrd1, it is not responsive to the cardiotoxic drug Doxorubicin, suggesting that different mechanisms govern their expression in cardiac cells.", "journal": "Histochemistry and cell biology", "date": "2015-01-15", "authors": ["JovanaJasnic-Savovic", "AleksandraNestorovic", "SlobodanSavic", "SinisaKarasek", "NicolaVitulo", "GiorgioValle", "GeorgineFaulkner", "DragicaRadojkovic", "SnezanaKojic"], "doi": "10.1007/s00418-015-1307-5"}
{"title": "Modeling and estimation of tip contact force for steerable ablation catheters.", "abstract": "The efficacy of catheter-based cardiac ablation procedures can be significantly improved if real-time information is available concerning contact forces between the catheter tip and cardiac tissue. However, the widely used ablation catheters are not equipped for force sensing. This paper proposes a technique for estimating the contact forces without direct force measurements by studying the changes in the shape of the deflectable distal section of a conventional 7-Fr catheter (henceforth called the \"deflectable distal shaft,\" the \"deflectable shaft,\" or the \"shaft\" of the catheter) in different loading situations.\nFirst, the shaft curvature when the tip is moving in free space is studied and based on that, a kinematic model for the deflectable shaft in free space is proposed. In the next step, the shaft shape is analyzed in the case where the tip is in contact with the environment, and it is shown that the curvature of the deflectable shaft provides useful information about the loading status of the catheter and can be used to define an index for determining the range of contact forces exerted by the ablation tip.\nExperiments with two different steerable ablation catheters show that the defined index can detect the range of applied contact forces correctly in more than 80% of the cases. Based on the proposed technique, a framework for obtaining contact force information by using the shaft curvature at a limited number of points along the deflectable shaft is constructed.\nThe proposed kinematic model and the force estimation technique can be implemented together to describe the catheter's behavior before contact, detect tip/tissue contact, and determine the range of contact forces.\nThis study proves that the flexibility of the catheter's distal shaft provides a means of estimating the force exerted on tissue by the ablation tip.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2015-01-15", "authors": ["MahtaKhoshnam", "Allan CSkanes", "Rajni VPatel"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2015.2389615"}

The aim of the study was to phenotypically characterize two strains of mice with differential Chagas infection susceptibility and correlate strain myocarditis phenotypes with heart tissue gene expression. C57BL/6J and Balb/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0 or 150-200 tissue-derived trypomastigotes (Tulahuen strain). Echocardiograms, brain natriuretic peptide, and troponin were measured. Heart tissue was harvested for histopathological analysis and gene expression profiling on microarrays. Genes differently expressed between infected Balb/c and C57BL/6J mice were identified. Echocardiograms showed differences in Balb/c versus C57BL/6J infected mice in heart rate (413 versus 476 beats per minute; P = 0.0001), stroke volume (31.9 \u00b1 9.3 versus 39.2 \u00b1 5.5 \u03bcL; P = 0.03), and cardiac output (13.1 \u00b1 3.5 versus 18.7 \u00b1 3.2 \u03bcL/min; P = 0.002).

Thirty days after treatment, an echocardiographic analysis was performed, followed by euthanasia. The animals in all of the cell therapy groups, regardless of the cell type transplanted, had less collagen deposition in their heart tissue and demonstrated a significant improvement in myocardial function after IC.

A high-fat diet was administered to male Wistar rats for 45 days and the rats of the treatment group were administered EGCG via intraperitoneal injection for the last 15 days.

The myocardium and aorta were also histopathologically examined. The high-fat diet-fed rats were found to be hypercholesterolemic or exhibited abnormal values in the selected parameters. However, these abnormalities were reversed to near-normal values in the rats administered EGCG. Similarly, the enzymatic antioxidant activity and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels were improved with EGCG treatment in high-fat diet-fed rats. In addition, EGCG activated sirtuin 1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1, which suggests that its protective effect is mediated through the stimulation of lipid metabolism. The histopathological examination further revealed that EGCG significantly prevented the development of tissue abnormalities and improved the morphology of myocardial tissue.

{"title": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress response in spontaneously hypertensive rats is affected by myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Cell apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress appears to be one of the main causes of myocardial necrosis following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R). The C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) pathway is the main pathway through which apoptosis is induced during ER stress. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is an important protein involved in the CHOP pathway. The present study investigated the hypothesis that MI/R activates the CHOP pathway through signaling via a pathway involving PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), \u03b1-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1) and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2). Immunohistochemical staining of the heart tissues from spontaneously hypersensitive rats indicated that MI/R injury increases CHOP and GPR78 protein expression levels. To further analyze the mechanism by which MI/R injury induces apoptosis by ER stress, the expression levels of five marker proteins involved in the hypothetical PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF2 pathway were detected, namely PERK, phosphorylated PERK (P-PERK), eIF2\u03b1, phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 (P-eIF2\u03b1) and ATF2. An increase in the collective expression levels of these proteins would indicate that apoptosis was induced by this signaling pathway. In addition, the study also explored whether hypertension affects the signaling pathway of MI/R-induced myocardial apoptosis by treating spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with captopril (an effective drug used to treat hypertension). Rats treated with captopril experienced a reduction in blood pressure to normal levels, but no marked differences in the expression levels of the tested proteins or in MI/R injury severity compared with those in untreated rats. These results suggest that MI/R activates the CHOP pathway during ER stress by activating the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF2 pathway and that hypertension does not affect this signaling pathway.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2015-01-13", "authors": ["Xiao-FuGuo", "Xiang-JunYang"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2014.2094\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(200002)190:3<255::AID-PATH526>3.0.CO;2-6\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000606\n10.1016/j.jep.2014.04.052\n10.1007/s00204-014-1240-8\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0945\n10.1007/978-1-4614-3209-8_83\n10.1016/j.molcel.2014.03.022\n10.1093/nar/gkm038\n10.1128/MCB.20.19.7192-7204.2000\n10.1128/MCB.00939-10\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2004.04.013\n10.1354/vp.42-4-405\n10.1097/00001756-200302100-00004\n10.1172/JCI62874\n10.1172/JCI112160\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00033-9\n10.1056/NEJMra071667"}
{"title": "Ultrastructural maturation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes under alternative induction of 5-azacytidine.", "abstract": "Adult cardiomyocytes lack the ability to proliferate and are unable to repair damaged heart tissue, therefore differentiation of stem cells to cardiomyocytes represents an exceptional opportunity to study cardiomyocytes in vitro and potentially provides a valuable source for replacing damaged tissue. However, characteristic maturity of the in vitro differentiated cardiomyocytes and methods to achieve it are yet to be optimized. In this study, differentiation of human bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) into cardiomyocytes is accomplished and the process investigated ultrastructurally. The hBM-MSCs were alternatively treated with 5\u2009\u03bcM of 5-azacytidine (5-aza) for 8 weeks resulting in differentiation to cardiomyocytes. Expressions of cardiomyocyte-specific genes [cardiac \u03b1-actinin, cardiac \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (MHC) and connexin-43] and proteins (cardiac \u03b1-actinin, cardiac troponin and connexin-43) were confirmed in a time-dependent manner from the first to the fifth weeks post-induction. Ultrastructural maturation of hBM-MSCs-derived cardiomyocyte (MSCs-CM) corresponded with increase in number and organization of myofilaments in cells over time. Starting from week five, organized myofibrils along with developing sarcomeres were detectable. Later on, MSCs-CM were characterized by the presence of sarcoplasmic reticulum, T-tubules and diads as cardiomyocytes connected to each other by intercalated disc-like structures. Here, we showed the potential of hBM-MSCs as a source for the production of cardiomyocytes and confirmed mature ultrastructural characteristics of these cells using our alternative incubation method.", "journal": "Cell biology international", "date": "2015-01-13", "authors": ["AbbasPiryaei", "MasoudSoleimani", "Mohammad HassanHeidari", "MonaSaheli", "RaziehRohani", "MohammadaliAlmasieh"], "doi": "10.1002/cbin.10421"}

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of long-term exposure to BPA at the reference dose on the myocardium of rats, and the underlying mechanisms. Male rats received corn oil or 50 \u03bcg/kg/day of BPA since delactation. At 24 and 48 weeks (wk), cardiac function and mitochondrial function were examined. The mRNA expression and the methylation status of PCG-1\u03b1, a major regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in cardiac muscle, were also tested. At 48 wk, BPA-exposed rats displayed cardiomyopathy, characterized by myocardium hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte enlargement, and impairment of cardiac function. At 24 wk, significantly reduced ATP production, dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential (\u03a8m) and declined mitochondrial respiratory complex (MRC) activity in cardiomyocytes were observed in BPA-exposed rats compared with the control rats, indicating a decrease in mitochondrial function occurs before the development of cardiomyopathy. Additionally, BPA exposure decreased the expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and induced hypermethylation of PGC-1 \u03b1 in heart tissue in 24- and 48-week-old rats. The change in methylation of PGC-1\u03b1 was observed more pronounced in BPA-exposed rats at 48 wk.

{"title": "Gene expression changes controlling distinct adaptations in the heart and skeletal muscle of a hibernating mammal.", "abstract": "Throughout the hibernation season, the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) experiences extreme fluctuations in heart rate, metabolism, oxygen consumption, and body temperature, along with prolonged fasting and immobility. These conditions necessitate different functional requirements for the heart, which maintains contractile function throughout hibernation, and the skeletal muscle, which remains largely inactive. The adaptations used to maintain these contractile organs under such variable conditions serves as a natural model to study a variety of medically relevant conditions including heart failure and disuse atrophy. To better understand how two different muscle tissues maintain function throughout the extreme fluctuations of hibernation we performed Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing of cDNAs to compare the transcriptome of heart and skeletal muscle across the circannual cycle. This analysis resulted in the identification of 1,076 and 1,466 differentially expressed genes in heart and skeletal muscle, respectively. In both heart and skeletal muscle we identified a distinct cold-tolerant mechanism utilizing peroxisomal metabolism to make use of elevated levels of unsaturated depot fats. The skeletal muscle transcriptome also shows an early increase in oxidative capacity necessary for the altered fuel utilization and increased oxygen demand of shivering. Expression of the fetal gene expression profile is used to maintain cardiac tissue, either through increasing myocyte size or proliferation of resident cardiomyocytes, while skeletal muscle function and mass are protected through transcriptional regulation of pathways involved in protein turnover. This study provides insight into how two functionally distinct muscles maintain function under the extreme conditions of mammalian hibernation.", "journal": "Physiological genomics", "date": "2015-01-13", "authors": ["Katie LVermillion", "Kyle JAnderson", "MarshallHampton", "Matthew TAndrews"], "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00108.2014"}
{"title": "A high-resolution computational model of the deforming human heart.", "abstract": "Modeling of the heart ventricles is one of the most challenging tasks in soft tissue mechanics because cardiac tissue is a strongly anisotropic incompressible material with an active component of stress. In most current approaches with active force, the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) is limited by the direct method of solution of linear systems of equations. We develop a new approach for high-resolution heart models with large numbers of DOF by: (1) developing a hex-dominant finite element mixed formulation and (2) developing a Krylov subspace iterative method that is able to solve the system of linearized equations for saddle-point problems with active stress. In our approach, passive cardiac tissue is modeled as a hyperelastic, incompressible material with orthotropic properties, and mixed pressure-displacement finite elements are used to enforce incompressibility. Active stress is generated by a model with force dependence on length and velocity of muscle shortening. The ventricles are coupled to a lumped circulatory model. For efficient solution of linear systems, we use Flexible GMRES with a nonlinear preconditioner based on block matrix decomposition involving the Schur complement. Three methods for approximating the inverse of the Schur complement are evaluated: inverse of the pressure mass matrix; least squares commutators; and sparse approximate inverse. The sub-matrix corresponding to the displacement variables is preconditioned by a V-cycle of hybrid geometric-algebraic multigrid followed by correction with several iterations of GMRES preconditioned by sparse approximate inverse. The overall solver is demonstrated on a high-resolution two ventricle mesh based on a human anatomy with roughly 130\u00a0K elements and 1.7\u00a0M displacement DOF. Effectiveness of the numerical method for active contraction is shown. To the best of our knowledge, this solver is the first to efficiently model ventricular contraction using an iterative linear solver for the mesh size demonstrated and therefore opens the possibility for future very high-resolution models. In addition, several relatively simple benchmark problems are designed for a verification exercise to show that the solver is functioning properly and correctly solves the underlying mathematical model. Here, the output of the newly designed solver is compared to that of the mechanics component of Chaste ('Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment'). These benchmark tests may be used by other researchers to verify their newly developed methods and codes.", "journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "date": "2015-01-09", "authors": ["ViatcheslavGurev", "PrasPathmanathan", "Jean-LucFattebert", "Hui-FangWen", "JohnMagerlein", "Richard AGray", "David FRichards", "J JeremyRice"], "doi": "10.1007/s10237-014-0639-8"}

We have recently shown that the inhibition of extracellular RNA (eRNA) using non-toxic RNase1 protected the heart against acute IRI, reduced myocardial infarct (MI) size and preserved left ventricular systolic function in rodent animal MI models. Based on this previous work in animals, the role of the eRNA/RNase1 system in cardiac RIPC in humans should be defined.\nFourteen patients underwent cardiac surgery without RIPC; from each patient, six separate 5 ml blood specimens from radial artery and two blood specimens from coronary sinus at different time points during heart surgery were taken. Six healthy donors received RIPC (4 \u00d7 5 min upper limb ischaemia); blood parameters were quantified before and after RIPC. Twelve patients underwent cardiac surgery of which 6 received RIPC, whereas the remaining 6 were exposed to sham procedure. Circulating eRNA was quantified in plasma from arterial and coronary sinus blood obtained from patients undergoing cardiac by standard procedures. Tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) production by heart tissue was assessed by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay; RNase activity was quantified by an enzymatic assay.\nBefore surgery, eRNA levels were similar in both groups (14 \u00b1 6 vs 13 \u00b1 5 ng/ml; P = 0.9967). In patients without RIPC, arterial eRNA levels rose during surgery (87 \u00b1 12 ng/ml) and peaked after (127 \u00b1 11 ng/ml) aortic declamping; accordingly, eRNA levels in coronary sinus blood were significantly higher (206 \u00b1 32 ng/ml; P = 0.0129) than that in radial artery. Moreover, significant elevation of TNF-\u03b1 (36 \u00b1 6 ng/ml; P = 0.0059) particularly in coronary sinus blood after opening of the aortic clamping was observed. Interestingly, applying a RIPC protocol significantly increased levels of plasma endogenous vascular RNase1 by >7-fold, and the levels of arterial (31 \u00b1 7 ng/ml; P = 0.0024) and coronary sinus (37 \u00b1 9 ng/ml; P < 0.0001) circulating eRNA, as well as circulating TNF-\u03b1 (20 \u00b1 4 ng/ml; P = 0.0050) levels were significantly reduced.\nUpon RIPC, the level of cardioprotective RNase1 increased, while the concentration of damaging eRNA and TNF-\u03b1 decreased. The present findings imply a significant contribution of the RIPC-dependent (endothelial) RNase1 for improving the outcome of cardiac surgery.

Recently, it has been shown that HspB8 can enhance cardiac function and render cardioprotection. However, the potential benefits of HspB8 action on ischemic stroke and the underlying mechanism(s) are largely unknown. To investigate whether HspB8 exerts protective effects on in vitro ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury, mouse neuroblastoma cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R). At first, we investigated and described the HspB8 expression and distribution in N2A cells exposed to OGD/R. Expressions of HspB8 were upregulated in mouse N2A cells after OGD/R, both at mRNA and protein levels. The level of HspB8 began increased after the OGD/R and peaked at 12 hour (12h) after the reperfusion, then declined at 24-hour time points, however, the level of HspB8 was still significantly increased compared to controls. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the expressed HspB8 was constitutively localized in the cytoplasm and at the periphery of the nucleus. Nuclear HspB8 levels increased after OGD/R compared with levels in the control, beginning as early as 4h reperfusion, the most conspicuous nuclear HspB8 staining was observed after 24h of reperfusion. Furthermore, overexpression of HspB8 reduced OGD/R -induced apoptosis by reducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that increased HspB8 expression and its nuclear shift in mouse N2A neuroblastoma cells protected against I/R injury, resulting in reduced apoptosis with the decrease of the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. Therefore, HspB8 might play a fundamental role in opposing and alleviating I/R injury in primary myocardial cells, and it may constitute a new therapeutic target for cerebral ischemic diseases.", "journal": "Current neurovascular research", "date": "2015-01-06", "authors": ["BinbinYang", "HeZhang", "XiaoyeMo", "HanXiao", "ZhipingHu"], "doi": "10.2174/1567202612666150102152350"}

As skin autofluorescence (sAF) can assess subcutaneous accumulation of fluorescent AGEs, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between AGE-modified cardiac tissue collagen and AGE-related sAF in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery patients.\nBetween January 2011 and January 2012, data from 72 consecutive male patients undergoing isolated CABG were prospectively recorded. Collagen fractions were isolated from the right atrial appendages of these patients by proteolysis and collagenase digestion. Collagen was quantified by hydroxyproline assay, and AGEs by AGE-related intrinsic fluorescence; sAF was measured using an autofluorescence reader.\nBiochemical analysis showed that the insoluble cardiac collagen fraction contained the highest amounts of accumulated AGEs; the AGE-related intrinsic fluorescence of this fraction increased with age (P=0.0001), blood glucose (P=0.002), HbA1c (P=0.01) and sAF (P=0.008).\nThis study demonstrated for the first time a relationship between cardiac tissue glycation and AGE-related sAF.

In this paper, we review four major approaches to promoting angiogenesis and vascularization in cardiac tissue engineering and regeneration: delivery of pro-angiogenic factors/molecules, direct cell implantation/cell sheet grafting, fabrication of prevascularized cardiac constructs, and the use of bioreactors to promote angiogenesis and vascularization. We further provide a detailed review and discussion on the early perfusion design in nature-derived biomaterials, synthetic biodegradable polymers, tissue-derived acellular scaffolds/whole hearts, and hydrogel derived from extracellular matrix.

Using an in vivo rat model, we assessed hemodynamic parameters and time to hemodynamic failure after central venous application (vena jugularis interna) of anidulafungin (low-dose group, 2.5 mg/kg body weight [BW]; high-dose group, 25 mg/kg BW), caspofungin (low-dose group, 0.875 mg/kg BW; high-dose group, 8.75 mg/kg BW), micafungin (low-dose group, 3 mg/kg BW; high-dose group, 30 mg/kg BW), and placebo (0.9% sodium chloride). Left ventricular heart tissue was collected to determine mitochondrial enzyme activity via spectrophotometric measurements. mRNA expression of transcriptional regulators and primary mitochondrial transcripts, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and citrate synthase activity were also explored. Animals receiving high-dose anidulafungin or caspofungin showed an immediate decrease in hemodynamic function. All of the subjects in these groups died during the observation period. Every animal in the untreated control group survived (P < 0.001). Hemodynamic failure was not noticed in the anidulafungin and caspofungin low-dose groups.

{"title": "Effects of physiologic mechanical stimulation on embryonic chick cardiomyocytes using a microfluidic cardiac cell culture model.", "abstract": "Hemodynamic mechanical cues play a critical role in the early development and functional maturation of cardiomyocytes (CM). Therefore, tissue engineering approaches that incorporate immature CM into functional cardiac tissues capable of recovering or replacing damaged cardiac muscle require physiologically relevant environments to provide the appropriate mechanical cues. The goal of this work is to better understand the subcellular responses of immature cardiomyocytes using an in vitro cardiac cell culture model that realistically mimics in vivo mechanical conditions, including cyclical fluid flows, chamber pressures, and tissue strains that could be experienced by implanted cardiac tissues. Cardiomyocytes were cultured in a novel microfluidic cardiac cell culture model (CCCM) to achieve accurate replication of the mechanical cues experienced by ventricular CM. Day 10 chick embryonic ventricular CM (3.5 \u00d7 10(4) cell clusters per cell chamber) were cultured for 4 days in the CCCM under cyclic mechanical stimulation (10 mmHg, 8-15% stretch, 2 Hz frequency) and ventricular cells from the same embryo were cultured in a static condition for 4 days as controls. Additionally, ventricular cell suspensions and ventricular tissue from day 16 chick embryo were collected and analyzed for comparison with CCCM cultured CM. The gene expressions and protein synthesis of calcium handling proteins decreased significantly during the isolation process. Mechanical stimulation of the cultured CM using the CCCM resulted in an augmentation of gene expression and protein synthesis of calcium handling proteins compared to the 2D constructs cultured in the static conditions. Further, the CCCM conditioned 2D constructs have a higher beat rate and contractility response to isoproterenol. These results demonstrate that early mechanical stimulation of embryonic cardiac tissue is necessary for tissue proliferation and for protein synthesis of the calcium handling constituents required for tissue contractility. Thus, physiologic mechanical conditioning may be essential for generating functional cardiac patches for replacement of injured cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2014-12-30", "authors": ["Mai-DungNguyen", "Joseph PTinney", "FeiYe", "Ahmed AElnakib", "FangpingYuan", "AymanEl-Baz", "PalaniappanSethu", "Bradley BKeller", "Guruprasad AGiridharan"], "doi": "10.1021/ac503716z"}
{"title": "Neuronal Na+ channel blockade suppresses arrhythmogenic diastolic Ca2+ release.", "abstract": "Sudden death resulting from cardiac arrhythmias is the most common consequence of cardiac disease. Certain arrhythmias caused by abnormal impulse formation including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) are associated with delayed afterdepolarizations resulting from diastolic Ca2+ release (DCR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Despite high response of CPVT to agents directly affecting Ca2+ cycling, the incidence of refractory cases is still significant. Surprisingly, these patients often respond to treatment with Na+ channel blockers. However, the relationship between Na+ influx and disturbances in Ca2+ handling immediately preceding arrhythmias in CPVT remains poorly understood and is the object of this study.\nWe performed optical Ca2+ and membrane potential imaging in ventricular myocytes and intact cardiac muscles as well as surface ECGs on a CPVT mouse model with a mutation in cardiac calsequestrin. We demonstrate that a subpopulation of Na+ channels (neuronal Na+ channels; nNav) colocalize with ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels (RyR2). Disruption of the crosstalk between nNav and RyR2 by nNav blockade with riluzole reduced and also desynchronized DCR in isolated cardiomyocytes and in intact cardiac tissue. Such desynchronization of DCR on cellular and tissue level translated into decreased arrhythmias in CPVT mice.\nThus, our study offers the first evidence that nNav contribute to arrhythmogenic DCR, thereby providing a conceptual basis for mechanism-based antiarrhythmic therapy.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2014-12-30", "authors": ["Przemys\u0142aw BRadwa\u0144ski", "LuciaBrunello", "RengasayeeVeeraraghavan", "Hsiang-TingHo", "QingLou", "Michael AMakara", "Andriy EBelevych", "MirceaAnghelescu", "Silvia GPriori", "PompeoVolpe", "Thomas JHund", "Paul M LJanssen", "Peter JMohler", "John H BBridge", "StevenPoelzing", "S\u00e1ndorGy\u00f6rke"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvu262\n10.1113/jphysiol.2014.277699"}

However, it reduced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and the glutathione peroxidase and the level of reduced glutathione.

Pretreatment of vincristine (25\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) or quercetin (10\u00a0mg/kg) alone for 2\u00a0weeks ameliorated these cardiotoxic effects partially. However, treatment of both vincristine and quercetin for a similar period reduced the serum CK-MB, LDH, SGPT and cTnT levels near to normal levels in ISO-treated rats. Concomitantly, the test drugs improved the status of antioxidants and decreased the cardiac lipid peroxidation products. Combined treatment of both the drugs also restored the pathological electrocardiographic patterns and reduced the area of myocardial necrosis.

Consequently, future generations of sea turtles may be at risk from increasing nest temperatures due to climate change, but little is known about how embryos respond to heat stress.

This study provides the first evidence of an expression response in the heat shock genes of embryos of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) exposed to realistic and near-lethal temperatures (34\u00b0C and 36\u00b0C) for 1 or 3 hours.

Under the most extreme treatment (36\u00b0C, 3h), Hsp70 increased mRNA expression by a factor of 38.8 in heart tissue and 15.7 in brain tissue, while Hsp90 mRNA expression increased by a factor of 98.3 in heart tissue and 14.7 in brain tissue. Hence, both Hsp70 and Hsp90 are useful biomarkers for assessing heat stress in the late-stage embryos of sea turtles.

Escherichia coli endotoxin was injected into the canines via the central vein, and hemodynamics were monitored. Energy metabolism, UCP2 mRNA and protein expression, and UCP2 localization were analyzed, and the correlation between energy metabolism changes, and UCP2 expression was determined. After the canine endotoxin shock model was successfully established, the expression of UCP2 mRNA and protein was found to increase, with later time points showing significant increases (P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence assays of UCP2 in heart tissue showed that UCP2 was localized in the cytoplasm, and its expression pattern was the same as that found in the mRNA and protein analyses. The energy metabolism results revealed that the ADP levels increased, but the ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) levels and ATP/ADP and PCr/ATP ratios decreased in the model. In particular, the PCr/ATP ratio was significantly different from that of the control group 6 h after shock (P < 0.05). Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that the UCP2 protein and mRNA levels were negatively correlated with myocardial energy levels.

{"title": "Construction of three-dimensional vascularized cardiac tissue with cell sheet engineering.", "abstract": "Construction of three-dimensional (3D) tissues with pre-isolated cells is a promising achievement for novel medicine and drug-discovery research. Our laboratory constructs 3D tissues with an innovative and unique method for layering multiple cell sheets. Cell sheets maintain a high-efficiently regenerating function, because of the higher cell density and higher transplantation efficiency, compared to other cell-delivery methods. Cell sheets have already been applied in clinical applications for regenerative medicine in treating patients with various diseases. Therefore, in our search to develop a more efficient treatment with cell sheets, we are constructing 3D tissues by layering cell sheets. Native animal tissues and organs have an abundance of capillaries to supply oxygen and nutrients, and to remove waste molecules. In our investigation of vascularized cardiac cell sheets, we have found that endothelial cells within cell sheets spontaneously form blood vessel networks as in vivo capillaries. To construct even thicker 3D tissues by layering multiple cell sheets, it is critical to have a medium or blood flow within the vascular networks of the cell sheets. Therefore, to perfuse medium or blood in the cell sheet vascular network to maintain the viability of all cells, we developed two types of vascular beds; (1) a femoral muscle-based vascular bed, and (2) a synthetic collagen gel-based vascular bed. Both vascular beds successfully provide the critical flow of culture medium, which allows 12-layer cell sheets to survive. Such bioreactor systems, when combined with cell sheet engineering techniques, have produced functional vascularized 3D tissues. Here we explain and discuss the various processes to obtain vascular networks by properly connecting cell sheets and the engineering of 3D tissues.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2014-12-20", "authors": ["KatsuhisaSakaguchi", "TatsuyaShimizu", "TeruoOkano"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.12.016"}

High-rate, full-field image acquisition in multiphoton microscopy is achievable by parallelization of the excitation and detection pathways. We developed our approach via a diffractive optical element which splits a pulsed laser into 16 beamlets and exploits a descanned detection system consisting of an array of beamlet-associated photomultiplier tubes. The optical performance of the multiphoton multispot system (MCube) has been characterized in cardiac tissue sections and subsequently used for the first time for fluorescence imaging of cardiomyocyte Ca\u00b2\u207a dynamics in viable acute cardiac slices. Multispot multiphoton microscopy (MMM) has never been used before to monitor Ca\u00b2\u207a dynamics in thick, viable tissue samples. Acute heart slices are a powerful close-to-in vivo model of Ca\u00b2\u207a imaging allowing the simultaneous observation of several cells in their own tissue environment, exploiting the multiphoton excitation ability to penetrate scattering tissues. Moreover, we show that the concurrent high spatial and temporal resolutions afforded by the parallel scanning in MMM can be exploited to simultaneously assess subcellular Ca\u00b2\u207a dynamics in different cells in the tissue.

{"title": "Acoustic signal emission monitoring as a novel method to predict steam pops during radiofrequency ablation: preliminary observations.", "abstract": "Steam pop is an explosive rupture of cardiac tissue caused by tissue overheating above 100 \u00b0C, resulting in steam formation, predisposing to serious complications associated with radiofrequency (RF) ablations. However, there are currently no reliable techniques to predict the occurrence of steam pops. We propose the utility of acoustic signals emitted during RF ablation as a novel method to predict steam pop formation and potentially prevent serious complications.\nRadiofrequency generator parameters (power, impedance, and temperature) were temporally recorded during ablations performed in an in vitro bovine myocardial model. The acoustic system consisted of HTI-96-min hydrophone, microphone preamplifier, and sound card connected to a laptop computer. The hydrophone has the frequency range of 2 Hz to 30 kHz and nominal sensitivity in the range -240 to -165 dB. The sound was sampled at 96 kHz with 24-bit resolution. Output signal from the hydrophone was fed into the camera audio input to synchronize the video stream. An automated system was developed for the detection and analysis of acoustic events.\nNine steam pops were observed. Three distinct sounds were identified as warning signals, each indicating rapid steam formation and its release from tissue. These sounds had a broad frequency range up to 6 kHz with several spectral peaks around 2-3 kHz. Subjectively, these warning signals were perceived as separate loud clicks, a quick succession of clicks, or continuous squeaking noise. Characteristic acoustic signals were identified preceding 80% of pops occurrence. Six cardiologists were able to identify 65% of acoustic signals accurately preceding the pop. An automated system identified the characteristic warning signals in 85% of cases. The mean time from the first acoustic signal to pop occurrence was 46 \u00b1 20 seconds. The automated system had 72.7% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity for predicting pops.\nEasily identifiable characteristic acoustic emissions predictably occur before imminent steam popping during RF ablations. Such acoustic emissions can be carefully monitored during an ablation and may be useful to prevent serious complications during RF delivery.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology", "date": "2014-12-18", "authors": ["William W BChik", "RomanKosobrodov", "AbhishekBhaskaran", "Michael Anthony TonyBarry", "Doan TrangNguyen", "JimPouliopoulos", "KarenByth", "GopalSivagangabalan", "Stuart PThomas", "David LRoss", "AlistairMcEwan", "PrameshKovoor", "AravindaThiagalingam"], "doi": "10.1111/jce.12598"}
{"title": "Positive feedback regulation between adiponectin and T-cadherin impacts adiponectin levels in tissue and plasma of male mice.", "abstract": "Adiponectin (Adipo), a multimeric adipocyte-secreted protein abundant in the circulation, is implicated in cardiovascular protective functions. Recent work documented that Adipo locally associates with responsive tissues through interactions with T-cadherin (Tcad), an atypical, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cadherin cell surface glycoprotein. Mice deficient for Tcad lack tissue-associated Adipo, accumulate Adipo in the circulation, and mimic the Adipo knockout (KO) cardiovascular phenotype. In reverse, Tcad protein is visibly reduced from cardiac tissue in Adipo-KO mice, suggesting interdependent regulation of the 2 proteins. Here, we evaluate the effect of Adipo on Tcad protein expression. Adipo and Tcad proteins were colocalized in aorta, heart, and skeletal muscle. Adipo positively regulated levels of Tcad protein in vivo and in endothelial cell (EC) cultures. In Tcad-KO mice, binding of endogenous and exogenously administered Adipo to cardiovascular tissues was dramatically reduced. Consistently, knockdown of Tcad in cultured murine vascular ECs significantly diminished Adipo binding. In search for a possible mechanism, we found that enzymatic cleavage of Tcad with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C increases plasma Adipo while decreasing tissue-bound levels. Similarly, pretreatment of cultured ECs with serum containing Adipo attenuated phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-mediated Tcad cleavage. In vivo administration of adenovirus producing Adipo suppressed plasma levels of GPI phospholipase D, the endogenous cleavage enzyme for GPI-anchored proteins. In conclusion, our data show that both circulating and tissue-bound Adipo levels are dependent on Tcad and, in reverse, regulate tissue Tcad levels through a positive feedback loop that operates by suppressing phospholipase-mediated Tcad release from the cell surface.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2014-12-17", "authors": ["KeisukeMatsuda", "YuyaFujishima", "NorikazuMaeda", "TakuyaMori", "AyumuHirata", "RyoheiSekimoto", "YuTsushima", "ShigekiMasuda", "MasayaYamaoka", "KanaInoue", "HitoshiNishizawa", "ShunbunKita", "BarbaraRanscht", "TohruFunahashi", "IichiroShimomura"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2014-1618"}

Here, we show that skeletal muscle-specific EcSOD transgenic mice are protected from cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction under the condition of type 1 diabetes mellitus induced by streptozotocin injection. We also show that both exercise training and muscle-specific transgenic expression of EcSOD result in elevated EcSOD protein in the blood and heart without increased transcription in the heart, suggesting that enhanced expression of EcSOD from skeletal muscle redistributes to the heart. Importantly, cardiac tissue in transgenic mice displayed significantly reduced oxidative stress, aberrant cell signaling, and inflammatory cytokine expression compared with wild-type mice under the same diabetic condition.\nEnhanced expression of EcSOD in skeletal muscle is sufficient to mitigate streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy through attenuation of oxidative stress, aberrant cell signaling, and inflammation, suggesting a cross-organ mechanism by which exercise training improves cardiac function in diabetes mellitus.", "journal": "Circulation.

Here, we investigated whether luteolin pretreatment diminishes myocardial I/R injury in diabetic rats by affecting eNOS and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). After diabetic rats were produced by streptozotocin treatment (65 mg/kg) for 3 weeks, luteolin (100 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d) or L-NAME (25 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d) was administered intragastrically for 2 weeks. Hearts were then isolated and subjected to 30 minutes of global ischemia followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. Pretreatment with luteolin significantly improved left ventricular function and coronary flow throughout reperfusion, increased cardiac tissue viability and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity, and reduced coronary lactate dehydrogenase release, and the myocardial malonaldehyde level in diabetic I/R rat hearts. All these improving effects of luteolin were significantly attenuated by L-NAME. Luteolin also significantly upregulated eNOS expression in diabetic rat hearts after I/R. Ca-induced mPTP opening and mitochondrial inner membrane potential reduction were significantly inhibited in ventricular myocytes isolated from luteolin-treated diabetic rats, and this effect was attenuated by L-NAME.

Also, the cytokine response differed. Both in sheep and pigs an IFN-gamma response occurred which seemed to be a slightly more pronounced in sheep. In sheep, also IL-10 and IL-4 mRNA expression showed an increase, but later than IFN-gamma and with more variation. However, in pigs no such increase was seen.

Oral allergic reaction was quantified by rectal thermometry and plasma mouse mast cell protease (mMCP)-1 by ELISA. Cardiovascular functions were determined by a non-invasive tail cuff method.

Population-based data support that elevated serum uric acids are associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. However, the mechanism by which excess uric acid promotes these maladaptive cardiac effects has not been explored. In assessing the role of Western diet-induced increases in uric acid, we hypothesized that reductions in uric acid would prevent Western diet-induced development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac stiffness, and impaired diastolic relaxation by reducing growth and profibrotic signaling pathways. Four-weeks-old C57BL6/J male mice were fed excess fat (46%) and fructose (17.5%) with or without allopurinol (125 mg/L), a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, for 16 weeks. The Western diet-induced increases in serum uric acid along with increases in cardiac tissue xanthine oxidase activity temporally related to increases in body weight, fat mass, and insulin resistance without changes in blood pressure. The Western diet induced cardiomyocte hypertrophy, myocardial oxidative stress, interstitial fibrosis, and impaired diastolic relaxation. Further, the Western diet enhanced activation of the S6 kinase-1 growth pathway and the profibrotic transforming growth factor-\u03b21/Smad2/3 signaling pathway and macrophage proinflammatory polarization. All results improved with allopurinol treatment, which lowered cardiac xanthine oxidase as well as serum uric acid levels.

The mechanism by which loss of GAA activity causes cardiomyopathy is poorly understood. We reprogrammed fibroblasts from patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that were differentiated to cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM). Pompe iPSC-CMs had undetectable GAA activity and pathognomonic glycogen-filled lysosomes. Nonetheless, Pompe and control iPSC-CMs exhibited comparable contractile properties in engineered cardiac tissue. Impaired autophagy has been implicated in Pompe skeletal muscle; however, control and Pompe iPSC-CMs had comparable clearance rates of LC3-II-detected autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, the lysosome-associated membrane proteins, LAMP1 and LAMP2, from Pompe iPSC-CMs demonstrated higher electrophoretic mobility compared with control iPSC-CMs. Brefeldin A induced disruption of the Golgi in control iPSC-CMs reproduced the higher mobility forms of the LAMPs, suggesting that Pompe iPSC-CMs produce LAMPs lacking appropriate glycosylation. Isoelectric focusing studies revealed that LAMP2 has a more alkaline pI in Pompe compared with control iPSC-CMs due largely to hyposialylation. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of N-linked glycans demonstrated reduced diversity of multiantennary structures and the major presence of a trimannose complex glycan precursor in Pompe iPSC-CMs. These data suggest that Pompe cardiomyopathy has a glycan processing abnormality and thus shares features with hypertrophic cardiomyopathies observed in the congenital disorders of glycosylation.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2014-12-10", "authors": ["Kunil KRaval", "RanTao", "Brent EWhite", "Willem JDe Lange", "Chad HKoonce", "JunyingYu", "Priya SKishnani", "James AThomson", "Deane FMosher", "John CRalphe", "Timothy JKamp"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M114.628628"}
{"title": "Cooperative stabilization of transthyretin by clusterin and diflunisal.", "abstract": "The circulating protein transthyretin (TTR) can unfold, oligomerize, and form highly structured amyloid fibrils that are deposited in tissues, causing organ damage and disease. This pathogenic process is caused by a heritable TTR point mutation in cases of familial TTR-related amyloidosis or wild-type TTR in cases of age-associated amyloidosis (previously called senile systemic amyloidosis). The TTR amyloid cascade is hypothesized to begin with the dissociation of the TTR native tetrameric structure into folded but unstable monomeric TTR subunits. Unfolding of monomeric TTR initiates an oligomerization process leading to aggregation and fibril formation. Numerous proteostatic mechanisms for regulating the TTR amyloid cascade exist. Extracellular chaperones provide an innate defense against misfolded proteins. Clusterin (CLU), a plasma protein, has the capacity to recognize exposed hydrophobic regions of misfolded proteins, shielding them from aggregation. We have previously demonstrated that CLU is associated with the amyloid fibrils in cardiac tissues from patients with TTR amyloidosis. In this study, we have used tetrameric and monomeric TTR structural variants to determine the ability of CLU to inhibit TTR amyloid fibril formation. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we determined that CLU preferentially stabilizes monomeric TTR and generates increasingly stable conformations under acid stress. Moreover, studies using surface plasmon resonance showed a direct interaction of CLU with high-molecular weight TTR oligomers.

However, the ECM alone forms a hydrogel that is very soft compared to the native myocardium. As both the stiffness and composition of the ECM are important in regulating cell behavior and can have complex synergistic effects, we sought to develop an ECM-based scaffold with tunable biochemical and mechanical properties. We used solubilized rat cardiac ECM from two developmental stages (neonatal, adult) combined with fibrin hydrogels that were cross-linked with transglutaminase. We show that ECM was retained within the gels and that the Young's modulus could be tuned to span the range of the developing and mature heart. C-kit+ cardiovascular progenitor cells from pediatric patients with congenital heart defects were seeded into the hybrid gels. Both the elastic modulus and composition of the scaffolds impacted the expression of endothelial and smooth muscle cell genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the hybrid gels are injectable, and thus have potential for minimally invasive therapies.

{"title": "Optimal contact forces to minimize cardiac perforations before, during, and/or after radiofrequency or cryothermal ablations.", "abstract": "Catheter perforations remain a major clinical concern during ablation procedures for treatment of atrial arrhythmias and may lead to life-threatening cardiac tamponade. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation alters the biomechanical properties of cardiac tissue, ultimately allowing for perforation to occur more readily. Studies on the effects of cryoablation on perforation force as well as studies defining the perforation force of human tissue are limited.\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the required force to elicit perforation of cardiac atrial tissue after or during ablation procedures.\nEffects of RF or cryothermal ablations on catheter perforation forces for both swine (n = 83 animals, 530 treatments) and human (n = 8 specimens, 136 treatments) cardiac tissue were investigated.\nOverall average forces resulting in perforation of healthy unablated tissue were 406g \u00b1 170g for swine and 591g \u00b1 240g for humans. Post-RF ablation applications considerably reduced these forces to 246g \u00b1 118g for swine and 362 \u00b1 185g for humans (P <.001). Treatments with cryoablation did not significantly alter forces required to induce perforations. Decreasing catheter sizes resulted in a reduction in forces required to perforate the atrial wall (P <.001). Catheter perforations occurred over an array of contact forces with a minimum of 38g being observed.\nThe swine model likely underestimates the required perforation forces relative to those of human tissues. We provide novel insights related to the comparative effects of RF and cryothermal ablations on the potential for inducing undesired punctures, with RF ablation reducing perforation force significantly.

However, the expression of different drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) in RL-14 cells has not been elucidated yet. Therefore, the main objectives of the current work were to investigate the capacity of RL-14 cells to express different cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes and correlate this expression to primary cardiomyocytes.\nThe expression of CYP isoenzymes was determined at mRNA, protein and catalytic activity levels using real time-PCR, Western blot analysis and liquid chromatography-electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS), respectively.\nOur results showed that RL-14 cells constitutively express CYP \u03c9-hydroxylases, CYP1A, 1B, 4A and 4F; CYP epoxygenases, CYP2B, 2C and 2J; in addition to soluble epoxide hydrolayse (EPHX2) at mRNA and protein levels. The basal expression of CYP \u03c9-hydroxylases, epoxygenases and EPHX2 was supported by the ability of RL-14 cells to convert arachidonic acid to its biologically active metabolites, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (20-HETEs), 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (14,15-EET), 11,12-EET, 8,9-EET, 5,6-EET, 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-DHET), 11,12-DHET, 8,9-DHET and 5,6-DHET. Furthermore, RL-14 cells express CYP epoxygenases and \u03c9-hydroxylase at comparable levels to those expressed in adult and fetal human primary cardiomyocytes cells implying the importance of RL-14 cells as a model for studying DMEs in vitro. Lastly, different CYP families were induced in RL-14 cells using 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and fenofibrate at mRNA and protein levels.\nThe current study provides the first evidence that RL-14 cells express CYP isoenzymes at comparable levels to those expressed in the primary cells and thus offers a unique in vitro model to study DMEs in the heart.", "journal": "Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["Zaid HMaayah", "Osama HElshenawy", "Hassan NAlthurwi", "GhadaAbdelhamid", "Ayman O SEl-Kadi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vascn.2014.11.005"}

We studied the relative contributions of experimentally recorded intrinsic and extrinsic variability to dispersion of repolarization in tissue.

(99m)Tc-labeled duramycin is a peptide-based imaging agent that binds PE with high affinity and specificity. The goal of the current study was to investigate the clearance kinetics of (99m)Tc-labeled duramycin in a large animal model (normal pigs) and to assess its uptake in the heart using a pig model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.\nThe clearance and distribution of intravenously injected (99m)Tc-duramycin were characterized in sham-operated animals (n=5). In a closed chest model of myocardial ischemia, coronary occlusion was induced by balloon angioplasty (n=9). (99m)Tc-duramycin (10-15mCi) was injected intravenously at 1hour after reperfusion. SPECT/CT was acquired at 1 and 3hours after injection. Cardiac tissues were analyzed for changes associated with acute cellular injuries. Autoradiography and gamma counting were used to determine radioactivity uptake. For the remaining animals, (99m)Tc-tetrafosamin scan was performed on the second day to identify the infarct site.\nIntravenously injected (99m)Tc-duramycin cleared from circulation predominantly via the renal/urinary tract with an \u03b1-phase half-life of 3.6\u00b10.3minutes and \u03b2-phase half-life of 179.9\u00b164.7minutes.

The size of (99m)Tc-duramycin positive myocardium was qualitatively larger than the infarct size delineated by the perfusion defect in (99m)Tc-tetrafosmin uptake. This was consistent with findings from tissue analysis and autoradiography.\n(99m)Tc-duramycin was demonstrated, in a large animal model, to have suitable clearance and biodistribution profiles for imaging.

We ligated the left coronary artery (LCA) without reperfusion in mice and administered either NaCl or 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA, 20 mg/kg/d) intraperitoneally for 4 weeks. Cardiac rupture rates during the first week of MI were 37.5% and 18.2% in the control and 4-PBA groups, respectively. The extent of ventricular aneurysm and fibrosis was less, and the cardiac function better, in the 4-PBA group compared with the control group. The protein levels of ER stress markers in the heart tissues of the control group remained elevated during the entire 4-week period after MI, while pro-apoptotic proteins mainly increased in the early phase, and the pro-fibrotic proteins markedly increased in the late phase post MI; 4-PBA decreased all of these protein levels. In the primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or fibroblasts, hypoxia (3% O2) increased the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes and promoted the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts, all of which were attenuated by 4-PBA (0.5 mM).

Random electrospun fibers with various PGS/PBS-DLA compositions (70/30, 60/40, 50/50, and 0/100) were fabricated. To examine the suitability of these fiber blends for heart patches, their morphology, as well as their physical, chemical, and mechanical properties were measured before examining their biocompatibility through cell adhesion. The fabricated fibers were bead-free and exhibited a relatively narrow diameter distribution. The addition of PBS-DLA to PGS resulted in an increase of the average fiber diameter, whereas increasing the amount of PBS-DLA decreased the hydrophilicity and the water uptake of the nanofibrous scaffolds to values that approached those of neat PBS-DLA nanofibers. Moreover, the addition of PBS-DLA significantly increased the elastic modulus. Initial toxicity studies with C2C12 myoblast cells up to 72\u2009h confirmed nontoxic behavior of the blends. Immunofluorescence analyses and scanning electron microscopy analyses confirmed that C2C12 cells showed better cell attachment and proliferation on electrospun mats with higher PBS-DLA content. However, immunofluorescence analyses of the 3-day-old rat cardiomyocytes cultured for 2 and 5 days demonstrated better attachment on the 70/30 fibers containing well-aligned sarcomeres and expressing high amounts of connexin 43 in cellular junctions indicating efficient cell-to-cell communication.

{"title": "The role of short term memory and conduction velocity restitution in alternans formation.", "abstract": "Alternans is the periodic beat-to-beat short-long alternation in action potential duration (APD), which is considered to be a precursor of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In extended cardiac tissue, electrical alternans can be either spatially concordant (SCA, all cells oscillate in phase) or spatially discordant (SDA, cells in different regions oscillate out of phase). SDA gives rise to an increase in the spatial dispersion of repolarization, which is thought to be proarrhythmic. In this paper, we investigated the effect of two aspects of short term memory (STM) (\u03b1, \u03c4) and their interplay with conduction velocity (CV) restitution on alternans formation using numerical simulations of a mapping model with two beats of memory. Here, \u03b1 quantifies the dependence of APD restitution on pacing history and \u03c4 characterizes APD accommodation, which is an exponential change of APD over time once basic cycle length (BCL) changes. Our main findings are as follows: In both single cell and spatially coupled homogeneous cable, the interplay between \u03b1 and \u03c4 affects the dynamical behaviors of the system. For the case of large APD accommodation (\u03c4 \u2265 290 ms), increase in \u03b1 leads to suppression of alternans. However, if APD accommodation is small (\u03c4 \u2264 250 ms), increase in \u03b1 leads to appearance of additional alternans region. On the other hand, the slope of CV restitution does not change the regions of alternans in the cable. However, steep CV restitution leads to more complicated dynamical behaviors of the system. Specifically, SDA instead of SCA are observed. In addition, for steep CV restitution and sufficiently large \u03c4, we observed formations of type II conduction block (CB2), transition from type I conduction block (CB1) to CB2, and unstable nodes.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2014-12-02", "authors": ["NingWei", "YoichiroMori", "Elena GTolkacheva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.11.014"}

We launched this study to examine the role of Tsc1 in cardiac physiology and pathology. Mice in which Tsc1 was deleted in cardiac tissue and vascular smooth muscle (Tsc1c/cSM22cre(+/-)), developed progressive cardiomegaly and hypertension and died early. Hearts of Tsc1c/cSM22cre(+/-) mice displayed a progressive increase in cardiomyocyte number, and to a lesser extent, size between the ages of 1 and 6 weeks. In addition, compared to control hearts, proliferation markers (phospho-histone 3 and PCNA) were elevated in Tsc1c/cSM22cre(+/-) cardiomyocytes at 0-4 weeks, suggesting that cardiomyocyte proliferation was the predominant mechanism underlying cardiomegaly in Tsc1c/cSM22cre(+/-) mice. To examine the contribution of Tsc1 deletion in peripheral vascular smooth muscle to the cardiac phenotype, Tsc1c/cSM22cre(+/-) mice were treated with the antihypertensive, hydralazine. Prevention of hypertension had no effect on survival, cardiac size, or cardiomyocyte number in these mice.

The Tsc1c/cSMAcre-ER(T2+/-) mice also developed hypertension. However, their survival was normal and no cardiac abnormalities were observed.

Shengmai injection (SMI) is a Chinese medicine, which is widely used in China to treat ischemic heart diseases with speculated functions of modulating energy metabolism. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective activity of SMI via the modulation of energy metabolism, a proteomic analysis was performed on ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injured hearts of rats in this study. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to measure the protein expression profiles of heart tissues. Differentially expressed proteins among groups were identified using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS). Western blot analysis was used to validate differentially expressed proteins. Proteomic data revealed 14 major differentially expressed proteins that are related to the energy metabolism. It was found that the glucose oxidation, TCA cycle and ATP synthesis related proteins were consistently up-regulated in SMI treated rats, which is beneficial to aerobic respiration and ATP generation. In contrast, two proteins catalyzing fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation were down-regulated, implying the inhibition of this pathway to avoid high oxygen consumption. It is thus concluded that one of the major mechanisms of SMI protection against IR injury was modulation of the myocardial energy metabolism to improve cardiac efficiency through multiple metabolic pathways including stimulating glucose metabolism and inhibiting fatty acid metabolism. It provided potential protein targets for the therapeutic strategy through modulation of the myocardial energy metabolism.", "journal": "Molecular bioSystems", "date": "2014-11-28", "authors": ["ShuyuZhan", "XiaohuiFan", "FengZhang", "YiWang", "LiyuanKang", "ZhengLi"], "doi": "10.1039/c4mb00161c"}

Cardiac toxicity was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase in the serum, malondialdehyde (MDA) level in plasma and cardiac tissue, and antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) in cardiac tissue.\nMangiferin protected against DOX-induced increased mortality and electrocardiogram abnormality and decreased biochemical markers of cardiac toxicity i.\u2009e., lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme. In addition, elevation of plasma and cardiac tissue levels of MDA in response to DOX treatment were significantly attenuated. The reduction of cardiac activity of SOD was significantly reduced in contrast with the other antioxidant SYL and Vit E. Histopathologically, mangiferin treatment showed significant reduction in inflammatory cell number, fibrotic area, and necrotic foci as compared with DOX only-treated rats.\nThese results suggested that mangiferin had better protective effect against DOX-induced cardiac toxicity in comparison with SYL and VitE, thus besides the antioxidant activity, different mechanism may be involved in the action of mangiferin and need to be clarified in the future studies.", "journal": "Drug research", "date": "2014-11-27", "authors": ["WArozal", "F DSuyatna", "VJuniantito", "D SRosdiana", "SAmurugam", "RAulia", "E RMonayo", "RSiswandi"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0034-1394457"}

Here, we report the cardiac effects of a novel positive inotropic peptide isolated from the toxin of the Black Judean scorpion that activates neuronal tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels.\nAll venoms and peptides were isolated from Black Judean Scorpions (Buthotus Hottentotta) caught in the Judean Desert. The full scorpion venom increased left ventricular function in sedated mice in vivo, prolonged ventricular repolarization, and provoked ventricular arrhythmias. An inotropic peptide (BjIP) isolated from the full venom by chromatography increased cardiac contractility but did neither provoke ventricular arrhythmias nor prolong cardiac repolarization. BjIP increased intracellular calcium in ventricular cardiomyocytes and prolonged inactivation of the cardiac sodium current. Low concentrations of tetrodotoxin (200 nmol/L) abolished the effect of BjIP on calcium transients and sodium current. BjIP did not alter the function of Nav1.5, but selectively activated the brain-type sodium channels Nav1.6 or Nav1.3 in cellular electrophysiological recordings obtained from rodent thalamic slices. Nav1.3 (SCN3A) mRNA was detected in human and mouse heart tissue.\nOur pilot experiments suggest that selective activation of tetrodotoxin-sensitive neuronal sodium channels can safely increase cardiac contractility.

{"title": "The interplay of protein kinase A and perilipin 5 regulates cardiac lipolysis.", "abstract": "Defective lipolysis in mice lacking adipose triglyceride lipase provokes severe cardiac steatosis and heart dysfunction, markedly shortening life span. Similarly, cardiac muscle (CM)-specific Plin5 overexpression (CM-Plin5) leads to severe triglyceride (TG) accumulation in cardiomyocytes via impairing TG breakdown. Interestingly, cardiac steatosis due to overexpression of Plin5 is compatible with normal heart function and life span indicating a more moderate impact of Plin5 overexpression on cardiac lipolysis and energy metabolism. We hypothesized that cardiac Plin5 overexpression does not constantly impair cardiac lipolysis. In line with this assumption, TG levels decreased in CM of fasted compared with nonfasted CM-Plin5 mice indicating that fasting may lead to a diminished barrier function of Plin5. Recent studies demonstrated that Plin5 is phosphorylated, and activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to phosphorylation of Plin5, suggesting that Plin5 is a substrate for PKA. Furthermore, any significance of Plin5 phosphorylation by PKA in the regulation of TG mobilization from lipid droplets (LDs) is unknown. Here, we show that the lipolytic barrier of Plin5-enriched LDs, either prepared from cardiac tissue of CM-Plin5 mice or Plin5-transfected cells, is abrogated by incubation with PKA. Notably, PKA-induced lipolysis of LDs enriched with Plin5 carrying a single mutation at serine 155 (PlinS155A) of the putative PKA phosphorylation site was substantially impaired revealing a critical role for PKA in Plin5-regulated lipolysis. The strong increase in protein levels of phosphorylated PKA in CM of Plin5 transgenic mice may partially restore fatty acid release from Plin5-enriched LDs, rendering these hearts compatible with normal heart function despite massive steatosis.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2014-11-25", "authors": ["Nina MPollak", "DorisJaeger", "StephanieKolleritsch", "RobertZimmermann", "RudolfZechner", "AchimLass", "GuenterHaemmerle"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M114.604744\n10.1002/hep.27409"}

In this chapter, novel cardiac signal analysis techniques that allow the study and diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias are described, with emphasis on cardiac mapping which allows for spatiotemporal analysis of cardiac signals.Cardiac mapping can serve as a diagnostic tool by recording cardiac signals either in close contact to the heart tissue or noninvasively from the body surface, and allows the identification of cardiac sites responsible of the development or maintenance of arrhythmias. Cardiac mapping can also be used for research in cardiac arrhythmias in order to understand their mechanisms.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) mediates the toxicity of some PAHs. Exposure to a simple PAH mixture during embryo development consisting of an AHR agonist (benzo(a)pyrene-BaP) with fluoranthene (FL), an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 1(CYP1)--a gene induced by AHR activation--results in cardiac deformities. Exposure to BaP or FL alone at similar concentrations alters heart rates, but does not induce morphological deformities. Furthermore, AHR2 knockdown prevents the toxicity of BaP\u2009+\u2009FL mixture. Here, we used a zebrafish microarray analysis to identify heart-specific transcriptomic changes during early development that might underlie cardiotoxicity of BaP\u2009+\u2009FL. We used AHR2 morphant embryos to determine the role of this receptor in mediating toxicity. Control and knockdown embryos at 36\u2009h post-fertilization were exposed to DMSO, 100\u2009\u03bcg/l BaP, 500\u2009\u03bcg/l FL, or 100\u2009\u03bcg/l BaP\u2009+\u2009500\u2009\u03bcg/l FL, and heart tissues for RNA were extracted at 2, 6, 12, and 18\u2009h-post-exposure (hpe), prior to the appearance of cardiac deformities. Data show AHR2-dependent BaP\u2009+\u2009FL effects on expression of genes involved in protein biosynthesis and neuronal development in addition to signaling molecules and their associated molecular pathways.

The Mexican salamander (axolotl), Ambystoma mexicanum, provides an excellent vertebrate animal model for studying myofibrillogenesis due to its naturally occurring cardiac nonfunction mutation. Homozygous recessive embryos do not develop normal hearts due to a lack of myofibril formation. In previous studies, myofibril-inducing ribonucleic acid (MIR) from the normal wild-type axolotl genome was found to rescue mutant nonfunctioning hearts through restoration of tropomyosin levels followed by normal myofibril formation. Our purpose in this study is to identify and characterize functional homologs for the MIR from human fetal heart ribonucleic acid (RNA). After randomized cloning of human fetal heart RNA, 396 clones were analyzed for rescuing ability by using mutant heart rescue bioassays and confocal microscopy. By these analyses, we discovered a functional homolog of MIR from human fetal heart RNA, which is associated with the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene. This RNA came from our clone #30 and induces tropomyosin synthesis and myofibrillogenesis in mutant axolotl hearts which ordinarily do not synthesize tropomyosin or form organized myofibrils. Clone #30, a mitochondrial RNA molecule associated with human cytochrome c oxidase, serves as a functional homolog of MIR, leading to tropomyosin production, organized myofibrils, and beating cardiac tissue in mutant hearts.

Increased levels of inflammatory factors, including C-reactive protein (CRP), in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may affect myocardial perfusion. However, why the no-reflow phenomenon increases in inflammation stress after PCI is not clear. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects and molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of CRP on the expression of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) on the development of the no-reflow phenomenon. There was a significant increase in plasma levels of CRP and interleukin (IL)-6 in no-reflow patients, suggesting that inflammatory factors play an important role in the development of the no-reflow phenomenon. The mechanisms involved were further evaluated after reperfusion in a rat model mimicking the no-reflow phenomenon. Compared with normal reflow rats, there were significant increases in both COX-1 and COX-2 in cardiac tissue from no-reflow rats. The COX inhibitor indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the no-reflow area. In another series of experiments, human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) were treated with CRP at clinically relevant concentrations (5-25 \u03bcg/mL).

We previously demonstrated that miR-221 regulated cardiac hypertrophy in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrated that the cardiac-specific overexpression of miR-221 in mice evoked cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. The lipidated form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 was significantly decreased and sequestosome 1 was accumulated in cardiac tissues of transgenic (TG) mice, indicating that autophagy was impaired. Overexpression of miR-221 in vitro reduced autophagic flux through inhibiting autophagic vesicle formation. Furthermore, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was activated by miR-221, both in vivo and in vitro. The inactivation of mTOR abolished the miR-221-induced inhibition of autophagy and cardiac remodeling. Our previous study has demonstrated that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27 was a direct target of miR-221 in cardiomyocytes. Consistently, the expression of p27 was markedly suppressed in the myocardia of TG mice. Knockdown of p27 by siRNAs was sufficient to mimic the effects of miR-221 overexpression on mTOR activation and autophagy inhibition, whereas overexpression of p27 rescued miR-221-induced autophagic flux impairment. Inhibition of CDK2 restored the impaired autophagic flux and rescued the cardiac remodeling induced by either p27 knockdown or miR-221 overexpression.

All of these changes were validated using classical techniques and by using novel and precise selected reaction monitoring analysis and an RNA sequencing approach, with the total heart samples being increased to 24.

Physiological concentrations of estrogens have been shown to be cardioprotective, especially against the damaging effects of fructose-rich diet. The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of the renin-angiotensin system molecules with potentially deleterious effect on the heart (angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II type 1 receptor) and those with potentially protective effects, (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin II type 2 receptor), in ovariectomized fructose fed female rats with 17\u03b2-estradiol replacement. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were used for quantification of gene and protein expression in the heart. Fructose diet increased the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II type 1 receptor and decreased the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin II type 2 receptor. On the other hand, estradiol replacement seems to undo fructose diet effects on cardiac renin-angiotensin system. Downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II type 1 receptor, and reversion of expression of both potentially protective molecules, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin II type 2 receptor, to the control level in cardiac tissue took place. Obtained results suggest that estradiol may reverse the harmful effect of fructose-rich diet on the expression of renin-angiotensin system molecules.

Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 4 d with L-NAME in the absence or presence of (-)-epicatechin in the diet. The redox status in cardiac tissue was improved by (-)-epicatechin administration.

These effects of (-)-epicatechin were associated with a higher endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation at an activation site and a reduced expression of the regulatory subunit, p47(phox), suggesting the involvement of posttranslational mechanisms in (-)-epicatechin action. Thus, the (-)-epicatechin treatment would restore NO steady state levels in vivo through effects on both, its synthesis and degradation via the reaction with superoxide anion.

However, the biological and functional consequences of such reprogramming are not yet known.\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether noncardiac myocytes directly reprogrammed using miRNAs in vivo develop into mature functional cardiac myocytes in situ, and whether reprogramming leads to improvement of cardiac function.\nWe subjected fibroblast-specific protein 1-Cre mice/tandem dimer Tomato (tdTomato) mice to cardiac injury by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and injected lentiviruses encoding miR combo or a control nontargeting miRNA. miR combo significantly increased the number of reprogramming events in vivo. Five to 6 weeks after injury, morphological and physiological properties of tdTomato(-) and tdTomato(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells were analyzed ex vivo. tdTomato(+) cells expressed cardiac myocyte markers, sarcomeric organization, excitation-contraction coupling, and action potentials characteristic of mature ventricular cardiac myocytes (tdTomato(-) cells). Reprogramming was associated with improvement of cardiac function, as analyzed by serial echocardiography. There was a time delayed and progressive improvement in fractional shortening and other measures of ventricular function, indicating that miR combo promotes functional recovery of damaged myocardium.\nThe findings from this study further validate the potential use of miRNA-mediated reprogramming as a therapeutic approach to promote cardiac regeneration after myocardial injury.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2014-10-30", "authors": ["Tilanthi MJayawardena", "Elizabeth AFinch", "LunanZhang", "HengtaoZhang", "Conrad PHodgkinson", "Richard EPratt", "Paul BRosenberg", "MariaMirotsou", "Victor JDzau"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304510"}

Pixel misalignment due to contraction is a main cause of the presence of gross motion artifacts in action potential recordings. This study is focused on methods for identifying landmarks and tracking the motion of cardiac tissue for preparations in optical mapping recordings. This is a first step toward our long-term goal to implement a landmark-based image registration technique to correct for pixel misalignment in cardiac optical mapping fluorescence videos and, hence, for gross motion artifacts. Preliminary results for the registration step are presented as an initial proof of concept. The characteristics of the optical mapping images are challenging, since their lack of contrast and well-defined features impose a limitation on the techniques than can be used for landmark selection and motion tracking. This paper compares results of motion estimation of the cardiac surface with two approaches that do not rely on high-contrast features: 1) Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) detected \"keypoints,\" to be used as landmarks for motion tracking, as well as 2) a classical global optical flow (OF) algorithm. Both are applied to low-contrast and low-resolution cardiac fluorescence images. We demonstrate that the performance of SIFT is superior to that of OF for pixel motion tracking in cardiac optical mapping images with simulated motion.

Recent studies show that inserting microRNA target sequences into the genomes of certain viruses can eradicate these viruses within local host tissues that specifically express the cognate microRNA. Here, we demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that incorporating target sequences for miRNA-133 and -206 into the 5' untranslated region of the CVB3 genome ameliorated CVB3 virulence in skeletal muscle and myocardial cells that specifically expressed the cognate cellular microRNAs. Compared to wild-type CVB3, viral replication of the engineered CVB3 was attenuated in human TE671 (rhabdomyosarcoma) and L6 (skeletal muscle) cell lines in vitro that expressed high levels of miRNA-206. In the in vivo murine CVB3-infection model, viral replication of the engineered CVB3 was attenuated specifically in the heart that expressed high levels of both miRNAs, but not in certain tissues, which allowed the host to retain the ability to induce a strong and protective humoral immune response against CVB3. The results of this study suggest that a microRNA-targeting strategy to control CVB3 tissue tropism and pathogenesis may be useful for viral attenuation and vaccine development.\nCoxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a major causative agent for viral myocarditis, and viral replication in the heart may lead to heart failure or even death. Limiting CVB3 replication within the heart may be a promising strategy to decrease CVB3 pathogenicity. miRNAs are \u223c21-nucleotide-long, tissue-specific endogenous small RNA molecules that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression by imperfectly binding to the 3' untranslated region (UTR), the 5' UTR, or the coding region within a gene. In our study, muscle-specific miRNA targets (miRT) were incorporated into the CVB3 genome. Replication of the engineered viruses was restricted in the important heart tissue of infected mice, which reduced cardiac pathology and increased mouse survival. Meanwhile, replication ability was retained in other tissues, thus inducing a strong humoral immune response and providing long-term protection against CVB3 rechallenge.

Cardiac specification and maturation of the iPS was analyzed by gene expression array, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and patch-clamp techniques. In vivo, the iPS-derived CMs or culture medium control were injected into the peri-infarct region of hearts after coronary artery ligation, and functional and histology changes were assessed from 1 to 8 weeks post-transplantation. On differentiation, the iPS displayed early and robust in vitro cardiogenesis, expressing cardiac-specific genes and proteins. More importantly, electrophysiological studies demonstrated that a more mature ventricular-like cardiac phenotype was achieved when cells were treated with NRG-1\u03b2 and DMSO compared with DMSO alone. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrated that iPS-derived CMs were able to engraft and electromechanically couple to heart tissue, ultimately preserving cardiac function and inducing adequate heart tissue remodeling.

The broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor ONO-4817 significantly alleviated these histologic and functional changes during the acute phase.\nWe suggest that cardiac fibroblasts are of pathogenetic importance in inflammation and fibrosis in the heart during sepsis, leading to cardiac dysfunction that would affect the outcome of sepsis syndrome.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2014-10-09", "authors": ["KengoTomita", "MitchinoriTakashina", "NatsumiMizuno", "KimimasaSakata", "KohshiHattori", "JojiImura", "WakanaOhashi", "YuichiHattori"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2014.09.012"}
{"title": "Ultrasound shear wave elasticity imaging quantifies coronary perfusion pressure effect on cardiac compliance.", "abstract": "Diastolic heart failure (DHF) is a major source of cardiac related morbidity and mortality in the world today. A major contributor to, or indicator of DHF is a change in cardiac compliance. Currently, there is no accepted clinical method to evaluate the compliance of cardiac tissue in diastolic dysfunction. Shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) is a novel ultrasound-based elastography technique that provides a measure of tissue stiffness. Coronary perfusion pressure affects cardiac stiffness during diastole; we sought to characterize the relationship between these two parameters using the SWEI technique. In this work, we demonstrate how changes in coronary perfusion pressure are reflected in a local SWEI measurement of stiffness during diastole. Eight Langendorff perfused isolated rabbit hearts were used in this study. Coronary perfusion pressure was changed in a randomized order (0-90 mmHg range) and SWEI measurements were recorded during diastole with each change. Coronary perfusion pressure and the SWEI measurement of stiffness had a positive linear correlation with the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the slope of 0.009-0.011 m/s/mmHg ( R(2) = 0.88 ). Furthermore, shear modulus was linearly correlated to the coronary perfusion pressure with the 95% CI of this slope of 0.035-0.042 kPa/mmHg ( R(2) = 0.83). In conclusion, diastolic SWEI measurements of stiffness can be used to characterize factors affecting cardiac compliance specifically the mechanical interaction (cross-talk) between perfusion pressure in the coronary vasculature and cardiac muscle. This relationship was found to be linear over the range of pressures tested.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "date": "2014-10-08", "authors": ["MaryamVejdani-Jahromi", "MattNagle", "Gregg ETrahey", "Patrick DWolf"], "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2014.2360835"}

The animals exposed to F as sodium Fluoride (NaF) (25mg/kg BW) for 4 weeks exhibited a significant increase in the levels of cardiac troponins T and I (cTnT & I), cardiac serum markers, lipid peroxidative markers and plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL), free fatty acids (FFA), low density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as cardiac lipids profile (TC, TG and FFA) with the significant decrease of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiac phospholipids. F intoxication also decreased the levels of mitochondrial enzymes such as ICDH, SDH, MDH, \u03b1-KGDH and NADH in the cardiac tissue of rats. The mitochondrial Ca(2+) ion level was also significantly reduced along with the significant decrease in the levels of enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants. Furthermore, F treatment significantly increased the DNA fragmentation, up regulate cardiac pro-apoptotic markers, inflammatory markers and down-regulate the anti-apoptotic markers in the cardiac tissue. Pre administration of EGCG (40mg/kg/bw) in F intoxicated rats remarkably recovered all these altered parameters to near normalcy through its antioxidant nature. Thus, results of the present study clearly demonstrated that treatment with EGCG prior to F intoxication has a significant role in protecting F-induced cardiotoxicity and dyslipidemia in rats.", "journal": "Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS)", "date": "2014-10-06", "authors": ["SMiltonprabu", "SThangapandiyan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtemb.2014.08.015"}

However the therapeutic efficiency has become a major obstacle due to the poor survival of transplanted MSCs in ischemic cardiac tissue. Previous studies reported that melatonin could protect many different types of cells from apoptosis under various pathological conditions. In the present study, we demonstrated that melatonin, an endogenously secreted indoleamine had cytoprotection from hypoxia/serum deprivation (Hy/SD)-induced cell death in MSCs. We further investigated the possible mechanism and found out that melatonin attenuated (Hy/SD)-induced cell death could be via effectively reducing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, an increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and then activation of caspase-3 in MSCs in response to Hy/SD exposure. Furthermore, melatonin pretreatment significantly modulated the expression of phospho-P38MAPK and phospho-ERK1/2 in Hy/SD-induced MSCs and the protective effects of melatonin were partially reversed by ERK1/2 inhibitor but not p38 inhibitor, suggesting that melatonin inhibited Hy/SD-induced MSCs cell death through the MAPK signaling pathway in part. Taken together, the findings imply that melatonin could improve the survival of engrafted MSCs under hypoxia and serum deprivation condition.

The repair of cardiac tissue with cells delivered by an appropriate bioscaffold is expected to offer a superior, long-lasting treatment strategy. The present material, CardioCel\u00ae, is based on acellular pericardium that has been stabilized by treatments, including a low concentration of glutaraldehyde, that eliminate calcification after implantation. In the present study, we have assessed this material using human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells at various cell densities under standard, static cell culture conditions. The initial seeding densities were monitored to evaluate the extent of cell attachment and cell viability, with subsequent cell proliferation assessed up to 4 weeks using an MTS assay. Cell morphology, infiltration, and spreading were tracked using scanning electron microscopy and phalloidin staining. The efficacy of long-term cell survival was further assessed by examining the extent and type of new tissue formation on seeded scaffolds at 70 days; both type I and type III collagens were present in fibrillar structures on these scaffolds indicating that the seeded stem cells had the capacity to differentiate into collagen-producing cells necessary to repair damaged ECM. These data show that the CardioCel\u00ae scaffold is an appropriate substrate for the stem cells and has the potential to both retain seeded stem cells and to act as a template for cell propagation and new tissue formation.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Cardiomyocytes are mostly devoid of nuclear glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and it is generally assumed that effects of adrenal steroids in heart are mediated through the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Here we used immunocytochemistry to study localization of corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) in semithin sections of human cardiac tissue samples. With staining of consecutive sections we examined colocalization with GR and MR immunoreactivities. While GR staining was almost undetectable, a portion of myocytes with MR immunostained nuclei was found. Almost all cardiomyocytes exhibited CBG immunostaining in cytoplasm and on the cell membrane. Most pronounced CBG immunoreactivities were found in Purkinje fibers and in smooth muscle cells of arterial walls. With RT-PCR, we found in homogenates of cardiac tissue detectable levels of CBG encoding mRNA. Our findings indicate that CBG is expressed in human heart. Known cardiac effects of adrenal steroids may in part be mediated through the binding globulin and its putative membrane receptor in addition to nuclear steroid receptors and direct genomic action. Highlights of our study: Human cardiomyocytes express mineralocorticoid receptors, but are mostly free of nuclear glucocorticoid receptors. CBG is expressed in myocardium and in Purkinje fibers.

We also report on outcomes from other patients in the same study, including electrocardiogram changes, cardiovascular biomarkers, and transthoracic echocardiograms. Thirty-four patients received IFN-free BMS-986094 regimens. Six patients had left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) <30%, 8 had LVEFs 30%-50%, and 11 required hospitalization for suspected cardiotoxicity. Of the patients with LVEF <50%, 6 had normalization of systolic function after a median of 20 days. T-wave inversions were the most sensitive predictor of LVEF dysfunction. B-type natriuretic peptide levels increased over time and correlated with the degree of LVEF dysfunction. Pathological analysis of cardiac tissue revealed severe myocyte damage with elongated myofibrils without gross necrosis. These findings were consistent with some results of recent primate studies that were conducted to further investigate the potential mechanisms of BMS-986094 toxicity.\nA novel nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor developed for HCV treatment may cause a toxic cardiomyopathy.

Although we have developed human cardiac cell sheets by integration of cell sheet-based tissue engineering and scalable bioreactor culture, the risk of contamination by induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in cardiac cell sheets remains unresolved. In the present study, we established a novel culture method to fabricate human cardiac cell sheets with a decreased risk of iPS cell contamination while maintaining viabilities of iPS cell-derived cells, including cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, using a methionine-free culture condition. When cultured in the methionine-free condition, human iPS cells did not survive without feeder cells and could not proliferate or form colonies on feeder cells or in coculture with cells for cardiac cell sheet fabrication. When iPS cell-derived cells after the cardiac differentiation were transiently cultured in the methionine-free condition, gene expression of OCT3/4 and NANOG was downregulated significantly compared with that in the standard culture condition. Furthermore, in fabricated cardiac cell sheets, spontaneous and synchronous beating was observed in the whole area while maintaining or upregulating the expression of various cardiac and extracellular matrix genes.

In particular gene networks inferred from expression data can support the identification of novel hypotheses on regulatory processes. In this review we focus on the use of gene network analysis in the study of heart development. Understanding heart development will promote the elucidation of the aetiology of congenital heart disease and thus possibly improve diagnostics. Moreover, it will help to establish cardiac therapies. For example, understanding cardiac differentiation during development will help to guide stem cell differentiation required for cardiac tissue engineering or to enhance endogenous repair mechanisms. We introduce different methodological frameworks to infer networks from expression data such as Boolean and Bayesian networks. Then we present currently available temporal expression data in heart development and discuss the use of network-based approaches in published studies. Collectively, our literature-based analysis indicates that gene network analysis constitutes a promising opportunity to infer therapy-relevant regulatory processes in heart development. However, the use of network-based approaches has so far been limited by the small amount of samples in available datasets. Thus, we propose to acquire high-resolution temporal expression data to improve the mathematical descriptions of regulatory processes obtained with gene network inference methodologies.

{"title": "Antithrombin up-regulates AMP-activated protein kinase signalling during myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Antithrombin (AT) is a protein of the serpin superfamily involved in regulation of the proteolytic activity of the serine proteases of the coagulation system. AT is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective properties when it binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on vascular cells. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays an important cardioprotective role during myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion (I/R). To determine whether the cardioprotective signaling function of AT is mediated through the AMPK pathway, we evaluated the cardioprotective activities of wild-type AT and its two derivatives, one having high affinity and the other no affinity for heparin, in an acute I/R injury model in C57BL/6J mice in which the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded. The serpin derivatives were given 5 minutes before reperfusion. The results showed that AT-WT can activate AMPK in both in vivo and ex vivo conditions. Blocking AMPK activity abolished the cardioprotective function of AT against I/R injury. The AT derivative having high affinity for heparin was more effective in activating AMPK and in limiting infraction, but the derivative lacking affinity for heparin was inactive in eliciting AMPK-dependent cardioprotective activity. Activation of AMPK by AT inhibited the inflammatory c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) pathway during I/R. Further studies revealed that the AMPK activity induced by AT also modulates cardiac substrate metabolism by increasing glucose oxidation but inhibiting fatty acid oxidation during I/R. These results suggest that AT binds to HSPGs on heart tissues to invoke a cardioprotective function by triggering cardiac AMPK activation, thereby attenuating JNK inflammatory signalling pathways and modulating substrate metabolism during I/R.", "journal": "Thrombosis and haemostasis", "date": "2014-09-19", "authors": ["YinaMa", "JinliWang", "JunjieGao", "HuiYang", "YanqingWang", "ChandrashekharaManithody", "JiLi", "Alireza RRezaie"], "doi": "10.1160/TH14-04-0360"}

Proinflammatory responses, like the increase of adhesion molecules and leukocyte infiltration, were more pronounced and occurred at lower doses in ApoE(-/-) vs. C57BL/6 mice. These findings indicate that metabolic risk factors, such as decreased ApoE lipoproteins, may lead to an enhanced proinflammatory and prothrombotic late response in locally irradiated hearts.", "journal": "Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Finally, we applied the modified TRIzol protocol to the proteomic profiling of EMBs from human left and right ventricles.\nAnalysis of the proteins extracted from mouse and human samples revealed sufficient protein amount for downstream applications. Thus, LC-tandem mass spectrometry permitted highly sensitive protein identifications and comparable protein patterns and coverage of cellular components as a standard extraction protocol. 2D gel-based analysis confirmed the high quality and reproducibility of the TRIzol derived protein extracts.\nOur results prove the utility of the modified TRIzol protocol for proteomics analyses involving minute amounts of precious samples.", "journal": "Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry", "date": "2014-09-10", "authors": ["CristinaPop", "SabineAmeling", "KlausEmpen", "JuliaR\u00fcdebusch", "Vishnu MukundDhople", "Stephan BFelix", "FeliciaLoghin", "UweV\u00f6lker", "ElkeHammer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cca.2014.08.033"}

A critical target in chlorine inhalation-induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Autopsy specimens from human victims or experimental animals that die due to acute chlorine gas exposure present features of cardiovascular pathology. We demonstrate acute chlorine inhalation-induced reduction in heart rate and oxygen saturation in rats. Chlorine inhalation elevated chlorine reactants, such as chlorotyrosine and chloramine, in blood plasma. Using heart tissue and primary cardiomyocytes, we demonstrated that acute high-concentration chlorine exposure in vivo (500 ppm for 30 min) caused decreased total ATP content and loss of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) activity. Loss of SERCA activity was attributed to chlorination of tyrosine residues and oxidation of an important cysteine residue, cysteine-674, in SERCA, as demonstrated by immunoblots and mass spectrometry. Using cardiomyocytes, we found that chlorine-induced cell death and damage to SERCA could be decreased by thiocyanate, an important biological antioxidant, and by genetic SERCA2 overexpression. We also investigated a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, ranolazine, used in treatment of cardiac diseases, and previously shown to stabilize SERCA in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion. Pretreatment with ranolazine or istaroxime, another SERCA activator, prevented chlorine-induced cardiomyocyte death. Further investigation of responsible mechanisms showed that ranolazine- and istaroxime-treated cells preserved mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP after chlorine exposure.

{"title": "Extrahepatic targets and cellular reactivity of drug metabolites.", "abstract": "Biotransformation is one of the key elements of chemically induced toxicity. Although organisms have an intrinsic tendency to diminish the harm posed by chemical exposure with or without structural modification and excretion of the agents (detoxification), this is not always the case; toxification may also occur. The liver has evolved to be the center of biotransformation from the anatomical, physiological and biochemical points of view; it is located alongside the stomach and intestine, it receives more than 25% of the cardiac output and it contains, in general, the richest quantity but also variety of drug metabolizing enzymes. That is why many orally taken drug-induced toxic effects are seen in the liver. Nevertheless, non-hepatic tissues in the organism are also subjected to toxic insult. Although several instances have suggested transport of liver-bioactivated reactive metabolites to the target tissue is responsible, such as monocrotaline-associated lung toxicity, tetraethyl lead- and n-hexane-associated nervous system toxicity and 2-methoxyethanol-associated testis toxicity, etc. [1], the vast majority of data show local bioactivation in the target tissue is responsible for the extrahepatic toxic outcome. The impact of extrahepatic bioactivation and toxicity of drugs can also be seen in cases of drug attrition due to unacceptable toxicity; adverse cardiovascular effects were the foremost reason for drug withdrawals between 1993 and 2006 [2]. On the other hand, the parent drug and/or its stable metabolite( s) may also cause adverse effects such as inhibition of transporters, occlusion of bile secretion (cholestasis) and accumulation in organelles such as mitochondria, causing steatosis in liver and possibly in other organs. However, this review attempts to summarize only extrahepatic bioactivation of drugs/chemicals and their effects at the cellular and tissue level. Specifically, it focuses on the two most perfused organs, lung and heart tissue, as well as thyroid, blood, brain, and skin.

Measurements were performed with rats inside the exposure box in order to determine the distribution of EMF intensity. Our measurements showed that pregnant experimental group rats were exposed to a mean electrical field intensity of 13.77\u2009V/m inside the box (0.50\u2009W/m(2)). This study continued with male rat pups obtained from both groups. Pups were sacrificed on postnatal day 21, and the heart tissues were extracted. Malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and catalase values were significantly higher in the experimental group rats, while glutathione values were lower. Light microscopy revealed irregularities in heart muscle fibers and apoptotic changes in the experimental group.

In order to further advance the development and regeneration of engineered cardiac tissues using biomaterial platforms, it is important to have a complete overview of the effects that substrates have on cardiomyocyte (CM) morphology and function. This article summarizes recent studies that investigate the effect of mechanical cues on the CM differentiation, maturation, and growth. In these studies, CMs derived from embryos, neonates, and mesenchymal stem cells were seeded on different substrates of various elastic modulus. Measuring the contractile function by force production, work output, and calcium handling, it was seen that cell behavior on substrates was optimized when the substrate stiffness mimicked that of the native tissue. The contractile function reflected changes in the sarcomeric protein confirmation and organization that promoted the contractile ability. The analysis of the literature also revealed that, in addition to matrix stiffness, mechanical stimulation, such as stretching the substrate during cell seeding, also played an important role during cell maturation and tissue development.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Stem cell-based therapies have the potential to fundamentally transform the treatment of ischemic cardiac injury and heart failure by achieving what would have been unthinkable only a few years ago-the Holy Grail of myocardial regeneration. Recent therapeutic approaches involve bone marrow (BM)-derived mononuclear cells and their subsets such as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells as well as adipose tissue-derived MSCs, cardiac tissue-derived stem cells, and cell combinations. Clinical trials employing these cells have demonstrated that cellular therapy is feasible and safe. Regarding delivery methods, the safety of catheter-based, transendocardial and -epicardial stem cell injection has been established. However, the results, while variable, suggest rather modest clinical efficacy overall in both heart failure and ischemic heart disease, such as in acute myocardial infarction.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in the translational regulation of gene expression, which is beside transcriptional regulation crucial for the morphologic development of muscle tissue. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that the expression of miR-1, miR-133a/b, and miR-208a correlates with gestational age as well as with an apoptotic and proliferative index in the developing human heart. Our study included normal heart tissue samples obtained at autopsy from 46 fetuses, 12 children, and 15 adults. Proliferation and apoptosis were measured by the immunohistochemical detection of Ki67 and cleaved-CK18. Expression of miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b, and miR-208a was measured using real-time PCR. We found a similar level of expression of miR-133a/b in fetal and children hearts that was different from the levels in healthy adults. We also found a correlation between a miR-208a expression to the gestational age of fetuses. We observed an inverse correlation between Ki67 expression and gestational age. Expression of Ki67 was positively correlated to the expression of miR-208a and miR-1, but inversely correlated to the expression of miR-133a/b. Expression of cleaved-CK18 was also inversely correlated to the expression of miR-133a/b. Our results showed a general decrease in the expression of miR-1 and an increase of miR-133a/b with increasing gestational age.

{"title": "Adipose-derived stem cell adhesion on laminin-coated microcarriers improves commitment toward the cardiomyogenic lineage.", "abstract": "For tissue-engineering studies of the infarcted heart it is essential to identify a source of cells that may provide cardiomyocyte progenitors, which is easy to amplify, accessible in adults, and allowing autologous grafts. Preclinical studies have shown that human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) can differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells and improve heart function in myocardial infarction. We have developed pharmacologically active microcarriers (PAMs) which are biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric microspheres conveying cells on their biomimetic surface, therefore providing an adequate three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment. Moreover, they can release a growth factor in a prolonged manner. In order to implement ADSCs and PAMs for cardiac tissue engineering we first defined the biomimetic surface by studying the influence of matrix molecules laminin (LM) and fibronectin (FN), in combination with growth factors present in the cardiogenic niche, to further enhance the in vitro cardiac differentiation of ADSCs. We demonstrated that LM increased the expression of cardiac markers (Nkx2.5, GATA4, MEF2C) by ADSCs after 2 weeks in vitro. Interestingly, our results suggest that the 3D support provided by PAMs with a LM biomimetic surface (LM-PAMs) further enhanced the expression of cardiac markers and induced the expression of a more mature contractile protein, cardiac troponin I, compared with the 2D differentiating conditions after only 1 week in culture. The enrichment of the growth-factor cocktail with TGF-\u03b21 potentiated the cardiomyogenic differentiation.

The regulatory subunits of the four PKA isoforms (RI\u03b1, RI\u03b2, RII\u03b1, and RII\u03b2) each form a homodimer, and their dimerization domain interacts with a small helical region present in each of the more than 40 AKAPs reported so far. This allows for tight anchoring of PKA and efficient communication with other signaling proteins that interact with the AKAP scaffold in a spatial and temporal manner. The hydrophobic interaction surfaces of the PKA-R dimer and several AKAP helices have been investigated in great detail. Despite this knowledge, not every suggested AKAP has had its binding motif specified. Here we created an efficient bioinformatic tool, termed THAHIT, to accurately map the PKA binding motif and/or additional motifs of all previously reported AKAPs. Moreover, THAHIT predicts its specificity toward PKA-RI\u03b1 and/or PKA-RII\u03b1 binding. To verify the validity of these newly predicted anchoring sites and their putative specificities, we used computational modeling approaches (HADDOCK), biochemical affinity studies (fluorescence anisotropy), and cellular colocalization studies. We further demonstrate the potential of THAHIT to identify novel AKAPs in cAMP-based chemical proteomics discovery data sets, and the human proteome. We retrieved numerous novel AKAP candidates, including a never reported 330 kDa AKAP observed in heart tissue, which we further characterized biochemically as a PKA-RII\u03b1 binder.

{"title": "Intravital microscopy of localized stem cell delivery using microbubbles and acoustic radiation force.", "abstract": "The use of stem cells for the repair of damaged cardiac tissue after a myocardial infarction holds great promise. However, a common finding in experimental studies is the low number of cells delivered at the area at risk. To improve the delivery, we are currently investigating a novel delivery platform in which stem cells are conjugated with targeted microbubbles, creating echogenic complexes dubbed StemBells. These StemBells vibrate in response to incoming ultrasound waves making them susceptible to acoustic radiation force. The acoustic force can then be employed to propel circulating StemBells from the centerline of the vessel to the wall, facilitating localized stem cell delivery. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of manipulating StemBells acoustically in vivo after injection using a chicken embryo model. Bare stem cells or unsaturated stem cells (<5 bubbles/cell) do not respond to ultrasound application (1 MHz, peak negative acoustical pressure P_ = 200 kPa, 10% duty cycle). However, stem cells which are fully saturated with targeted microbubbles (>30 bubbles/cell) can be propelled toward and arrested at the vessel wall.

Heart tissue produces a number of secreted proteins, also known as cardiokines, which participate in intercellular and intertissue communication. We recently reported that follistatin-like 1 (Fstl1) functions as a cardiokine with cardioprotective properties. Here, we investigated the role of cardiac Fstl1 in renal injury after subtotal nephrectomy. Cardiac-specific Fstl1-deficient (cFstl1-KO) mice and wild-type mice were subjected to subtotal (5/6) nephrectomy. cFstl1-KO mice showed exacerbation of urinary albumin excretion, glomerular hypertrophy, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis after subtotal renal ablation compared with wild-type mice. cFstl1-KO mice also exhibited increased mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, NADPH oxidase components, and fibrotic mediators, in the remnant kidney. Conversely, systemic administration of adenoviral vectors expressing Fstl1 (Ad-Fstl1) to wild-type mice with subtotal nephrectomy led to amelioration of albuminuria, glomerular hypertrophy, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, accompanied by reduced expression of proinflammatory mediators, NADPH oxidase components, and fibrotic markers in the remnant kidney. In cultured human mesangial cells, treatment with recombinant FSTL1 attenuated TNF-\u03b1-stimulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Treatment of mesangial cells with FSTL1 augmented the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and inhibition of AMPK activation abrogated the anti-inflammatory effects of FSTL1.

The present study investigated the role of gemfibrozil against partial abdominal aortic constriction-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by partial abdominal aortic constriction in rats and they survived for 4 weeks. The cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by measuring left ventricular weight to body weight ratio, left ventricular wall thickness, and protein and collagen content. The oxidative stress in the cardiac tissues was assessed by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, superoxide anion generation, and reduced glutathione level. The haematoxylin-eosin and picrosirius red staining was used to observe cardiomyocyte diameter and collagen deposition, respectively. Moreover, serum levels of cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, and glucose were also measured.

Increasing evidences have shown that the humid heat stress-induced dysfunction of the cardiovascular system was accompanied with severe cardiomyocyte injury; however, the precise mechanism of heat stress-induced injury of cardiomyocyte remains unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that humid heat stress promoted oxidative stress through the activation of angiotensin II (Ang II) in cardiomyocytes. To test our hypothesis, we established mouse models of humid heat stress. Using the animal models, we found that Ang II levels in serum were significantly up-regulated and that the Ang II receptor AT1 was increased in cardiomyocytes. The antioxidant ability in plasma and heart tissues which was detected by the ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay was also decreased with the increased ROS production under humid heat stress, as was the expression of antioxidant genes (SOD2, HO-1, GPx). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Ang II receptor antagonist, valsartan, effectively relieved oxidative stress, blocked Ang II signaling pathway and suppressed cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by humid heat stress. In addition, overexpression of antioxidant genes reversed cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by Ang II. Overall, these results implied that humid heat stress increased oxidative stress and caused apoptosis of cardiomyocytes through the Ang II signaling pathway. Thus, targeting the Ang II signaling pathway may provide a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases caused by humid heat stress.", "journal": "Heart and vessels", "date": "2014-06-06", "authors": ["XiaowuWang", "BinbinYuan", "WenpengDong", "BoYang", "YongchaoYang", "XiLin", "GuGong"], "doi": "10.1007/s00380-014-0523-6"}

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of ALDH2 on diabetes-induced myocardial injury with a focus on autophagy. Wild-type FVB and ALDH2 transgenic mice were challenged with streptozotozin (STZ, 200mg/kg, i.p.) for 3months to induce experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetes triggered cardiac remodeling and contractile dysfunction as evidenced by cardiac hypertrophy, decreased cell shortening and prolonged relengthening duration, the effects of which were mitigated by ALDH2. Lectin staining displayed that diabetes promoted cardiac hypertrophy, the effect of which was alleviated by ALDH2. Western blot analysis revealed dampened autophagy protein markers including LC3B ratio and Atg7 along with upregulated p62 following experimental diabetes, the effect of which was reconciled by ALDH2. Phosphorylation level of AMPK was decreased and its downstream signaling molecule FOXO3a was upregulated in both diabetic cardiac tissue and in H9C2 cells with high glucose exposure. All these effect were partly abolished by ALDH2 overexpression and ALDH2 agonist Alda1. High glucose challenge dampened autophagy in H9C2 cells as evidenced by enhanced p62 levels and decreased levels of Atg7 and LC3B, the effect of which was alleviated by the ALDH2 activator Alda-1. High glucose-induced cell death and apoptosis were reversed by Alda-1. The autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and the AMPK inhibitor compound C mitigated Alda-1-offered beneficial effect whereas the autophagy inducer rapamycin mimicked or exacerbated high glucose-induced cell injury. Moreover, compound C nullified Alda-1-induced protection against STZ-induced changes in autophagy and function. Our results suggested that ALDH2 protects against diabetes-induced myocardial dysfunction possibly through an AMPK -dependent regulation of autophagy.

Serum was analyzed for specific cardiac injury biomarkers. Cardiac tissue was examined for lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content, antioxidant (GSH, GR, GPx, GST, SOD, CAT, NQO1, and HO-1), and apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, p53, and DNA fragmentation) status. Myocardial protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in different experimental groups was evaluated. Pathological changes in heart tissue and activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were also analyzed. Our results demonstrated that LS pretreatment augmented myocardial antioxidant status and attenuated myocardial oxidative stress. Myocardial apoptosis as well as MMPs activities was significantly prevented by LS pretreatment in ISO-induced mice.

Previous studies have described a reduction of plakoglobin (PKG) protein at the level of intercalated disks as the hallmark of ARVC. The main objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of desmosome mutations in the histological phenotype of ARVC. We performed a genetic analysis of ARVC cases, and histological characterization of ARVC heart tissue samples. We genetically analyzed 48 ARVC cases distributed into two groups: 42 human tissue heart samples with conclusive diagnoses of ARVC after post-mortem examination; and six DNA samples from peripheral blood of living patients who were clinically diagnosed. Sequenom MassARRAY analysis revealed three ARVC-associated variants in three patients in 42 tissue samples (7.14 %). Three individuals carried one single pathogenic mutation, p.R811S _PKP2, p.S824L_DSC2, and p.T526M_PKP2 in postmortem samples. In the living patients group, Sequenom MassARRAY revealed no mutation, however, later Sanger sequencing analysis identified three ARVC mutations in 2/6 patients not included in the Sequenom design. In post-mortem tissue samples we performed immunohistochemical labeling for desmosomal proteins and Connexin 43. This study revealed that PKP2 carriers present either absent or clearly reduced PKG immunolabeling, while the DSC2 carrier showed PKG immunolabeling similar to control samples. Immunolabeling for Cx43 did not show any differences compared to controls. The present Sequenom MassARRAY design is a useful tool for post-mortem genetic diagnosis of ARVC.

This study sought to determine whether early intramyocardial injection of alginate-chitosan could prevent left ventricular (LV) remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI), leading to a more favorable course of tissue restoration. In a rat model of acute MI, local injection of alginate-chitosan hydrogel into the peri-infarct zone preserved scar thickness, attenuated infarct expansion, and reduced scar fibrosis after 8 weeks, concomitantly with promoting increased angiogenesis and greater recruitment of endogenous repair at the infarct zone. Furthermore, this treatment prevented cell apoptosis, induced cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry. The cardiac function of the control-injected animals deteriorated over the 8-week course, while that of the hydrogel-injected animals did not.In addition, the hydrogel did not exacerbate inflammation in the heart. Intramyocardial injection of alginate-chitosan hydrogel represents a useful strategy to treat MI.

This cell death is caused by Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) interactions under harsh conditions. To investigate improving the survival and therapeutic effects of MSCs, we focused our research on Fas-FasL-mediated cell death. In this study, we found that the poor viability of transplanted MSCs was caused by Fas-FasL interactions between host ischemic myocardial cells and implanted MSCs. In addition, we found that increased Fas expression and the corresponding decrease of cell survival were in close relation to hypoxic MSCs treated with FasL and H2O2. When MSCs were treated with a recombinant Fas/Fc chimera (Fas/Fc) inhibiting Fas-FasL interactions, the expressions of proapoptotic proteins including caspase-8, caspase-3, Bax, and cytochrome-c were attenuated, and the survival of MSCs was recovered. In ischemia-reperfusion injury models, the interaction between FasL in ischemic heart and Fas in implanted MSCs caused a loss of transplanted MSCs, whereas the inhibition of this interaction by Fas/Fc treatment improved cell survival and restored heart function. Thus, our study suggests that Fas-FasL interactions are responsible for activating cell death signaling in implanted stem cells and could be a potential target for improving therapeutic efficacy of stem cells in treating ischemic heart diseases.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2014-05-16", "authors": ["OnjuHam", "Se-YeonLee", "Byeong-WookSong", "Min-JiCha", "Chang YounLee", "Jun-HeePark", "Il-KwonKim", "JiyunLee", "Hyang-HeeSeo", "Min-JiSeung", "EunhyunChoi", "YangsooJang", "Ki-ChulHwang"], "doi": "10.3727/096368914X681748"}
{"title": "Tuning composition and architecture of biomimetic scaffolds for enhanced matrix synthesis by murine cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "A major onset of heart failure is myocardial infarction, which causes the myocardium to lose cardiomyocytes and transform into a scar tissue. Since mammalian infarcted cardiac tissue has a limited ability to regenerate, alternative strategies including implantation of tissue-engineered scaffolds at the site of damaged myocardium have been explored. The goal is to enable in situ cardiac reconstruction at the injured myocardium site, replace the lost cardiomyocytes, deliver the required biomolecules, and remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM synthesis and deposition by cardiomyocytes within such scaffolds remains categorically unexplored. Here, we investigated the survival, ECM synthesis and deposition, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) release by cardiomyocytes within three-dimensional (3D) substrates. Rat cardiomyocytes were cultured for three weeks within two structurally different substrates: 3D collagen hydrogels or polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibrous scaffolds. The concentration and composition of the hydrogels was varied, while PCL nanofibers were surface-modified with various ECM proteins. Results showed that myocyte attachment and survival was higher within collagen hydrogels, while myocyte alignment and beating was noted only within PCL scaffolds. Total protein synthesis by myocytes within PCL scaffolds was significantly higher compared to that within collagen hydrogels, although more protein was deposited as matrix within hydrogels. Significant ECM synthesis and matrix deposition, TIMP-1, and MMP release were noted within modified collagen hydrogels and PCL nanofiber scaffolds. These results were qualitatively confirmed by imaging techniques.

{"title": "Efficient generation of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac progenitors based on tissue-specific enhanced green fluorescence protein expression.", "abstract": "Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) are committed to the cardiac lineage but retain their proliferative capacity before becoming quiescent mature cardiomyocytes (CMs). In medical therapy and research, the use of human pluripotent stem cell-derived CPCs would have several advantages compared with mature CMs, as the progenitors show better engraftment into existing heart tissues, and provide unique potential for cardiovascular developmental as well as for pharmacological studies. Here, we demonstrate that the CAG promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) reporter system enables the identification and isolation of embryonic stem cell-derived CPCs. Tracing of CPCs during differentiation confirmed up-regulation of surface markers, previously described to identify cardiac precursors and early CMs. Isolated CPCs express cardiac lineage-specific transcripts, still have proliferating capacity, and can be re-aggregated into embryoid body-like structures (CAG-EGFP(high) rEBs). Expression of troponin T and NKX2.5 mRNA is up-regulated in long-term cultured CAG-EGFP(high) rEBs, in which more than 90% of the cells become Troponin I positive mature CMs. Moreover, about one third of the CAG-EGFP(high) rEBs show spontaneous contractions.

The control group was administered normal pellet chow, and the Chol group was administered pellet chow including 2% Chol, while 50 JCL, 100 JCL, and 200 JCL groups were administered 50, 100, and 200\u00a0mg/kg JCL oil dissolved in 0.5% sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, respectively, in addition to the pellet chow containing 2% Chol, by gavage. After 30\u00a0days, the experiment was terminated and the antioxidant enzyme activities were examined in the heart tissue of rats. While consumption of dietary Chol decreases the activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT in heart tissue of rats (not significant), administeration of 200\u00a0mg/kg JCL oil in addition to Chol led to a significant increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Administering Chol led to a significant increase in TBARS level. Administering 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg JCL oil together with Chol prevented significantly the increase in lipid peroxides. As a result of the study, JCL oil showed oxidant-antioxidant effect in the heart tissue of rats.", "journal": "Toxicology and industrial health", "date": "2013-01-08", "authors": ["NurhanGumral", "Duygu DogucKumbul", "FirdevsAylak", "MustafaSaygin", "EminSavik"], "doi": "10.1177/0748233712469995"}
