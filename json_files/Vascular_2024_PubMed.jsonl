{"title": "Open-door extended endoscopic transorbital technique to the paramedian anterior and middle cranial fossae: technical notes, anatomomorphometric quantitative analysis, and illustrative case.", "abstract": "The superior eyelid endoscopic transorbital approach (SETOA) provides a direct and short minimally invasive route to the anterior and middle skull base. Nevertheless, it uses a narrow corridor that limits its angles of attack. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of an \"extended\" conservative variant of the \"standard\" endoscopic transorbital approach-termed \"open-door\"-to enhance the exposure of lesions affecting the paramedian aspect of the anterior and middle cranial fossae.\nFirst, the authors described the technical nuances of the open-door extended transorbital approach (ODETA). Next, they documented its morphometric advantages over standard SETOA. Finally, they provided a clinical-anatomical application to demonstrate enhanced exposure and better angles of attack to treat lesions occupying the paramedian anterior and middle cranial fossae. Five adult cadaveric specimens (10 sides) initially underwent standard SETOA and then extended open-door SETOA (ODETA to the paramedian anterior and middle fossae). The adjunct of hinge-orbitotomy, through three surgical steps and straddling the frontozygomatic suture, converted conventional SETOA to its extended open-door variant. CT scans were performed before dissection and uploaded to the neuronavigation system for quantitative analysis. The angles of attack on the axial plane that addressed four key landmarks, namely the tip of the anterior clinoid process (ACP), foramen rotundum (FR), foramen ovale (FO), and trigeminal impression (TI), were calculated for both operative techniques and compared.\nHinge-orbitotomy of the extended open-door SETOA resulted in several surgical, functional, and esthetic advantages: it provided wider axial angles of attack for each of the target points, with a gain angle of 26.68\u00b0 \u00b1 1.31\u00b0 for addressing the ACP (p < 0.001), 29.50\u00b0 \u00b1 2.46\u00b0 for addressing the FR (p < 0.001), 19.86\u00b0 \u00b1 1.98\u00b0 for addressing the FO (p < 0.001), and 17.44\u00b0 \u00b1 2.21\u00b0 for addressing the lateral aspect of the TI (p < 0.001), while hiding the skin scar, avoiding temporalis muscle dissection, preserving flap vascularization, and decreasing the rate of bone infection and degree of orbital content retraction.\nThe extended open-door technique may be specifically suited for selected patients affected by paramedian anterior and middle fossae lesions, with prevalent anteromedial extension toward the anterior clinoid, the foremost compartment of the cavernous sinus and FR and not completely controlled with the pure endoscopic transorbital approach.", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "date": "2024-04-01", "authors": ["SergioCorvino", "AminKassam", "AmedeoPiazza", "FrancescoCorrivetti", "TomaSpiriev", "AntonioColamaria", "GiovanniCirrottola", "CarloCavaliere", "FeliceEsposito", "Luigi MariaCavallo", "GiorgioIaconetta", "Matteode Notaris"], "doi": "10.3171/2024.1.FOCUS23838"}

In turn, the vasculature plays a key role in the host immune response to bacterial infections. Technological advancements in microfluidic device design and development have yielded increasingly sophisticated and physiologically relevant models of the vasculature including vasculature-on-a-chip and organ-on-a-chip models. This review aims to highlight advancements in microfluidic device development that have enabled studies of the vascular response to bacteria and bacterial-derived molecules at or near the vascular interface. In the first section of this review, we discuss the use of parallel plate flow chambers and flow cells in studies of bacterial adhesion to the vasculature. We then highlight microfluidic models of the vasculature that have been utilized to study bacteria and bacterial-derived molecules at or near the vascular interface. Next, we review organ-on-a-chip models inclusive of the vasculature and pathogenic bacteria or bacterial-derived molecules that stimulate an inflammatory response within the model system. Finally, we provide recommendations for future research in advancing the understanding of host-bacteria interactions and responses during infections as well as in developing innovative antimicrobials for preventing and treating bacterial infections that capitalize on technological advancements in microfluidic device design and development.", "journal": "Biomicrofluidics", "date": "2024-04-01", "authors": ["Lily IsabelleGaudreau", "Elizabeth JStewart"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0179281"}

However, there is limited knowledge about the relationship between IVIM-derived measures and changes at the level of the vascular network. In this study, we investigated the potential use of IVIM MRI as a noninvasive tool for measuring changes in cerebral vascular density. Variations in quantitative immunohistochemical measurements of the vascular density across different regions in the rat brain (cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus) were related to the pseudo-diffusion coefficient D* and the flowing blood fraction f in healthy Wistar rats. We assessed whether region-wise differences in the vascular density are reflected by variations in the IVIM measurements and found a significant positive relationship with the pseudo-diffusion coefficient (p\u2009<\u20090.05, \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.24). The effect of cerebrovascular alterations, such as blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption on the perfusion-related IVIM parameters, is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated the effect of BBB disruption on the IVIM measures in a rat model of metabolic and vascular comorbidities (ZSF1 obese rat) and assessed whether this affects the relationship between the cerebral vascular density and the noninvasive IVIM measurements. We observed increased vascular permeability without detecting any differences in diffusivity, suggesting that BBB leakage is present before changes in the tissue integrity.

Additionally, we engineered hydroxyapatite/chitosan microspheres (HA/CS MS) with biomimetic nanostructures to facilitate multiple ETV2-DPSC functions and further enhanced the osteogenic differentiation. Animal experiments have validated the synergistic effect of ETV2-modified DPSCs and HA/CS MS in promoting the critical-size bone defect regeneration.

{"title": "Continuous iontronic chemotherapy reduces brain tumor growth in embryonic avian in vivo models.", "abstract": "Local and long-lasting administration of potent chemotherapeutics is a promising therapeutic intervention to increase the efficiency of chemotherapy of hard-to-treat tumors such as the most lethal brain tumors, glioblastomas (GBM). However, despite high toxicity for GBM cells, potent chemotherapeutics such as gemcitabine (Gem) cannot be widely implemented as they do not efficiently cross the blood brain barrier. As an alternative method for continuous administration of Gem, we here operate freestanding iontronic pumps - \"GemIPs\" - equipped with a custom-synthesized ion exchange membrane to treat a GBM tumor in an avian embryonic in vivo system. We compare GemIP treatment effects with a topical metronomic treatment and observe that a remarkable growth inhibition was only achieved with steady dosing via GemIPs. Daily topical drug administration (at the maximum dosage that was not lethal for the embryonic host organism) did not decrease tumor sizes, while both treatment regimes caused S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We hypothesize that the pharmacodynamic effects generate different transient intratumoral drug concentration profiles for each technique, which causes this difference in outcome. We created a digital model of the experiment, which proposes a fast decay in the local drug concentration for the topical daily treatment, but a long-lasting high local concentration of Gem close to the tumor area with GemIPs. Continuous chemotherapy with iontronic devices opens new possibilities in cancer treatment: the long-lasting and highly local dosing of clinically available, potent chemotherapeutics to greatly enhance treatment efficiency without systemic side-effects. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Iontronic pumps (GemIPs) provide continuous and localized administration of the chemotherapeutic gemcitabine (Gem) for treating glioblastoma in vivo models. By generating high and constant drug concentrations near the vascularized growing tumor, GemIPs offer an efficient and less harmful alternative to systemic administration. Continuous GemIP dosing resulted in remarkable growth inhibition, superior to daily topical Gem application at higher doses. Our digital modelling shows the advantages of iontronic chemotherapy in overcoming drug clearance effects due to vascularization, and providing precise control over dosing profiles and local distribution.

The index and middle fingers are the most common sites. Early diagnosis is essential to eradicate the infection. Delay in diagnosis and management leads to extensive involvement which may require surgical intervention. The current literature reveals conservative management gives satisfactory results in early stages. Though surgical intervention in Tuberculous dactylitis is seldom required, delay in diagnosis and management leads to extensive involvement of the bone and sequestration which does not respond to Anti Tubercular Therapy and needs staged surgical interventions. We report a case of an 11-year-old girl who presented to us after extensive involvement of 2nd and 3rd metacarpals and failed to respond to ATT even after 1.5\u00a0years of medication. She required staged surgeries to eradicate the infection which led to loss of 2nd and 3rd metacarpals. Complex reconstructive procedures of hand were required in stages and the bone loss was managed with non-vascularized Fibular strut graft.

{"title": "Pulsed Electric Fields Induce STING Palmitoylation and Polymerization Independently of Plasmid DNA Electrotransfer.", "abstract": "Gene therapy approaches may target skeletal muscle due to its high protein-expressing nature and vascularization. Intramuscular plasmid DNA (pDNA) delivery via pulsed electric fields (PEFs) can be termed electroporation or electrotransfer. Nonviral delivery of plasmids to cells and tissues activates DNA-sensing pathways. The central signaling complex in cytosolic DNA sensing is the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING). The effects of pDNA electrotransfer on the signaling of STING, a key adapter protein, remain incompletely characterized. STING undergoes several post-translational modifications which modulate its function, including palmitoylation. This study demonstrated that in mouse skeletal muscle, STING was constitutively palmitoylated at two sites, while an additional site was modified following electroporation independent of the presence of pDNA. This third palmitoylation site correlated with STING polymerization but not with STING activation. Expression of several palmitoyl acyltransferases, including zinc finger and DHHC motif containing 1 (zDHHC1), coincided with STING activation. Expression of several depalmitoylases, including palmitoyl protein thioesterase 2 (PPT2), was diminished in all PEF application groups. Therefore, STING may not be regulated by active modification by palmitate after electroporation but inversely by the downregulation of palmitate removal. These findings unveil intricate molecular changes induced by PEF application.", "journal": "Pharmaceutics", "date": "2024-03-28", "authors": ["AmandaSales Conniff", "JulieSingh", "RichardHeller", "Loree CHeller"], "doi": "10.3390/pharmaceutics16030363\n10.1186/1471-2199-8-56\n10.1038/gt.2011.198\n10.1093/nar/gkz768\n10.3390/vaccines10122037\n10.1089/bioe.2022.0041\n10.1038/mtna.2016.34\n10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113088\n10.1038/s41580-020-0244-x\n10.1016/j.immuni.2016.08.014\n10.3389/fcell.2021.717610\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.049\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.069\n10.1073/pnas.1906431116\n10.1038/s41467-020-19318-3\n10.1084/jem.20161387\n10.1038/s41590-020-0699-0\n10.1016/j.immuni.2018.07.013\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.036\n10.1038/ncomms11932\n10.1038/s41423-019-0205-5\n10.1016/j.chembiol.2018.05.003\n10.1111/febs.15728\n10.1038/s41586-018-0287-8\n10.1073/pnas.1806239115\n10.1101/2023.08.11.553045\n10.12688/f1000research.6464.1\n10.1007/978-1-4939-9532-5_16\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btt607\n10.1093/nar/gkaa1100\n10.1093/nar/gkac240\n10.1093/nar/gkg500\n10.1093/nar/gku1003\n10.1007/978-1-4939-9532-5_7\n10.2478/v10019-012-0010-6\n10.1016/j.bioelechem.2023.108487\n10.1016/j.ab.2003.10.047\n10.1002/pro.3993\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000001968\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0419-16.2016\n10.1194/jlr.R600007-JLR200\n10.3389/fcell.2020.600368\n10.1038/nmeth.1769\n10.1074/jbc.M111.306183\n10.1371/journal.pone.0015142\n10.1126/scisignal.2002521\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1004783\n10.1038/s41586-019-1000-2\n10.7554/eLife.57837\n10.1126/scisignal.aaw4673\n10.1016/j.chom.2014.09.006\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1009035\n10.1038/nature10098\n10.1038/nrg3185\n10.1074/jbc.M301225200\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.056\n10.1016/j.abb.2011.09.002\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.10.061\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.04.016\n10.4049/jimmunol.2200881"}

We aimed to investigate differences in metal and metalloid content between the placentas of women with preeclampsia and healthy controls. This was a case-control study in 63 women with preeclampsia and 113 healthy women. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to measure the placental metals and metalloids content. Compared with healthy control subjects, preeclampsia was associated with a significantly lower concentration of essential elements (magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, and selenium) in the placental tissue. After multivariable adjustment, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in selenium concentration was associated with a reduced risk of preeclampsia with an OR of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.33-0.77). The joint effects of multiple selected metals and metalloids were associated with a reduced risk of preeclampsia. The lower placental magnesium, chromium, iron, zinc, and selenium concentrations of preeclampsia cases indicate a potential link to its pathogenesis.

{"title": "Impact of TNF and IL-33 Cytokines on Mast Cells in Neuroinflammation.", "abstract": "Mast cells (MCs) are derived from hematopoietic progenitors, mature in vascularized tissues, and participate in innate and acquired immunity. Neuroinflammation is a highly debated topic in the biomedical literature; however, the impact of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-33 on MCs in the brain has not been widely addressed. MCs can be activated by IgE binding to Fc\u03b5RI, as well as by different antigens. After activation, MCs mediate various immunological and inflammatory responses through TNF and IL-33. TNF has two receptors: TNFR1, a p55 molecule, and TNFR2, a p75 molecule. This cytokine is the only one of its kind to be stored in the granules of MCs and can also be generated by de novo synthesis via mRNA. In the central nervous system (CNS), TNF is produced almost exclusively by microglial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and, minimally, by endothelial cells. After its release into brain tissue, TNF rapidly induces the adhesion molecules endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (ELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) in endothelial cells. TNF causes the chemoattraction of neutrophils by inducing several molecules, including CXC chemokines (IL-8). Both MCs and microglial cells act as a primary barrier against foreign molecules in the CNS, producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-33. IL-33 belongs to the IL-1 family, is activated through the ST2L/IL1-RAcP receptor complex, and mediates both the innate and adaptive immune response. IL-33 is a nuclear transcription factor expressed in the brain, where it induces pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-1) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10). Therefore, MCs and microglia in the CNS are a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF and IL-33, that mediate many brain diseases. The inhibition of TNF and IL-33 may represent a new therapeutic approach that could complement existing neuroinflammatory therapies.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2024-03-28", "authors": ["PioConti", "GianpaoloRonconi", "DorinaLauritano", "FilibertoMastrangelo", "AlessandroCaraffa", "Carla EGallenga", "IliasFrydas", "Spyridon KKritas", "FrancescoCarinci", "FedericoGaudelli", "CiroAnnicchiarico", "CristianD'Ovidio"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms25063248\n10.1056/NEJMra1708714\n10.3390/ijms232213850\n10.3389/fimmu.2022.920464\n10.1016/j.anai.2023.10.032\n10.1172/JCI58644\n10.4049/jimmunol.176.7.4102\n10.1073/pnas.0504197102\n10.1016/j.imlet.2007.08.007\n10.1007/s10787-023-01137-9\n10.1046/j.1440-1711.2001.00983.x\n10.1182/blood.V89.11.4120\n10.3390/ijms20153701\n10.1016/j.tice.2017.04.002\n10.1038/s41598-023-47905-z\n10.1074/jbc.M110.203398\n10.1007/3-540-32636-7_1\n10.1172/JCI11837\n10.4049/jimmunol.0901970\n10.1189/jlb.0204115\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.21.120601.141025\n10.1056/NEJMra1409760\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2021.104346\n10.1016/j.immuni.2013.10.005\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.603050\n10.1023/A:1020776807187\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00624.x\n10.3390/ijms21124297\n10.3390/ijms21041498\n10.3389/fimmu.2012.00120\n10.4049/jimmunol.0803180\n10.1016/S0161-5890(02)00089-5\n10.3389/fphar.2016.00316\n10.1371/journal.pone.0014525\n10.3390/ijms24054811\n10.4049/jimmunol.176.4.2114\n10.1016/j.lfs.2003.07.012\n10.1038/346274a0\n10.1073/pnas.1524845114\n10.1016/j.jneuroim.2004.09.013\n10.1155/2014/861231\n10.1002/path.2287\n10.1016/j.autrev.2013.06.004\n10.1186/s12974-014-0215-2\n10.1111/cpr.12475\n10.1182/blood-2006-09-046128\n10.1038/ncomms13696\n10.1007/s004240050493\n10.3390/ijms20205147\n10.1089/jir.2006.0158\n10.3389/fncel.2019.00353\n10.3389/fncel.2019.00110\n10.1038/nri2782\n10.2174/156720507781788873\n10.1016/j.neuro.2009.07.001\n10.1186/s12974-021-02200-4\n10.1016/j.it.2004.02.013\n10.1159/000087574\n10.1189/jlb.68.1.9\n10.4049/jimmunol.164.2.656\n10.1371/journal.pone.0182923\n10.1016/j.cyto.2022.155828\n10.4049/jimmunol.162.1.460\n10.1182/blood.V99.8.2890\n10.1002/jcb.10321\n10.1016/S0014-5793(03)00224-2\n10.1016/j.micpath.2023.106005\n10.1159/000450576\n10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112606\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.tb20472.x\n10.1111/j.1600-0536.2010.01769.x\n10.1002/jlb.46.2.161\n10.3389/fncel.2013.00195\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.122.036946\n10.1016/j.bbi.2009.09.006\n10.1186/s12974-020-01758-9\n10.1159/000024052\n10.1046/j.1365-201X.1997.549324000.x\n10.1016/j.phrs.2019.104580\n10.1016/j.it.2009.07.012\n10.1254/jphs.09143FP\n10.2353/ajpath.2010.090342\n10.1016/j.jaci.2017.06.003\n10.1111/imr.12634\n10.1016/j.jcmgh.2019.02.006\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.005\n10.1016/j.neuron.2015.01.013\n10.3390/ijms21113933\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.00364\n10.1038/nri.2016.95\n10.1016/j.brainres.2011.02.045\n10.1016/j.immuni.2015.06.021\n10.1016/j.cyto.2015.05.010\n10.3390/cells10113000\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.00888\n10.1016/j.imlet.2016.07.003\n10.3390/ijms19092676\n10.3389/fphys.2019.01514\n10.1084/jem.183.1.195\n10.1002/pro.2072\n10.2332/allergolint.10-OA-0247\n10.1242/dev.029249\n10.4049/jimmunol.0903566\n10.1084/jem.20060285\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00628.x\n10.1159/000250438\n10.1016/j.it.2018.11.001\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.00514\n10.1038/s12276-021-00660-5\n10.1073/pnas.1604032113\n10.1186/s12967-022-03570-w\n10.1002/eji.201141947\n10.1038/mp.2009.10\n10.1189/jlb.1207830\n10.1016/j.clim.2011.11.007\n10.1186/s40478-016-0344-1\n10.1084/jem.20190915"}

Although recently developed techniques for bone reconstruction, such as bone segment transfer, are becoming increasingly popular, bone defects may still require vascularized bone grafts under certain circumstances.

{"title": "Exploring Costimulatory Blockade-Based Immunologic Strategies in Transplantation: Are They a Promising Immunomodulatory Approach for Organ and Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation?", "abstract": "The field of transplantation, including the specialized area of vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA), has been transformed since the first hand transplant in 1998. The major challenge in VCA comes from the need for life-long immunosuppressive therapy due to its non-vital nature and a high rate of systemic complications. Ongoing research is focused on immunosuppressive therapeutic strategies to avoid toxicity and promote donor-specific tolerance. This includes studying the balance between tolerance and effector mechanisms in immune modulation, particularly the role of costimulatory signals in T lymphocyte activation. Costimulatory signals during T cell activation can have either stimulatory or inhibitory effects.

{"title": "The Role of Matrix Metalloproteinases in Thoracic Aortic Disease: Are They Indicators for the Pathogenesis of Dissections?", "abstract": "The pathogenesis of aortic aneurysm and dissection continues to be under discussion. Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling processes in the aortic wall are hypothesized to be involved in the development of the disorders. Therefore, in a histological study, we investigated the expression of metalloproteases 1 and 9 (MMP1 and MMP9) and their inhibitors (TIMP 1 and TIMP 2) in cardiac surgery patients. In parallel, we studied the aortic roots by echocardiography. Clinical reports of 111 patients (30 women and 81 men) who suffered from aortic aneurysms and aortic dissection were evaluated and studied by transesophageal echocardiography. Seven patients who had coronary heart disease served as \"healthy controls\". All patients underwent the necessary surgical procedure according to the diagnosed aortic disease in the period from 2007 to 2015. A tissue sample of the aortic biopsies was collected from each patient during surgery. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for MMP1 and MMP9 and TIMP1 and TIMP2 as well. Vascularization was monitored by a CD 31 antibody. In direct comparison, the expressions are not homogeneous. We found the smallest changes in the intima area at all. TIMP 1 and TIMP 2 distribution increases from the lumen of the vessel outward in the wall layers of the aorta. In the case of arteriosclerotic changes, intima had a capillarization, but not in the media. An opposite pattern was found in the dissected aortas. There are differences in the vascularization between the aneurysm and dissection and the different layers, respectively. A different remodeling process of the ECM in comparison to the vascular layers must be hypothesized. Reading the patterns of staining and with regard to the known inhibitory effect of MMP9 on ECM remodeling, but especially TIMP 2 on neoangiogenesis, disturbed nutrition, and dysfunctional vasa vasorum remodeling must be assumed as causes of dissection.", "journal": "Biomedicines", "date": "2024-03-28", "authors": ["MarcIrqsusi", "Lan AnhDong", "Fiona RRodepeter", "RabiaRamzan", "IldarTalipov", "TamerGhazy", "MadelineG\u00fcnther", "SebastianVogt", "Ardawan JRastan"], "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines12030619\n10.3390/ijms21249739\n10.1016/j.jss.2014.03.027\n10.1111/jocs.16449\n10.1161/01.CIR.92.5.1355\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00021-8\n10.1007/s00395-016-0534-9\n10.3390/ph12030118\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.09.069\n10.1001/jamasurg.2018.1804\n10.1186/1471-2415-3-10\n10.1161/01.ATV.14.8.1315\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.806505\n10.1172/JCI8931\n10.1172/JCI0215334\n10.3390/biom11040491\n10.1016/j.molmed.2005.01.007\n10.1038/cr.1998.17\n10.3389/fonc.2019.01370\n10.1016/j.mehy.2008.11.046\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.00706\n10.3390/ijms23063346\n10.1152/ajpheart.00884.2009\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00124\n10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.120.012312\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.09.022\n10.1007/s10237-016-0769-2\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110805\n10.1093/cvr/cvz262\n10.1016/j.xjon.2020.12.012"}

Developing human-engineered spinal cord tissues that can replenish lost cells and restore a regenerative microenvironment offers promising potential for SCI therapy. However, creating vascularized human spinal cord-like tissues that mimic the diverse cell types and longitudinal parallel structural features of spinal cord tissues remains a significant hurdle. In present study, vascularized spinal cord tissues (VSCT) were engineered using embryonic human spinal cord-derived neural cells and endothelial cells on linear ordered collagen scaffolds (LOCS). Studies have shown that astrocytes and endothelial cells align along the scaffolds in VSCT, supporting axon extension from various human neurons myelinated by oligodendrocytes. After transplantation into SCI rats, VSCT survived at the injury sites, promoted endogenous neural regeneration and vascularization, ultimately reducing scarring and enhanced the behavioral functional recovery. It suggests pre-vascularization of engineered spinal cord tissues are beneficial for SCI treatment and highlights the important role of exogenous endothelial cells in tissue engineering.

Here, we bioengineered a vascularized heart-on-a-chip with circulating immune cells to model severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced acute myocarditis. We observed hallmarks of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-induced myocardial inflammation, as the presence of immune cells augmented the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, triggered progressive impairment of contractile function, and altered intracellular calcium transients. An elevation of circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) was measured first in the heart-on-a-chip and then validated in COVID-19 patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction, demonstrating that mitochondrial damage is an important pathophysiological hallmark of inflammation-induced cardiac dysfunction. Leveraging this platform in the context of SARS-CoV-2-induced myocardial inflammation, we established that administration of endothelial cell-derived exosomes effectively rescued the contractile deficit, normalized calcium handling, elevated the contraction force, and reduced the ccf-mtDNA and cytokine release via Toll-like receptor-nuclear factor \u03baB signaling axis.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2024-03-27", "authors": ["Rick Xing ZeLu", "NaimehRafatian", "YimuZhao", "Karl TWagner", "Erika LBeroncal", "BoLi", "CarolLee", "JinganChen", "ErynChurcher", "DanielVosoughi", "ChuanLiu", "YingWang", "AndrewBaker", "UrielTrahtemberg", "BowenLi", "AgostinoPierro", "Ana CAndreazza", "Claudia CDos Santos", "MilicaRadisic"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.adk0164"}

{"title": "Fibrosis-on-Chip: A Guide to Recapitulate the Essential Features of Fibrotic Disease.", "abstract": "Fibrosis, which is primarily marked by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, is a pathophysiological process associated with many disorders, which ultimately leads to organ dysfunction and poor patient outcomes. Despite the high prevalence of fibrosis, currently there exist few therapeutic options, and importantly, there is a paucity of in vitro models to accurately study fibrosis. This review discusses the multifaceted nature of fibrosis from the viewpoint of developing organ-on-chip (OoC) disease models, focusing on five key features: the ECM component, inflammation, mechanical cues, hypoxia and vascularization. We explore the potential of OoC technology for better modeling these features in the context of studying fibrotic diseases and emphasize the interplay between various key features. We review how organ-specific fibrotic diseases have been modeled in OoC platforms, which elements have been included in these existing models, and we highlight avenues for novel research directions. Finally, we conclude with a perspective section on how to address the current gap with respect to the inclusion of multiple features to yield more sophisticated and relevant models of fibrotic diseases in an OoC format.

Angiogenesis breaks through this limitation, allowing the construction of larger constructs. Our innovative scaffold combination significantly boosts angiogenesis, resulting in longer branches and more capillary network junctions. The copolymer attached to fibrin fibers enables precise adjustment of hydrogel mechanical dynamic properties for specific applications. Our material proves effective for angiogenesis, even under suppression factors like suramin. In our study, we prepared fibrin-based hydrogels with and without the copolymer PVP12400-co-GMA10mol%. Using a co-culture system of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), we analyzed angiogenetic behavior on and within the modified hydrogels.

{"title": "A Keratin 12 Expression-Based Analysis of Stem-Precursor Cells and Differentiation in the Limbal-Corneal Epithelium Using Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data.", "abstract": "The corneal epithelium (CE) is spread between two domains, the outer vascularized limbus and the avascular cornea proper. Epithelial cells undergo constant migration from the limbus to the vision-critical central cornea. Coordinated with this migration, the cells undergo differentiation changes where a pool of unique stem/precursor cells at the limbus yields the mature cells that reach the corneal center. Differentiation is heralded by the expression of the corneal-specific Krt12. Processing data acquired by scRNA-Seq showed that the increase in Krt12 expression occurs in four distinct steps within the limbus, plus a single continuous increase in the cornea. Differential gene analysis demonstrated that these domains reflect discreet stages of CE differentiation and yielded extensive information of the genes undergoing down- or upregulation in the sequential transition from less to more differentiate conditions. The approach allowed the identification of multiple gene cohorts, including (a) the genes which have maximal expression in the most primitive, Krt12-negative cell cohort, which is likely to include the stem/precursor cells; (b) the sets of genes that undergo continuous increase or decrease along the whole differentiation path; and (c) the genes showing maximal positive or negative correlation with the changes in Krt12.", "journal": "Biology", "date": "2024-03-27", "authors": ["J MarioWolosin"], "doi": "10.3390/biology13030145\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.01.038\n10.1016/0092-8674(82)90400-7\n10.1083/jcb.103.1.49\n10.1111/j.1432-0436.1987.tb00051.x\n10.1016/0922-3371(90)90103-4\n10.1016/S1350-9462(01)00007-6\n10.1016/0092-8674(89)90958-6\n10.1038/eye.1989.22\n10.1167/iovs.64.13.48\n10.1016/S0161-6420(95)30842-1\n10.1136/bjo.85.3.371c\n10.1167/iovs.02-0195\n10.1097/ICO.0000000000000242\n10.1167/iovs.06-0998\n10.1074/jbc.M600777200\n10.1167/iovs.09-3791\n10.1167/iovs.19-27656\n10.1016/j.jtos.2020.12.004\n10.1038/s41598-021-94933-8\n10.1016/j.jtos.2021.03.010\n10.1167/iovs.64.13.5\n10.1167/iovs.03-0628\n10.1016/j.jtos.2021.08.006\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000598\n10.1074/jbc.271.52.33568\n10.1242/jcs.112.5.613\n10.1076/ceyr.24.6.430.8599\n10.1167/iovs.02-0776\n10.1016/j.bbadva.2022.100067\n10.1074/jbc.R800031200\n10.1091/mbc.E19-08-0429\n10.1038/s43018-021-00287-5\n10.1038/s41419-022-04958-8"}

The superficial circumflex iliac artery perforator (SCIP) flap is an extremely versatile perforator-based flap with minimal donor site morbidity, which may represent the optimal procedure in this setting. Over the last 5\u2009years, we collected a large base of experience, including both simple and chimeric SCIP-based reconstruction, making this flap our first choice for head and neck reconstructions.\nSeventy-three patients undergoing ablative head and neck surgery for oncologic pathologies were treated by means of a SCIP flap reconstruction. Patients' mean age was 67\u2009years old (range 37-89), 51 were males and 22 were females. Fifty-eight flaps were simple and 15 were chimeric reconstruction patterns. Indocyanine green perfusion imaging was performed in all cases.\nAll the patients were successfully treated with no flap losses were encountered. Twelve patients encountered postoperative complications: in four cases revision surgery was required for venous congestion, while the remaining cases were managed conservatively (four wound dehiscence and three infections). No patients showed donor site complications. The mean follow-up period was 11\u2009months (range 3-24).\nOur case series demonstrates the reliability and versatility of the SCIP flap for different kinds of head and neck reconstructions. The chimeric options combined with bone, double skin paddle, and muscle offer a broad variety of functional reconstructive solutions for complex head and neck surgeries. Intraoperative indocyanine green perfusion examination provides a valuable tool to assess and ascertain proper vascularization and post-anastomosis vessel patency in complex microvascular flap-based reconstructions.", "journal": "Head & neck", "date": "2024-03-27", "authors": ["Mario FScaglioni", "MatteoMeroni", "Patrick ETomasetti", "Gunesh PRajan"], "doi": "10.1002/hed.27760"}

{"title": "Pediatric corneal transplantation: techniques, challenges, and outcomes.", "abstract": "Pediatric corneal transplant is a highly demanding and technically challenging procedure for the cornea surgeon in today's era. These cases pose unique challenges in clinical and surgical management. The indications of pediatric corneal transplant can be therapeutic, tectonic, optical, and cosmetic. Pediatric patients undergoing corneal transplants are at a high risk of graft infection, failure, rejection, dehiscence, and amblyopia due to young age, robust immune system, increased incidence of trauma, and compliance issues. The other factors contributing to graft failure can be allograft rejection, secondary glaucoma, corneal vascularization, multiple surgeries, vitreous prolapse, and lack of treatment compliance. A successful corneal transplant in children depends on meticulous preoperative evaluation, uneventful surgery, the expertise of a corneal surgeon, and regular and timely postoperative follow-up. Therapeutic and optical penetrating keratoplasty are the most commonly performed transplants in children. However, with the advancements in surgical technique and management protocol, the current focus has shifted toward lamellar keratoplasty. Lamellar keratoplasty offers early visual recovery and potentially fewer complications. Visual rehabilitation through corneal transplant in otherwise blind eyes can be a boon for the children. Recently, keratoprostheses have been promising in children with multiple graft failures. The current review gives insights into epidemiology, etiology, indications, clinical characteristics, investigations, management options, recent advances, and the future of pediatric corneal transplants. As surgical techniques continue to grow and comprehension of pediatric corneal transplants is improving, we can safeguard these eyes with the best possible anatomical and functional outcomes.", "journal": "Therapeutic advances in ophthalmology", "date": "2024-03-27", "authors": ["BharatGurnani", "KirandeepKaur", "SameerChaudhary", "Ruminder PreetKaur", "SwatishreeNayak", "DeepakMishra", "HarinikrishnaBalakrishnan", "Rohit OmParkash", "Arvind KumarMorya", "AmitPorwal"], "doi": "10.1177/25158414241237906"}
{"title": "Generating human bone marrow organoids for disease modeling and drug discovery.", "abstract": "The bone marrow supports and regulates hematopoiesis, responding to physiological requirements for blood cell production over ontogeny and during pathological challenges. Interactions between hematopoietic cells and niche components are challenging to study mechanistically in the human context, but are important to delineate in order to explore the pathobiology of blood and bone marrow disorders. Organoids are proving transformative in many research settings, but an accurate human bone marrow model incorporating multiple hematopoietic and stromal elements has been lacking. This protocol describes a method to generate three-dimensional, multilineage bone marrow organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), detailing the steps for the directed differentiation of hiPSCs using a series of cytokine cocktails and hydrogel embedding. Over 18 days of differentiation, hiPSCs yield the key lineages that are present in central myelopoietic bone marrow, organized in a well-vascularized architecture that resembles native hematopoietic tissues. This presents a robust, in vitro system that can model healthy and perturbed hematopoiesis in a scalable three-dimensional microenvironment. Bone marrow organoids also support the growth of immortalized cell lines and primary cells from healthy donors and patients with myeloid and lymphoid cancers, including cell types that are poorly viable in standard culture systems. Moreover, we discuss assays for the characterization of organoids, including interrogation of pathogenic remodeling using recombinant TGF-\u00df treatment, and methods for organoid engraftment with exogenous cells.

However, the inclusion of substantial lymph nodes (LNs) in the flap remains uncertain. This study aimed to identify the anatomical basis for reliable flap harvest for VGLNT.\nThe anatomy of perigastric station 4d LNs was studied in healthy cadavers (n\u00a0=\u00a015) and patients with early gastric cancer (EGC) (n\u00a0=\u00a027). The omentum was divided into three segments: proximal, middle, and distal from the origin of the right gastroepiploic vessels. The flap dimension, number, location, size of LNs, and caliber of the vessels were reviewed. Eight patients underwent VGLNT for upper/lower limb lymphedema.\nThe mean numbers of LNs in the proximal, middle, and distal segment were 2.5, 1.4, 0.5 in the cadavers, and 4.9, 2.7, 0.7 in the gastrectomy specimens, respectively. The proximal third included a significantly greater number of LNs than the distal third in the cadaveric (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024) and ECG (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) specimens. A total of 95% of the LNs were located within proximal two-thirds of the flap from the vessel origin both in the cadavers (21.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05.0\u00a0cm) and in the gastrectomy specimens (20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0cm).

{"title": "The accessory vascularization of the tensor fasciae latae muscle: towards a new classification?", "abstract": "The tensor fasciae latae (TFL) muscle is supplied by the lateral femoral circumflex artery (LCFA), arising from the deep femoral artery. However, it has been noted that there is also a consistent vascular anastomotic network. The aim of this study was to describe the accessory vascularization of the TFL muscle through a descriptive anatomical study, in order to hypothesize the feasibility of harvesting a TFL flap in the event of an injury to the main pedicle. In addition, we illustrate this hypothesis with a successful clinical case of Scarpa freconstruction following ligature of the deep femoral artery.\nThe description of the accessory vascularization was obtained by injecting dye into seven lateral femoral circumflex arteries (LCFA), six superficial circumflex iliac arteries (SCIA), and three inferior gluteal arteries (IGA).\nThe TFL muscle was vascularized primarily by the LCFA. A vascular anastomotic network with the SCIA and the IGA was observed. After selective injection to the SCIAs and IGAs, the subsequent injection to the LCFA showed a diffusion of the TFL skin paddle with a perforasome overlapping between the different vascular territories.\nThe ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex plays a dominant role in the vascularization of the TFL muscle. As a result of a periarticular anastomotic network of the hip, this artery establishes several connections with the proximal arteries. Consequently, in cases where blood flow through the LCFA is interrupted, it should be equally possible to harvest the TFL flap through its accessory vascularization.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2024-03-26", "authors": ["SilviaGandolfi", "BChaput", "YBerkane", "ELupon", "AKarra"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-024-03343-8\n10.1016/j.bjps.2005.04.038\n10.1097/00006534-200008000-00016\n10.1007/s00276-014-1261-2\n10.1097/00006534-199810000-00027\n10.1055/s-0030-1249321\n10.1097/00006534-197804000-00004\n10.1055/s-0038-1677010\n10.1007/s00238-004-0624-z\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000135332.97062.7F\n10.1097/00006534-200009010-00009\n10.1097/00006534-199904010-00014\n10.1097/00006534-200106000-00018\n10.1016/j.anplas.2016.05.011\n10.1007/BF01628133\n10.1016/S0007-1226(79)90031-6\n10.1097/00006534-198167020-00007\n10.1097/00000637-197807000-00003\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000142416.91524.4C\n10.1097/SAP.0000000000001424\n10.1002/(SICI)1098-2353(1998)11:4<236::AID-CA2>3.0.CO;2-P\n10.1016/j.aanat.2020.151566"}

{"title": "Does Fibula Free Flap Harvesting Affect Donor Site of Patients in Facial Reconstructions: A Gait Analysis Study.", "abstract": "Vascularized fibula free flap (VFFF) remains gold standard for reconstruction of bony defects of the maxilla or mandible. Research and publications in recent years essentially focused on the evolution and improvement of the recipient reconstructed area but very few concerning the donor site morbidity.\nThe aim of this study was to analyze walking ability of patients following VFFF operation and to determine if there are long term walking disabilities.\nThe retrospective cohort study involved healthy controls and patients who had undergone VFFF between 2012 and 2019 at the oral and maxillo-facial department of the University Hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland. Patients with cardiovascular, pulmonary, neuromuscular or musculoskeletal pathologies that could impair walking were excluded from the study.\nPrimary predictor is the reconstruction status, VFFF versus healthy patients (controls).\nMain outcomes were gait parameters. Objective evaluation of walking abilities was assessed using the Gait up system (Gait Up SA, EPFL Innov'Park-C, Lausanne, Switzerland), which are wearable motion sensors that provides 3D analytics of the gait.\nCovariates implied patient characteristics such as age, sex, time after surgery and subjective evaluation of the gait obtained with two orthopedic validated questionnaires.\nThis study implied 10 healthy controls and 11 patients who had undergone VFFF. Results showed statistically significant differences in the speed [m/s] (1.3 vs 1.1 for a P value of .001), the stride length [m] (1.4 vs 1.2 for a P value of 0.003), the flat foot phase [%] (55.0 vs 63.3 for a P value of .006) and the pushing phase [%] (34.1 vs 25.1 for a P value of .008).\nReconstruction using vascularized autograft in maxillofacial surgery is substantial and well described. Our attention focusing on donor site morbidity has demonstrated subjective and objective long-term alterations. These results will have to be confirmed with gait analysis in a prospective project including preoperative and postoperative analysis of the gait of the patient acting himself as his own control, with a larger scale of patients.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2024-03-26", "authors": ["EloiDenys", "LaurencePincet", "KarmaLambery", "MartinBroome", "LaurenceMay"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2024.03.003"}

The crucial role of endothelial cells and osteoblasts in bone vascularization and osteogenesis underscores the importance of their intimate interaction. However, efforts to bioengineer bone tissue have been impeded by the difficulty in establishing proper angiogenesis and osteogenesis in tissue structures. This study presents a novel approach to bone tissue engineering, involving a three-dimensional composite hydrogel scaffold composed of sodium alginate microspheres encapsulated in type I collagen. Using this scaffold, a three-dimensional indirect co-culture system was established for osteoblasts and endothelial cells to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation potential of osteoblasts. Results demonstrate that the non-contact co-culture system of endothelial cells and osteoblasts constructed by the composite hydrogel scaffold loaded with microspheres holds promise for bone tissue engineering.

Surgery, especially minimally invasive methods such as laparoscopic and robotic procedures, is the preferred treatment. However, these techniques present technical complications. The anatomical complexity and variations in vessel branching patterns pose challenges, particularly for less experienced surgeons. The CoDIG 2 is a nationwide observational study involving 76 specialized Italian general surgery departments focused on colorectal surgery. The centres were directed to maintain their standard surgical and clinical practices. The aim of this study was to analyse the intraoperative vascular anatomy of Italian patients who underwent laparoscopic right colectomy and explore the ligature techniques used by Italian surgeons. Surgeons reported information about vascularization of the right colon for 616 patients and about surgical anatomy of RCA for 368 patients. Fifty-three patients (10.8%) showed no RCA intraoperatively. The right colic artery (RCA) was categorized according to the Yada classification (types 1-4) during evaluation, and intraoperative assessments revealed that Yada type 1 was the most common type (55.2%), while radiologic evaluations revealed a higher prevalence of type 2. Furthermore, compared with the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), the RCA is more often located anteriorly according to intraoperative and contrast-enhanced\u00a0CT examination; 59.9% were found in the anterior position during intraoperative examination, while 40.1% were found in the same position on preoperative contrast-enhanced CT. Vascularization of the right colon, including missing branches, additional branches, shared trunks, and retro-superior courses of the mesenteric vein, exhibited notable variations. To understand vascular variations, a preoperative radiological study is necessary; although there was no concordance between the intraoperative and radiological evaluations, this is a limitation of preinterventional radiological evaluation (PII) because it is always needed for oncological staging.

{"title": "Engineering vascularized skin-mimetic phantom for non-invasive Raman spectroscopy.", "abstract": "Recent advances in Raman spectroscopy have shown great potential for non-invasive analyte sensing, but the lack of a standardized optical phantom for these measurements has hindered further progress. While many research groups have developed optical phantoms that mimic bulk optical absorption and scattering, these materials typically have strong Raman scattering, making it difficult to distinguish metabolite signals. As a result, solid tissue phantoms for spectroscopy have been limited to highly scattering tissues such as bones and calcifications, and metabolite sensing has been primarily performed using liquid tissue phantoms. To address this issue, we have developed a layered skin-mimetic phantom that can support metabolite sensing through Raman spectroscopy. Our approach incorporates millifluidic vasculature that mimics blood vessels to allow for diffusion akin to metabolite diffusion in the skin. Furthermore, our skin phantoms are mechanically mimetic, providing an ideal model for development of minimally invasive optical techniques. By providing a standardized platform for measuring metabolites, our approach has the potential to facilitate critical developments in spectroscopic techniques and improve our understanding of metabolite dynamics ", "journal": "Sensors and actuators.

{"title": "Molecular Basis of Angiogenesis and its Application.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels, is a fundamental physiological process. In addition, angiogenesis plays a key role in the pathogenesis of several disorders, including cancer and eye disorders such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, identifying the regulators of angiogenesis proved challenging. Numerous factors that stimulated angiogenesis in various bioassays were identified, but their pathophysiological role remained unclear. In 1989, we reported the isolation and cloning of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, VEGF-A) as an endothelial cell-specific mitogen and angiogenic factor. The tyrosine kinases Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2) were subsequently identified as VEGF receptors. Loss of a single vegfa allele results in defective vascularization and embryonic lethality in mice, emphasizing the essential role of VEGF in the development of blood vessels. Subsequently, we reported that anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies block growth and neovascularization in tumor models. These findings paved the way for the clinical development of a humanized anti-VEGF antibody and other VEGF inhibitors for cancer therapy. To date, several VEGF inhibitors represent standard of care for colorectal cancer and other difficult to treat malignancies. VEGF is also implicated in intraocular neovascularization associated with retinal disorders as well as neovascular AMD. Our group developed a humanized anti-VEGF-A antibody fragment (ranibizumab) for the treatment of wet AMD. Ranibizumab not only maintained but also improved visual acuity and has been approved worldwide for the treatment of wet AMD and other neovascular disorders. Other VEGF inhibitors, including bevacizumab and aflibercept, have also resulted in significant clinical benefits. Today anti-VEGF drugs represent the most effective therapy for intraocular neovascularization.

However, the preparation of implants with excellent antimicrobial properties as well as better osseointegration ability remains difficult for clinical application. In this study, black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) were doped into hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings using electrophoretic deposition. The coatings' surface morphology, roughness, water contact angle, photothermal properties, and antibacterial properties were investigated. The BP/HA coating exhibited a surface roughness of 59.1\u2009nm, providing an ideal substrate for cell attachment and growth. The water contact angle on the BP/HA coating was measured to be approximately 8.55\u00b0, indicating its hydrophilic nature. The BPNSs demonstrated efficient photothermal conversion, with a temperature increase of 42.2\u00b0C under laser irradiation. The BP/HA composite coating exhibited a significant reduction in bacterial growth, with inhibition rates of 95.6% and 96.1% against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In addition, the cytocompatibility of the composite coating was evaluated by cell adhesion, CCK8 and AM/PI staining; the effect of the composite coating in promoting angiogenesis was assessed by scratch assay, transwell assay, and protein blotting; and the osteoinductivity of the composite coating was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase assay, alizarin red staining, and Western blot. The results showed that the BP/HA composite coating exhibited superior performance in promoting biological functions such as cell proliferation and adhesion, antibacterial activity, osteogenic differentiation, and angiogenesis, and had potential applications in vascularized bone regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "TGF\u03b2 signalling: a nexus between inflammation, placental health and preeclampsia throughout pregnancy.", "abstract": "The placenta is a unique and pivotal organ in reproduction, controlling crucial growth and cell differentiation processes that ensure a successful pregnancy. Placental development is a tightly regulated and dynamic process, in which the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) superfamily plays a central role. This family of pleiotropic growth factors is heavily involved in regulating various aspects of reproductive biology, particularly in trophoblast differentiation during the first trimester of pregnancy. TGF\u03b2 signalling precisely regulates trophoblast invasion and the cell transition from cytotrophoblasts to extravillous trophoblasts, which is an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like process. Later in pregnancy, TGF\u03b2 signalling ensures proper vascularization and angiogenesis in placental endothelial cells. Beyond its role in trophoblasts and endothelial cells, TGF\u03b2 signalling contributes to the polarization and function of placental and decidual macrophages by promoting maternal tolerance of the semi-allogeneic foetus. Disturbances in early placental development have been associated with several pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia (PE) which is one of the severe complications. Emerging evidence suggests that TGF\u03b2 is involved in the pathogenesis of PE, thereby offering a potential target for intervention in the human placenta.\nThis comprehensive review aims to explore and elucidate the roles of the major members of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily, including TGF\u03b2s, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), activins, inhibins, nodals, and growth differentiation factors (GDFs), in the context of placental development and function. The review focusses on their interactions within the major cell types of the placenta, namely trophoblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells, in both normal pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by PE throughout pregnancy.\nA literature search was carried out using PubMed and Google Scholar, searching terms: 'TGF signalling preeclampsia', 'pregnancy TGF signalling', 'preeclampsia tgf\u03b2', 'preeclampsia bmp', 'preeclampsia gdf', 'preeclampsia activin', 'endoglin preeclampsia', 'endoglin pregnancy', 'tgf\u03b2 signalling pregnancy', 'bmp signalling pregnancy', 'gdf signalling pregnancy', 'activin signalling pregnancy', 'Hofbauer cell tgf\u03b2 signalling', 'placental macrophages tgf\u03b2', 'endothelial cells tgf\u03b2', 'endothelium tgf\u03b2 signalling', 'trophoblast invasion tgf\u03b2 signalling', 'trophoblast invasion Smad', 'trophoblast invasion bmp', 'trophoblast invasion tgf\u03b2', 'tgf\u03b2 preeclampsia', 'tgf\u03b2 placental development', 'TGF\u03b2 placental function', 'endothelial dysfunction preeclampsia tgf\u03b2 signalling', 'vascular remodelling placenta TGF\u03b2', 'inflammation pregnancy tgf\u03b2', 'immune response pregnancy tgf\u03b2', 'immune tolerance pregnancy tgf\u03b2', 'TGF\u03b2 pregnancy NK cells', 'bmp pregnancy NK cells', 'bmp pregnancy tregs', 'tgf\u03b2 pregnancy tregs', 'TGF\u03b2 placenta NK cells', 'TGF\u03b2 placenta tregs', 'NK cells preeclampsia', 'Tregs preeclampsia'. Only articles published in English until 2023 were used.\nA comprehensive understanding of TGF\u03b2 signalling and its role in regulating interconnected cell functions of the main placental cell types provides valuable insights into the processes essential for successful placental development and growth of the foetus during pregnancy. By orchestrating trophoblast invasion, vascularization, immune tolerance, and tissue remodelling, TGF\u03b2 ligands contribute to the proper functioning of a healthy maternal-foetal interface. However, dysregulation of TGF\u03b2 signalling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PE, where the shallow trophoblast invasion, defective vascular remodelling, decreased uteroplacental perfusion, and endothelial cell and immune dysfunction observed in PE, are all affected by an altered TGF\u03b2 signalling.\nThe dysregulation of TGF\u03b2 signalling in PE has important implications for research and clinical practice. Further investigation is required to understand the underlying mechanisms, including the role of different ligands and their regulation under pathophysiological conditions, in order to discover new therapeutic targets. Distinguishing between clinically manifested subtypes of PE and studying TGF\u03b2 signalling in different placental cell types holistically is an important first step. To put this knowledge into practice, pre-clinical animal models combined with new technologies are needed. This may also lead to improved human research models and identify potential therapeutic targets, ultimately improving outcomes for affected pregnancies and reducing the burden of PE.", "journal": "Human reproduction update", "date": "2024-03-23", "authors": ["MonikaHorvat Mercnik", "CarolinSchliefsteiner", "GonzaloSanchez-Duffhues", "ChristianWadsack"], "doi": "10.1093/humupd/dmae007"}

While the fabrication technology and model cells used to synthesize organs-on-chip have advanced considerably, most platforms rely on animal-derived or synthetic extracellular matrix as a cell substrate, limiting mimicry of human physiology and precluding use in modeling diseases in which matrix dynamics play a role in pathogenesis. Here, the development of human cell-derived matrix (hCDM) composite hydrogels for use in 3D microphysiologic models of the vasculature is reported. hCDM composite hydrogels are derived from human donor fibroblasts and maintain a complex milieu of basement membrane, proteoglycans, and nonfibrillar matrix components. The use of hCDM composite hydrogels as 2D and 3D cell culture substrates is demonstrated, and hCDM composite hydrogels are patterned to form engineered human microvessels. Interestingly, hCDM composite hydrogels are enriched in proteins associated with vascular morphogenesis as determined by mass spectrometry, and functional analysis demonstrates proangiogenic signatures in human endothelial cells cultured in these hydrogels. In conclusion, this study suggests that human donor-derived hCDM composite hydrogels could address technical gaps in human organs-on-chip development and serve as substrates to promote vascularization.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2024-03-23", "authors": ["Elizabeth LDoherty", "GraceKrohn", "Emily CWarren", "AlexandraPatton", "Chloe PWhitworth", "MiteshRathod", "AndreeaBiehl", "Wen YihAw", "Donald OFreytes", "William JPolacheck"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202400192"}

The spherical microgels with a size of 150\u00a0\u03bcm were obtained. The MTK-TK-drug microgels efficiently converted the pro-inflammatory Th17\u00a0cells into anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Treg) cells in vitro, and the ROS-scavenging materials synergistically enhanced the effect by modulating the inflammation microenvironment. Thus, the microgels significantly reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and decreased the inflammatory response in the early stages of post-myocardial infarction (MI) in vivo, thereby reducing fibrosis, promoting vascularization, and preserving cardiac function.

The same designs, in a polycaprolactone scaffold only, or when combined with gelatin methacryloyl, were then assessed for their ability to allow the infiltration of blood vessels in a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, a cost-effective and time-efficient ", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2024-03-22", "authors": ["Stephanie EDoyle", "MicaelaPannella", "CarmineOnofrillo", "ChiaraBellotti", "ClaudiaDi Bella", "Cathal DO'Connell", "ElenaPirogova", "EnricoLucarelli", "SerenaDuchi"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2024.1353154\n10.1021/acsami.9b23100\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.01.071\n10.1002/mabi.201900058\n10.4155/fso.15.63\n10.1016/j.psj.2023.103119\n10.1088/1758-5090/ab19fd\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.07.003\n10.1136/jcp.2007.048868\n10.1016/0026-2862(89)90022-8\n10.1039/d1bm01262b\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.08.028\n10.1002/admt.202100189\n10.1002/jbm.a.20023\n10.1155/2010/940741\n10.1073/pnas.0604237103\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.10.016\n10.1016/j.psj.2021.101622\n10.3389/fphys.2022.838013\n10.3389/fcell.2020.602278\n10.1016/j.matdes.2021.110224\n10.1002/adfm.202109915\n10.1038/nbt0705-821\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.10.187\n10.1016/j.actbio.2009.08.044\n10.1002/term.2628\n10.1002/mabi.202000204\n10.1038/laban0304-28\n10.1177/2041731420901621\n10.1101/2023.04.14.536947\n10.3389/fphys.2022.981161\n10.1016/j.mporth.2016.04.007\n10.1089/ten.TEB.2009.0085\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.04.039\n10.1371/journal.pone.0152821\n10.4248/BR201303001\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.09.011\n10.1038/srep32168\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2017.0186\n10.1002/term.2711\n10.1186/s42826-022-00128-1\n10.1111/joa.13282\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2006.tb00423.x\n10.1007/s10456-014-9440-7\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120383\n10.14573/altex.1807241\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104933\n10.1155/2017/5046953\n10.1039/c8tb01373j\n10.3390/polym13193399\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.166\n10.1272/jnms.84.148\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2021.112716\n10.1038/386671a0\n10.1007/s10856-019-6273-3\n10.1038/s41580-020-00279-w\n10.1016/j.addr.2014.06.002\n10.1111/j.1365-2613.2008.00633.x\n10.1111/j.0959-9673.2004.00396.x\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2022.105631\n10.7150/ijbs.27063\n10.1042/BA20030109\n10.1088/1758-5090/ac6700\n10.3390/cells9061325\n10.1016/S0232-1513(86)80087-1\n10.4248/BR201304002\n10.3390/ijms18010159\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2017.10.001\n10.1038/labinvest.3780252\n10.1002/jbm.10152\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.158014\n10.1038/s41598-021-00024-z\n10.3390/ani13172710\n10.7150/ijms.10443\n10.2147/IJN.S248911\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00077-7"}

Intelligence studies help focus on research hotspots and address key mechanistic issues. Currently, few comprehensive studies describe the characteristics of human organoid research. In this study, we extracted 8,591 original articles on organoids from the Web of Science core collection database over the past two decades and conducted intelligence analysis using CiteSpace. The number of publications in this field has experienced rapid growth in the last ten years (almost 70-fold increase since 2009). The United States, China, Germany, Netherlands, and UK have strong collaborations in publishing articles. Clevers Hans, Van Der Laan, Jason R Spence, and Sato Toshiro have made significant contributions to advancing progress in this field. Clustering and burst analysis categorized research hotspots into tissue model and functional construction, intercellular signaling, immune mechanisms, and tumor metastasis. Organoid research in highly cited articles covers four major areas: basic research (38%), involving stem cell developmental processes and cell-cell interactions; biobanking (10%), with a focus on organoid cultivation; precision medicine (16%), emphasizing cell therapy and drug development; and disease modeling (36%), including pathogen analysis and screening for disease-related genetic variations. The main obstacles currently faced in organoid research include cost and technology, vascularization of cells, immune system establishment, international standard protocols, and limited availability of high-quality clinical trial data.

Clinical treatment was classified into 3 phases. In phase I, techniques such as orthognathic surgery, microsurgery, and distraction osteogenesis were employed to reconstruct the correct three-dimensional (3D) jaw position relationship. In phase II, bone augmentation and soft tissue management techniques were utilized to address insufficient alveolar bone mass and poor gingival soft tissue conditions. In phase III, implant-supported overdentures or fixed dentures were used for occlusal reconstruction. A summary of treatment methods, clinical efficacy evaluation, comparative analysis of imageological examinations, and satisfaction questionnaire survey were utilized to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy in patients with traumatic old jaw fractures and dentition defects. All data are summarized using the arithmetic mean and standard deviation and compared using independent sample t-tests.\nIn 15 patients with old jaw fractures and dentition defects (an average age of 32 years, ranging from 18 to 53 years), there were 7 cases of malocclusion of single maxillary fracture, 6 of malocclusion of single mandible fracture, and 2 of malocclusion of both maxillary and mandible fractures. There were 5 patients with single maxillary dentition defects, 2 with single mandibular dentition defects, and 8 with both maxillary and mandibular dentition defects. To reconstruct the correct 3D jaw positional relationship, 5 patients underwent Le Fort I osteotomy of the maxilla, 3 underwent bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy of the mandible, 4 underwent open reduction and internal fixation for old jaw fractures, 3 underwent temporomandibular joint surgery, and 4 underwent distraction osteogenesis. All patients underwent jawbone augmentation, of whom 4 patients underwent a free composite vascularized bone flap (26.66%) and the remaining patients underwent local alveolar bone augmentation. Free gingival graft and connective tissue graft were the main methods for soft tissue augmentation (73.33%). The 15 patients received 81 implants, of whom 11 patients received implant-supported fixed dentures and 4 received implant-supported removable dentures. The survival rate of all implants was 93.82%. The final imageological examination of 15 patients confirmed that the malocclusion was corrected, and the clinical treatment ultimately achieved occlusal function reconstruction. The patient satisfaction questionnaire survey showed that they were satisfied with the efficacy, phonetics, aesthetics, and comfort after treatment.\nOcclusal reconstruction of old jaw fractures and dentition defects requires a phased sequential comprehensive treatment, consisting of 3D spatial jaw correction, alveolar bone augmentation and soft tissue augmentation, and implant-supported occlusal reconstruction, achieving satisfactory clinical therapeutic efficacy.", "journal": "Chinese journal of traumatology = Zhonghua chuang shang za zhi", "date": "2024-03-22", "authors": ["Ming-ChaoDing", "Bo-YaJing", "JinShi", "LiuYang", "Xiang-DongLiu", "Jing-FuWang", "ShuangQu", "Jia-WuLiang", "Zi-HaoTang", "Jin-LongZhao", "LeiTian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cjtee.2024.03.004"}

Although reconstructive surgery has made significant strides, the challenges of restoring both form and function remain, particularly in centrally located defects. This review explored the long-term outcomes of FT, addressing its challenges and potential pitfalls. A systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted, encompassing articles published in English from November 2005 to January 2023, which were searched across PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases. Keywords included \"face transplant,\" \"face transplant outcomes,\" and \"face transplant long-term.\" Data on surgical teams, patient demographics, transplant specifics, rejection episodes, additional surgeries, and patient-reported outcomes were extracted and analyzed. In total, 34 articles met the inclusion criteria. Over the 2 decades, 48 FT procedures were performed, with 23 patients followed for at least 3\u00a0years. Predominantly, patients were men (80%), averaging 31\u00a0years in age. Ballistic trauma (44.6%) and burns (25.5%) were common causes of injury. Chronic rejection emerged as a significant concern, leading to graft loss and necessitating retransplantation in 2 patients. Additional surgical procedures were often required. FT offers a remarkable solution for individuals with extensive facial disfigurement. Successful outcomes depend on factors, such as patient selection, multidisciplinary collaboration, psychiatric evaluation, and post-operative care. Nevertheless, challenges persist, including the need for lifelong immunosuppression and risk of chronic rejection.

{"title": "Intercalary Resection of the Tibia for Primary Bone Tumors: Are Vascularized Fibula Autografts With or Without Allografts a Durable Reconstruction?", "abstract": "Reconstruction with vascularized fibula grafts (VFG) after intercalary resection of sarcoma may offer longevity by providing early graft-host union and fracture healing. The ability of the fibula to hypertrophy under mechanical stress, as well as vascularized bone in the area, may also be advantageous, given that soft tissues may be compromised because of resection, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. VFG with a massive allograft combines the primary mechanical stability of the graft with the biological potential of the vascularized fibula; however, complications and the durability of this combined reconstruction are not well described.\n(1) What was the proportion of complications after reconstruction with VFG, with or without allografts? (2) What was the functional result after surgical treatment as assessed by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score? (3) What was the survivorship of these grafts free from revision and graft removal?\nBetween 1988 and 2021, 219 patients were treated at our institution for a primary malignant or aggressive benign bone tumor of the tibia with en bloc resection. Of those, 54% (119 of 219) had proximal tibial tumors with epiphyseal involvement and were treated with either intra-articular resection and reconstruction with an osteoarticular allograft, allograft-prosthesis composite (APC), or modular prosthesis according to age, diagnosis, and preoperative or postoperative radiotherapy. Nine percent (20) of patients had distal tibial tumors that were treated with intra-articular resection and reconstruction with ankle arthrodesis using allogenic or autologous grafts, and 0.5% (1 patient) underwent total tibial resection for extensive tumoral involvement of the tibia and reconstruction with an APC. Thirty-six percent (79) of patients had a metadiaphyseal bone tumor of the tibia and were treated with intercalary joint-sparing resection. We routinely use reconstruction with VFG after intercalary tibial resection for primary malignant or aggressive benign bone tumors in patients with long life expectancy and high functional demands and in whom at least 1 cm of residual bone stock of the proximal or distal epiphysis can be preserved. By contrast, we routinely use intercalary massive allograft reconstruction in short resections or in patients with metastatic disease who do not have long life expectancy. We avoid VFG in patients with tibial bone metastasis, patients older than 70 years, or primary bone tumors in patients who may undergo postoperative radiotherapy; in these patients, we use alternative reconstructive methods such as intercalary prostheses, plate and cement, or intramedullary nailing with cement augmentation. According to the above-mentioned indications, 6% (5 of 79) of patients underwent massive allograft reconstruction because they were young and had intercalary resections shorter than 7 cm or had metastatic disease at diagnosis without long life expectancy, whereas 94% (74) of patients underwent VFG reconstruction. The median age at operation was 16 years (range 5 to 68 years). The diagnosis was high-grade osteosarcoma in 22 patients, Ewing sarcoma in 19, adamantinoma in 16, low-grade osteosarcoma in five, fibrosarcoma in three, malignant fibrous histiocytoma and Grade 2 chondrosarcoma in two, and malignant myoepitelioma, angiosarcoma of bone, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor of bone, squamous cell carcinoma secondary to chronic osteomyelitis, and desmoplastic fibroma in one patient each. Median follow-up was 12.3 years (range 2 to 35 years). The median tibial resection length was 15 cm (range 7 to 27 cm), and the median fibular resection length was 18 cm (range 10 to 29 cm). VFG was used with a massive allograft in 55 patients, alone in 12 patients, and combined with allogenic cortical bone struts in seven patients. We used VFG combined with a massive allograft in patients undergoing juxta-articular, joint-sparing resections that left less than 3 cm of residual epiphyseal bone, for intra-epiphyseal resections, or for long intercalary resections wherein the allograft can provide better mechanical stability. In these clinical situations, the combination of a VFG and massive allograft allows more stable fixation and better tendinous reattachment of the patellar tendon. VFG was used with cortical bone struts in distal tibia intercalary resections where the narrow diameter of the allograft did not allow concentric assembling with the fibula. Finally, VFG alone was often used after mid- or distal tibia intercalary resection in patients with critical soft tissue conditions because of previous surgery, in whom the combination with massive allograft would result in a bulkier reconstruction. We ascertained complications and MSTS scores by chart review, and survivorship free from revision and graft removal was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. In our study, however, the occurrence of death as a competing event was observed in a relatively low proportion of patients, and only occurred after the primary event of interest had already occurred. Considering the nature of our data, we did not consider death after the primary event of interest as a competing event.\nIn all, 49% (36 of 74) of patients experienced complications and underwent operative treatment. There were 45 complications in 36 patients. There was one instance of footdrop secondary to common peroneal nerve palsy, four wound problems, one acute vein thrombosis of the VFG pedicle and one necrosis of the skin island, two episodes of implant-related pain, 10 nonunions, six fractures, six deep infections, nine local recurrences, one Achilles tendon retraction, one varus deformity of the proximal tibia with postoperative tibial apophysis detachment, one knee osteoarthritis, and one hypometria. The median MSTS score was 30 (range 23 to 30); the MSTS score was assessed only in patients in whom the VFG was retained at the final clinical visit, although if we had considered those who had an amputation, the overall score would be lower. Revision-free survival of the reconstructions was 58% (95% confidence interval 47% to 70%) at 5 years, 52% (95% CI 41% to 65%) at 10 and 15 years, and 49% (95% CI 38% to 63%) at 20 and 30 years. Eight patients underwent VFG removal because of complications, with an overall reconstruction survival of 91% (95% CI 84% to 98%) at 5 years and 89% (95% CI 82% to 97%) at 10 to 30 years.\nVFG, alone or combined with an allograft, could be considered in reconstructing a lower extremity after intercalary resections of the tibia for primary bone tumors, and it avoids the use of a large endoprosthesis. However, this procedure was associated with frequent, often severe complications during the first postoperative years and complication-free survival of 58% at 5 years. Nearly 10% of patients ultimately had an amputation. For patients whose reconstruction succeeded, the technique provides a durable reconstruction with good MSTS scores, and we believe it is useful for active patients with long life expectancy. Fractures, frequently observed in the first 5 years postoperatively, might be reduced using long-spanning plate fixation, and that appeared to be the case in our study.

{"title": "Implications of an Altered Gut Microbiome in Rat Experimental Vascularized Composite Transplantation.", "abstract": "Vascularized composite allotransplantation is a reconstructive option after severe injury but is fraught with complications, including transplant rejection due to major histocompatibility complex mismatch in the context of allogeneic transplant, which in turn is due to altered immuno-inflammation secondary to transplant. The immunosuppressant tacrolimus can prevent rejection. Because tacrolimus is metabolized predominantly by the gut, this immunosuppressant alters the gut microbiome in multiple ways, thereby possibly affecting immunoinflammation.\nWe performed either allogeneic or syngeneic transplant with or without tacrolimus in rats. We quantified protein-level inflammatory mediators in the skin, muscle, and plasma and assessed the diversity of the gut microbiome through 16S RNA analysis at several timepoints over 31 days posttransplant.\nStatistical analysis highlighted a complex interaction between major histocompatibility complex and tacrolimus therapy on the relative diversity of the microbiome. Time-interval principal component analysis indicated numerous significant differences in the tissue characteristics of inflammation and gut microbiome that varied over time and across experimental conditions. Classification and regression tree analysis suggested that both inflammatory mediators in specific tissues and changes in the gut microbiome are useful in characterizing the temporal dynamics of posttransplant inflammation. Dynamic network analysis highlighted unique changes in Methanosphaera that were correlated with Peptococcusin allogeneic transplants with and without tacrolimus versus Prevotella in syngeneic transplant with tacrolimus, suggesting that alterations in Methanosphaera might be a biomarker of vascularized composite allotransplant rejection.\nOur results suggest a complex interaction among major histocompatibility complex, local and systemic immuno-inflammation, and tacrolimus therapy and highlight the potential for novel insights into vascularized composite allotransplant from computational approaches.", "journal": "Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation", "date": "2024-03-21", "authors": ["Ashti MShah", "Ali MAral", "Derek ABarclay", "JinlingYin", "RubenZamora", "VijayGorantla", "YoramVodovotz"], "doi": "10.6002/ect.2023.0312"}
{"title": "High-Scale 3D-Bioprinting Platform for the Automated Production of Vascularized Organs-on-a-Chip.", "abstract": "3D bioprinting possesses the potential to revolutionize contemporary methodologies for fabricating tissue models employed in pharmaceutical research and experimental investigations. This is enhanced by combining bioprinting with advanced Organs-on-a-Chip (OOCs), which includes a complex arrangement of multiple cell types representing organ-specific cells, connective tissue and vasculature. However, both OOCs and bioprinting so far demand a high degree of manual intervention, thereby impeding efficiency and inhibiting scalability to meet technological requirements. Through the combination of drop-on-demand bioprinting with robotic handling of microfluidic chips, a print procedure is achieved that is proficient in managing three distinct tissue models on a chip within only a minute, as well as capable of consecutively processing numerous OOCs without manual intervention. This process rests upon the development of a post-printing sealable microfluidic chip, that is compatible with different types of 3D-bioprinters and easily connected a perfusion system. The capabilities of the automized bioprint process are showcased through the creation of a multicellular and vascularized liver carcinoma model on chip. The process achieves full vascularization and stable microvascular network formation over 14 days of culture time, with pronounced spheroidal cell growth and albumin secretion of HepG2 serving as a representative cell model.

{"title": "Targeting STAT6-mediated synovial macrophage activation improves pain in experimental knee osteoarthritis.", "abstract": "Pain from osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the top causes of disability worldwide, but effective treatment is lacking. Nociceptive factors are released by activated synovial macrophages in OA, but depletion of synovial macrophages paradoxically worsens inflammation and tissue damage in previous studies. Rather than depleting macrophages, we hypothesized that inhibiting macrophage activation may improve pain without increasing tissue damage. We aimed to identify key mechanisms mediating synovial macrophage activation and test the role of STAT signaling in macrophages on pain outcomes in experimental knee OA.\nWe induced experimental knee OA in rats via knee destabilization surgery, and performed RNA sequencing analysis on sorted synovial tissue macrophages to identify macrophage activation mechanisms. Liposomes laden with STAT1 or STAT6 inhibitors, vehicle (control), or clodronate (depletion control) were delivered selectively to synovial macrophages via serial intra-articular injections up to 12 weeks after OA induction. Treatment effects on knee and hindpaw mechanical pain sensitivity were measured during OA development, along with synovitis, cartilage damage, and synovial macrophage infiltration using histopathology and immunofluorescence. Lastly, crosstalk between drug-treated synovial tissue and articular chondrocytes was assessed in co-culture.\nThe majority of pathways identified by transcriptomic analyses in OA synovial macrophages involve STAT signaling. As expected, macrophage depletion reduced pain, but increased synovial tissue fibrosis and vascularization. In contrast, STAT6 inhibition in macrophages led to marked, sustained improvements in mechanical pain sensitivity and synovial inflammation without worsening synovial or cartilage pathology. During co-culture, STAT6 inhibitor-treated synovial tissue had minimal effects on healthy chondrocyte gene expression, whereas STAT1 inhibitor-treated synovium induced changes in numerous cartilage turnover-related genes.\nThese results suggest that STAT signaling is a major mediator of synovial macrophage activation in experimental knee OA. STAT6 may be a key mechanism mediating the release of nociceptive factors from macrophages and the development of mechanical pain sensitivity. Whereas therapeutic depletion of macrophages paradoxically increases inflammation and fibrosis, blocking STAT6-mediated synovial macrophage activation may be a novel strategy for OA-pain management without accelerating tissue damage.", "journal": "Arthritis research & therapy", "date": "2024-03-21", "authors": ["GarthBlackler", "YueLai-Zhao", "JosephKlapak", "Holly TPhilpott", "Kyle KPitchers", "Andrew RMaher", "BenoitFiset", "Logan AWalsh", "Elizabeth RGillies", "C ThomasAppleton"], "doi": "10.1186/s13075-024-03309-6\n10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-204905\n10.1002/art.39488\n10.1136/ard.2009.121426\n10.1016/j.joca.2015.09.013\n10.3899/jrheum.210285\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.678757\n10.1002/art.42412\n10.1097/PR9.0000000000000892\n10.1172/JCI59643\n10.1002/art.40161\n10.1016/j.joca.2020.01.015\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00614\n10.2147/JIR.S219586\n10.1016/j.joca.2021.03.010\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bty560\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btv098\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btt656\n10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8\n10.1038/nprot.2009.97\n10.1038/s41598-020-76603-3\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1002/jor.25593\n10.1016/j.joca.2010.05.030\n10.1016/j.joca.2018.10.014\n10.1185/03007995.2013.785391\n10.1016/j.joca.2013.03.018\n10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001466\n10.1371/journal.pone.0054633\n10.1186/s12864-020-07228-z\n10.1136/annrheumdis-2016-209757\n10.1155/2015/341308\n10.1016/j.neulet.2008.03.050\n10.1371/journal.pone.0028205\n10.1186/s13075-019-1923-x\n10.1136/ard-2022-223640\n10.1038/s41598-018-36909-9"}

There is an unmet need to identify novel markers that can predict the parasellar growth of PitNETs. Furthermore, mechanisms that regulate bone invasiveness of PitNETs and factors related to tumor vascularization are largely unknown. We used genome-wide mRNA analysis in a cohort of 77 patients with PitNETs of different types to explore the differences in gene expression patterns between invasive and noninvasive tumors with respect to the parasellar growth and regarding the rare phenomenon of bone invasiveness. Additionally, we studied the genes correlated to the contrast enhancement quotient, a novel radiological parameter of tumor vascularization. Most of the genes differentially expressed related to the parasellar growth were genes involved in tumor invasiveness. Differentially expressed genes associated with bone invasiveness are involved in NF-\u03baB pathway and antitumoral immune response.

{"title": "BMP9 is a key player in endothelial identity and its loss is sufficient to induce arteriovenous malformations.", "abstract": "BMP9 is a high affinity ligand of ALK1 and endoglin receptors that are mutated in the rare genetic vascular disorder Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). We have previously shown that loss of Bmp9 in the 129/Ola genetic background leads to spontaneous liver fibrosis via capillarization of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and kidney lesions. We aimed to decipher the molecular mechanisms downstream of BMP9 to better characterize its role in vascular homeostasis in different organs.\nFor this, we performed a RNAseq analysis on LSEC from adult WT and Bmp9-KO mice and identified over 2000 differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology analysis showed that Bmp9 deletion led to a decrease in BMP and Notch signaling, but also LSEC capillary identity while increasing their cell cycle. The gene ontology term \"glomerulus development\" was also negatively enriched in Bmp9-KO mice versus WT supporting a role for BMP9 in kidney vascularization. Through different imaging approaches (electron microscopy, immunostainings), we found that loss of Bmp9 led to vascular enlargement of the glomeruli capillaries associated with alteration of podocytes. Importantly, we also showed for the first time that the loss of Bmp9 led to spontaneous arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the liver, gastro-intestinal tract and uterus.\nAltogether, these results demonstrate that BMP9 plays an important role in vascular quiescence both locally in the liver by regulating endothelial capillary differentiation markers and cell cycle but also at distance in many organs via its presence in the circulation. It also reveals that loss of Bmp9 is sufficient to induce spontaneous AVMs, supporting a key role for BMP9 in the pathogenesis of HHT.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2024-03-19", "authors": ["ADesroches-Castan", "DKoca", "HLiu", "CRoelants", "LResmini", "NRicard", "CBouvard", "NChaumontel", "P LTharaux", "ETillet", "CBattail", "OLenoir", "SBailly"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvae052"}

Consequently, recent research for myocardial infarction (MI) therapy has utilized hdECM with various delivery techniques, such as injection or patch implantation. In this study, a novel approach for hdECM delivery using a wet adhesive paintable hydrogel is proposed. The hdECM-containing paintable hydrogel (pdHA_t) is simply applied, with no theoretical limit to the size or shape, making it highly beneficial for scale-up. Additionally, pdHA_t exhibits robust adhesion to the epicardium, with a minimal swelling ratio and sufficient adhesion strength for MI treatment when applied to the rat MI model. Moreover, the adhesiveness of pdHA_t can be easily washed off to prevent undesired adhesion with nearby organs, such as the rib cages and lungs, which can result in stenosis. During the 28 days of in vivo analysis, the pdHA_t not only facilitates functional regeneration by reducing ventricular wall thinning but also promotes neo-vascularization in the MI region. In conclusion, the pdHA_t presents a promising strategy for MI treatment and cardiac tissue regeneration, offering the potential for improved patient outcomes and enhanced cardiac function post-MI.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2024-03-19", "authors": ["JaewooLee", "Seul-GiLee", "Beom-SeokKim", "ShinhyePark", "M NivedhithaSundaram", "Byung-GeeKim", "C-YoonKim", "Nathaniel SHwang"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202307353"}

{"title": "Cascaded controlled delivering growth factors to build vascularized and osteogenic microenvironment for bone regeneration.", "abstract": "The process of bone regeneration is intricately regulated by various cytokines at distinct stages. The establishment of early and efficient vascularization, along with the maintenance of a sustained osteoinductive microenvironment, plays a crucial role in the successful utilization of bone repair materials. This study aimed to develop a composite hydrogel that would facilitate the creation of an osteogenic microenvironment for bone repair. This was achieved by incorporating an early rapid release of VEGF and a sustained slow release of BMP-2. Herein, the Schiff base was formed between VEGF and the composite hydrogel, and VEGF could be rapidly released to promote vascularization in response to the early acidic bone injury microenvironment. Furthermore, the encapsulation of BMP-2 within mesoporous silica nanoparticles enabled a controlled and sustained release, thereby facilitating the process of bone repair. Our developed composite hydrogel released more than 80% of VEGF and BMP-2 in the acidic medium, which was significantly higher than that in the neutral medium (about 60%). Moreover, the composite hydrogel demonstrated a significant improvement in the migratory capacity and tube formation ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, the composite hydrogel exhibited an augmented ability for osteogenesis, as confirmed by the utilization of ALP staining, alizarin red staining, and the upregulation of osteogenesis-related genes. Notably, the composite hydrogel displayed substantial osteoinductive properties, compared with other groups, the skull defect in the composite hydrogels combined with BMP-2 and VEGF was full of new bone, basically completely repaired, and the BV/TV value was greater than 80%. The outcomes of animal experiments demonstrated that the composite hydrogel effectively promoted bone regeneration in cranial defects of rats by leveraging the synergistic effect of an early rapid release of VEGF and a sustained slow release of BMP-2, thereby facilitating vascularized bone regeneration.

Previously, we have demonstrated that recombinant human (rh)PRG4 treatment accelerates auricular cartilage injury closure through an inhibition of the fibrotic response, and promotion of tissue regeneration in mice. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of rhPRG4 treatment (vs. a DMSO carried control) on full-thickness skin wound healing in a preclinical porcine model. Our findings suggest that while rhPRG4 did not significantly accelerate nor impede full-thickness skin wound closure, it did improve repair quality by decreasing molecular markers of fibrosis and increasing re-vascularization. We also demonstrated that rhPRG4 treatment increased dermal adipose tissue during the healing process specifically by retaining adipocytes in the wound area but did not inhibit lipolysis. Overall, the results of the current study have demonstrated that rhPRG4 acts as antifibrotic agent and regulates dermal adipose tissue during the healing processes resulting in a tissue with a trajectory that more resembles the native skin vs. a fibrotic patch.

{"title": "Survivin in lung cancer: a potential target for therapy and prevention-a narrative review.", "abstract": "A versatile biomarker, survivin, is highly expressed in proliferating cells of multiple cancers in humans and animals. It is an apoptosis-regulating protein, engaging in a cascade of reactions that involve several other genes and protein interactions. Currently, researchers are investigating its therapeutic potential due to the evidence linking its overexpression to advanced-stage lung cancer. This review is centered around examining survivin-related molecular mechanisms and its therapeutic role specifically in lung cancer. Our objective is to discuss the role of survivin in prognosis and treatment response, shedding light on immune-targeted therapies, as well as outlining future directions for survivin-based vaccines in lung cancer.\nThe PubMed database and the United States National Library of Medicine search engine at the National Institutes of Health were searched on 24 August 2023 to identify published research studies.

After screening the title and abstracts and excluding the review articles 168 titles were shortlisted and full text studied. The discussions are added to relevant sections.\nSurvivin is a cell cycle-dependent, inhibitor of apoptosis protein that contributes to carcinogenesis, tumor vascularization, metastasis, and treatment resistance. Several treatments that impact survivin either directly or indirectly have been reported as effective in treating lung cancer. Immunity-based therapy, a novel approach known for its targeted nature and minimal side effects, is currently under investigation for lung cancer treatment. Emerging survivin-centered vaccines exhibit promising attributes in terms of safety, effectiveness, and ability to stimulate an immune response. These factors point towards a significant potential for advancing the future of lung cancer prevention and enhancing overall survival rates.\nNuclear survivin is a potential biomarker for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. It plays a role in determining drug responsiveness and is found to be significantly elevated in cases of resistance to chemotherapy. Multiple compounds and immunization strategies have been identified to impact lung cancer cells; however, they are currently in the early stages of phase I or phase II clinical trials.

Therefore, an intrinsic vascular study of this novel tissue engineering tool becomes essential to understand its efficacy and applicability.\n32 porcine long bones (humeri and femurs) were used to assess the quality of their vascular network prior and after undergoing a perfusion-decellularization protocol. 12 paired bones were used to assess the vascular matrix prior (N\u00a0=\u00a06) and after our protocol (N\u00a0=\u00a06) by immunohistochemistry.

All 12 underwent a contrast-agent injection through the nutrient artery prior an angio CT-scan acquisition. The images were processed and the length of medullary vessels filled with contrast agent were measured on angiographic cT images obtained in control and decellularized bones by 4 independent observers to evaluate the vascular network preservation. The microscopic cortical vascular network was evaluated on 8 bones: 4 control and 4 decellularized. After injection of gelatinous fluorochrome mixture (calcein green), non-decalcified fluoroscopic microscopy was performed in order to assess the perfusion quality of cortical vascular lacunae.\nThe continuity of the microscopic vascular network was assessed with Collagen IV immunohistochemistry (p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.805) while the decellularization quality was observed through CD31 and Von Willebrand factor immunohistochemistry (p-values <0.001). The macroscopic vascular network was severely impaired after perfusion-decellularization; nutrient arteries were still patent but the amount of medullary vascular channels measured was significantly higher in the control group compared to the decellularized group (p-value <0.001). On average, the observers show good agreement on these results, except in the decellularized group where more inter-observer discrepancies were observed. The microscopic vascular network was observed with green fluoroscopic signal in almost every canals and lacunae of the bone cortices, in three different bone locations (proximal metaphysis, diaphysis and distal metaphysis).\nDespite the aggressiveness of the decellularization protocol on medullary vessels, total porcine long bones decellularized by perfusion retain an acellular cortical microvascular network.

To achieve this, the specific composition of hepatic cells in a normal human liver was determined using a spatial proteogenomics dataset. The data and biomimetic hepatic micro-tissues with hexagonal hollow cross-sections indicate that cell information was successfully generated using a homemade 3D-imprinted device for layer-by-layer imprinting and assembling the hepatic cell sheets. By infiltrating vascular endothelial cells into the hollow section of the assembly, biomimetic hepatic microtissues with vascularized channels for nutrient diffusion and drug perfusion can be obtained. We demonstrate that the resultant vascularized biomimetic hepatic micro-tissues can not only be integrated into a microfluidic drug-screening liver-on-a-chip but also assembled into an enlarged physiological structure to promote liver regeneration. We believe that our 3D-imprinted cell sheets strategy will open new avenues for biomimetic microtissue construction.", "journal": "Science bulletin", "date": "2024-03-16", "authors": ["JinglinWang", "DanqingHuang", "HanxuChen", "YuanjinZhao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.scib.2024.02.030"}

Drag-reducing polymers, which have been previously studied as a potential therapy to reduce the pressure drop across the vascular bed, are evaluated for their effect on mitigating the disturbed flow. Polymer concentrations of 1000 ppm prevented recirculation and disturbed flow at the wall. Proteomic analysis of plasma collected from whole blood recirculated through the vascularized channel with and without drag-reducing polymers provides insight into the effects of flow regimes on levels of proteins indicative of the endothelial-blood interaction.

{"title": "Vasorin exocytosed from glioma cells facilitates angiogenesis via VEGFR2/AKT signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Glioma is a highly vascularized tumor of the central nervous system. Angiogenesis plays a predominant role in glioma progression and is considered an important therapeutic target. Our previous study showed that vasorin (VASN), a transmembrane protein, is overexpressed in glioma and promotes angiogenesis; however, the potential mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we found that human vascular endothelial cells (hECs) co-cultured with VASN-overexpressing glioma cells exhibited accelerated migration ability and increased expression of VASN originated from glioma cells. VASN was found in exosomes secreted by glioma cells and could be taken up by hECs. hECs showed more edge filopodia and significantly upregulated expression of endothelial tip cell marker gene and protein levels after co-culture with VASN-overexpressing glioma cells. In clinical glioma tissue and orthotopic transplantation glioma tissue, the vascular density and the number of vascular endothelial cells with a tip cell phenotype in VASN-overexpressed tissues were significantly higher than in tissues with low expression. At the molecular level, VASN interacted with VEGFR2 and caused internalization and autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 protein, and then activated the AKT signaling pathway. Our study collectively reveals the function and mechanism of VASN in facilitating angiogenesis in glioma, providing a new therapeutic target for glioma.

Fibroblasts can produce both ECM, physical support for maintaining homeostasis, and bioactive molecules, such as growth factors and cytokines. Endothelial cells can secrete growth factors and form vascular networks that enable the supply of nutrients and oxygen and remove metabolic products.\nIn this study, we focused on combining Human Periodontal Ligament Fibroblasts (HPLF) and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) for tissue regeneration in clinical applications.\nThe fibroblastic and angiogenic phenotypes were promoted in co-culture with HPLF and HUVEC at a ratio of 1:1 compared to HPLF or HUVEC mono-culture. The gene expression of ECM components and angiogenesis-related factors was also enhanced by HPLF/HUVEC co-culture. Despite an apparent increase in the expression of angiogenic factors, the levels of secreted growth factors decreased under co-culture conditions. These data suggest that ECM constructed by HPLF and HUVEC would act as a storage site for growth factors, which can later be released. Our results showed that cell-to-cell interactions between HPLF and HUVEC enhanced collagen synthesis and endothelial network formation, leading to the creation of highly vascularized constructs for periodontal tissue regeneration.\nSuccessful periodontal tissue regeneration requires microenvironmental reconstruction and vascularization, which can be achieved using a co-culture system. In the present study, we found that fibroblastic and angiogenic phenotypes were enhanced by the co-culture of HPLF and HUVEC.

{"title": "Biogenerated Oxygen-Related Environmental Stressed Apoptotic Vesicle Targets Endothelial Cells.", "abstract": "The dynamic balance between hypoxia and oxidative stress constitutes the oxygen-related microenvironment in injured tissues. Due to variability, oxygen homeostasis is usually not a therapeutic target for injured tissues. It is found that when administered intravenously, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and in vitro induced apoptotic vesicles (ApoVs) exhibit similar apoptotic markers in the wound microenvironment where hypoxia and oxidative stress co-existed, but MSCs exhibited better effects in promoting angiogenesis and wound healing. The derivation pathway of ApoVs by inducing hypoxia or oxidative stress in MSCs to simulate oxygen homeostasis in injured tissues is improved. Two types of oxygen-related environmental stressed ApoVs are identified that directly target endothelial cells (ECs) for the accurate regulation of vascularization. Compared to normoxic and hypoxic ones, oxidatively stressed ApoVs (Oxi-ApoVs) showed the strongest tube formation capacity. Different oxygen-stressed ApoVs deliver similar miRNAs, which leads to the broad upregulation of EC phosphokinase activity. Finally, local delivery of Oxi-ApoVs-loaded hydrogel microspheres promotes wound healing. Oxi-ApoV-loaded microspheres achieve controlled ApoV release, targeting ECs by reducing the consumption of inflammatory cells and adapting to the proliferative phase of wound healing. Thus, the biogenerated apoptotic vesicles responding to oxygen-related environmental stress can target ECs to promote vascularization.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2024-03-13", "authors": ["QiuyuZhao", "BolunLu", "ShutongQian", "JiayiMao", "LiuchengZhang", "YuguangZhang", "XiyuanMao", "WenguoCui", "XiaomingSun"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202306555"}

In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of a hybrid surface consisting of a brushite surface coating and cross-linked water-soluble eggshell membrane protein on the osseointegration of titanium (Ti) screws under in vivo conditions.\nTwenty Ti alloy screws were implanted monocortically in anteromedial regions of New Zealand rabbit tibiae.

All rabbits were sacrificed six weeks after the surgery. Peri-screw tissues were evaluated by micro-computed tomography (\u00b5-CT), histological and histomorphometrical methods.\nThe \u03bc-CT assessments indicated that the experimental group had significantly higher mean bone surface area (BSA) and trabeculae number (TbN) than those of the control group (p \u02c2 0.05). Bone surface area (BV), trabecular separation (TbSp), trabecular thickness (TbTh), and bone mineral density (BMD) scores of the control and experimental groups were quite similar (p > 0.05).

{"title": "BAP31 Promotes Angiogenesis via Galectin-3 Upregulation in Neuroblastoma.", "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the highly vascularized childhood solid tumors, and understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis in NB is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) has been implicated in tumor progression, but its role in angiogenesis remains unexplored. This study investigated BAP31 modulation of pro-angiogenic factors in SH-SY5Y NB cells. Through protein overexpression, knockdown, antibody blocking, and quantification experiments, we demonstrated that overexpression of BAP31 led to increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and Galectin-3 (GAL-3), which are known to promote angiogenesis. Conditioned medium derived from BAP31-overexpressing neuroblastoma cells stimulated migration and tube formation in endothelial cells, indicating its pro-angiogenic properties. Also, we demonstrated that BAP31 enhances capillary tube formation by regulating hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) and its downstream target, GAL-3. Furthermore, GAL-3 downstream proteins, Jagged 1 and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), were up-regulated, and blocking GAL-3 partially inhibited the BAP31-induced tube formation. These findings suggest that BAP31 promotes angiogenesis in NB by modulating GAL-3 and VEGF signaling, thereby shaping the tumor microenvironment.

NB exhibits cellular heterogeneity, with adrenergic and mesenchymal states displaying distinct tumorigenic potentials. NB is highly vascularized, and blood vessels can form through various mechanisms, including endothelial transdifferentiation, leading to the development of tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs) associated with chemoresistance. We lack specific biomarkers for TECs. Therefore, identifying new TEC biomarkers is vital for effective NB therapies. A stiffness-based platform simulating human arterial and venous stiffness was developed to study NB TECs in vitro. Adrenergic cells cultured on arterial-like stiffness transdifferentiated into TECs, while mesenchymal state cells did not. The TECs derived from adrenergic cells served as a model to explore new biomarkers, with a particular focus on GB3, a glycosphingolipid receptor implicated in angiogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. Notably, the TECs unequivocally expressed GB3, validating its novelty as a marker. To explore targeted therapeutic interventions, nanoparticles functionalized with the non-toxic subunit B of the Shiga toxin were generated, because they demonstrated a robust affinity for GB3-positive cells.

However, several factors hamper a widespread application and long-term success: chronic hypoxia, an inappropriate microenvironment and suppression of regenerative and proliferative potential by high local levels of immunosuppressive agents. Therefore, the identification of alternative and superior transplant sites is of major scientific and clinical interest. Here, we aim to evaluate the adrenal as an alternative transplantation site. The adrenal features a particular microenvironment with extensive vascularization, anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. To validate this novel transplantation site, an in vitro co-culture system of adrenal cells and pancreatic islets was established and viability, islet survival, functional potency and antioxidative defense capacity were evaluated. For in vivo validation, an immune-deficient diabetic mouse model for intra-adrenal islet transplantation was applied. The functional capacity of intra-adrenally grafted islets to reverse diabetes was compared to a standard islet transplant model and measures of engraftment such as vascular integration were evaluated. The presence of adrenal cells positively impacted on cell metabolism and oxidative stress. Following transplantation, we could demonstrate enhanced islet function in comparison to standard models with improved engraftment and superior re-vascularization. This experimental approach allows for novel insights into the interaction of endocrine systems and may open up novel strategies for islet transplantation augmented through the bystander effect of other endocrine cells or the active factors secreted by adrenal cells modulating the microenvironment.", "journal": "Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme", "date": "2024-03-13", "authors": ["UndineSchubert", "SusannLehmann", "JanineSchmid", "HenningMorawietz", "Stefan RBornstein", "BarbaraLudwig"], "doi": "10.1055/a-2256-6344"}

Bony exposure of the anterior palate subjects the maxilla to scarring and growth restriction, while scar contracture of the posterior void may result in velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and fistula formation. Utilization of the buccal fat pad flap (BFPF) at the time of palatoplasty provides vascularized tissue over these critical areas, thereby reducing the rate of secondary surgery for speech and fistula revision.\nA single-center, retrospective review identified patients who underwent palatoplasty with or without BFPF between 1995-2015. Data collected included cleft type, surgical technique, follow-up duration, and complications. Outcomes included rate of speech surgery and palatal fistula development. Veau phenotype index was computed on a scale of 2-4 as a weighted mean to reflect the frequency of cleft type (Veau II-IV) in BFPF and non-BFPF groups.\nCharts of 866 patients were reviewed; 212 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 101 received a BFPF. Mean follow-up duration was 11.4 years. Despite a selection bias for more severe clefts, the BFPF group had lower incidence of speech surgery (9.9% vs. 36.9%, p=0.0072). The BFPF group had more mild cases treatable with fat injection (7.9% vs. 2.7%, p=0.0346) and developed fewer fistulas (6.9% vs. 18.0%, p=0.0280).\nDespite the presence of more severe clefts, the BFPF group had a significantly lower rate of speech surgery.

However, capsular contracture can pose both aesthetic and clinical challenges.\nTo analyze the biological and morphological characteristics of the capsular tissue surrounding PU-coated implants, irrespective of their contracture status, and to assess their potential suitability as a flap in revision breast surgery for capsular contracture.\nA total of 23 tissue samples were harvested from the capsules surrounding PU-coated breast implants in 12 female patients during replacement or revision surgery. We evaluated collagen abundance, cellular and vascular density, inflammation, collagen band types and alignment, synovial metaplasia, capsule thickness, and the expression of inflammatory biomarkers and myofibroblasts using immunohistochemical techniques. Scanning electron microscopy was used to assess implant surface characteristics over time.\nWe found a significant association of capsule contraction with longer implantation durations and greater implant surface roughness (p\u2009=\u20090.018 and p\u2009=\u20090.033, respectively). Synovial metaplasia was significantly more frequent in noncontracted capsules (p\u2009=\u20090.0049). Both capsule types consisted of paucicellular, type I collagen-rich compact fibrous tissue with low vascularization. There was a marked reduction in inflammatory cells within the foreign body granuloma. The expression of inflammatory biomarkers in the capsular tissue was negligible.\nGiven the reduced levels of inflammatory and vascular components within the dense, fibrous capsular tissue, we consider them to be viable alternatives for use as capsular flaps in revision surgery.

As microvessels can be easily identified in histologic specimens, quantification of microvascularity can be used alone or in combination with other histological features to increase the understanding of the dynamic behavior, diagnosis, and prognosis of brain tumors. Different brain tumors, and even subtypes of the same tumor, show specific microvascular patterns, as a kind of \"microvascular fingerprint,\" which is particular to each histotype. Reliable morphometric parameters are required for the qualitative and quantitative characterization of the neoplastic angioarchitecture, although the lack of standardization of a technique able to quantify the microvascular patterns in an objective way has limited the \"morphometric approach\" in neuro-oncology.In this chapter, we focus on the importance of computational-based morphometrics, for the objective description of tumoral microvascular fingerprinting. By also introducing the concept of \"angio-space,\" which is the tumoral space occupied by the microvessels, we here present fractal analysis as the most reliable computational tool able to offer objective parameters for the description of the microvascular networks.The spectrum of different angioarchitectural configurations can be quantified by means of Euclidean and fractal-based parameters in a multiparametric analysis, aimed to offer surrogate biomarkers of cancer.

The inability of injured sensory axons to re-enter the spinal cord results in permanent loss of sensation, and often also leads to the development of neuropathic pain. Approaches that restore connection between peripheral sensory axons and their CNS targets are thus urgently need. Previous research has shown that sensory axons from peripherally grafted human sensory neurons are able to enter the spinal cord by growing along BVs which penetrate the CNS from the spinal cord surface. In this study we analysed the distribution of BVs after avulsion injury and how their pattern is affected by implantation at the injury site of boundary cap neural crest stem cells (bNCSCs), a transient cluster of cells, which are located at the boundary between the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system and assist the growth of sensory axons from periphery into the spinal cord during development. The superficial dorsal spinal cord vasculature was examined using intravital microscopy and intravascular BV labelling. bNCSC transplantation increased vascular volume in a non-dose responsive manner, whereas dorsal root avulsion alone did not decrease the vascular volume. To determine whether bNCSC are endowed with angiogenic properties we prepared 3D printed scaffolds, containing bNCSCs together with rings prepared from mouse aorta. We show that bNCSC do induce migration and assembly of endothelial cells in this system. These findings suggest that bNCSC transplant can promote vascularization in vivo and contribute to BV formation in 3D printed scaffolds.", "journal": "Neuroscience letters", "date": "2024-03-12", "authors": ["CarlTrolle", "YilinHan", "Shivaprakash JagalurMutt", "GustafChristoffersson", "Elena NKozlova"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neulet.2024.137724"}

{"title": "The Dysregulated IL-23/TH17 Axis in Endometriosis Pathophysiology.", "abstract": "Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which endometrial-like tissue grows ectopically, resulting in pelvic pain and infertility. IL-23 is a key contributor in the development and differentiation of TH17 cells, driving TH17 cells toward a pathogenic profile. In a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, TH17 cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, contributing to disease pathophysiology. Our studies and others have implicated IL-17 and TH17 cell dysregulation in endometriosis, which is associated with disease severity. In this article, we address whether IL-23-driven TH17 cells contribute to cardinal features of lesion proliferation, vascularization, and inflammation in endometriosis using patient samples, representative cell lines, and our established mouse model of endometriosis. The results indicated dysregulated expression of key genes in the IL-23/TH17 axis in patient ectopic and eutopic endometrial samples and increased IL-23 protein in patient plasma compared with controls. In vitro studies using primary human TH cells determined that rIL-23 mixture treatment increased pathogenic TH17 cell frequency. Similarly, rIL-23 treatment of cell lines (12Z cells, EECCs, HUVECs, and hESCs) representative of the endometriotic lesion microenvironment increased cytokines and growth factors, which play a role in lesion establishment and maintenance. In a syngeneic mouse model of endometriosis, rIL-23 treatment altered numbers of myeloid and T cell subsets in peritoneal fluid and increased giant cells within the lesion. Lesions from rIL-23-treated mice did not reveal significant alterations in proliferation/vascularization, although trends of increased proliferation and vascularization were observed. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the impact of the IL-23/TH17 axis on local immune dysfunction and broadly on endometriosis pathophysiology.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2024-03-11", "authors": ["Danielle JSisnett", "Katherine BZutautas", "Jessica EMiller", "HarshavardhanLingegowda", "Soo HyunAhn", "AlisonMcCallion", "OlgaBougie", "Bruce ALessey", "ChandrakantTayade"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.2400018"}
{"title": "A Swine Burn Model for Investigating the Healing Process in Multiple Depth Burn Wounds.", "abstract": "Burn wound healing is a complex and long process. Despite extensive experience, plastic surgeons and specialized teams in burn centers still face significant challenges. Among these challenges, the extent of the burned soft tissue can evolve in the early phase, creating a delicate balance between conservative treatments and necrosing tissue removal. Thermal burns are the most common type, and burn depth varies depending on multiple parameters, such as temperature and exposure time. Burn depth also varies in time, and the secondary aggravation of the \"shadow zone\" remains a poorly understood phenomenon. In response to these challenges, several innovative treatments have been studied, and more are in the early development phase. Nanoparticles in modern wound dressings and artificial skin are examples of these modern therapies still under evaluation. Taken together, both burn diagnosis and burn treatments need substantial advancements, and research teams need a reliable and relevant model to test new tools and therapies. Among animal models, swine are the most relevant because of their strong similarities in skin structure with humans. More specifically, Yucatan minipigs show interesting features such as melanin pigmentation and slow growth, allowing for studying high phototypes and long-term healing.

These features can be used in biological anthropology and archaeology to investigate the morphology of the vascular network in extinct species and past populations. Generally, the term refers to macrovascular features of the endocranial cavity, like those associated with the middle meningeal artery, venous sinuses, emissary foramina, and diploic channels. However, small vascular passages (here called microforamina or microchannels) have been occasionally described on the endocranial surface. The larger ones (generally with a diameter between 0.5 and 2.0\u2009mm) can be detected through medical scanners on osteological collections. In this study, we describe and quantify the number and distribution of these microforamina in adult humans (N\u2009=\u200945) and, preliminarily, in a small sample of children (N\u2009=\u20097). Adults display more microchannels than juvenile skulls. A higher frequency in females is also observed, although this result is not statistically significant and might be associated with allometric cranial variations. The distribution of the microforamina is particularly concentrated on the top of the vault, in particular along the sagittal, metopic, and coronal sutures, matching the course of major venous sinuses and parasagittal bridging veins.

Modular tissue engineering approaches have promise in this application because of the ability to combine tissue types and to localize microenvironmental cues to drive desired cell function. In direct bone formation approaches, it is challenging to maintain sustained osteogenic activity, since vasculogenic cues can inhibit tissue mineralization. This study harnessed the physiological process of endochondral ossification to create multiphase tissues that allowed concomitant mineralization and vessel formation. Mesenchymal stromal cells in pellet culture were differentiated toward a cartilage phenotype, followed by induction to chondrocyte hypertrophy. Hypertrophic pellets exhibited increased alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium deposition, and osteogenic gene expression relative to chondrogenic pellets. In addition, hypertrophic pellets secreted and sequestered angiogenic factors, and supported new blood vessel formation by co-cultured endothelial cells and undifferentiated stromal cells. Multiphase constructs created by combining hypertrophic pellets and vascularizing microtissues and maintained in unsupplemented basal culture medium were shown to support robust vascularization and sustained tissue mineralization.

Despite advances in 3D-bioprinting, the fabrication of structures with void spaces and channels remains challenging. This study presents a novel approach to create robust yet flexible and permeable small (600-1300\u00a0\u03bcm) artificial vessels in a single processing step using 3D coaxial extrusion printing of a biomaterial ink, based on tyramine-modified polyethylene glycol (PEG-Tyr).

Chemical characterization using NMR and FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the successful modification of PEG with Tyr and rheological characterization indicated that the addition of PEG-Tyr decreased the viscosity of the ink. Enzyme-mediated crosslinking of PEG-Tyr allowed the formation of covalent crosslinks within the hydrogel chains, ensuring its stability. PEG-Tyr units improved the mechanical properties of the material, resulting in stretchable and elastic constructs without compromising cell viability and adhesion.

This cohort represents the largest reported series of epiphyseal transfer for hip reconstruction following septic necrosis in children.\nA total of 18 patients with an average age at surgery of 5.4 years were included.

Longitudinal growth averaged 7.3\u00a0mm/year, and the physis width increased by an average of 2.7\u00a0mm/year. The rate of longitudinal growth was fastest after the age of 10 years (18.5\u00a0mm/y), which coincides with the pubertal growth spurt. All successful transfers had an open growth plate on final follow-up radiographs. Ten patients had limb length discrepancy of an average 2.8\u00a0cm (range 1 to 8\u00a0cm).

Nanomaterials constructed based on specific goals can be employed to activate endogenous growth factor-related signaling. In this study, based on the conventional single-stranded DNA self-assembly into tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs), the Apt02 nucleic acid aptamer and dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG) small molecule are integrated into a complex via a template-based click chemistry reaction and toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction. Thus, being able to simulate the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) function and stabilize HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor), a functional whole is constructed and applied to angiogenesis. Cellular studies demonstrate that the tFNAs-Apt02 complex (TAC) has a conspicuous affinity to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Further incubation with DMOG yields the tFNAs-Apt02-DMOG complex (TACD), which promotes VEGF secretion, in vitro blood vessel formation, sprouting, and migration of HUVECs. Additionally, TACD enhances angiogenesis by upregulating the VEGF/VEGFR and HIF signaling pathways. Moreover, in a diabetic mouse skin defect repair process, TACD increases blood vessel formation and collagen deposition, therefore accelerating wound healing.

The demyelinated lesion is a cardinal feature. The well-characterised anatomy of the spinal cord and new analytic approaches allows the systematic study of lesion topography and its extent of inflammatory activity unveiling new insights into disease pathogenesis. We studied cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord tissue from 119 pathologically confirmed multiple sclerosis cases. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect demyelination (PLP) and classify lesional inflammatory activity (CD68). Prevalence and distribution of demyelination, staged by lesion activity, was determined and topographical maps were created to identify patterns of lesion prevalence and distribution using mixed models and permutation-based voxelwise analysis. 460 lesions were observed throughout the spinal cord with 76.5% of cases demonstrating at least 1 lesion. The cervical level was preferentially affected by lesions. 58.3% of lesions were inflammatory with 87.9% of cases harbouring at least 1 inflammatory lesion. Topographically, lesions consistently affected the dorsal and lateral columns with relative sparing of subpial areas in a distribution mirroring the vascular network. The presence of spinal cord lesions and the proportion of active lesions related strongly with clinical disease milestones, including time from onset to wheelchair and onset to death. We demonstrate that spinal cord demyelination is common, highly inflammatory, has a predilection for the cervical level, and relates to clinical disability. The topography of lesions in the dorsal and lateral columns and relative sparing of subpial areas points to a role of the vasculature in lesion pathogenesis, suggesting short-range cell infiltration from the blood and signaling molecules circulating in the perivascular space incite lesion development. These findings challenge the notion that end-stage progressive multiple sclerosis is 'burnt out' and an outside-in lesional gradient predominates in the spinal cord.

Current therapies are inadequate for brittle diabetics, necessitating pancreatic islet transplants, which however, introduces its own set of challenges such as paucity of donors, rigorous immunosuppression and autoimmune rejection. Organoid technology represents a significant stride in the field of regenerative medicine and bypasses donor-based approaches. Hence this article focuses on strategies enhancing the in vivo engraftment of islet organoids (IOs), namely vascularization, encapsulation, immune evasion, alternative extra-hepatic transplant sites and 3D bioprinting. Hypoxia-induced necrosis and delayed revascularization attenuate organoid viability and functional capacity, alleviated by the integration of diverse cell types e.g., human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to boost vascularization. Encapsulation with biocompatible materials and genetic modifications counters immune damage, while extra-hepatic sites avoid surgical complications and immediate blood-mediated inflammatory reactions (IBMIR). Customizable 3D bioprinting may help augment the viability and functionality of IOs. While the clinical translation of IOs faces hurdles, preliminary results show promise.

Here, we report the initial clinical outcomes of utilizing host corneal buttons derived from optical penetrating keratoplasties of pseudophakic bullous keratoplasty (PBK) patients. Two patients presented to our department with a perforated fungal corneal ulcer in one eye during the COVID-19 pandemic. One eye of each of the patients was operated on with non-vascularized host cut tissues preserved in glycerin. The tissues were secured using 10-0 nylon sutures. Good anatomical integrity was achieved in both eyes. An optical penetrating keratoplasty (PK) was done in both eyes after one year for visual rehabilitation, with a final visual acuity of 20/120 and\u00a020/80, respectively, at six months. In conclusion, therapeutic PK using host tissues obtained from the recipients of optical PK is a safe and effective option to restore ocular integrity during a shortage of fresh or glycerol-preserved corneas.

{"title": "UV light-mediated corneal crosslinking as (lymph)angioregressive pretreatment to promote graft survival after subsequent high-risk corneal transplantation (CrossCornealVision): protocol for a multicenter, randomized controlled trial.", "abstract": "Good vision highly depends on the transparency of the cornea, which is the \"windscreen\" of the eye. In fact, corneal blindness due to transparency loss is the second most common cause of blindness worldwide, and corneal transplantation is the main cure. Importantly, the cornea is normally avascular but can secondarily be invaded by pathological (blood and lymphatic) vessels due to severe inflammation, and the survival prognosis of a corneal graft mainly depends on the preoperative vascular condition of the recipient's cornea. Whereas transplants placed into avascular recipient beds enjoy long-term survival rates of > 90%, survival rates significantly decrease in pathologically pre-vascularized, so-called high-risk recipients, which account for around 10% of all performed transplants in Germany and > 75% in lower and middle-income countries worldwide.\nThis parallel-grouped, open-randomized, multicenter, prospective controlled exploratory investigator-initiated trial (IIT) intends to improve graft survival by preconditioning pathologically vascularized recipient corneas by (lymph)angioregressive treatment before high-risk corneal\u00a0transplantation. For this purpose, corneal crosslinking (CXL) will be used, which has been shown to potently regress corneal blood and lymphatic vessels. Prior to transplantation, patients will be randomized into 2 groups: (1) CXL (intervention) or (2) no pretreatment (control). CXL will be repeated once if insufficient reduction of corneal neovascularization should be observed. All patients (both groups) will then undergo corneal transplantation. In the intervention group, remaining blood vessels will be additionally regressed using fine needle diathermy (on the day of transplantation). Afterwards, the incidence of graft rejection episodes will be evaluated for 24 months (primary endpoint). Overall graft survival, as well as regression of corneal vessels and/or recurrence, among other factors, will be analyzed (secondary endpoints).\nBased on preclinical and early pilot clinical evidence, we want to test the novel concept of temporary (lymph)angioregressive pretreatment of high-risk eyes by CXL to promote subsequent corneal graft survival. So far, there is no evidence-based approach to reliably improve graft survival in the high-risk corneal transplantation setting available in clinical routine. If successful, this approach will be the first to promote graft survival in high-risk transplants. It will significantly improve vision and quality of life in patients suffering from corneal blindness.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT05870566.

These limitations hinder their survival and regenerative effects after transplantation. Another significant concern is the reliance on mouse tumor-derived matrix in organoid culture, which is unsuitable for clinical translation due to its tumor origin and safety issues.

Microvascular disease (MVD) is a diabetic complication, but also associated with other diseases, for example chronic kidney disease.

They are applied in various fields including drug screening, gene editing, and identification of oncogenes. However, CAR-T therapy in the treatment of solid tumours is still at an exploratory stage. Tumour organoids offer unique advantages over other preclinical models commonly used for CAR-T therapy research, which the preservation of the biological characteristics of primary tumour tissue is critical for the study of early-stage solid tumour CAR-T therapies. Although some investigators have used this co-culture model to validate newly targeted CAR-T cells, optimise existing CAR-T cells and explore combination therapy strategies, there is still untapped potential in the co-culture models used today. This review introduces the current status of the application of tumour organoid and CAR-T cell co-culture models in recent years and commented on the limitations of the current co-cultivation model. Meanwhile, we compared the tumour organoid model with two pre-clinical models commonly used in CAR-T therapy research. Eventually, combined with the new progress of organoid technologies, optimization suggestions were proposed for the co-culture model from five perspectives: preserving or reconstructing the tumor microenvironment, systematization, vascularization, standardized culture procedures, and expanding the tumor organoids resource library, aimed at assisting related researchers to better utilize co-culture models.", "journal": "Cancer cell international", "date": "2024-03-06", "authors": ["Rong-XuanNing", "Cun-YuLiu", "Shi-QiWang", "Wen-KaiLi", "XiaKong", "Zhi-WeiHe"], "doi": "10.1186/s12935-024-03272-x\n10.1053/j.gastro.2011.07.050\n10.1038/s41568-018-0007-6\n10.1038/nm.4441\n10.1056/NEJMoa1707447\n10.1056/NEJMoa1817226\n10.1186/s12943-023-01723-z\n10.1126/science.1247125\n10.1038/nature14415\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.12.009\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.04.003\n10.1038/nature07935\n10.1038/s41596-020-0402-9\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2021.01.021\n10.15252/embj.2018100928\n10.1002/cti2.1248\n10.7150/ijbs.34213\n10.1186/s13046-022-02479-y\n10.1038/s41467-022-29647-0\n10.3389/fonc.2021.664236\n10.1007/s00262-022-03195-4\n10.1002/cac2.12452\n10.1016/j.omto.2022.11.004\n10.1016/j.ccell.2023.02.016\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.07.009\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.11.021\n10.1038/s41568-018-0104-6\n10.3322/caac.21596\n10.1016/j.blre.2018.11.002\n10.1126/sciadv.adf3700\n10.1016/j.coph.2021.08.008\n10.1038/s41598-017-08879-x\n10.1007/s10456-022-09863-4\n10.1038/nm.3737\n10.7554/eLife.76707\n10.1038/s41592-019-0586-5\n10.1039/D2LC01109C\n10.1093/jnci/djz196\n10.1186/s13046-020-1523-2\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-1376\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.08.016\n10.1038/s41587-019-0048-8\n10.15252/embj.2018100300\n10.3389/fimmu.2022.1061388\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2022.07.016\n10.1186/s12943-020-01288-1\n10.1016/S0140-6736(23)00023-5\n10.1038/s41591-022-02017-5\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2022.07.011\n10.3389/fcell.2021.745897"}

To overcome this challenge, branched channels were created in the porous \u03b2-TCP scaffold by using 3D printing and a template-casting method to facilitate the instant flow of blood supply. Human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded in the channeled porous scaffolds and characterized through a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay, and cell migration. Channeled porous \u03b2-TCP scaffolds were then implanted in the subcutaneous pockets of mice. Histological staining and immunohistochemical staining on vascularization and bone-related markers were carried out on the embedded paraffin sections. Results from in vitro experiments showed that branched channels significantly promoted HUVECs' infiltration, migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis, and also promoted the proliferation and osteogenesis differentiation of hBMSCs. In vivo implantation results showed that, in the early stage after implantation, cells significantly migrated into branched channeled scaffolds. More matured blood vessels formed in the branched channeled scaffolds compared to that in nonchanneled and straight channeled scaffolds. Beside promoting vascularization, the branched channels also stimulated the infiltration of bone-related cells into the scaffolds. These results suggested that the geometric design of branched channels in the porous \u03b2-TCP scaffold promoted rapid vascularization and potentially stimulated bone cells recruitment.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2024-03-05", "authors": ["EnzeQian", "YunqingKang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.3c17328"}

As a chronic and progressive disease, affected patients will require life-long therapy centered on compression. Although conventional compressive treatments can be effective, they are extremely burdensome and time-consuming for most patients and adherence is challenging. With advances in the field of reconstructive microsurgery, new procedures have been developed in the past decades to help these patients in their continuous care and have been offered at many oncological centers around the world as a first line of treatment. We performed a PubMed search using the Mesh terms 'Lymphedema/surgery' and 'Lower extremity' yielding a total of 508 articles. Of these, 35 articles were included for analysis. Articles that failed to provide a comprehensive analysis of outcomes following surgical treatment, studies examining treatment for upper limb lymphedema, primary lymphedema, or lower extremity lymphedema resulting from non-gynecologic etiologies, and studies that failed to have a minimum of 6 months follow-up were excluded. A comprehensive review of these 35 articles including over 1200 patients demonstrated large variability on the outcomes reported; however, an overall benefit from these procedures was found.

The CAM is a richly vascularized extraembryonic membrane, which shows limited immunoreactivity, thus becoming an excellent hosting model for human origin cell transplants. This paper describes the strategy to engraft human brain organoids differentiated at multiple maturation stages into the CAM. The cellular composition of brain organoids changes with time, reflecting the milestones of human brain development. We grafted brain organoids at relevant maturation stages: neuroepithelial expansion (18 DIV), early neurogenesis (60 DIV), and early gliogenesis (180 DIV) into the CAM of embryonic day (E)7 chicken embryos. Engrafted brain organoids were harvested 5 days later and their histological features were analyzed. No histological signs of neovascularization in the grafted organoids or abnormal blood vessels adjacent to the graftings were detected. Moreover, remarkable changes were observed in the cellular composition of the grafted organoids, namely, an increase in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive-reactive astrocytes. However, the cytoarchitectural changes were dependent on the organoid maturation stage. Altogether, these results suggest that brain organoids can grow in the CAM, and they show differences in the cytoarchitecture depending on their maturation stage at grafting.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2024-03-04", "authors": ["LucianoFiore", "JanArderiu", "AndreaMart\u00ed-Sarrias", "IsabelTurp\u00edn", "Ruth IPareja", "ArcadiNavarro", "MarianaHolubiec", "JulietaBianchelli", "TomasFalzone", "GonzaloSpelzini", "GabrielScicolone", "SandraAcosta"], "doi": "10.3791/65710"}

First, we prepared a chitin whisker/chitosan polysaccharide LC precursor, and then infuse it into the pores of 3D printed PLLA scaffold, which was previously surface modified with a polydopamine layer. Next, the LC precursor was chemical cross-linked by genipin to form a hydrogel network with bone-like ECM viscoelasticity and LC phase in the scaffold. Subsequently, we performed directional freeze-casting on the composite scaffold to create oriented channels in the LC hydrogel.

{"title": "Lymphadenopathy and lymph node rejection following facial vascularized composite allotransplantation.", "abstract": "Apart from the skin, little is known about the immunological processes in deeper tissues, which are typically not accessible to biopsy and inspection, of vascularized composite allografts (VCAs). Face transplant patients develop prominent adenopathy shortly after transplantation that resolves over time. The mechanisms underlying this process are not understood.\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted on 9 patients who underwent 10 facial VCAs at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, between April 2009 and July 2019. Clinical, radiological, and histological data related to lymphadenopathy of the head and neck were reviewed.\nPatients who received donor-derived lymph nodes (LNs) developed bilateral lymphadenopathy of the submental or submandibular superficial LNs. Median time of presentation was POD18 (range POD6-POM3). Notably, bilateral adenopathy of the neck was not observed in later stages of follow-up (mean follow-up, 115 months). Histology of 3 LNs showed increased histiocytes and apoptosis, with the features reminiscent of necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, and B and T lymphocytes (mostly CD8\u00a0+ T) admixed with CD163\u00a0+\u00a0histiocytes and dendritic cells. Molecular chimerism analysis in one case showed the coexistence of donor (81%) and recipient (19%) derived lymphocytes. Granzyme B (GZMB) expression confirmed the presence of increased cytotoxic T cells in this LN sample.\nOur data suggested the involvement of an immunological process within the donor-derived LNs after facial allotransplantation between the recipient and donor cells. GZMB expression suggested LN rejection that can occurred independently of skin rejection.

Loss of renal function after PN is influenced by medical comorbidities/preoperative renal function and surgical variables such volume of parenchyma preserved and ischemia time. Urologists should select the clamping strategy during PN based on their experience and patient-specific factors.

{"title": "Tumor-immune metaphenotypes orchestrate an evolutionary bottleneck that promotes metabolic transformation.", "abstract": "Metabolism plays a complex role in the evolution of cancerous tumors, including inducing a multifaceted effect on the immune system to aid immune escape. Immune escape is, by definition, a collective phenomenon by requiring the presence of two cell types interacting in close proximity: tumor and immune. The microenvironmental context of these interactions is influenced by the dynamic process of blood vessel growth and remodelling, creating heterogeneous patches of well-vascularized tumor or acidic niches.\nHere, we present a multiscale mathematical model that captures the phenotypic, vascular, microenvironmental, and spatial heterogeneity which shapes acid-mediated invasion and immune escape over a biologically-realistic time scale. The model explores several immune escape mechanisms such as i) acid inactivation of immune cells, ii) competition for glucose, and iii) inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor expression (PD-L1). We also explore the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 and sodium bicarbonate buffer agents for treatment. To aid in understanding immune escape as a collective cellular phenomenon, we define immune escape in the context of six collective phenotypes (termed \"meta-phenotypes\"): Self-Acidify, Mooch Acid, PD-L1 Attack, Mooch PD-L1, Proliferate Fast, and Starve Glucose.\nFomenting a stronger immune response leads to initial benefits (additional cytotoxicity), but this advantage is offset by increased cell turnover that leads to accelerated evolution and the emergence of aggressive phenotypes. This creates a bimodal therapy landscape: either the immune system should be maximized for complete cure, or kept in check to avoid rapid evolution of invasive cells. These constraints are dependent on heterogeneity in vascular context, microenvironmental acidification, and the strength of immune response.\nThis model helps to untangle the key constraints on evolutionary costs and benefits of three key phenotypic axes on tumor invasion and treatment: acid-resistance, glycolysis, and PD-L1 expression. The benefits of concomitant anti-PD-L1 and buffer treatments is a promising treatment strategy to limit the adverse effects of immune escape.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2024-03-01", "authors": ["JeffreyWest", "FrederikaRentzeperis", "CaseyAdam", "RafaelBravo", "Kimberly ALuddy", "MarkRobertson-Tessi", "Alexander R AAnderson"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2024.1323319\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1428\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-2844\n10.1073/pnas.2011342118\n10.1111/imr.12858\n10.1038/s41423-021-00783-9\n10.1007/s002850050127\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0564\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.08.002\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.10.027\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.06.009\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.03.002\n10.3390/pr7010037\n10.1038/s41416-019-0542-2\n10.4049/jimmunol.170.3.1257\n10.1038/s41416-020-01232-6\n10.1038/s41586-019-1330-0\n10.1038/s41467-020-17756-7\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1743\n10.1007/s10585-011-9415-7\n10.2217/pme.14.57\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007635\n10.1093/imammb/dqi005\n10.1186/s12859-019-3173-y\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.88\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.03.025\n10.1126/science.aaw7875\n10.4172/2155-9600.1000685\n10.1073/pnas.1919764117\n10.1038/s41568-018-0083-7\n10.1038/s41592-020-01033-y\n10.1016/j.tcb.2022.10.006\n10.1038/s41568-023-00610-5\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2023.01.004"}
{"title": "The SGLT2 inhibitor Empagliflozin promotes post-stroke functional recovery in diabetic mice.", "abstract": "Type-2 diabetes (T2D) worsens stroke recovery, amplifying post-stroke disabilities. Currently, there are no therapies targeting this important clinical problem. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are potent anti-diabetic drugs that also efficiently reduce cardiovascular death and heart failure. In addition, SGLT2i facilitate several processes implicated in stroke recovery. However, the potential efficacy of SGLT2i to improve stroke recovery in T2D has not been investigated. Therefore, we determined whether a post-stroke intervention with the SGLT2i Empagliflozin could improve stroke recovery in T2D mice. T2D was induced in C57BL6J mice by 8\u00a0months of high-fat diet feeding. Hereafter, animals were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and treated with vehicle or the SGLTi Empagliflozin (10\u00a0mg/kg/day) starting from 3\u00a0days after stroke. A similar study in non diabetic mice was also conducted. Stroke recovery was assessed using the forepaw grip strength test. To identify potential mechanisms involved in the Empagliflozin-mediated effects, several metabolic parameters were assessed. Additionally, neuronal survival, neuroinflammation, neurogenesis and cerebral vascularization were analyzed using immunohistochemistry/quantitative microscopy. Empagliflozin significantly improved stroke recovery in T2D but not in non-diabetic mice. Improvement of functional recovery was associated with lowered glycemia, increased serum levels of fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21), and the normalization of T2D-induced aberration of parenchymal pericyte density. The global T2D-epidemic and the fact that T2D is a major risk factor for stroke are drastically increasing the number of people in need of efficacious therapies to improve stroke recovery. Our data provide a strong incentive for the potential use of SGLT2i for the treatment of post-stroke sequelae in T2D.", "journal": "Cardiovascular diabetology", "date": "2024-03-01", "authors": ["EllenVercalsteren", "DimitraKarampatsi", "CarolinaBuizza", "ThomasNystr\u00f6m", "ThomasKlein", "GesinePaul", "CesarePatrone", "VladimerDarsalia"], "doi": "10.1186/s12933-024-02174-6\n10.1016/S1474-4422(21)00252-0\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehy033\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.621649\n10.4239/wjd.v5.i6.939\n10.1161/01.STR.0000057975.15221.40\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.006538\n10.1016/S1474-4422(12)70005-4\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.027557\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.121.038151\n10.1136/svn-2017-000130\n10.1016/j.numecd.2017.12.010\n10.1161/01.STR.0000085087.41330.FF\n10.1159/000223436\n10.1001/jama.2019.9346\n10.1111/bph.15524\n10.2337/db20-0095\n10.1111/dom.12578\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166125\n10.1016/j.diabet.2018.09.005\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.05.028\n10.1016/S2213-8587(14)70120-2\n10.1016/j.jash.2014.02.003\n10.1186/s12933-017-0510-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.029529\n10.1038/s41569-020-0406-8\n10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00536-5\n10.1056/NEJMoa1504720\n10.1007/s00125-022-05787-2\n10.1038/s42003-022-03605-4\n10.1186/s12933-014-0148-1\n10.1530/JOE-17-0263\n10.1186/s13195-020-00607-4\n10.3390/cells11213372\n10.1136/svn-2020-000774\n10.1007/s12975-021-00941-1\n10.2337/db15-1356\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2012.07943.x\n10.1007/s12975-016-0460-z\n10.1007/s12975-020-00841-w\n10.3390/cells10123555\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.001660\n10.1097/00004647-199607000-00010\n10.1161/01.STR.17.3.472\n10.1186/s12933-021-01426-z\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1007/s10456-004-4182-6\n10.1002/jemt.20829\n10.1111/bph.15524\n10.2337/db20-0095\n10.1042/CS20190180\n10.1172/jci.insight.123130\n10.2337/db22-0826\n10.3390/cells12182221\n10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.09.008\n10.2147/DMSO.S375559\n10.3390/molecules27217174\n10.2147/DMSO.S258593\n10.2147/DMSO.S312527\n10.1007/s00414-018-1893-6\n10.1016/j.lfs.2022.121002\n10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-002104\n10.1007/s12975-022-01109-1\n10.1038/s41583-023-00690-0\n10.1016/j.regpep.2014.05.001\n10.15252/emmm.202216269\n10.1186/s12974-016-0774-5\n10.1113/JP283259\n10.3390/cells11193107\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.11.028\n10.3389/fnut.2021.782657\n10.1007/s11064-022-03637-6\n10.1111/dom.13577\n10.1038/s41467-020-15983-6\n10.1007/s00125-022-05815-1\n10.2337/dc16-0330\n10.1111/dom.12881\n10.1007/s12975-021-00941-1\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.022119\n10.1038/s42255-021-00354-2\n10.1038/srep19626\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.09.078\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.120.007197\n10.3390/jcm11040949\n10.3390/ijms21030824\n10.4103/1673-5374.264442\n10.2337/db22-0674\n10.3390/brainsci9030057\n10.1007/s00401-009-0483-6\n10.1161/01.STR.25.9.1794\n10.1042/CS20060049\n10.1038/jcbfm.2012.187\n10.1038/jcbfm.2011.136\n10.1016/S0169-328X(03)00085-8\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2014.12.007\n10.3389/fendo.2022.869414\n10.1152/ajpheart.00287.2018\n10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01429-5\n10.3390/ijms24021132\n10.2337/db21-0536\n10.1093/jnen/nlac048\n10.1038/s41598-021-95344-5\n10.3390/antiox10121886\n10.3390/ijms222111967\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.12.009\n10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104877\n10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00722\n10.1016/j.vph.2021.106949\n10.1111/jcmm.15699\n10.1016/j.molmet.2018.05.003\n10.1007/s12272-020-01237-y\n10.1111/fcp.12548\n10.1113/JP280389"}

Microvascular pathology and neuroinflammation are suggested to drive the transition from normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) to WMH, particularly in individuals with hypertension. However, current imaging techniques cannot capture ongoing NAWM changes. The transition from NAWM into WMH is a continuous process, yet white matter lesions are often examined dichotomously, which may explain their underlying heterogeneity. Therefore, we examined microvascular and neurovascular inflammation pathology in NAWM and severe WMH three-dimensionally, along with gradual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal (sub-)segmentation. In WMH, the vascular network exhibited reduced length and complexity compared to NAWM. Neuroinflammation was more severe in WMH. Vascular inflammation was more pronounced in NAWM, suggesting its potential significance in converting NAWM into WMH. Moreover, the (sub-)segmentation of FLAIR signal displayed varying degrees of vascular pathology, particularly within WMH regions. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between microvascular pathology and neuroinflammation in the transition from NAWM to WMH. Further examination of neurovascular inflammation across MRI-visible alterations could aid deepening our understanding on WMH conversion, and therewith how to improve the prognosis of SVD.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2024-03-01", "authors": ["GemmaSol\u00e9-Guardia", "MatthijsLuijten", "BramGeenen", "Jurgen A H RClaassen", "GeertLitjens", "Frank-Erikde Leeuw", "MaximilianWiesmann", "Amanda JKiliaan"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-024-55733-y\n10.1038/nrneurol.2015.10\n10.1136/jnnp.70.1.9\n10.1016/s1474-4422(13)70124-8\n10.3174/ajnr.A3146\n10.1161/strokeaha.112.680223\n10.1186/s40478-022-01497-3\n10.1016/j.nicl.2015.04.012\n10.1212/wnl.0000000000005684\n10.1186/s40478-019-0666-x\n10.1136/jnnp.2009.204685\n10.1097/NEN.0b013e318277387e\n10.1242/dev.199720\n10.1038/nmeth1036\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.007\n10.2214/ajr.149.2.351\n10.48550/arXiv.1809.06839\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.12.011\n10.1016/S1361-8415(98)80009-1\n10.1145/357994.358023\n10.1002/jemt.20829\n10.3389/fncel.2018.00106\n10.1212/01.wnl.0000319691.50117.54\n10.1111/bpa.12224\n10.1136/svn-2016-000035\n10.1136/jnnp.2009.172072\n10.1161/circresaha.111.246116\n10.1212/wnl.0000000000201186\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.009627\n10.1097/wco.0000000000000913\n10.3390/brainsci9070170\n10.1212/wnl.0000000000201205\n10.1007/BF00688824\n10.1097/00005072-199401000-00003\n10.1111/j.1365-2990.2007.00828.x\n10.1016/j.arr.2019.100916\n10.1097/hjh.0000000000003503\n10.3389/fneur.2021.786840\n10.3233/JAD-190687"}
{"title": "Tissue engineered periosteum: Fabrication of a gelatin basedtrilayer composite scaffold with biomimetic properties for enhanced bone healing.", "abstract": "The periosteum, a vascularized tissue membrane, is essential in bone regeneration following fractures and bone loss due to some other reasons, yet there exist several research gaps concerning its regeneration. These gaps encompass reduced cellular proliferation and bioactivity, potential toxicity, heightened stiffness of scaffold materials, unfavorable porosity, expensive materials and procedures, and suboptimal survivability or inappropriate degradation rates of the implanted materials. This research used an interdisciplinary approach by forming a new material fabricated through electrospinning for the proposed application as a layer-by-layer tissue-engineered periosteum (TEP). TEP comprises poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL), PCL/gelatin/magnesium-doped zinc oxide (vascular layer), and gelatin/bioactive glass/COD liver oil (osteoconductive layer). These materials were selected for their diverse properties, when integrated into the scaffold formation, successfully mimic the characteristics of native periosteum. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to confirm the trilayer structure of the scaffold and determine the average fiber diameter. In-vitro degradation and swelling studies demonstrated a uniform degradation rate that matches the typical recovery time of periosteum. The scaffold exhibited excellent mechanical properties comparable to natural periosteum. Furthermore, the sustained release kinetics of COD liver oil were observed in the trilayer scaffold. Cell culture results indicated that the three-dimensional topography of the scaffold promoted cell growth, proliferation, and attachment, confirming its non-toxicity, biocompatibility, and bioactivity.

However, the current therapies are suboptimal to manage the corneal wound healing process. Therefore, there is an obvious need to develop new treatment strategies that are efficient in promoting wound healing in patients with severe corneal disorders. In this study, we investigated and compared the efficacy of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) and photobiomodulation (PBM) with polychromatic light in the NIR (600-1200\u00a0nm) alone and in combination, on corneal opacity, inflammatory response, and tissue architecture in a rat corneal opacity model created by mechanical injury. All animals were divided into four groups randomly following the injury: injury only (no treatment), ADMSCs treatment, PBM treatment and combined (ADMSCs+PBM) treatment (n\u00a0=\u00a012 eyes per group). At the 10th and 30th day following injury, corneal opacity formation, neovascularization, and corneal thickness were assessed. On the 30th day the harvested corneas were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), histological evaluation, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On day 30, the corneal opacity score, neovascularization grade, and corneal thickness in all treatment groups were significantly lower in comparison with the untreated injured corneas. The TEM imaging and H&E staining together clearly revealed a significant enhancement in corneal regeneration with improved corneal microenvironment and reduced vascularization in the combined administration of PBM and ADMSCs compared to treatment of PBM and ADMSCs alone. In addition, the IHC staining, and RT-PCR analysis supported our hypothesis that combining ADMSCs therapy with PBM alleviated the inflammatory response, and significantly decreased scar formation compared to either ADMSCs or PBM alone during the corneal wound healing.", "journal": "Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

The cranial pole of the gland was closely related to the cricoid or thyroid cartilage, while the caudal pole showed variable positioning to the tracheal rings. The isthmus, a thin band of tissue connecting the lobes, was present in all specimens. The cranial thyroid artery was found to originate from the external carotid artery in most specimens. It supplied the thyroid gland and sent branches to muscles in the neck region. The caudal thyroid artery, originating from the common carotid artery, provides additional blood supply to the gland and sends a branch to the esophagus.

Macrophages are recognized as prominent immune cells in tissue regeneration and wound healing. Consequently, the modulation of macrophages provides a promising therapeutic target for wound healing disorders. Here, we aimed to explore whether a novel constructed combination of thermosensitive hydrogel Pluronic F-127 (PF-127) and phillyrin (PH, the main active compound of forsythia suspensa) could improve skin wound healing.\nFirstly, the biological effects of pH on the phenotype and inflammation of macrophages were assessed by flow cytometry and ELISA. The biocompatibility of the PF-127 plus PH combination was investigated on keratinocytes and red blood cells. The biological effect of PF-127/PH hydrogel on the migratory ability of keratinocytes in vitro was evaluated using the scratch and transwell migration assays. In addition,S. aureusandE. coliwere employed to test the antibacterial properties of the PF-127 plus PH combination. Finally, PF-127 plus PH scaffold was appliedto the full-thickness skin defect in mice. Histomorphological evaluation and immunochemistry were performed to explore the wound-healing activity of PF-127/PH hydrogel.\nPH can promote the polarization of macrophages from the M1 (pro-inflammatory) phenotype to the M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotype. The PF-127/PH hydrogel was highly biocompatible and showed a potent stimulative effect on the migration of keratinocytesin vitro. The combination of PF-127 and PH exerted a pronounced antibacterial activity onS. aureusandE. coli in vitro.PF-127/PH hydrogel potently accelerates the healing of full-thickness skin defects by promoting skin cell proliferation, accelerating angiogenesis, and inhibiting inflammation.\nOur study suggests that PF-127/PH hydrogel has excellent potential for treating traumatic skin defects.", "journal": "Cytokine", "date": "2024-02-29", "authors": ["ChenggangHuang", "JiajiaTeng", "WeiLiu", "JunzheWang", "AnLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cyto.2024.156556"}
{"title": "Disruption of Super-Enhancers in Activated Pancreatic Stellate Cells Facilitates Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer.", "abstract": "One major obstacle in the drug treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is its highly fibrotic tumor microenvironment, which is replete with activated pancreatic stellate cells (a-PSCs). These a-PSCs generate abundant extracellular matrix and secrete various cytokines to form biophysical and biochemical barriers, impeding drug access to tumor tissues. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a strategy for reversing PSC activation and thereby removing the barriers to facilitate PDAC drug treatment. Herein, by integrating chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq, Assays for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-seq, and RNA-seq techniques, this work reveals that super-enhancers (SEs) promote the expression of various genes involved in PSC activation. Disruption of SE-associated transcription with JQ1 reverses the activated phenotype of a-PSCs and decreases stromal fibrosis in both orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. More importantly, disruption of SEs by JQ1 treatments promotes vascularization, facilitates drug delivery, and alters the immune landscape in PDAC, thereby improving the efficacies of both chemotherapy (with gemcitabine) and immunotherapy (with IL-12). In summary, this study not only elucidates the contribution of SEs of a-PSCs in shaping the PDAC tumor microenvironment but also highlights that targeting SEs in a-PSCs may become a gate-opening strategy that benefits PDAC drug therapy by removing stromal barriers.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2024-02-28", "authors": ["YazhouWang", "KaiChen", "GangLiu", "ChongDu", "ZhaoxiaCheng", "DanWei", "FenfenLi", "ChenLi", "YinmoYang", "YingZhao", "GuangjunNie"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202308637"}

They also showed excellent volume retention after 12 weeks. In contrast, ADSCs isolated from SVF-gel displayed lower vitality. However, grafts from SVF-gel exhibited the highest volume maintenance rate among the four groups after 12 weeks, closely resembling normal adipose tissue and displaying significant vascularization. Compared to large fat granule and SVF-gel group, medium and small fat granule grafts exhibited lower volume retention and less angiogenesis.\nThrough preclinical studies, the flexible clinical use of different fat grafts can be tailored to their unique characteristics.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

{"title": "A Two-Step Approach for Breast Augmentation with Chest Wall Deformity?", "abstract": "Breast augmentation in the case of chest wall deformity can be challenging. It is essential to treat the two problematics separately, and not to attempt compensation for asymmetry with vastly different breast implants. With this work, we wish to highlight the approach based on the use of custom-made 3D implants, enabling optimal correction of thoracic deformity. A first case study illustrates a one-step approach to correcting deformity and augmenting the breast. The importance of separate management of these issues lies in the fact that possible normalization of thoracic dysmorphia alone can sometimes lead to withdrawal of the request for breast augmentation. We illustrate this with a second case report with optimal patient satisfaction after isolated correction of a pectus excavatum.Level of Evidence V This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

{"title": "Fabrication of vascularized tissue-engineered bone models using triaxial bioprinting.", "abstract": "Bone tissue is a highly vascularized tissue. When constructing tissue-engineered bone models, both the osteogenic and angiogenic capabilities of the construct should be carefully considered. However, fabricating a vascularized tissue-engineered bone to promote vascular formation and bone generation, while simultaneously establishing nutrition channels to facilitate nutrient exchange within the constructs, remains a significant challenge. Triaxial bioprinting, which not only allows the independent encapsulation of different cell types while simultaneously forming nutrient channels, could potentially emerge as a strategy for fabricating vascularized tissue-engineered bone. Moreover, bioinks should also be applied in combination to promote both osteogenesis and angiogenesis. In this study, employing triaxial bioprinting, we used a blend bioink of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), sodium alginate (Alg), and different concentrations of nano beta-tricalcium phosphate (nano \u03b2-TCP) encapsulated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts as the outer layer, a mixed bioink of GelMA and Alg loaded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as the middle layer, and gelatin as a sacrificial material to form nutrient channels in the inner layer to fabricate vascularized bone constructs simulating the microenvironment for bone and vascular tissues. The results showed that the addition of nano \u03b2-TCP could adjust the mechanical, swelling, and degradation properties of the constructs. Biological assessments revealed the cell viability of constructs containing different concentrations of nano \u03b2-TCP was higher than 90% on day 7, The cell-laden constructs containing 3% (w/v) nano \u03b2-TCP exhibited better osteogenic (higher Alkaline phosphatase activity and larger Osteocalcin positive area) and angiogenic (the gradual increased CD31 positive area) potential. Therefore, using triaxial bioprinting technology and employing GelMA, Alg, and nano \u03b2-TCP as bioink components could fabricate vascularized bone tissue constructs, offering a novel strategy for vascularized bone tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Though it is an unfortunate misnomer, being neither pyogenic nor a true granuloma, the name has been used for years. In the oral cavity, it presents as a growth mostly situated on the gingiva, but may also occur on the tongue, buccal and labial mucosa, and palate, and may even be seen in relation to dental implants. The lesion is usually bright or purple red in color, soft in consistency, relatively painless, and appears highly vascularized. Local etiologic factors are usually poor oral hygiene or chronic irritation. Histopathologically it is an inflammatory hyperplasia of the connective tissue with exuberant vascularity. Sometimes, this lesion may present with unusual histopathological patterns, which could lead to difficulty in diagnosis. Long-standing pyogenic granuloma may show histologic changes such as localized osteogenesis in the matrix of the lesion which could potentially lead to complications in the area of the lesion.

{"title": "Vascularized organoid-on-a-chip: design, imaging, and analysis.", "abstract": "Vascularized organoid-on-a-chip (VOoC) models achieve substance exchange in deep layers of organoids and provide a more physiologically relevant system in vitro. Common designs for VOoC primarily involve two categories: self-assembly of endothelial cells (ECs) to form microvessels and pre-patterned vessel lumens, both of which include the hydrogel region for EC growth and allow for controlled fluid perfusion on the chip. Characterizing the vasculature of VOoC often relies on high-resolution microscopic imaging. However, the high scattering of turbid tissues can limit optical imaging depth. To overcome this limitation, tissue optical clearing (TOC) techniques have emerged, allowing for 3D visualization of VOoC in conjunction with optical imaging techniques. The acquisition of large-scale imaging data, coupled with high-resolution imaging in whole-mount preparations, necessitates the development of highly efficient analysis methods. In this review, we provide an overview of the chip designs and culturing strategies employed for VOoC, as well as the applicable optical imaging and TOC methods. Furthermore, we summarize the vascular analysis techniques employed in VOoC, including deep learning. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges in VOoC and vascular analysis methods and provide an outlook for future development.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2024-02-27", "authors":

Materials and Methods A total of 155 pregnant women were included in this study, randomly divided into 104 cases in the training set and 51 cases in the validation set. There were 93 Non-PAS cases, and 62 cases in the PAS group. The training set included 62 Non-PAS cases and 42 PAS cases. Clinical factors and MRI signs were collected for univariate analysis. Then, binary logistic regression analysis was used to develop independent diagnostic models with clinical relevant risk factors or MRI signs, as well as those combining clinical risk factors and MRI signs. The ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of each diagnostic model. Finally, the validation was performed with the validation set. Results In the training set, four clinical factors (gestity, parity, uterine surgery history, placental position) and 11 MRI features (T2-dark bands, placental bulge, T2 hypointense interface loss, myometrial thinning, bladder wall interruption, focal exophytic mass, abnormal placental bed vascularization, placental heterogeneity, asymmetric placental thickening/shape, placental ischemic infarction, abnormal intraplacental vascularity) were considered as risk factors for PAS. The AUC of the clinical diagnostic model, MRI diagnostic model, and clinical + MRI model of PAS were 0.779, 0.854, and 0.874, respectively. In the validation set, the AUC of the clinical diagnostic model, MRI diagnostic model, and clinical + MRI model of PAS were 0.655, 0.728, and 0.735, respectively.

However, there is still a risk of absorption of the grafts over time. Intrinsic postauricular fascia (IPF) with a rich vascular network may play an important role in the nutrition and repair of auricular cartilage. This study aimed to investigate the effect of IPF on the survival viability of free auricular cartilage grafts.\n24 auricular cartilages were obtained from 6 New Zealand white rabbits which were divided into the cartilage-fascia composite graft group (FC group, n=12) and the cartilage without fascia group (C group, n=12). Two groups of cartilage were implanted into each side of the subcutaneous pocket of the rabbit's dorsum. The rabbits were sacrificed after 3 months and all cartilage grafts were obtained. Macroscopic observation, histopathological staining, and biomechanical testing were performed on all specimens.\nThere were significant differences between the 2 groups regarding proliferating chondrocytes, apoptotic chondrocytes, vascularization, and matrix collagen. Compared to the auricular cartilage grafts without fascia, the auricular cartilage-fascia composite grafts had more neovascularization, proliferative chondrocytes, and type II collagen, with a homogeneous cartilage matrix and no obvious areas of heterogeneous staining. Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength of cartilage were reduced in both groups compared to pretransplantation, but the composite graft group was superior to the fascia-free group.\nAuricular cartilage-fascial composite tissue free graft could improve cartilage survival outcomes with higher viability and mechanical properties.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2024-02-26", "authors": ["ChuanLi", "Lun-KunMa", "Ze-YaZhang", "Xiao-JunTang", "WeiLiu", "XiXu", "ShiFeng", "Shan-BagaZhao", "Zhi-YongZhang"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000010050"}

{"title": "One-carbon metabolite supplementation to nutrient-restricted beef heifers affects placental vascularity during early pregnancy.", "abstract": "We hypothesized that restricted maternal nutrition and supplementation of one-carbon metabolites (OCM; methionine, folate, choline, and vitamin B12) would affect placental vascular development during early pregnancy. A total of 43 cows were bred, and 32 heifers successfully became pregnant with female calves, leading to the formation of four treatment groups: CON\u00a0-\u00a0OCM (n\u2005=\u20058), CON\u2005+\u2005OCM (n\u2005=\u20057), RES\u00a0-\u00a0OCM (n\u2005=\u20059), and RES\u2005+\u2005OCM (n\u2005=\u20058). The experimental design was a 2\u2005\u00d7\u20052 factorial, with main factors of dietary intake affecting average daily gain: control (CON; 0.6\u00a0kg/d ADG) and restricted (RES; -0.23\u00a0kg/d ADG); and OCM supplementation (+OCM) in which the heifers were supplemented with rumen-protected methionine (7.4\u00a0g/d) and choline (44.4\u00a0g/d) and received weekly injections of 320\u00a0mg of folate and 20\u00a0mg of vitamin B12, or received no supplementation (-OCM; corn carrier and saline injections). Heifers were individually fed and randomly assigned to treatment at breeding (day 0). Placentomes were collected on day 63 of gestation (0.225 of gestation). Fluorescent staining with CD31 and CD34 combined with image analysis was used to determine the vascularity of the placenta. Images were analyzed for capillary area density (CAD) and capillary number density (CND). Areas evaluated included fetal placental cotyledon\u00a0(COT), maternal placental caruncle (CAR), whole placentome (CAR\u2005+\u2005COT), intercotyledonary fetal membranes (ICOT, or chorioallantois), intercaruncular endometrium (ICAR), and endometrial glands (EG). Data were analyzed with the GLM procedure of SAS, with heifer as the experimental unit and significance at P\u2005\u2264\u20050.05 and a tendency at P\u2005>\u20050.05 and P\u2005<\u20050.10. Though no gain\u2005\u00d7\u2005OCM interactions existed (P\u2005\u2265\u20050.10), OCM supplementation increased (P\u2005=\u20050.01) CAD of EG, whereas nutrient restriction tended (P\u2005<\u20050.10) to increase CAD of ICOT and CND of COT. Additionally, there was a gain\u2005\u00d7\u2005OCM interaction (P\u2005<\u20050.05) for CAD within the placentome and ICAR, such that RES reduced and supplementation of RES with OCM restored CAD. These results indicate that maternal rate of gain and OCM supplementation affected placental vascularization (capillary area and number density), which could affect placental function and thus the efficiency of nutrient transfer to the fetus during early gestation.\nIn cow\u2013calf production, periods of poor forage availability or quality can result in nutrient restriction during pregnancy. Previous studies have shown that even moderate maternal feed restriction during pregnancy, including very early in pregnancy, has profound effects on fetal and placental development, potentially having lasting impacts on calf growth and body composition later in life. One-carbon metabolites (OCM) in the diet are biomolecules required for methylation reactions and participate in the regulation of gene expression. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of nutrient restriction and OCM supplementation (specifically methionine, choline, folate, and vitamin B12) on placental vascular development during early pregnancy. Proper placental vascular development is necessary for healthy pregnancy outcomes, reflected by normal birth weight and healthy offspring. Our results indicated that maternal rate of gain and OCM supplementation affect placental vascularization, which could affect placental function and thereby fetal development throughout gestation. In the context of beef cattle production, our study sheds light on strategies that could enhance placental vascular development during early pregnancy.

However, the lack of available models has challenged studies of angiogenesis in OSF. Here, we found that the expression of thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), an endogenous angiostatic protein, was elevated in the stroma of tissues with OSF. Using a fibroblast-attached organoid (FAO) model, the overexpression of THBS1 in OSF was stably recapitulated in vitro. In the FAO model, treatment with arecoline, a major pathogenic component in areca nuts, enhanced the secretion of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 by epithelial cells, which then promoted the expression of THBS1 in fibroblasts. Furthermore, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incorporated into the FAO to mimic the vascularized component. Overexpression of THBS1 in fibroblasts drastically suppressed the sprouting ability of endothelial cells in vascularized FAOs (vFAOs). Consistently, treatment with arecoline reduced the expression of CD31 in vFAOs, and this effect was attenuated when the endothelial cells were preincubated with neutralizing antibody of CD36, a receptor of THBS1. Finally, in an arecoline-induced rat OSF model, THBS1 inhibition alleviated collagen deposition and the decline in vascularity in vivo.

This study aimed to create multiple three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) femur models to biomechanically evaluate the fracture risk in the donor site of a vascularized MFC bone graft.\nComputer tomography scans of the femurs of nine patients (four males and five females) with no left femur disease were enrolled in the study. A 3D FE model of the left femur was generated based on the CT images taken from the patients. The descending genicular artery (DGA), the main nutrient vessel in vascularized MFC bone grafts, divides into the proximal transversal branch (TB) and the distal longitudinal branch (LB) before entering the periosteum. Thirty-six different bone defect models with different sizes and locations of the harvested bone were created.\nThe highest stress was observed in the proximal medial and metaphyseal portions under axial and external rotation, respectively. In the bone defect model, the stress was most elevated in the extracted region's anterior or posterior superior part. Stress increased depending on proximal location and harvested bone size.\nIncreasing the size of the bone graft proximally raises the stress at the site of bone extraction.

Women undergoing voluntary termination of pregnancy at three different gestational ages (Group 8\u00a0GW: 8 to 8\u00a0+\u00a06\u00a0GW, Group 11GW: 11 to 11\u00a0+\u00a06\u00a0GW and Group 13GW: 13 to 13\u00a0+\u00a06\u00a0GW) were included, with 14 subjects per group. Women presenting with a personal risk of preeclampsia and/or intrauterine growth restriction were excluded. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was performed with an intravenous bolus administration of 2.4\u00a0mL of microbubbles. The region of interest (ROI) was the entire placenta. The perfusion curves and kinetic parameters, including wash-in perfusion index, peak enhancement and mean transit time, were calculated.\nOf the 42 women initially included, interpretable perfusion curves could be obtained for 33. Regardless of the gestational age, contrast was observed in the entire placenta. No significant difference in perfusion parameters was observed between groups. There was an association between signal intensity and both maternal heart frequency and placental location. Signal intensity was decreased when the heart frequency increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and when the placenta was in a nonanterior position (p\u00a0>\u00a00.005).\nWe confirmed the presence of maternal perfusion of the intervillous space as early as 8\u00a0GW.

{"title": "Non-surgical treatment of post-burn hypopigmentation: a literature review.", "abstract": "The treatment of post-burn hypopigmentation was primarily surgical before the advent of new technologies. Medical devices and therapies are emerging to manage scar sequelae that can be disfiguring and associated with severe psychosocial impact. These innovations have been poorly investigated for hypopigmentation, but they represent a real hope. We reviewed all articles published on Pubmed up to June 2022. Included studies had to specifically focus on treating post-burn hypopigmented scars. All articles evaluating transient solutions such as make-up, and articles describing inflammation-linked hypopigmentation with no etiological details or no burn injury history were excluded. Through this review, we have highlighted six different types of non-surgical treatments reported in post-burn leukoderma potentially allowing definitive results. Electrophoto-Biomodulation or E light (combining intensive pulsed light, radiofrequency, and cooling), topical daylight psoralen UVA therapy, and lasers (Fractional lasers using pulse energies or CO2FL devices, lasers-assisted drug delivery as local bimatoprost and tretinoin or pimecrolimus) have been explored with encouraging results in hypopigmented burns. Finally, other promising medical strategies include using FK506, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, to induce melanogenesis or using melanocyte-stimulating hormones with fractional laser-assisted drug deliveries, which are expected to emerge soon.", "journal": "Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association", "date": "2024-02-24", "authors": ["EliseLupon", "YanisBerkane", "NicolasBertheuil", "Curtis LCetrulo", "CamilleVaillant", "Beno\u00eetChaput", "OlivierCamuzard", "Alexandre GLellouch"], "doi": "10.1093/jbcr/irae030"}

The incision was extended laterally to expose the chest wall. The internal thoracic pedicle was freed from its origin down to the upper limit of the delineated flap to be elevated. The perichondria and adjacent periostea were incised longitudinally to remove cartilages and adjacent rib segments, preserving perichondria and periostea. A full-thickness quadrangular chest wall flap pedicled on internal thoracic vessels was then elevated and shaped into a neo conduit to replace the trachea with the pleura as an inner lining.\nVarious types of extended non-circumferential and full-circumferential tracheal replacements were achieved with this composite flap. No anastomosis tension was noticed despite the absence of release manoeuvres.\nThis model could represent a suitable autologous tracheal substitute, which is long, longitudinally flexible and eventually transversely rigid. No microsurgical vascular anastomoses are required. The technique is reproducible. The perichondria and periostea would regenerate vascularized neo-cartilaginous rings, potentially decreasing the need for long-term stenting.

{"title": "Impact of Brightness on Choroidal Vascularity Index.", "abstract": "The use of choroidal vascularization to diagnose and follow-up ocular and systemic pathologies has been consolidated in recent research. Unfortunately, the choroidal parameters can be different depending on the lighting settings of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the brightness of OCT images could influence the measurements of choroidal parameters obtained by processing and analyzing scientific images with the ImageJ program. In this observational, prospective, non-randomized study, 148 eyes of 74 patients with a mean age of 30.7 \u00b1 8.5 years (ranging from 23 to 61 years) were assessed. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination including slit lamp, fundus oculi, ocular biometry, corneal tomography and spectral domain (SD) OCT evaluations of the foveal region in the enhanced depth imaging (EDI) mode. OCT images at two different brightness levels were obtained. The total choroidal area (TCA), choroidal vascularity index (CVI), stromal choroidal area (SCA) and luminal choroidal area (LCA) at both lower and higher brightness levels were measured. To avoid the bias of operator-dependent error, the lower and higher brightness TCAs were obtained using two methods: the manual tracking mode and fixed area. At the two different brightness levels, LCA, SCA and CVI measurements showed statistically significant changes (", "journal": "Journal of clinical medicine", "date": "2024-02-24", "authors": ["NicolaRosa", "MarcoGioia", "RacheleOrlando", "MartinaDe Luca", "EleonoraD'Aniello", "IsabellaFioretto", "CiroSannino", "MaddalenaDe Bernardo"], "doi": "10.3390/jcm13041020\n10.1364/BOE.4.000397\n10.1038/srep21090\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2010.09.012\n10.1038/s41433-018-0158-4\n10.1097/ICU.0b013e3282fb7c33\n10.1097/IAE.0000000000000035\n10.1097/IAE.0000000000001689\n10.1186/s40662-018-0118-x\n10.1038/s41598-021-84650-7\n10.1007/s00417-011-1620-1\n10.1016/j.ajo.2009.04.029\n10.1186/s12886-015-0059-2\n10.1097/IAE.0000000000003427\n10.1080/09273948.2019.1699579\n10.1080/09273948.2018.1530364\n10.1016/j.semarthrit.2020.08.010\n10.1159/000521071\n10.1136/bjophthalmol-2018-312625\n10.1007/s00417-018-04216-8\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2022.10.002\n10.1097/IAE.0b013e3181eef053\n10.1007/s00417-020-05032-9\n10.1007/s11325-015-1306-8\n10.1097/IAE.0000000000002117\n10.1186/s12886-019-1218-7\n10.1159/000506056\n10.1167/iovs.18-25764\n10.1016/j.ajo.2008.05.032\n10.1167/iovs.14-14933\n10.1097/IAE.0000000000000489\n10.1167/iovs.12-11503\n10.1007/s00417-020-04907-1\n10.1038/s41598-021-95812-y\n10.1038/s41433-020-0969-y\n10.1016/j.ajo.2015.03.005\n10.1038/s41598-022-23665-0\n10.3389/fendo.2023.1049326\n10.3390/tomography9040116\n10.3390/jcm11133715\n10.3174/ajnr.A6091\n10.1016/j.ijoa.2018.12.010\n10.1186/s40779-019-0207-8\n10.1016/j.ajem.2019.02.001\n10.1002/jcu.1870020107\n10.1167/iovs.17-22720\n10.1080/09273948.2017.1343357\n10.1007/s00417-016-3283-4\n10.1167/tvst.5.4.7\n10.1080/09273948.2017.1332231\n10.1016/j.ajo.2019.03.028\n10.1080/01658107.2019.1566384\n10.1167/iovs.63.5.22"}
{"title": "Using Liver Organoids as Models to Study the Pathobiology of Rare Liver Diseases.", "abstract": "Liver organoids take advantage of several important features of pluripotent stem cells that self-assemble in a three-dimensional culture matrix and reproduce many aspects of the complex organization found within their native tissue or organ counterparts. Compared to other 2D or 3D in vitro models, organoids are widely believed to be genetically stable or docile structures that can be programmed to virtually recapitulate certain biological, physiological, or pathophysiological features of original tissues or organs in vitro. Therefore, organoids can be exploited as effective substitutes or miniaturized models for the study of the developmental mechanisms of rare liver diseases, drug discovery, the accurate evaluation of personalized drug responses, and regenerative medicine applications.

A total of 219 eyes from 110 dogs were examined, with 94.5% of them affected by PK. Age, previous ocular diseases, corneal vascularization, and corneal sensitivity were significantly associated with the presence of PF and the severity of corneal pigmentation. The study also found that low tear production and blinks incomplete with tear signs, as well as reduced corneal sensitivity, were linked to more severe forms of corneal pigmentation. The Tear Ferning Test (TFT) was identified as a valuable tool for evaluating tear quality in dogs, with worse test results indicating a higher risk of severe PK. A lower mean Tear Break-Up Time (TBUT) test was observed in dogs with PK. Additionally, the study observed a statistically significant difference in corneal thickness between the nasal and temporal zones, with the nasal zone being thicker.

Its discovery is often incidental, but symptomatic presentations can occur, including ovarian torsion, can occur without any specification.\nWe present the case of a 55-year-old menopausal woman with chronic pelvic pain. Initial diagnostic imaging and tumor markers suggested ovarian malignancy. Subsequent investigations, including ultrasound and MRI, revealed a vascularized adnexal mass with characteristics mimicking malignancy. Surgical exploration through laparoscopy unveiled an 8\u00a0cm multicystic solid-cystic lesion with histopathological analysis confirming a 9\u00a0cm cavernous hemangioma.\nHistologically, the lesion displayed features consistent with a benign vascular malformation. Literature review indicates variability in presentations and diagnostic challenges in distinguishing these lesions from malignant ovarian tumors. Treatment involved successful cystectomy via laparoscopic surgery, ensuring ovarian preservation so as not to increase the cardiovascular risk due to bilateral annexectomy.\nOvarian cavernous hemangiomas pose diagnostic challenges due to their rarity and potential mimicry of malignancy.

Extensive research is ongoing to explore tissue engineered products that provide durable coverage. However, there is a lack of controlled and affordable testbeds in the preclinical setting to reflect this challenging clinical scenario. We aimed to address this gap in the literature and develop a feasible and easily reproducible model in rodents that reflects an avascular structure in the wound bed.\nWe created 20 \u00d7 20 mm full thickness wounds on the dorsal skin of Lewis rats and secured 0.5-mm-thick silicone sheets of varying sizes to the wound bed. A 3D-printed wound frame was designed to isolate the wound environment. Skin graft and free flap survival along with exposure of the underlying silicone was assessed. Rats were followed for 4 weeks with weekly dressing changes and photography. Samples were retrieved at the endpoint for tissue viability and histologic analysis.\nThe total wound surface area was constant throughout the duration of the experiment in all groups and the wound frames were well tolerated. The portion of the skin graft without underlying silicone demonstrated integration with the underlying fascia and a histologically intact epidermis. Gradual necrosis of the portion of the skin graft overlying the silicone sheet was observed with varying sizes of the silicone sheet. When the size of the silicone sheet was reduced from 50% of the wound surface area, the portion surviving over the silicone sheet increased at the 4-week timepoint. The free flap provided complete coverage over the silicone sheet.\nWe developed a novel model of rodent wound healing to maintain the same wound size and isolate the wound environment for up to 4 weeks. This model is clinically relevant to a complex wound with an avascular structure in the wound bed. Skin grafts failed to completely cover increasing sizes of the avascular structure, whereas the free flap was able to provide viable coverage. This cost-effective model will establish an easily reproducible platform to evaluate more complex bioengineered wound coverage solutions.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2024-02-23", "authors": ["Fuat BarisBengur", "ChiakiKomatsu", "ShawnLoder", "PoojaHumar", "YadiraVillalvazo", "BaraaNawash", "Benjamin KSchilling", "Mario GSolari"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0000000000003829"}

This study aimed to examine the potential associations between Doppler parameters and clinical characteristics of hypothyroid patients, such as the autoimmune nature of the disease and adequacy of LT4 replacement.\nA total of 338 patients with hypothyroidism, primarily caused by autoimmune thyroiditis (AT), were enrolled in this study. Exclusion criteria comprised specific medical conditions, medication history, and nodular abnormalities of the thyroid gland. Patient demographics (age, sex, BMI), treatment parameters (LT4 daily dose), and thyroid hormone levels (TSH, fT4) were recorded.\nAmong the enrolled patients, 85.2% had autoimmune thyroiditis. Suboptimal levothyroxine (LT4) replacement was observed in 20.1% of patients at the time of enrollment. Patients with autoimmune thyroiditis had increased elastography ratios compared to those without autoimmune disease and present a positive association of elastography ratios with vascularity. In patients without autoimmune thyroiditis, those with suboptimal LT4 replacement had lower total thyroid volume. Patients with suboptimal LT4 replacement had higher peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) in the inferior thyroid artery and lower resistive index (RI). The severity of hypothyroidism, as indicated by LT4 dose/body mass index (BMI), was negatively correlated with thyroid volume and EDV values of superior and inferior thyroid arteries.

Using flow cytometry assays, we found that 86.1% of MDA-MB-231 and 92% of Hs-578t breast cancer cells showed the CD44+/CD24- immunophenotype representative of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). The MDA-MB-231 subpopulation of CSCs exhibited the ability to form mammospheres, as expected. Interestingly, we found that the restoration of miR-204 expression in CSCs significantly inhibited the number and size of the mammospheres. Moreover, we found that MDA-MB-231 and Hs-578t CSCs efficiently undergo angiogenesis and hypoxia-induced vasculogenic mimicry in vitro. The transfection of precursor miR-204 in both CSCs was able to impair the angiogenesis in the HUVEC cell model, which was observed as a diminution in the number of polygons and sprouting cells. Remarkably, miR-204 mimics also resulted in the inhibition of vasculogenic mimicry formation in MDA-MB-231 and Hs-578t CSCs, with a significant reduction in the number of channel-like structures and branch points. Mechanistically, the effects of miR-204 were associated with a diminution of pro-angiogenic VEGFA and \u03b2-catenin protein levels. In conclusion, our findings indicated that miR-204 abrogates the angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry development in breast cancer stem-like cells, suggesting that it could be a potential tool for breast cancer intervention based on microRNA replacement therapies.", "journal": "Non-coding RNA", "date": "2024-02-23", "authors": ["MarthaResendiz-Hern\u00e1ndez", "Alejandra PGarc\u00eda-Hern\u00e1ndez", "Macrina BSilva-C\u00e1zares", "RogelioCoronado-Uribe", "Olga NHern\u00e1ndez-de la Cruz", "Lourdes AArriaga-Pizano", "Jessica LPrieto-Ch\u00e1vez", "Yarely MSalinas-Vera", "EloisaIbarra-Sierra", "Concepci\u00f3nOrtiz-Mart\u00ednez", "C\u00e9sarL\u00f3pez-Camarillo"], "doi": "10.3390/ncrna10010014\n10.1007/s12015-023-10529-x\n10.1038/nm0797-730\n10.4081/ejh.2018.2943\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3126\n10.1038/nrc3184\n10.1016/j.canlet.2012.02.024\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.02.015\n10.1038/nature09557\n10.1038/nrc1093\n10.1038/nrc.2017.51\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1010\n10.1002/cnr2.1318\n10.1038/nrc1092\n10.1093/jnci/djh267\n10.3892/ol.2013.1555\n10.1002/cam4.5077\n10.1155/2012/708036\n10.1186/bcr1673\n10.1097/00029330-200810020-00006\n10.3390/cells8080840\n10.1186/s12935-020-01716-8\n10.1016/j.ejca.2010.02.030\n10.3389/fonc.2020.00413\n10.4067/S0716-97602009000300012\n10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2018.0209\n10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2015014042\n10.1016/j.gendis.2015.12.004\n10.1038/labinvest.2015.144\n10.1200/JCO.2005.06.081\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.021\n10.1038/srep34504\n10.3233/CBM-210457\n10.1016/j.canlet.2018.06.003\n10.1016/j.humpath.2011.05.005\n10.1038/s41598-017-14364-2\n10.1186/bcr1610\n10.18632/oncotarget.8461\n10.4149/neo_2021_201208N1328\n10.1097/MD.0000000000002228"}

{"title": "Unlocking the Promise of Decellularized Pancreatic Tissue: A Novel Approach to Support Angiogenesis in Engineered Tissue.", "abstract": "Advancements in regenerative medicine have highlighted the potential of decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) as a scaffold for organ bioengineering. Although the potential of ECM in major organ systems is well-recognized, studies focusing on the angiogenic effects of pancreatic ECM are limited. This study investigates the capabilities of pancreatic ECM, particularly its role in promoting angiogenesis. Using a Triton-X-100 solution, porcine pancreas was successfully decellularized, resulting in a significant reduction in DNA content (97.1% removal) while preserving key pancreatic ECM components. A three-dimensional ECM hydrogel was then created from this decellularized tissue and used for cell culture. Biocompatibility tests demonstrated enhanced adhesion and proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells (mES-ECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in this hydrogel compared to conventional scaffolds. The angiogenic potential was evaluated through tube formation assays, wherein the cells showed superior tube formation capabilities in ECM hydrogel compared to rat tail collagen. The RT-PCR analysis further confirmed the upregulation of pro-angiogenic genes in HUVECs cultured within the ECM hydrogel. Specifically, HUVECs cultured in the ECM hydrogel exhibited a significant upregulation in the expression of MMP2, VEGF and PAR-1, compared to those cultured in collagen hydrogel or in a monolayer condition. The identification of ECM proteins, specifically PRSS2 and Decorin, further supports the efficacy of pancreatic ECM hydrogel as an angiogenic scaffold. These findings highlight the therapeutic promise of pancreatic ECM hydrogel as a candidate for vascularized tissue engineering application.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2024-02-23", "authors": ["LeiHao", "FaribaKhajouei", "JaselinRodriguez", "SoojinKim", "Eun Jung ALee"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering11020183\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.057\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.068\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.06.051\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.11.210\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.09.014\n10.1016/j.pan.2016.06.007\n10.3109/07388551.2015.1007495\n10.1002/term.3359\n10.1093/rb/rbab071\n10.3389/fcell.2020.555378\n10.1002/bit.28047\n10.1111/aor.14126\n10.1039/D1BM01017D\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.120167\n10.4103/jmss.JMSS_2_20\n10.3390/jfb13040240\n10.1111/xen.12380\n10.1111/liv.12088\n10.1093/icvts/ivw022\n10.1371/journal.pone.0090406\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.12.103\n10.1089/ten.tec.2016.0109\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.11.026\n10.1002/hep.24067\n10.1007/s00125-018-4711-2\n10.1056/NEJMoa061267\n10.1097/01.TP.0000157273.60147.7C\n10.2337/diab.45.9.1161\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e31829c79cf\n10.1586/eci.11.101\n10.1097/SLA.0000000000001364\n10.2337/dc15-1988\n10.1016/j.actbio.2023.09.009\n10.1016/j.actbio.2023.09.034\n10.1038/s41598-022-11085-z\n10.1177/1932296813519558\n10.21769/BioProtoc.1236\n10.1089/ten.tec.2017.0018\n10.3727/096368915X687732\n10.1002/bit.25918\n10.1021/acsabm.8b00283\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.12.014\n10.1089/adt.2011.391\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.04.038\n10.3390/ijms22147516\n10.1242/jcs.063859\n10.1038/s41598-020-67289-8\n10.2307/2331554\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.11.041\n10.1172/JCI6870\n10.3390/ijms19051319\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.11.046\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.10.013\n10.3998/panc.2017.10\n10.1089/ten.tec.2018.0180\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.03.005\n10.1038/s41598-018-28857-1\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.014\n10.1038/ncomms4935\n10.1002/bip.21024\n10.1038/srep04414\n10.1007/s00439-022-02436-x\n10.1002/pmic.201800489\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-1190-03\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0706410\n10.3389/fnagi.2020.584839\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00241\n10.1038/srep40495\n10.3390/ijms17111822\n10.1016/j.devcel.2006.01.015\n10.3390/molecules26216740\n10.1186/s13567-015-0241-9\n10.1002/bit.26821\n10.1371/journal.pone.0178696\n10.1177/0885328217752859\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.11.037\n10.1002/advs.202103526\n10.1002/pros.20047\n10.3109/09537104.2015.1051953\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2005.tb00355.x"}
{"title": "A Deep Learning Approach for Improving Two-Photon Vascular Imaging Speeds.", "abstract": "A potential method for tracking neurovascular disease progression over time in preclinical models is multiphoton fluorescence microscopy (MPM), which can image cerebral vasculature with capillary-level resolution. However, obtaining high-quality, three-dimensional images with traditional point scanning MPM is time-consuming and limits sample sizes for chronic studies. Here, we present a convolutional neural network-based (PSSR Res-U-Net architecture) algorithm for fast upscaling of low-resolution or sparsely sampled images and combine it with a segmentation-less vectorization process for 3D reconstruction and statistical analysis of vascular network structure. In doing so, we also demonstrate that the use of semi-synthetic training data can replace the expensive and arduous process of acquiring low- and high-resolution training pairs without compromising vectorization outcomes, and thus open the possibility of utilizing such approaches for other MPM tasks where collecting training data is challenging. We applied our approach to images with large fields of view from a mouse model and show that our method generalizes across imaging depths, disease states and other differences in neurovasculature. Our pretrained models and lightweight architecture can be used to reduce MPM imaging time by up to fourfold without any changes in underlying hardware, thereby enabling deployability across a range of settings.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2024-02-23", "authors": ["AnnieZhou", "Samuel AMihelic", "Shaun AEngelmann", "AlankritTomar", "Andrew KDunn", "Vagheesh MNarasimhan"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering11020111\n10.1111/j.1748-1716.2011.02256.x\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00966.2005\n10.1073/pnas.2117346119\n10.1161/01.STR.30.12.2752\n10.1038/jcbfm.2011.196\n10.1038/s41592-019-0579-4\n10.1038/s41592-019-0728-9\n10.1038/nmeth.2963\n10.1038/s41592-020-0762-7\n10.1038/s41467-022-29180-0\n10.1073/pnas.1812995116\n10.3389/fnins.2021.630250\n10.1016/j.neunet.2020.01.026\n10.34133/2021/8620932\n10.1038/s41467-022-29236-1\n10.1038/jcbfm.2015.26\n10.1364/BOE.448473\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp184\n10.1038/s41592-021-01080-z\n10.1109/TIP.2003.819861\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009451\n10.1007/978-0-387-30164-8_157\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa461\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.05.004\n10.1111/micc.12687\n10.1016/S0006-3495(01)76173-5\n10.7554/eLife.53205\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.049\n10.1117/1.JBO.27.8.083011"}

Main outcome parameters were postoperative best corrected visual acuity, postoperative refractive error, postoperative complications, anatomical and functional survival of the prosthesis as well as comparison of subgroups of the 2 different types (OOKP n = 78; tibia keratoprosthesis n = 52) of keratoprostheses, and subgroup analysis of different indications for surgery. Patients were examined every 6 months.\nThe longest follow-up was 25.8 years. Reasons for implantation were graft-vs-host disease (6.9%), vascularized corneas and dry eye (22.9%), physical or chemical burns (29.8%), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (9.9%), and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (30.5%). The functional success rate with postoperative visual acuity of better than 0.7 log MAR was achieved by 56.9%. The OOKP subgroup showed a better mean visual outcome. 14 keratoprostheses (10.7%) had to be explanted over the whole time span. In the time leading to explantation, refraction showed a statistically significant myopic shift when compared with the non-explanted prosthesis. Anatomical survival rates were better for the OOKP in the first 12 years after implantation.\nThe study shows that keratoprosthesis with a biological haptic has favorable long-term outcomes.

However, a standardized approach for the planning and shaping of this combined flap is still lacking. We aimed to propose a comprehensive algorithmic approach for delayed unilateral breast and lymphedema reconstruction using a predesigned abdominal flap associated with inguinal lymph node transfer. We present in detail the preoperative measurements and surgical technique of the chimeric flap, which combines a predesigned DIEP template and a preselected inguinal lymph node flap, based on the preoperative computed tomography angiography and SPEC-CT findings, respectively; four different flap types are described according to the location of the pedicles of the two flap components. Our results of a series of 34 consecutive female patients with unilateral mastectomy and arm lymphedema, who underwent this combined predesigned reconstructive procedure, are retrospectively analyzed and reported. We recorded a high survival rate of the chimeric flaps in our series, with only one case of partial ischemic loss of a DIEP skin island. In the majority of our patients, the pedicles of the combined flaps were located in opposite positions. After a mean 35-month follow-up, we recorded a 47% mean volume difference reduction of the lymphedematous compared to the unaffected arm; no donor-site lymphedema was documented. Self-evaluation questionnaires showed high patient satisfaction rates regarding breast reconstruction.

{"title": "Benzophenone-3 alters expression of genes encoding vascularization and epithelial-mesenchymal transition functions during Trp53-null mammary tumorigenesis.", "abstract": "Benzophenone-3 (also referred to as oxybenzone) is a putative endocrine disrupting chemical and common ingredient in sunscreens and other personal care products. We previously showed that benzophenone-3 was promotional for epithelial tumorigenesis in mice fed adult high-fat diet, while protective against the incidence of more aggressive spindle cell tumors in the same treatment group. In this study, we show that benzophenone-3 reduces epithelial to mesenchymal transition in the epithelial tumors of these mice. This reduction in epithelial to mesenchymal transition is associated with altered expression of several genes involved in regulation of angiogenesis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Among the genes altered in expression, Timp1 is of particular interest because benzophenone-3 suppressed both migration and Timp1 expression in a mammary tumor cell line that displays epithelial to mesenchymal transition characteristics. These alterations in gene expression plausibly stabilize the vasculature of epithelial carcinomas and contribute to benzophenone-3 promotion of epithelial tumors, while at the same time suppress epithelial to mesenchymal transition and suppress incidence of spindle cell tumors.", "journal": "Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association", "date": "2024-02-23", "authors": ["ElenaMorozova", "AnastasiaKariagina", "CalistaBusch", "Richard CSchwartz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fct.2024.114540\n10.1210/er.2009-0002\n10.1289/ehp.11269\n10.1016/j.envint.2014.05.015\n10.1001/jama.2019.5586\n10.1001/jama.2019.20747\n10.1021/es305000d\n10.1021/es040055r\n10.1007/s00244-015-0227-7\n10.1210/js.2018-00024\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2019.08.002\n10.3389/ftox.2022.910230\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2022.06.002\n10.1016/j.adcanc.2022.100080\n10.18632/oncotarget.27831\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203270\n10.1073/pnas.1018862108\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203270\n10.1007/s10911-010-9184-y\n10.1023/a:1026435103940\n10.1007/BF02096299\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.07007.x\n10.1186/1471-2458-12-439\n10.1021/ac050390d\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203277\n10.1186/bcr2416\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.1991.tb00229.x\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1641\n10.1038/nrc2894\n10.1038/nm0603-677\n10.1172/JCI137552\n10.1172/JCI64044\n10.1038/onc.2011.365\n10.3390/ijms20112767\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-14-0105\n10.1007/s13277-015-4450-7\n10.3892/ol.2017.5896\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4100\n10.18632/oncotarget.24061\n10.1016/j.canlet.2012.08.018\n10.3390/cells9020457\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3030\n10.1126/science.277.5322.55\n10.1126/science.277.5322.48\n10.1016/j.ejso.2006.07.015\n10.1074/jbc.M111.235689\n10.1093/jnci/djs009\n10.1002/path.1618\n10.1038/s41419-020-2486-0\n10.1186/bcr3054\n10.1186/bcr3317\n10.1038/onc.2016.286\n10.1186/bcr2635\n10.1016/j.csbj.2021.07.014\n10.1038/nrc2894\n10.1007/s10565-016-9368-3\n10.1016/s0039-128x(01)00163-5\n10.1161/01.STR.0000153795.38388.72\n10.1016/j.ejogrb.2012.12.040\n10.3892/mmr.2020.11185\n10.1073/pnas.1422015112\n10.1210/en.2007-1530\n10.1007/978-0-387-69080-3_42\n10.1002/emmm.201302618\n10.1007/s00441-012-1337-4\n10.3892/ijo.27.4.949\n10.1677/joe.1.07030\n10.2147/BCTT.S146247\n10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.106938\n10.1038/sj.onc.1209529\n10.1038/onc.2011.483\n10.1210/endo.135.4.7925127\n10.1093/humrep/dem216"}
{"title": "Hu-Qi-Zheng-Xiao Decoction Inhibits the Metastasis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells by Suppressing the HIF-1\u03b1 Signaling Pathway to Inhibit EMT, LCSC, and Angiogenic Process.", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common clinical malignant tumor of the digestive system. Hu-Qi-Zheng-Xiao (HQZX) decoction has been clinically found to prolong the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and improve the quality of patients' survival, but its antitumor biological mechanism is still unclear.\nA nude mouse hollow fiber hepatocellular carcinoma model was constructed to analyze the in vivo efficacy of HQZX decoction against 7 different hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The subcutaneous graft tumor model was again validated. In vitro, the effect of HQZX decoction on the growth and metastasis of the cell line with the highest growth inhibition was evaluated. The cell line with the best efficacy response screened was again used to construct a hollow fiber hepatocellular carcinoma model and hollow fiber conduit cells were extracted to detect the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, EMT-related molecules, LCSCs-related molecules, and to observe the density of the subcutaneous vascular network of hollow fiber conduits. The liver metastasis model of splenic injection was constructed to observe the effect of HQZX decoction on tumor metastasis.\nThe hollow fiber hepatocellular carcinoma model was evaluated for the efficacy of HQZX decoction, and it was found to have the highest growth inhibition of LM3-luc cells. In vitro, the CCK8 assay revealed that HQZX decoction could inhibit tumor migration and invasion and promote apoptosis. In addition, the mechanism study of extracting cells from hollow fiber tubes found that HQZX decoction could inhibit metastasis-associated HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, EMT-related molecules, and LCSCs-related molecules expression. capillary network around subcutaneous fiber tubes was reduced in the HQZX decoction gavage group of mice. It inhibited tumor metastasis in nude mice.\nHQZX decoction inhibited the growth of a variety of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. HQZX decoction suppressed the expression of metastasis-associated VEGF, EMT-related molecules, and LCSCs-related molecules and inhibited tumor angiogenesis and growth and metastasis, which may be related to the inhibition of the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway. It reveals that HQZX decoction may be a promising herbal compound for anti-HCC therapy, and also reveals the accurate feasibility of the hollow fiber hepatocellular carcinoma model for in vivo pharmacodynamic evaluation and mechanism study.", "journal": "Integrative cancer therapies", "date": "2024-02-22", "authors": ["XuejingWang", "LingYin", "MengyinChai", "BuxinKou", "XiaoniLiu", "XiaojunWang"], "doi": "10.1177/15347354231226126"}

{"title": "Development of ovalbumin implants with different spatial configurations for treatment of peripheral nerve injury.", "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) seriously affects the health and life of patients, and is an urgent clinical problem that needs to be resolved. Nerve implants prepared from various biomaterials have played a positive role in PNI, but the effect should be further improved and thus new biomaterials is urgently needed. Ovalbumin (OVA) contains a variety of bioactive components, low immunogenicity, tolerance, antimicrobial activity, non-toxicity and biodegradability, and has the ability to promote wound healing, cell growth and antimicrobial properties. However, there are few studies on the application of OVA in neural tissue engineering. In this study, OVA implants with different spatial structures (membrane, fiber, and lyophilized scaffolds) were constructed by casting, electrospinning, and freeze-drying methods, respectively. The results showed that the OVA implants had excellent physicochemical properties and were biocompatible without significant toxicity, and can promote vascularization, show good histocompatibility, without excessive inflammatory response and immunogenicity. The in vitro results showed that OVA implants could promote the proliferation and migration of Schwann cells, while the in vivo results confirmed that OVA implants (the E5/70% and 20\u00a0kV 20\u00a0\u03bcL/min groups) could effectively regulate the growth of blood vessels, reduce the inflammatory response and promote the repair of subcutaneous nerve injury. Further on, the high-throughput sequencing results showed that the OVA implants up-regulated differential expression of genes related to biological processes such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) signaling pathway, axon guidance, cellular adhesion junctions, and nerve regeneration in Schwann cells.

{"title": "Innate and adaptive immune-directed tumour microenvironment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.", "abstract": "One of the most deadly and aggressive cancers in the world, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), typically manifests at an advanced stage. PDAC is becoming more common, and by the year 2030, it is expected to overtake lung cancer as the second greatest cause of cancer-related death. The poor prognosis can be attributed to a number of factors, including difficulties in early identification, a poor probability of curative radical resection, limited response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and its immunotherapy resistance. Furthermore, an extensive desmoplastic stroma that surrounds PDAC forms a mechanical barrier that prevents vascularization and promotes poor immune cell penetration. Phenotypic heterogeneity, drug resistance, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment are the main causes of PDAC aggressiveness. There is a complex and dynamic interaction between tumor cells in PDAC with stromal cells within the tumour immune microenvironment. The immune suppressive microenvironment that promotes PDAC aggressiveness is contributed by a range of cellular and humoral factors, which itself are modulated by the cancer.

{"title": "Cerebrospinal fluid pH regulation.", "abstract": "The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fills the brain ventricles and the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

Exosomes, implicated in cancer, are poorly understood in living systems. Here we use the genetically engineered mouse model (ExoBow) to map the spatiotemporal distribution of exosomes from healthy and PDAC pancreas in vivo to determine their biological significance. We show that, within the PDAC microenvironment, cancer cells establish preferential communication routes through exosomes with cancer associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The latter being a conserved event in the healthy pancreas. Inhibiting exosomes secretion in both scenarios enhances angiogenesis, underscoring their contribution to vascularization and to cancer. Inter-organ communication is significantly increased in PDAC with specific organs as most frequent targets of exosomes communication occurring in health with the thymus, bone-marrow, brain, and intestines, and in PDAC with the kidneys, lungs and thymus.

{"title": "Artificial insemination of all ejaculated sperm fractions accelerates embryo development and increases the uterine vascularity in the pig.", "abstract": "The semen of boar is characterized by ejaculation in well-differentiated fractions with specific concentration, composition, and volume. The 'sperm-rich fraction' (SRF), the most concentrated seminal fraction, is habitually collected in insemination centers to make artificial insemination (AI) doses. The absence of the other fractions in AI doses could alter the uterine reaction to AI and not trigger essential responses that could maximize fertility. Thus, there is an urge to ascertain the impact of different ejaculate fractions on the uterus after AI to optimize the semen doses. This work analyzed specific parameters related to fertility in pregnant artificially inseminated sows (n\u00a0=\u00a015) with ac-cumulative fractions of the semen of boars (n\u00a0=\u00a06): F1, composed of the sperm-rich fraction (SRF); F2, composed of F1 plus the intermediate fraction; F3, composed of F2 plus the post-SRF. Non-inseminated sows (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were included as control (C). The different types of seminal dose did not affect the number of ovulated follicles (CL; corpora lutea, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) but did affect the embryo development (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The proportion of embryos in morula stages was significantly higher in AI-F1 sows (84.4%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Morulas and blastocysts were balanced in AI-F2 or AI-F3 (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Independently of the type of seminal dose (F1, F2, or F3), we observed by immunohistochemistry that AI significantly increased uterine vascularization, although with some anatomical differences. The cranial region of the uterine horns was significantly more vascularized in AI-F1 or AI-F2 sows (26.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3 and 28.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0%, respectively), and AI-F3 showed significantly less vascularization at that point (17.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

However, the hostile local environment and the immature cell differentiation may compromise their therapeutic efficacy. To this end, human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (hASCs) are engineered into different-sized multicellular spheroids and co-cultured with 3D coaxially and hexagonally patterned human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a liver lobule-like manner to enhance their hepatic differentiation efficiency. It is found that small-sized hASC spheroids, with a diameter of \u224850\u00a0\u00b5m, show superior pro-angiogenic effects and hepatic differentiation compared to the other counterparts. The size-dependent functional enhancements are mediated by the Wnt signaling pathway. Meanwhile, co-culture of hASCs with HUVECs, at a HUVECs/hASCs seeding density ratio of 2:1, distinctly promotes hepatic differentiation and vascularization both in vitro and in vivo, especially when endothelial cells are patterned into hollow hexagons. After subcutaneous implantation, the mini-liver, consisting of HLC spheroids and 3D-printed interconnected vasculatures, can effectively improve liver regeneration in two ALF animal models through amelioration of local oxidative stress and inflammation, reduction of liver necrosis, as well as increase of cell proliferation, thereby showing great promise for clinical translation.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2024-02-21", "authors": ["JiabinZhang", "XiaodieChen", "YurongChai", "ChenyaZhuo", "YantengXu", "TiantianXue", "DanShao", "YuTao", "MingqiangLi"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202309899"}

{"title": "Hierarchical Composite Scaffold with Deferoxamine Delivery System to Promote Bone Regeneration via Optimizing Angiogenesis.", "abstract": "A bone defect refers to the loss of bone tissue caused by trauma or lesions. Bone defects result in high morbidity and deformity rates worldwide. Autologous bone grafting has been widely applied in clinics as the gold standard of treatment; however, it has limitations. Hence, bone tissue engineering (BTE) has been proposed and developed as a novel therapeutic strategy for treating bone defects. Rapid and effective vascularization is essential for bone regeneration. In this study, a hierarchical composite scaffold with deferoxamine (DFO) delivery system, DFO@GMs-pDA/PCL-HNTs (DGPN), was developed, focusing on vascularized bone regeneration. The hierarchical structure of DGPN imitates the microstructure of natural bone and interacts with the local extracellular matrix (ECM), facilitating cell adhesion and proliferation. The addition of 1 wt% of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) improved the material properties. Hydrophilic and functional groups conferred by polydopamine (pDA) modifications strengthened the scaffold bioactivity. Gelatin microspheres (GMs) protected the pharmacological activity of DFO, achieving local application and sustained release for seven days. DFO effectively promoted angiogenesis by activating the signaling pathway of hypoxia inducible factor-1 \u03b1 (HIF-1 \u03b1). In addition, DFO synergized with HNTs to promote osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization. These results indicated that DGPN promoted bone regeneration and accelerated cranial defect healing. This article is protected by copyright.

About 25% of patients with DM are estimated to encounter impaired healing of diabetic wounds, often leading to lower limb amputation. Multiple factors are attributed to the non-healing of diabetic wounds, including hyperglycaemia, chronic inflammation, and impaired angiogenesis. It is imperative to develop more efficient treatment strategies to tackle healing difficulties in diabetic wounds. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are promising for diabetic wound healing considering their anti-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic and pro-proliferative activities. A histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7)-derived 7-amino-acid peptide (7A) was shown to be highly effective for angiogenesis. However, it has never been investigated whether MSC-EVs are synergistic with 7A for the healing of diabetic wounds. Herein, we propose that MSC-EVs can be combined with 7A to greatly promote diabetic wound healing. The combination of EVs and 7A significantly improved the migration and proliferation of skin fibroblasts.

Her left eye (OS) revealed a large inferotemporal RH that measured approximately 2.1 mm\nBelzutifan, a hypoxia-inducible factor inhibitor, is an FDA-approved medication for VHL disease associated with renal cell carcinoma, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that do not require immediate surgical resection. Because of the high incidence of VHL-associated RHs, adjuvant laser photocoagulation therapy when belzutifan is suspended or withheld can allow for the regression of large lesions. In this case series, we also propose a reproducible and technically simple method to measure RH lesions size, using Optos fundus imaging.", "journal": "American journal of ophthalmology case reports", "date": "2024-02-20", "authors": ["Carson WErcanbrack", "Abdelrahman MElhusseiny", "Riley NSanders", "ErikaSantos Horta", "Sami HUwaydat"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajoc.2024.102011\n10.7554/eLife.80774\n10.1016/j.ajoc.2018.05.010\n10.7759/cureus.5319\n10.3928/23258160-20191031-12"}
{"title": "Generation of complex bone marrow organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "The human bone marrow (BM) niche sustains hematopoiesis throughout life. We present a method for generating complex BM-like organoids (BMOs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). BMOs consist of key cell types that self-organize into spatially defined three-dimensional structures mimicking cellular, structural and molecular characteristics of the hematopoietic microenvironment. Functional properties of BMOs include the presence of an in vivo-like vascular network, the presence of multipotent mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells, the support of neutrophil differentiation and responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a heterocellular composition including the presence of a hematopoietic stem/progenitor (HSPC) cluster expressing genes of fetal HSCs. BMO-derived HSPCs also exhibited lymphoid potential and a subset demonstrated transient engraftment potential upon xenotransplantation in mice. We show that the BMOs could enable the modeling of hematopoietic developmental aspects and inborn errors of hematopoiesis, as shown for human VPS45 deficiency. Thus, iPSC-derived BMOs serve as a physiologically relevant in vitro model of the human BM microenvironment to study hematopoietic development and BM diseases.", "journal": "Nature methods", "date": "2024-02-20", "authors": ["StephanieFrenz-Wiessner", "Savannah DFairley", "MaximilianBuser", "IsabelGoek", "KirillSalewskij", "GustavJonsson", "DavidIllig", "BenedictaZu Putlitz", "DanielPetersheim", "YueLi", "Pin-HsuanChen", "MartinaKalauz", "RaffaeleConca", "MichaelSterr", "JohannaGeuder", "YokoMizoguchi", "Remco T AMegens", "Monika ILinder", "DanielKotlarz", "MartinaRudelius", "Josef MPenninger", "CarstenMarr", "ChristophKlein"], "doi": "10.1038/s41592-024-02172-2"}
{"title": "PIBF1 regulates trophoblast syncytialization and promotes cardiovascular development.", "abstract": "Proper placental development in early pregnancy ensures a positive outcome later on. The developmental relationship between the placenta and embryonic organs, such as the heart, is crucial for a normal pregnancy. However, the mechanism through which the placenta influences the development of embryonic organs remains unclear. Trophoblasts fuse to form multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts (SynT), which primarily make up the placental materno-fetal interface. We discovered that endogenous progesterone immunomodulatory binding factor 1 (PIBF1) is vital for trophoblast differentiation and fusion into SynT in humans and mice. PIBF1 facilitates communication between SynT and adjacent vascular cells, promoting vascular network development in the primary placenta. This process affected the early development of the embryonic cardiovascular system in mice. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that PIBF1 promotes the development of cardiovascular characteristics in heart organoids. Our findings show how SynTs organize the barrier and imply their possible roles in supporting embryogenesis, including cardiovascular development. SynT-derived factors and SynT within the placenta may play critical roles in ensuring proper organogenesis of other organs in the embryo.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2024-02-20", "authors": ["Jong GeolLee", "Jung-MinYon", "GlobinnaKim", "Seul-GiLee", "C-YoonKim", "Seung-ACheong", "Hyun-YiKim", "JiyoungYu", "KyunggonKim", "Young HoonSung", "Hyun JuYoo", "Dong-CheolWoo", "Jin KyungRho", "Chang HoonHa", "Chan-GiPack", "Seak HeeOh", "Joon SeoLim", "Yu MiHan", "Eui-JuHong", "Je KyungSeong", "Han-WoongLee", "Sang-WookLee", "Ki-UpLee", "Chong JaiKim", "Sang-YoonNam", "You SookCho", "In-JeoungBaek"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-024-45647-8\n10.1002/uog.13197\n10.1038/nature26002\n10.1016/j.placenta.2015.08.003\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.021793\n10.1007/s00246-018-1876-x\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00735\n10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80209-9\n10.1016/S1097-2765(05)00014-6\n10.1128/MCB.00370-08\n10.1038/srep20999\n10.1046/j.1365-2443.2003.00680.x\n10.1016/j.mce.2015.11.010\n10.1038/s41467-023-36740-5\n10.1111/j.1600-0897.2010.00833.x\n10.1038/nm.4244\n10.1111/j.1600-0897.2009.00699.x\n10.1016/j.jri.2015.02.006\n10.1016/j.jri.2016.07.003\n10.1016/j.clim.2021.108858\n10.1016/j.jri.2020.103150\n10.1038/s41598-020-59452-y\n10.1016/j.jri.2008.06.002\n10.1016/j.placenta.2015.02.002\n10.1073/pnas.2203071119\n10.1002/ijc.20326\n10.3389/fimmu.2021.717884\n10.3389/fcell.2021.674162\n10.1586/14789450.2014.947966\n10.3389/fphar.2014.00049\n10.1007/s12020-011-9519-5\n10.4049/jimmunol.171.11.5956\n10.1093/biolre/ioab219\n10.1073/pnas.1206322110\n10.1038/s41423-021-00739-z\n10.1172/jci.insight.85560\n10.3389/fimmu.2022.880438\n10.1002/(SICI)1526-968X(200002)26:2<113::AID-GENE3>3.0.CO;2-2\n10.1242/dev.00755\n10.1016/j.devcel.2005.02.001\n10.1007/s10456-021-09783-9\n10.1371/journal.pone.0048196\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3001782\n10.1083/jcb.202011133\n10.1038/ncb3201\n10.1038/s10038-018-0462-7\n10.1186/s12881-020-01130-x\n10.1038/nature07619\n10.1006/dbio.2000.0106\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.080\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.184937\n10.1095/biolreprod.104.030437\n10.1002/immu.200310005\n10.1016/j.jare.2020.09.002\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121860\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.039\n10.1038/s41598-018-22040-2\n10.1073/pnas.2200582119\n10.1073/pnas.1112304108\n10.1038/ncomms12422\n10.1006/dbio.1999.9306\n10.1242/dev.107409\n10.1007/978-3-030-11093-2_8\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.111011\n10.1038/s41586-019-1127-1\n10.1038/ncb3091\n10.1002/jcp.25649\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15433\n10.3389/fendo.2018.00570\n10.1016/j.placenta.2003.12.004\n10.1177/002215540004800704\n10.1038/77076\n10.1007/s00018-022-04363-6\n10.1038/nature09972\n10.1126/science.aam6607\n10.1038/s41390-019-0405-9\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.11.004\n10.1016/0378-1119(91)90434-D\n10.1210/jc.2003-031707\n10.1080/08977190701773070\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0457\n10.1371/journal.pone.0061506\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.01.038\n10.3389/fphys.2021.741699\n10.1002/pmic.201300553\n10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8\n10.1038/nbt.2477\n10.1038/nbt.3614"}

For autofluorescent imaging a LED device with a wavelength in the violet region of the spectrum (400\u00b110 nm) was used. Quantitative registration of the kinetics of accumulation and distribution of the photosensitizer was carried out using the method of local fluorescence spectroscopy by measuring the fluorescence spectra.\nThe measurements were made before applying the photosensitizer, 10, 20 and 30 minutes after application. The study showed that in most patients with erosive-ulcerative and bullous forms of lichen planus, the accumulation of the photosensitizer in the lesions on the oral mucosa increased as the exposure time increased from 20 to 30 minutes. The fastest accumulation of the photosensitizer occurred in the areas of mucosal lesions with the most pronounced vascularization, namely, in the area of the tongue and the bottom of the oral cavity.\nUsing the method of local fluorescence spectroscopy, the kinetics of accumulation and destruction of photosensitizer in pathological areas of the oral mucosa was determined, and therefore the optimal time of laser exposure to the lesion was determined.\n\u0418\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438

However, the unsatisfying repair outcome usually results from a disturbed intricate milieu and the lack of in situ mineralization resources. In this work, we have developed a composite hydrogel that mimics the natural bone healing processes and serves as a seedbed for bone regeneration. The oxidized silk fibroin and fibrin are incorporated as rigid geogrids, and amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and platelet-rich plasma serve as the fertilizers and loam, respectively. Encouragingly, the seedbed hydrogel demonstrates excellent mechanical and biomineralization properties as a stable scaffold and promotes vascularized bone regeneration in vivo. Additionally, the seedbed serves a succinate-like function via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and subsequently orchestrates the mitochondrial calcium uptake, further converting the exogenous ACP into endogenous ACP. Additionally, the seedbed hydrogel realizes the succession of calcium resources and promotes the evolution of the biotemplate from fibrin to collagen.

Children who present with these defects have multiple co-morbidities or have had previous surgeries. Surgical options include various tissue cover for these defects without longer term benefits. Vascularized autologous pericardial patch offers a better solution to these defects by providing vascularity and potential for remodelling in future.\n41 children (M:F of 24:17) were operated for large trachea-bronchial defects between January 2015 and August 2022. The median age of was 12 months with median weight of 8.9\u00a0kg (IQR 3.3\u00a0kg-17.7\u00a0kg) Causes leading to the central tracheal defect include failed repair of previous trachea-oesophageal fistula (TOF) (n\u00a0=\u00a021) and acquired fistula due to button battery injury (n\u00a0=\u00a011). Surgical repair consisted of autologous pedicled pericardial patch repair for the airway defect under cardiopulmonary bypass.\nThere were two operative deaths related to extensive sepsis and necrosis of reconstructed trachea. Four children had further reoperation with additional patch. Bronchoscopy was used as surveillance in all these children, with use of airway stents (biodegradable stent) in 9 children. The median ventilation time was 8 days, with tracheostomy being needed in 5 for long term support.\nAutologous pericardial patch is a versatile technique and can be used to salvage large tracheal defects when other method have failed or not feasible.

{"title": "Bone ingrowth into a porous structure is achieved by preceding fibrogenesis and vascularization.", "abstract": "Porous structures are frequently used in surgical implants to strengthen the interlocking power produced by bone ingrowth. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying bone ingrowth into a porous structure accompanied by vascularization. A nonbioactive polyetheretherketone implant with a 3D-printed porous structure was prepared and implanted in a bone hole created in the tibias of rabbits. We observed bone ingrowth in the same individual specimens immediately and at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-implantation using in-vivo computed tomography (CT). Furthermore, a detailed evaluation with blood vessels of each specimen at 2, 4, and 12 weeks was performed with ex-vivo CT and histological specimen. Additional histological evaluation was performed using thin sections of an implant made with thermoplastic polyurethane having the same structure. As a result, the bone invasion began after four weeks, when the construction of fibrous tissue and the spread of new blood vessels within the voids matured. As the bone matured in the load-bearing area, new blood vessels outside the bone matrix regressed. This longitudinal evaluation study suggests that preceding fibrogenesis and vascularization may be key in developing bone ingrowth. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A porous structure is an essential structure for dental and orthopedic implants because it provides strong fixation through bone invasion. Although it was known that vascularization was involved in this, the details were not known.

However, as soon as the dimensions of engineered tissue exceed the diffusion limit of oxygen and nutriments, a necrotic core forms leading to irreversible damage. To overcome this constraint, the establishment of a functional perfusion network is essential. In this work, digital light processing bioprinting is used to encapsulate endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in 3D light-cured hydrogel scaffolds to guide them toward vascular network formation. In these scaffolds, EPCs proliferate and self-organize within a few days into branched tubular structures with predefined geometry, forming capillary-like vascular tubes or trees of diameters in the range of 10 to 100\u00a0\u00b5m. Presenting a confluent monolayer wall of cells strongly connect by tight junctions around a central lumen-like space, these structures can be microinjected with a fluorescent dye and are stable for several weeks in vitro. These endothelial structures can be recovered and manipulated in an alginate patch without altering their shape or viability.

Replicating such trans-wall transport with spatial heterogeneity can empower synthetic fluidic systems to program fluid compositions spatiotemporally. However, it remains challenging as existing synthetic channel walls are typically impermeable or composed of homogeneous materials without functional heterogeneity. This work presents a vascular network-inspired fluidic system (VasFluidics), which is functionalizable for spatially different trans-wall transport. Facilitated by embedded three-dimensional (3D) printing, elastic, ultrathin, and semipermeable walls self-assemble electrostatically. Physicochemical reactions between fluids and walls are localized to vary the trans-wall molecules among separate regions, for instance, by confining solutions or locally immobilizing enzymes on the outside of channels. Therefore, fluid compositions can be regulated spatiotemporally, for example, to mimic blood changes during glucose absorption and metabolism.

Considering these constraints, we develop a platform to establish and monitor the formation of endothelial networks around mesenchymal and pancreatic islet spheroids, as well as blood vessel organoids generated from pluripotent stem cells, cultured for up to 30 days on-chip. We show that these networks establish functional connections with the endothelium-rich spheroids and vascular organoids, as they successfully provide intravascular perfusion to these structures.

{"title": "Exploring the potential of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to extract vascularization data from DCE-MRI in the presence of diffusion.", "abstract": "Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is widely used to assess tissue vascularization, particularly in oncological applications. However, the most widely used pharmacokinetic (PK) models do not account for contrast agent (CA) diffusion between neighboring voxels, which can limit the accuracy of the results, especially in cases of heterogeneous tumors. To address this issue, previous works have proposed algorithms that incorporate diffusion phenomena into the formulation. However, these algorithms often face convergence problems due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. In this work, we present a new approach to fitting DCE-MRI data that incorporates CA diffusion by using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). PINNs can be trained to fit measured data obtained from DCE-MRI while ensuring the mass conservation equation from the PK model. We compare the performance of PINNs to previous algorithms on different 1D cases inspired by previous works from literature. Results show that PINNs retrieve vascularization parameters more accurately from diffusion-corrected tracer-kinetic models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of PINNs compared to other traditional algorithms when faced with noisy or incomplete data. Overall, our results suggest that PINNs can be a valuable tool for improving the accuracy of DCE-MRI data analysis, particularly in cases where CA diffusion plays a significant role.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2024-02-17", "authors": ["DSainz-DeMena", "M AP\u00e9rez", "J MGarc\u00eda-Aznar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2023.104092"}

Several cell-based therapeutic systems through the culturing of potent stem cells on modified scaffolds have been developed to direct the burn healing challenges. In this context, a new regenerative platform based on boron (B) enriched-acellular sheep small intestine submucosa (AOSIS) scaffold was designed and used as a carrier for mesenchymal stem cells derived from Wharton's jelly (WJMSCs) aiming to promote the tissue healing in burn-induced rat models. hWJMSCs have been extracted from human extra-embryonic umbilical cord tissue. Thereafter, 96 third-degree burned Wistar male rats were divided into 4 groups. The animals that did not receive any treatment were considered as group A (control). Then, group B was treated just by AOSIS scaffold, group C was received cell-seeded AOSIS scaffold (hWJMSCs-AOSIS), and group D was covered by boron enriched-cell-AOSIS scaffold (B/hWJMSCs-AOSIS). Inflammatory factors, histopathological parameters, and the expression levels of epitheliogenic and angiogenic proteins were assessed on 5, 14 and 21 d post-wounding. Application of the B/hWJMSCs-AOSIS on full-thickness skin-burned wounds significantly reduced the volume of neutrophils and lymphocytes at day 21 post-burning, whilst the number of fibroblasts and blood vessels enhanced at this time. In addition, molecular and histological analysis of wounds over time further verified that the addition of boron promoted wound healing, with decreased inflammatory factors, stimulated vascularization, accelerated re-epithelialization, and enhanced expression levels of epitheliogenic genes. In addition, the boron incorporation amplified wound closure via increasing collagen deposition and fibroblast volume and activity.

This study presents a method for reconstructing the femoral head blood supply by anastomosing the intraosseous artery.\nThe femoral heads of six male Landrace swine were surgically exposed, and subcranial fractures of the femoral neck were intentionally created. Under microscopic guidance, the trophoblastic foramen of the posterior supporting artery was identified. Subsequently, a triangular bone window was carefully crafted to expose the intraosseous artery. Following the fixation of the femoral head, an anastomosis was performed between the intraosseous artery and the posterior inferior supporting artery located at the distal end of the fracture. The assessment of femoral head blood supply was conducted using Kirschner's pinhole and angiography techniques.\nThe anastomotic intraosseous artery exhibited a vibrant red color, indicating adequate blood perfusion, and demonstrated pulsatile flow. Observation through pinholes in the surface of the femoral head revealed continuous blood flow. Angiography further confirmed the successful circulation, as the contrast agent entered the inferior retinacular artery branch originating from the deep femoral artery. The contrast agent then proceeded to enter the femoral head through the retinacular artery, reaching the anastomosis site of the intraosseous artery. Notably, the angiography also revealed the presence of visible internal branches, highlighting the establishment of a functional vascular network.\nThe method of reconstructing the blood supply to the femoral head through anastomosis of the intraosseous artery enables utilization of the existing blood supply system within the femoral head. This study is just a preliminary study of this innovative technique that has the potential to prevent and/or treat femoral head necrosis following a femoral neck fracture. By restoring adequate blood flow to the affected area, this approach holds promise in preserving the viability and functionality of the femoral head, ultimately improving patient outcomes.", "journal": "Heliyon", "date": "2024-02-15", "authors": ["HongyuWang", "DingsongWang", "JiamingWan", "XiaosongWang", "RuixingHou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e25555\n10.1016/j.injury.2014.10.010\n10.2106/00004623-200200002-00002\n10.1007/s00113-016-0215-z\n10.1093/bmb/ldaa044\n10.1186/s12891-015-0790-0\n10.1002/jor.22346\n10.1371/journal.pone.0187447\n10.1002/micr.30029\n10.1007/s11999-017-5318-5\n10.1111/joa.12475\n10.1111/os.13319\n10.1097/BOT.0000000000000291\n10.3928/0147-7447-19961201-11\n10.1016/j.morpho.2020.06.003\n10.1002/micr.22179\n10.21037/atm-19-3344\n10.5301/HIP.2012.9247\n10.1097/00006534-200206000-00021\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2022.113026\n10.1016/j.cjtee.2017.02.003\n10.1016/j.injury.2014.04.002\n10.1111/os.12364"}
{"title": "Apela promotes blood vessel regeneration and remodeling in zebrafish.", "abstract": "In contrast to adult mammals, zebrafish display a high capacity to heal injuries and repair damage to various organs. One of the earliest responses to injury in adult zebrafish is revascularization, followed by tissue morphogenesis. Tissue vascularization entails the formation of a blood vessel plexus that remodels into arteries and veins. The mechanisms that coordinate these processes during vessel regeneration are poorly understood. Hence, investigating and identifying the factors that promote revascularization and vessel remodeling have great therapeutic potential. Here, we revealed that fin vessel remodeling critically depends on Apela peptide. We found that Apela selectively accumulated in newly formed zebrafish fin tissue and vessels. The temporal expression of Apela, Apln, and their receptor Aplnr is different during the regenerative process. While morpholino-mediated knockdown of Apela (Mo-Apela) prevented vessel remodeling, exogenous Apela peptide mediated plexus repression and the development of arteries in regenerated fins. In contrast, Apela enhanced subintestinal venous plexus formation (SIVP). The use of sunitinib completely inhibited vascular plexus formation in zebrafish, which was not prevented by exogenous application. Furthermore, Apela regulates the expression of vessel remolding-related genes including VWF, IGFPB3, ESM1, VEGFR2, Apln, and Aplnr, thereby linking Apela to the vascular plexus factor network as generated by the STRING online database. Together, our findings reveal a new role for Apela in vessel regeneration and remodeling in fin zebrafish and provide a framework for further understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in vessel regeneration.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2024-02-15", "authors": ["NicolasNys", "Abdel-MajidKhatib", "GeraldineSiegfried"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-023-50677-1\n10.1038/nrm3176\n10.1097/BOR.0b013e32835b13b6\n10.1006/dbio.2000.9995\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2003.08.016\n10.18632/oncotarget.7728\n10.1167/iovs.10-5176\n10.1038/nature10144\n10.1038/nchembio778\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.039\n10.18632/oncotarget.12257\n10.2174/1389450123666220826160123\n10.21037/atm.2020.02.07\n10.1016/j.devcel.2013.11.002\n10.1126/science.1248636\n10.1126/science.aam6607\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.08.014\n10.1038/srep08170\n10.1111/jcmm.15651\n10.1038/cdd.2013.175\n10.1038/79951\n10.1006/dbio.2002.0711\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011438\n10.1002/bdrc.10016\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.02.156\n10.1007/s12012-015-9315-1\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.167171\n10.1002/bdrc.21123\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.10.017\n10.1155/2022/4880355\n10.1007/s12272-022-01389-z\n10.3389/fonc.2020.00221\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.021\n10.1038/s41416-021-01330-z\n10.3390/cells11010099\n10.1093/abbs/gmx143\n10.7717/peerj.688\n10.1007/s00018-019-03351-7\n10.3389/fonc.2018.00248\n10.1038/ncomms14361\n10.1182/blood-2011-10-383729\n10.1016/j.devcel.2010.05.006\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000255990.91805.6d\n10.1038/nature03511\n10.1172/JCI80454\n10.1016/j.devcel.2015.02.024\n10.1182/blood-2011-04-348706\n10.1073/pnas.0702031104\n10.1073/pnas.0702072104\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.304718\n10.7150/ijbs.30100\n10.1093/nar/gky1131\n10.1172/JCI32040\n10.1172/jci.insight.129070"}

Extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels and porous synthetic polymer microspheres can be prepared for injectable administration to achieve in situ tissue regeneration. However, the rapid degradation of ECM hydrogels and the poor injectability and biological inertness of most polymeric microspheres limit their pro-regenerative capabilities. Here, we develop a biomaterial system consisting of elastic porous poly(l-lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone) (PLCL) microspheres mixed with ECM hydrogels as injectable composites with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) dual-release functionality. The developed multifunctional composites have favorable injectability and biocompatibility, and regulate the behavior of macrophages and myogenic cells following injection into muscle tissue. The elicited promotive effects on tissue regeneration are evidenced by enhanced neomusle formation, vascularization, and neuralization at 2-months post-implantation in a male rat model of volumetric muscle loss.

Case report.", "abstract": "Hemangiomas are the most common benign tumors of the head-neck region in children and mainly affect the face, oral mucosa, lips, and tongue. The base of tongue is an extremely rare site of involvement. The incidence is higher in women and occur more frequently in infants and childhood.\nWe present a rare case of cavernous hemangioma of the base of tongue in a 70-year-old male patient surgically removed by Transoral Ultrasonic Surgery (TOUSS). 1-year follow up didn't show sign of recurrence.\nHemangiomas are benign proliferations of endothelial cells common in the head and neck. The etiology is uncertain: an imbalance in angiogenesis related to substances such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF) with uncontrolled proliferation of vascular elements is proposed. It can be asymptomatic or, when affecting the tongue, lead to difficulty swallowing, pain, bleeding and dyspnea.\nThis case report aims to stress that hemangioma should be considered in differential diagnosis in case of richly vascularized tongue base lesion, also in adult population.

Site prevascularization has been developed to enhance islet survivability in the subcutaneous zone while minimizing potential foreign body immune responses. Molecular communication between the host and prevascularized implant site remains ill-defined. Poly(ethylene oxide)s (PEOs) of various hydrated radii (i.e., \u223c11-62 \u00c5) were injected into prevascularized subcutaneous sites in C57BL/6 mice, and the clearance and organ biodistribution were characterized. Prevascularization formed a barrier that confined the molecules compared with the unmodified site. Molecular clearance from the prevascularized site was inversely proportional to the molecular weight. The upper limit in molecular size for entering the vasculature to be cleared was determined to be 35 kDa MW PEO. These findings provide insight into the impact of vascularization on molecular retention at the injection site and the effect of molecular size on the mobility of hydrophilic molecules from the prevascularized site to the host.

{"title": "Extracellular vesicles produced by irradiated endothelial or Glioblastoma stem cells promote tumor growth and vascularization modulating tumor microenvironment.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor in adult, characterized by highly aggressive and infiltrative growth. The current therapeutic management of GBM includes surgical resection followed by ionizing radiations and chemotherapy. Complex and dynamic interplay between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment drives the progression and contributes to therapeutic resistance. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the intercellular communication by delivering bioactive molecules in the surrounding milieu modulating tumor microenvironment.\nIn this study, we isolated by ultracentrifugation EVs from GBM stem-like cell (GSC) lines and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) exposed or not to ionizing irradiation. After counting and characterization, we evaluated the effects of exposure of GSCs to EVs isolated from endothelial cells and vice versa. The RNA content of EVs isolated from GSC lines and HMVECs exposed or not to ionizing irradiation, was analyzed by RNA-Seq. Periostin (POSTN) and Filamin-B (FLNB) emerged in gene set enrichment analysis as the most interesting transcripts enriched after irradiation in endothelial cell-derived EVs and GSC-derived EVs, respectively. POSTN and FLNB expression was modulated and the effects were analyzed by in vitro assays.\nWe confirmed that ionizing radiations increased EV secretion by GSCs and normal endothelial cells, affected the contents of and response to cellular secreted EVs. Particularly, GSC-derived EVs decreased radiation-induced senescence and promoted migration in HMVECs whereas, endothelial cell-derived EVs promoted tumorigenic properties and endothelial differentiation of GSCs. RNA-Seq analysis of EV content, identified FLNB and POSTN as transcripts enriched in EVs isolated after irradiation from GSCs and HMVECs, respectively. Assays performed on POSTN overexpressing GSCs confirmed the ability of POSTN to mimic the effects of endothelial cell-derived EVs on GSC migration and clonogenic abilities and transdifferentiation potential. Functional assays performed on HMVECs after silencing of FLNB supported its role as mediator of the effects of GSC-derived EVs on senescence and migration.\nIn this study, we identified POSTN and FLNB as potential mediators of the effects of EVs on GSC and HMVEC behavior confirming that EVs play a crucial role in the intercellular communication by delivering bioactive molecules in the surrounding milieu modulating tumor microenvironment.", "journal": "Cancer cell international", "date": "2024-02-13", "authors": ["GiorgiaCastellani", "MariachiaraBuccarelli", "Quintino GiorgioD'Alessandris", "RamonaIlari", "AndreaCappannini", "FrancescaPedini", "AlessandraBoe", "ValentinaLulli", "IsabellaParolini", "StefanoGiannetti", "MauroBiffoni", "VincenzoZappavigna", "GiovannaMarziali", "RobertoPallini", "LuciaRicci-Vitiani"], "doi": "10.1186/s12935-024-03253-0\n10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70025-7\n10.1159/000455842\n10.3390/ijms24054883\n10.1101/gad.324301.119\n10.1038/nature05236\n10.1038/nature11287\n10.1093/neuonc/now304\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.11.020\n10.4161/cc.9.15.12710\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0167\n10.1038/onc.2015.317\n10.3390/jpm12101625\n10.1096/fj.02-0557fje\n10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.081\n10.1101/gad.261982.115\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.07.007\n10.3389/fendo.2017.00194\n10.1146/annurev-cellbio-101512-122326\n10.1038/cdd.2008.72\n10.1038/nature09557\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0644\n10.1002/ijc.33370\n10.1007/978-1-4939-3753-0_16\n10.1038/s41379-018-0046-2\n10.1084/jem.20040921\n10.1098/rsif.2018.0709\n10.1186/s13046-021-02031-4\n10.1093/biosci/biv084\n10.3402/jev.v4.27066\n10.1038/ncb1800\n10.1074/jbc.M109.062984\n10.1007/978-981-13-6657-4_13\n10.1038/s41587-020-0546-8\n10.3390/biology12050736\n10.1186/s13287-015-0150-x\n10.3390/biomedicines10010112\n10.1038/ncb1725\n10.1016/j.celrep.2013.10.050\n10.1186/s12964-021-00760-9\n10.3390/ijms23052770\n10.1074/mcp.M900381-MCP200\n10.1186/1471-2407-12-421\n10.1593/tlo.13640\n10.1074/jbc.273.28.17531\n10.1074/jbc.M804888200\n10.1073/pnas.0608360104\n10.1007/s11060-013-1124-4\n10.1074/mcp.M111.008466\n10.1093/jnen/nlaa067\n10.1038/ncb3090"}

Environmental factors, perinatal outcomes, and fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with ROP were evaluated, comparing ROP with non-ROP newborns. A lasso logistic regression was performed to select variables; then, a conditional logistic regression was used to identify ROP maternal and perinatal risk factors adjusting by maternal and gestational ages, respectively.\nROP maternal risk factors were alcohol intake, periodontal infections, and severe stress. Respiratory distress, sepsis, and intracranial hemorrhage were the ROP perinatal risk factors. Markers rs186085 of EPAS1 and rs427832 of AGTR1 were significantly associated with ROP newborns.\nWe identified three maternal and three perinatal risk factors associated with ROP.

{"title": "Enhancing Fat Graft Survival via Upregulating Autophagy of Adipocytes.", "abstract": "Autophagy is a cellular self-protection mechanism. The upregulation of adipose-derived stem cells' (ADSCs) autophagy can promote fat graft survival. However, the effect of interfering with adipocyte autophagy on graft survival is still unknown. In addition, autophagy is involved in adipocyte dedifferentiation. We investigated the effect of autophagy on adipocyte dedifferentiation and fat graft survival.\nThe classic autophagy regulatory drugs rapamycin (100\u00a0nM) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA; 10\u00a0mM) were used to treat adipocytes, adipocyte dedifferentiation was observed, and their effects on ADSCs were detected. In our experiments, 100\u00a0nM rapamycin, 10\u00a0mM 3-MA and saline were mixed with human adipose tissue and transplanted into nude mice. At 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks postoperatively, the grafts were harvested for histological and immunohistochemical analysis.\nRapamycin and 3-MA can promote and inhibit adipocyte dedifferentiation by regulating autophagy. Both drugs can inhibit ADSC proliferation, and 10\u00a0mM 3-MA can inhibit ADSC adipogenesis. At weeks 8 and 12, the volume retention rate of the rapamycin group (8 weeks, 64.77%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.36%; 12 weeks, 56.13%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.73%) was higher than the control group (8 weeks, 52.62%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.04%; P\u2009<\u20090.05; 12 weeks, 43.17%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.02%; P\u2009<\u20090.05) and the rapamycin group had more viable adipocytes and better vascularization. Compared with the control group, the volume retention rate, viable adipocytes and vascularization of the 3-MA group decreased.\nRapamycin can promote adipocyte dedifferentiation by upregulating autophagy to promote fat graft survival. 3-MA can inhibit graft survival, but its mechanism includes the inhibition of adipocyte dedifferentiation and ADSC proliferation and adipogenesis.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each submission to which Evidence-Based Medicine rankings are applicable.

{"title": "Intracranial solitary fibrous tumor in a 15-year-old girl: illustrative case.", "abstract": "Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is an infrequent spindle cell tumor derived from mesenchymal tissue, which can manifest in diverse anatomical locations, primarily in the pleural cavity and infrequently in the central nervous system. SFT is predominantly observed in individuals aged between 40 and 50 years old, with a slightly higher occurrence in males than in females.\nThis case report describes a female, age 15, who had migraines for 2 months prior to the diagnosis of an intracranial tumor. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass located in the right parietooccipital region with surrounding edema and a compressed right lateral ventricle. Neurosurgery was utilized to successfully remove the mass, and single intracranial fibrous tumor (grade I) was identified by postoperative pathological analysis. During an 8-month follow-up period, the patient did not experience any recurrences.\nSFT is often misdiagnosed as meningioma because of their similar imaging characteristics. However, identifying the distinctive features of SFT on magnetic resonance imaging can distinguish it from meningioma and help to select appropriate treatment. The complete preoperative imaging data for this case indicated a highly vascularized tumor. Preoperative vascular embolization treatment reduced any difficulties during the subsequent tumor resection and minimized intraoperative bleeding.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

Organ-on-chip (OOC) technologies can potentially recreate physiological features and hold great promise for tissue and disease modeling. However, the non-standardized design of these chips and perfusion control systems has been a barrier to quantitative high-throughput screening (HTS). Here we present a scalable OOC microfluidic platform for applied kinetic in vitro assays (AKITA) that is applicable for high, medium, and low throughput. Its standard 96-well plate and 384-well plate layouts ensure compatibility with existing laboratory workflows and high-throughput data collection and analysis tools. The AKITA plate is optimized for the modeling of vascularized biological barriers, primarily the blood-brain barrier, skin, and lung, with precise flow control on a custom rocker. The integration of trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) sensors allows rapid and repeated monitoring of barrier integrity over long time periods.

One year after surgery, the mean Circumferential Reduction Rate (CRR) resulted 44.62 (range; 27.4-60.3). Infections' rates presented a statistically significant reduction, from an average of 2.4 (range; 1-4) to 0.2 (range; 0-1) episodes per year. Life quality index measured with the LYMQOL questionnaire showed significant improvement after 1\u2009year, from a mean score of 3.28 (range; 2-5) to 8.12 (range; 7-9).\nWhen compared with Literature evidence, the results of the current study are in line with both VLN inset ways related to BCRL treatment. An optimal therapeutic choice should consider benefits and drawbacks of each orthotopic and heterotopic VLNT, taking into account surgeon's preference and experience and patients' related factors and expectations.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2024-02-12", "authors": ["FedericoLo Torto", "JusteKaciulyte", "FilippoDi Meglio", "MarcoMarcasciano", "ManfrediGreco", "DiegoRibuffo"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.31147"}
{"title": "First description of a primary esophageal histiocytic sarcoma in a dog.", "abstract": "An 11-year-old male Schnauzer dog was referred for investigation of cough and regurgitation of one month duration and gradual hyporexia for the previous five months. Complete blood count showed severe leukocytosis. On ventrodorsal and lateral thoracic radiographs a soft tissue mass was visible in the craniodorsal mediastinum. Endoscopy showed esophageal dilatation and an irregular, nodular, friable, exophytic mass in the thoracic esophagus, which was invasive, vascularized and had ulcerated areas. The mass occluded approximately 90% of the esophageal lumen. The mucosa in the orad portion of the thoracic esophagus was pale and the aborad portion was hyperemic (red) with hemorrhages. The mucosa of the cervical and abdominal esophagus was macroscopically unremarkeble. Multiple biopsies using endoscopic cup biopsy forceps were taken from the mass for histopathologic analysis and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was performed. Histopathologic analysis of the biopsy samples was inconclusive due to the marked necrosis. The poor clinical condition of the dog precluded a more invasive approach, and palliative and supportive treatment was continued. After 100 days of follow-up, clinical signs worsened, and that day the dog had a fatal cardiac arrest due to aspiration pneumonia and sepsis. Postmortem examination showed a multilobulated mass in the esophageal wall with infiltration into the overlying esophageal mucosa and pulmonary and renal metastases. Histological examination revealed a poorly differentiated sarcoma. On immunohistochemical examination, the neoplastic cells showed marked cytoplasmic staining for vimentin and Iba-1. The proliferative rate was approximately 30% by Ki-67. Histological and immunohistochemical examination revealed the esophageal mass to be a primary histiocytic sarcoma. Histiocytic sarcoma is an extremely rare primary esophageal neoplasm in humans, and so far, there is no description in dogs. To the best of the authors knowledge this is the first case of primary esophageal histiocytic sarcoma in dogs. The clinical information reported here should improve recognition and aid in diagnosis of future cases.", "journal": "Topics in companion animal medicine", "date": "2024-02-12", "authors": ["Anelise BonillaTrindade-Gerardi", "Camila Alvesda Silveira", "JanyniDuz", "Isabella Teixeira Ca\u00e7apietra Piresda Silva", "Tain\u00e3 NormantonGuim", "Saulo PetinattiPavarini", "CristianoGomes", "Daniel Guimar\u00e3esGerardi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tcam.2024.100856"}
{"title": "Vascularization of a bone stump.", "abstract": "Aim To study the character of blood circulation in the bone stump at tight and loose closure of the medullary cavity. Methods Two series of experiments on 39 rabbits with mid-third femoral amputation and muscular plasty were carried out. In the 1st (experimental) series, the bone scapula was closed by thin cortical autograft taken from the epimetaphyseal area, and then the muscles were sutured, and in the 2nd - the scapula was closed by myoplasty only. Follow-up periods: 1st series - 7, 14, 21 days and 1, 3, 6 months, 2nd series - 1, 3, 6 months. Histological methods with infusion of vessels with ink-gelatin mixture and morphometry was used. Results In the 1st series there was a rapid restoration of the disturbed macro- and microcirculation due to the reserve sources of blood circulation and the development of extravascular ways of microcirculation. In the 2nd series, blood circulation recovery was significantly slower and occurred mainly due to the development of extravascular microcirculatory pathways.

{"title": "Balancing macrophage polarization via stem cell-derived apoptotic bodies for diabetic wound healing.", "abstract": "Adipose tissue-derived stem cell-derived apoptotic bodies (ADSC-ABs) have shown great potential for immunomodulation and regeneration, particularly in diabetic wound therapy. However, their local application has been limited by unclear regulatory mechanisms, rapid clearance, and short tissue retention times.\nWe analyzed the key role molecules and regulatory pathways of ADSC-ABs in regulating inflammatory macrophages by mRNA sequencing and microRNA (miRNA) sequencing and then verified them by gene knockdown. To prevent rapid clearance, we employed microfluidics technology to prepare methacrylate-anhydride gelatin (GelMA) microspheres (GMS) for controlled release of ABs. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of ADSC-AB-laden GMSs (ABs@GMSs) in a diabetic rat wound model.\nOur results demonstrated that ADSC-ABs effectively balanced macrophage inflammatory polarization through the janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, mediated by miR-20a-5p. Furthermore, we showed that AB@GMSs had good biocompatibility, significantly delayed local clearance of ABs, and ameliorated diabetic wound inflammation and promoted vascularization, thus facilitating its healing.\nOur study reveals the regulatory mechanism of ADSC-ABs in balancing macrophage inflammatory polarization and highlightsthe importance of delaying their local clearance by GMSs. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapies for diabetic wound healing.\nThis research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFA0908200), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82272263, 82002053, 32000937, and 82202467), Shanghai \"Rising Stars of Medical Talents\" Youth Development Program (22MC1940300), Shanghai Municipal Health Commission (20204Y0354), and Shanghai Science and Technology Development Funds (22YF1421400).", "journal": "Med (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2024-02-11", "authors": ["JiayiMao", "ShutongQian", "QiuyuZhao", "BinfanZhao", "BolunLu", "LiuchengZhang", "XiyuanMao", "YuguangZhang", "WenguoCui", "XiaomingSun"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medj.2024.01.006"}

Current methodologies struggle with imaging artifacts and clarity issues, particularly under low-light conditions and when using various high-speed CMOS sensors. These challenges are particularly pronounced when diagnosing and classifying diseases such as branch vein occlusion (BVO). To address these issues, we have developed a novel network based on topological structure generation, which transitions from superficial to deep retinal layers to enhance OCTA segmentation accuracy. Our approach not only demonstrates improved performance through qualitative visual comparisons and quantitative metric analyses but also effectively mitigates artifacts caused by low-light OCTA, resulting in reduced noise and enhanced clarity of the images. Furthermore, our system introduces a structured methodology for classifying BVO diseases, bridging a critical gap in this field. The primary aim of these advancements is to elevate the quality of OCTA images and bolster the reliability of their segmentation.

However, the unpredictable and redundant mechanisms of vascularization and immune suppression triggered by tumor-specific hypoxic microenvironments indicate that such combination therapies need to be further evaluated to improve patient outcomes.

{"title": "Significantly Improved Cold Preservation of Rat Hind Limb Vascularized Composite Allografts Using the New PrC-210 Free Radical Scavenger.", "abstract": "Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) represents a promising reconstructive solution primarily conducted to improve quality of life. However, tissue damage caused by cold-ischemia (CI) storage prior to transplant represents a major factor limiting widespread application. This study investigates the addition of the novel free radical scavenger PrC-210 to UW Organ Preservation Solution (UW Solution) to suppress CI-induced skeletal muscle injury in a rat hind limb amputation model. Lewis rats received systemic perfusion of UW solution +/- PrC-210 (0 mM control, 10 mM, 20 mM, 30 mM, or 40 mM), followed by bilateral transfemoral amputation. Limbs were stored in 40 mL of the same perfusate at 4 \u00b0C for 48 h. Muscle punch biopsies were taken at set times over the 48 h cold-storage period and analyzed for caspase-3,7 activity, cytochrome C levels, and qualitative histology. A single 15 s perfusion of PrC-210-containing UW Solution conferred a dose-dependent reduction in CI-induced muscle cell death over 48 h. In the presence of PrC-210, muscle cell mitochondrial cytochrome C release was equivalent to 0 h controls, with profound reductions in the caspase-3,7 apoptotic marker that correlated with limb histology. PrC-210 conferred complete prevention of ROS-induced mitochondrial lysis in vitro, as measured by cytochrome C release. We conclude that the addition of 30 mM PrC210 to UW Solution conferred the most consistent reduction in CI limb damage, and it warrants further investigation for clinical application in the VCA setting.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2024-02-10", "authors": ["William EFahl", "Zeeda HNkana", "Maya MGitter", "WeifengZeng", "Aaron MDingle"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms25031609\n10.1097/MOT.0000000000000567\n10.1016/j.apmr.2007.11.005\n10.1007/s12018-018-9252-1\n10.1097/MOT.0000000000000703\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000008846\n10.1016/j.trre.2022.100708\n10.1016/j.tem.2009.04.001\n10.1016/j.cmet.2006.02.011\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2017.09.013\n10.1097/00000658-199206000-00004\n10.1038/aps.2017.182\n10.1136/bmj.g255\n10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.10.011\n10.1097/TXD.0000000000000909\n10.1186/2047-783X-19-28\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.09.019\n10.1016/j.jss.2009.08.031\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e31821b6352\n10.1097/TXD.0000000000001032\n10.1101/cshperspect.a012559\n10.1016/0165-022X(84)90042-3"}
{"title": "A Systematic Review of Tear Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and External Eye Diseases.", "abstract": "We aim to summarize the current evidence of Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)s in external eye diseases and determine whether serum and plasma VEGF levels are associated with tear and ocular surface tissues. A systematic search of PUBMED and EMBASE was conducted using PRISMA guidelines between October 2022 and November 2023, with no restriction on language or publication date. Search terms included relevant MESH terms. These studies were evaluated for quality, and an assessment of the risk of bias was also carried out. Extracted data were then visually represented through relevant tables or figures. The initial literature search yielded 777 studies from PUBMED, 944 studies from EMBASE, and 10 studies from manual searches. Fourteen eligible studies were identified from 289 articles published from 2000 to 2023 in the English language or with English translations, including rabbit models, murine models, and human-derived samples. Most studies were retrospective in nature and case-control studies. Various common external eye diseases, such as dry eye disease (DED) and allergic eye disease were investigated. Despite limitations and small sample sizes, researchers have found elevated tissue levels of the VEGF in the vascularized cornea, especially in animal models, but there is no evidence of clear changes in the tear concentrations of VEGF in DED and allergic eye disease. Tear VEGF is associated with corneal vascularization.

A Study in Boxer and Dobermann Dogs.", "abstract": "The anatomical and functional characteristics of the placenta influence the adaptive ability of the fetus to the extrauterine environment. Placental efficiency, measured as the gram of neonate produced by each gram of placenta, summarizes these characteristics. In the present study, placental efficiency and its impact on the 7-day postpartum life of the puppies were studied in canine large breeds.\nPlacental efficiency (PE) was computed using chorioallantois weight (WPE) and surface (SPE) efficiency for puppies born from natural delivery or elective cesarean section. Capillary density was also histologically determined. Neonate viability was estimated by the APGAR score and the daily weight gain (DWG) was recorded on day 7 after delivery.\nfrom 15 large-breed bitches, 69 live puppies were born by natural delivery (24 puppies) and elective cesarean section (45 puppies). Cluster analysis detected a group of neonates for which reduced placental efficiency (8 for the WPE, 9 for the SPE) was identified, despite a placental weight and surface within the mean and no difference in capillary density. In this group, the DWG was lower and the mortality within 7 days was higher.\nthe results suggest that placental efficiency could be an additional tool for the evaluation of a puppy in the first 7 days after delivery.", "journal": "Animals : an open access journal from MDPI", "date": "2024-02-10", "authors": ["AlessiaGloria", "Maria CristinaVeronesi", "AlbertoContri"], "doi": "10.3390/ani14030423\n10.1016/0143-4004(91)90504-9\n10.1016/j.ajog.2015.07.050\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.04.041\n10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.02.003\n10.1186/1477-7827-2-46\n10.1016/j.placenta.2012.02.008\n10.1093/ije/dys116\n10.1016/j.placenta.2013.07.063\n10.1016/j.placenta.2011.09.001\n10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.08.028\n10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.104746\n10.1113/jphysiol.2009.173013\n10.1530/biosciprocs.16.0016\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00028\n10.1113/jphysiol.2008.156133\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00056.2006\n10.1007/s004290050284\n10.3390/ani11051418\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.08.017\n10.1016/j.domaniend.2013.07.002\n10.1071/RD10064\n10.1016/j.jfms.2011.05.009\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.03.010\n10.3390/ani7060043\n10.5326/0380090\n10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.03.003\n10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.01.007\n10.1111/vsu.13868\n10.1136/vr.142.22.602\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.07.027\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2013.07.006\n10.1111/jvp.13388\n10.1186/1751-0147-49-8\n10.1007/978-3-642-66603-2\n10.1093/ije/dyl080\n10.1136/bmj.301.6746.259\n10.1093/aje/kwp182\n10.1016/j.rbmo.2012.03.017\n10.1002/bdra.20345\n10.1016/S0143-4004(84)80002-8\n10.1152/jappl.1979.46.4.828\n10.1016/0026-0495(95)90063-2\n10.1016/S0002-9378(99)70675-7\n10.1152/ajpregu.00789.2004\n10.1096/fj.08-116889\n10.1677/joe.0.1500231\n10.1095/biolreprod64.6.1821\n10.1113/jphysiol.2003.039511\n10.1113/jphysiol.2005.104430\n10.1053/plac.2002.0858\n10.3390/ani13121928\n10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.12.023\n10.3390/ani13233605"}

{"title": "Spatiotemporal expression profiles of c-Mpl mRNA in the tooth germ: Comparative expression dynamics of vascularization-related genes.", "abstract": "Vascularization is an essential event for both embryonic organ development and tissue repair in adults. During mouse tooth development, endothelial cells migrate into dental papilla during the cap stage, and form blood vessels through angiogenesis. Megakaryocytes and/or platelets, as other hematopoietic cells, express angiogenic molecules and can promote angiogenesis in adult tissues. However, it remains unknown which cells are responsible for attracting and leading blood vessels through the dental papilla during tooth development.\nHere we analyzed the spatiotemporal expression of c-Mpl mRNA in developing molar teeth of fetal mice. Expression patterns were then compared with those of several markers of hematopoietic cells as well as of angiogenic elements including CD41, erythropoietin receptor, CD34, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Tie-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor2 (VEGFR2) through in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry.\nCells expressing c-Mpl mRNA was found in several parts of the developing tooth germ, including the peridental mesenchyme, dental papilla, enamel organ, and dental lamina. This expression occurred in a spatiotemporally controlled fashion. CD41-expressing cells were not detected during tooth development. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of c-Mpl mRNA in the dental papilla was similar to that of Ang-1, which preceded invasion of endothelial cells. Eventually, at the early bell stage, the c-Mpl mRNA signal was detected in morphologically differentiating odontoblasts that accumulated in the periphery of the dental papilla along the inner enamel epithelium layer of the future cusp region.\nDuring tooth development, several kinds of cells express c-Mpl mRNA in a spatiotemporally controlled fashion, including differentiating odontoblasts. We hypothesize that c-Mpl-expressing cells appearing in the forming dental papilla at the cap stage are odontoblast progenitor cells that migrate to the site of odontoblast differentiation. There they attract vascular endothelial cells into the forming dental papilla and lead cells toward the inner enamel epithelium layer through production of angiogenic molecules (e.g., Ang-1) during migration to the site of differentiation. C-Mpl may regulate apoptosis and/or proliferation of expressing cells in order to execute normal development of the tooth.", "journal": "Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft", "date": "2024-02-10", "authors": ["MasatakaSunohara", "ShigeruMorikawa", "KazutoShimada", "KingoSuzuki"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aanat.2024.152227"}

This retrospective case-control study aimed to determine the implant survival/success rates in different vascularized bone grafts and potential risk factors.\nOnly patients who received implants in free vascularized bone grafts between 2012 and 2020 were included. The free flap donor sites were the fibula, iliac crest, and scapula. The prosthetic restoration had to be completed, and the observation period had to be over one year after implantation. Implant success was defined according to the Health Scale for Dental Implants criteria.\nSixty-two patients with 227 implants were included. The implant survival rate was 86.3% after an average of 48.7\u00a0months. The causes of implant loss were peri-implantitis (n\u2009=\u200924), insufficient osseointegration (n\u2009=\u20091), removal due to tumor recurrence (n\u2009=\u20091), and osteoradionecrosis (n\u2009=\u20095). Of all implants, 52.4% were classified as successful, 19.8% as compromised, and 27.8% as failed. Removal of osteosynthesis material prior to or concurrent with implant placement resulted in significantly better implant success than material not removed (p\u2009=\u20090.035).

{"title": "Shaping the Neurovascular Unit Exploiting Human Brain Organoids.", "abstract": "Brain organoids, three-dimensional cell structures derived from pluripotent stem cells, closely mimic key aspects of the human brain in vitro, providing a powerful tool for studying neurodevelopment and disease. The neuroectodermal induction protocol employed for brain organoid generation primarily gives rise to the neural cellular component but lacks the vital vascular system, which is crucial for the brain functions by regulating differentiation, migration, and circuit formation, as well as delivering oxygen and nutrients. Many neurological diseases are caused by dysfunctions of cerebral microcirculation, making vascularization of human brain organoids an important tool for pathogenetic and translational research. Experimentally, the creation of vascularized brain organoids has primarily focused on the fusion of vascular and brain organoids, on organoid transplantation in vivo, and on the use of microfluidic devices to replicate the intricate microenvironment of the human brain in vitro. This review summarizes these efforts and highlights the importance of studying the neurovascular unit in a forward-looking perspective of leveraging their use for understanding and treating neurological disorders.", "journal": "Molecular neurobiology", "date": "2024-02-09", "authors": ["MafaldaRizzuti", "ValentinaMelzi", "LorenzoBrambilla", "LorenzoQuetti", "LucaSali", "LindaOttoboni", "MegiMeneri", "AntoniaRatti", "FedericoVerde", "NicolaTicozzi", "Giacomo PietroComi", "StefaniaCorti", "ElenaAbati"], "doi": "10.1007/s12035-024-03998-9\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.082\n10.1152/ajpcell.00120.2020\n10.1016/j.gde.2022.101955\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.10.003\n10.1126/science.aau5729\n10.3390/ijms22052659\n10.1186/s12929-017-0362-8\n10.1517/17460441.2015.1037737\n10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146561\n10.1038/s41578-021-00279-y\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.11.017\n10.1038/s41586-022-05219-6\n10.1038/nature12517\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.05.022\n10.1038/nrn.2017.107\n10.1016/j.neuron.2018.10.007\n10.1038/nprot.2014.158\n10.1016/j.neuron.2014.06.015\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.067\n10.1073/pnas.1613113113\n10.1038/nrn3114\n10.1038/nbt.4133\n10.1016/j.ceb.2017.01.001\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.05.013\n10.1002/med.21922\n10.1038/nmeth.3415\n10.1073/pnas.1315710110\n10.3389/fnins.2020.00538\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.07.035\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.017\n10.1073/pnas.1520760112\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.032\n10.1038/nature22330\n10.1038/nature22047\n10.1038/s41467-018-06684-2\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.06.034\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2022.08.013\n10.1016/j.stem.2016.07.005\n10.1038/s41531-019-0078-4\n10.3389/fneur.2020.01005\n10.3390/ijms241411427\n10.1016/j.nec.2010.03.011\n10.1038/386671a0\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07174.x\n10.1038/nrn1387\n10.1038/s41593-021-00904-7\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.07.030\n10.1042/CS20160720\n10.1002/stem.2577\n10.1038/nm0603-661\n10.1038/s41592-019-0586-5\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2015.12.016\n10.1002/jnr.21787\n10.1155/2015/105828\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.02.012\n10.1016/j.trsl.2022.12.003\n10.1039/D1LC00535A\n10.1242/dev.01794\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3000705\n10.1038/s41598-019-52204-7\n10.1097/WNR.0000000000001014\n10.1038/srep01500\n10.1038/ncomms15623\n10.1038/s41598-018-25603-5\n10.1038/s41598-020-66487-8\n10.1038/s41598-019-42439-9\n10.15283/ijsc21157\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.079\n10.3390/cells10082036\n10.1038/nbt.4127\n10.15283/ijsc20143\n10.1002/stem.3368\n10.1038/s41467-022-35536-3\n10.3389/fbioe.2021.664188\n10.1073/pnas.1105316108\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.005\n10.1039/c7ib00024c\n10.1039/c5lc01050k\n10.1039/c5lc00832h\n10.2217/rme-2016-0152\n10.3389/fbioe.2019.00039\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-090120-094330\n10.1126/science.aaw7894\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.06.002\n10.1063/5.0121476\n10.1038/s41592-019-0325-y\n10.1038/nbt.4226\n10.1177/1535370217694100\n10.1007/s00281-009-0177-0\n10.1016/j.nbd.2009.07.030\n10.1038/nature13185\n10.1038/s41598-020-69096-7\n10.1002/adbi.202000024\n10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110818\n10.1046/j.1471-4159.1997.68031135.x\n10.1016/j.neuron.2013.10.008\n10.1186/s12987-020-00202-7\n10.1016/j.cobme.2021.100341\n10.1016/j.addr.2023.114816\n10.3390/ijms21041539\n10.1002/advs.202101837\n10.1002/stem.306\n10.1186/2045-8118-10-33\n10.1038/s41467-019-10588-0\n10.1016/j.stem.2019.05.011\n10.3389/fbioe.2021.637048\n10.1038/s41582-022-00723-9\n10.1038/nm.3913\n10.1007/s00702-017-1795-7\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.1096054"}

The demand for constructed cardiac tissues (CCTs) to model and treat disease continues to grow. Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) manipulation, CRISPR gene editing, and 3D tissue culture have enabled a boom in iPSC-derived CCTs (iPSC-CCTs) with diverse cell types and architecture. Compared with 2D-cultured cells, iPSC-CCTs better recapitulate heart biology, demonstrating the potential to advance organ modeling, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine, though iPSC-CCTs could benefit from better methods to faithfully mimic heart physiology and electrophysiology.

{"title": "Enhancing Immunomodulatory Function of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells by Hydrogel Encapsulation.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) showcase remarkable immunoregulatory capabilities in vitro, positioning them as promising candidates for cellular therapeutics. However, the process of administering MSCs and the dynamic in vivo environment may impact the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions of MSCs, consequently influencing their survival, engraftment, and their immunomodulatory efficacy. Addressing these concerns, hydrogel encapsulation emerges as a promising solution to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of MSCs in vivo. Hydrogel, a highly flexible crosslinked hydrophilic polymer with a substantial water content, serves as a versatile platform for MSC encapsulation. Demonstrating improved engraftment and heightened immunomodulatory functions in vivo, MSCs encapsulated by hydrogel are at the forefront of advancing therapeutic outcomes. This review delves into current advancements in the field, with a focus on tuning various hydrogel parameters to elucidate mechanistic insights and elevate functional outcomes.

Extensive clinical studies have been conducted on cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells recently, as they can be easily proliferated using a straightforward, inexpensive protocol. Therefore, the function of CIK cells in regulating inflammatory environments has been drawing attention for clinical management. Throughout the current investigation, we discovered the regenerative capacity of these cells in the challenging environment of wounds that heal poorly due to diabetes. We demonstrated that the intravenous injection of CIK cells can re-establish a proregenerative inflammatory microenvironment, promote vascularization and, ultimately, accelerate skin healing in diabetic mice. The results indicated that CIK cell treatment affects macrophage polarization and restores the function of regenerative cells under hyperglycemic conditions. This novel cellular therapy offers a promising intervention for clinical applications through specific inflammatory regulation functions.", "journal": "Regenerative biomaterials", "date": "2024-02-09", "authors": ["YixiYang", "ChengZhang", "YuanJiang", "YijunHe", "JiaweiCai", "LinLiang", "ZhaohuanChen", "SichengPan", "ChuHua", "KekeWu", "LeWang", "ZhiyongZhang"], "doi": "10.1093/rb/rbad116"}

According to the European Laryngological Society classification, these loops are malignant vascular changes. This contradiction has high clinical importance; therefore, clarification of the clinical significance of type IV vascularization according to the Ni classification is needed.\nThe study was performed between June 2015 and December 2022. All recruited patients (n = 434) were symptomatic, with macroscopic laryngeal lesions (n = 674). Patients were investigated using the enhanced endoscopic methods of narrow band imaging (NBI) and the Storz Professional Image Enhancement System (IMAGE1 S). The microvascular patterns in the lesions were categorized according to Ni classification from 2011 and all lesions were examined histologically.\nA total of 674 lesions (434 patients) were investigated using flexible NBI endoscopy and IMAGE1 S endoscopy. Type IV vascularization was recognized in 293/674 (43.5%) lesions. Among these 293 lesions, 178 (60.7%) were benign (chronic laryngitis, hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, polyps, cysts, granulomas, Reinkeho oedema and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis); 9 (3.1%) were squamous cell carcinoma; 61 (20.8%) were mildly dysplastic, 29 (9.9%) were moderately dysplastic, 14 (4.8%) were severe dysplastic and 2 (0.7%) were carcinoma in situ. The ability to recognize histologically benign lesions in group of nonmalignant vascular pattern according to Ni (vascularization type I-IV) and distinguish them from precancers and malignancies was with accuracy 75.5%, sensitivity 54.4%, specificity 94.4%, positive predictive value 89.6% and negative predictive value 69.9%.\nLaryngeal lesions with type IV vascularization as defined by Ni present various histological findings, including precancerous and malignant lesions.

Herein, we hypothesized that melatonin-encapsuled silk Fibronin electrospun nanofibers (SF@MT) could provide intrinsic induction of both osteogenesis and angiogenesis, thereby promoting vascularized bone regeneration. The sustained release of melatonin from the SF@MT nanofibers resulted in favorable biocompatibility and superior osteogenic induction of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs). Interestingly, melatonin promoted the migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a BMMSC-dependent manner, potentially through the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) expression in SF@MT-cultured BMMSCs. SF@MT nanofibers enhanced the BMMSC-mediated angiogenesis by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. ", "journal": "Materials today.

{"title": "A highly soluble form of rutin for instant resolution of mask-wearing related disorders.", "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a new normal, necessitating the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) like face shields, surgical masks, gloves, and goggles. However, prolonged mask-wearing introduced skin-related issues due to changes in the skin's microenvironment, including increased humidity and temperature, as well as pressure on the skin. These factors led to skin deformation, vascular issues, edema, and inflammation, resulting in discomfort and cosmetic concerns. Clinical reports quickly highlighted the consequences of long-term mask use, including increased cases of \"maskne\" (mask-related acne) or mask-wearing related disorders such as rosacea flare-ups, skin-barrier defects, itching, erythema, redness, hyperpigmentation, and lichenification. Some of these issues, like inflammation, oxidative stress, and poor wound healing, could be directly linked to acne-related disorders or skin hypoxia.\nTo address these problems, researchers turned to rutin, a well-known flavonoid with antioxidant, vasoactive, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, rutin's poor water solubility presented a challenge for cosmetic formulations. To overcome this limitation, a highly water-soluble form of rutin was developed, making it suitable for use at higher concentrations.\nIn vitro and ex\u00a0vivo tests were conducted, as well as an innovative clinical trial including volunteers wearing surgical masks for at least 2\u2009h, to evaluate the biological activity of this soluble rutin on the main skin concerns associated with mask-wearing (inflammation, oxidative stress, skin repair, hyperpigmentation, and skin redness).\nThe in\u00a0vitro results showed that the active ingredient significantly reduced oxidative stress, improved wound healing, and reduced inflammation. In dark skin explants, the active ingredient significantly reduced melanin content, indicating its lightening activity. This effect was confirmed in the clinical study, where brown spots decreased significantly after 4\u2009days of application. Moreover, measurements on volunteers demonstrated a decrease in skin redness and vascularization after the active ingredient application, indicating inflammation and erythema reduction. Volunteers reported improved skin comfort.\nIn summary, the COVID-19 pandemic led to various skin issues associated with mask-wearing. A highly soluble form of rutin was developed, which effectively addressed these concerns by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and hyperpigmentation while promoting wound healing. This soluble rutin offers a promising solution for the rapid treatment of maskne-related disorders and other skin problems caused by prolonged mask use.", "journal": "Journal of cosmetic dermatology", "date": "2024-02-09", "authors": ["MorganeDe Tollenaere", "Ana\u00efsDurduret", "EmilieChapuis", "CaroleLambert", "PerrineLemagnen", "JeanTiguemounine", "DanielAuriol", "AmandineScandolera", "RomainReynaud"], "doi": "10.1111/jocd.16196"}
{"title": "Acid-base transporters in the context of tumor heterogeneity.", "abstract": "The copious metabolic acid production and -extrusion by cancer cells render poorly vascularized regions of solid tumors highly acidic. A growing list of proton - and bicarbonate transporters has been suggested to contribute to net acid extrusion from cancer cells, and/or been shown to be dysregulated and favor malignant development in various cancers. The great majority of these roles have been studied at the level of the cancer cells. However, recent advances in understanding of the cellular and physicochemical heterogeneity of solid tumors both enable and necessitate a reexamination of the regulation and roles of acid-base transporters in such malignancies. This review will briefly summarize the state-of-the-art, with a focus on the SLC9A and SLC4A families, for which most evidence is available. This is followed by a discussion of key concepts and open questions arising from recent insights and of the challenges that need to be tackled to address them. Finally, opportunities and challenges in therapeutic targeting of the acid-base transportome in cancers will be addressed.", "journal": "Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology", "date": "2024-02-09", "authors": ["Stine Helene FalsigPedersen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00424-024-02918-z\n10.18632/oncotarget.2860\n10.1186/s12943-016-0528-0\n10.1002/ijc.31276\n10.1002/ijc.27782\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-021119-034627\n10.1038/s41590-018-0226-8\n10.1111/apha.12877\n10.1002/mrm.29133\n10.1038/s43018-022-00470-2\n10.1016/j.neo.2014.12.003\n10.1016/j.neo.2022.01.003\n10.1038/s41571-021-00546-5\n10.1038/s42255-022-00730-6\n10.1038/nature13490\n10.1038/nrc.2017.77\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.166\n10.1038/nrc.2017.51\n10.1158/2159-8290.Cd-20-1211\n10.1007/112_2020_23\n10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107613\n10.1111/apha.13068\n10.1158/2159-8290.Cd-19-1007\n10.1182/blood-2005-05-1795\n10.1038/s41419-018-1062-3\n10.1186/s13046-018-0923-z\n10.7150/thno.50150\n10.1073/pnas.1610954113\n10.1007/s00018-021-03890-y\n10.1002/mrm.28255\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.06.005\n10.1016/j.canlet.2011.11.023\n10.1038/s41388-018-0353-6\n10.1186/s13058-023-01644-1\n10.1016/j.devcel.2020.06.018\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.11.104\n10.1152/ajpcell.00280.2010\n10.4049/jimmunol.177.10.7303\n10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112601\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103269\n10.1016/j.cmet.2022.01.007\n10.1016/j.molmet.2019.07.006\n10.1152/physrev.00028.2018\n10.1210/me.2015-1299\n10.1038/s41586-019-1831-x\n10.1038/nrc.2016.89\n10.1038/s41598-020-62430-z\n10.1002/ijc.34404\n10.1083/jcb.200806019\n10.1007/978-1-4614-4756-6_35\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2023.01.007\n10.1074/jbc.M116.730259\n10.1038/s41416-022-01911-6\n10.1038/s41568-023-00628-9\n10.1016/j.cmet.2019.06.001\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.03.005\n10.1007/BF01504608\n10.1038/s41586-020-03045-2"}

Here, we show that both\u00a0lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) male mice exhibit a potent and\u00a0prolonged inhibition of voluntary food intake following overfeeding-induced weight gain. We reveal that FGF21 is dispensable for this defense against weight gain. Targeted proteomics unveiled novel circulating factors linked to overfeeding, including the protease\u00a0 legumain (LGMN). Administration of recombinant LGMN lowers body weight and food intake in DIO mice. The protection against weight gain is also\u00a0associated with reduced vascularization in the hypothalamus and sustained reductions in the expression of the orexigenic neuropeptide genes, Npy and Agrp, suggesting a role for hypothalamic signaling in this homeostatic recovery from overfeeding. Overfeeding of melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) KO mice shows that these mice can suppress voluntary food intake and counteract the enforced weight gain, although their rate of weight recovery is impaired. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the defense against overfeeding-induced weight gain remains intact in obesity and involves mechanisms independent of both FGF21 and MC4R.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2024-02-09", "authors": ["CamillaLund", "PabloRanea-Robles", "SarahFalk", "Dylan MRausch", "GretheSkovbjerg", "Victoria KammaVibe-Petersen", "NathalieKrauth", "Jacob LerckeSkytte", "VasilikiVana", "UrmasRoostalu", "Tune HPers", "JensLund", "ChristofferClemmensen"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-024-45223-0\n10.1242/dmm.008698\n10.3928/0048-5713-19831201-03\n10.1006/appe.2001.0465\n10.1016/j.cmet.2007.06.004\n10.1098/rstb.2022.0231\n10.1016/j.mcna.2017.08.012\n10.1016/S2213-8587(17)30405-9\n10.1038/ijo.2015.59\n10.3945/ajcn.2008.26788C\n10.1038/382250a0\n10.1016/j.molmet.2022.101573\n10.1111/obr.13040\n10.1371/journal.pbio.3000629\n10.1016/j.cmet.2014.09.002\n10.1113/jphysiol.1959.sp006145\n10.1016/j.cmet.2018.05.029\n10.1016/j.tem.2020.06.002\n10.1056/NEJM199503093321001\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.04.006\n10.2337/db22-0306\n10.1210/en.2010-0439\n10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109845\n10.2337/db18-0696\n10.1093/jn/nxz333\n10.1371/journal.pone.0078864\n10.1016/j.molmet.2016.11.001\n10.1016/j.cmet.2018.12.016\n10.1038/s41467-021-21309-x\n10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111258\n10.1016/j.cmet.2021.04.007\n10.1172/JCI88878\n10.1038/nrendo.2017.161\n10.1016/j.febslet.2015.04.025\n10.1016/j.molmet.2012.08.004\n10.1098/rstb.2022.0229\n10.1038/s41593-020-0684-9\n10.1371/journal.pone.0005370\n10.2337/dbi18-0038\n10.1074/jbc.M302742200\n10.3389/fmolb.2021.764900\n10.1038/nm.3700\n10.1159/000125626\n10.1073/pnas.88.23.10931\n10.1016/0031-9384(92)90473-F\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.01.025\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-06-02362.1999\n10.1126/sciadv.aat0866\n10.1038/s41586-021-04088-9\n10.1038/nprot.2012.014\n10.1016/j.seizure.2017.09.015\n10.1093/nar/gkp356\n10.1038/s41596-022-00710-w\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btt656\n10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8\n10.1089/omi.2011.0118\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.010\n10.1007/s12021-020-09490-8\n10.1109/TMI.2009.2035616\n10.1016/j.cell.2020.01.028\n10.1038/nmeth.2019"}

{"title": "Delayed reconstruction of the combat-related mandibular defects with non-vascularized iliac crest grafts: Defining the optimal conditions for a positive outcome in the retrospective study.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of mandibular defects caused by combat injuries is challenging for clinicians due to soft tissue defects and high complication risk. This study evaluated the outcomes of mandibular continuous defects reconstruction with non-vascularized iliac crest graft (NVICG) in patients with combat injuries.\nPatients with continuous mandibular defects acquired by high-velocity agents, who received NVICG reconstruction with or without microvascular-free soft tissue or regional flaps, were included in the study. The outcome variable was graft loss due to postoperative complications or full (more than 90 %) resorption. The primary predictor variable was soft tissue defect in the recipient area. The secondary predictor variable was the length of the defect. Variables related to patients, defect site, surgery, and other complications were also evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed with the usage of independent sample t-test, Pearson's chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests with a significance level of P < 0.05 RESULTS: The study included 24 patients with 27 mandibular defects. Overall, the general success rate of reconstructions was 59.3 %. Soft tissue defects were significantly associated with graft failure and other complications (p < 0.05), which were mostly related to soft tissue defects. The graft success rate was only 14.3 % even in minor soft tissue defects. In turn, in reconstructions with sufficient soft tissue coverage, the graft survived in 75.0 % of the cases. In addition, patients with more delayed reconstruction had significantly fewer graft failures than those with earlier surgery (p < 0.05). No associations were found between defect size and complications.\nThe sufficient soft tissue coverage is essential in the reconstruction of mandibular defects caused by combat injuries. Also, minor soft tissue defects should be covered with soft tissue flaps to avoid complications and graft loss in these specific injuries. Even large defects can be reconstructed with NIVICG if the soft tissue coverage is sufficient.", "journal": "Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2024-02-09", "authors": ["BekirOsmanov", "YuriiChepurnyi", "JohannaSn\u00e4ll", "AndriiKopchak"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jormas.2024.101794"}

{"title": "Tissue-specific reprogramming leads to angiogenic neutrophil specialization and tumor vascularization in colorectal cancer.", "abstract": "Neutrophil (PMN) tissue accumulation is an established feature of ulcerative colitis (UC) lesions and colorectal cancer (CRC). To assess the PMN phenotypic and functional diversification during the transition from inflammatory ulceration to CRC we analyzed the transcriptomic landscape of blood and tissue PMNs. Transcriptional programs effectively separated PMNs based on their proximity to peripheral blood, inflamed colon, and tumors. In silico pathway overrepresentation analysis, protein-network mapping, gene signature identification, and gene-ontology scoring revealed unique enrichment of angiogenic and vasculature development pathways in tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs). Functional studies utilizing ex vivo cultures, colitis-induced murine CRC, and patient-derived xenograft models demonstrated a critical role for TANs in promoting tumor vascularization. Spp1 (OPN) and Mmp14 (MT1-MMP) were identified by unbiased -omics and mechanistic studies to be highly induced in TANs, acting to critically regulate endothelial cell chemotaxis and branching. TCGA data set and clinical specimens confirmed enrichment of SPP1 and MMP14 in high-grade CRC but not in patients with UC. Pharmacological inhibition of TAN trafficking or MMP14 activity effectively reduced tumor vascular density, leading to CRC regression. Our findings demonstrate a niche-directed PMN functional specialization and identify TAN contributions to tumor vascularization, delineating what we believe to be a new therapeutic framework for CRC treatment focused on TAN angiogenic properties.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2024-02-08", "authors": ["Triet MBui", "Lenore KYalom", "EdwardNing", "Jessica MUrbanczyk", "XingshengRen", "Caroline JHerrnreiter", "Jackson ADisario", "BrianWray", "Matthew JSchipma", "Yuri SVelichko", "David PSullivan", "KoukiAbe", "Shannon MLauberth", "Guang-YuYang", "Parambir SDulai", "Stephen BHanauer", "RonenSumagin"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI174545\n10.1053/j.gastro.2021.03.027\n10.1172/JCI122085\n10.5217/ir.2018.16.1.26\n10.1038/s41571-019-0222-4\n10.3390/ijms20030529\n10.1038/s41419-022-04585-3\n10.1186/s13058-016-0794-1\n10.1038/bjc.2013.167\n10.1038/nm.3909\n10.1038/s41590-020-0736-z\n10.1038/s41568-020-0281-y\n10.1038/s41577-019-0141-8\n10.1016/j.immuni.2018.02.002\n10.1084/jem.20201803\n10.1038/s41590-021-00968-4\n10.1016/j.cell.2021.08.003\n10.1016/j.immuni.2016.10.021\n10.1016/j.it.2022.04.008\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-421040\n10.1073/pnas.0601807103\n10.1172/JCI37223\n10.1038/s41598-018-36605-8\n10.1080/14728222.2021.1954162\n10.4103/1477-3163.78279\n10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.004\n10.1038/s41467-020-16596-9\n10.1126/scisignal.2004088\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.05.001\n10.1038/nrc724\n10.1054/bjoc.2001.1809\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2126\n10.1038/onc.2009.189\n10.1242/jcs.000679\n10.1167/iovs.16-19420\n10.3390/cancers12123685\n10.1016/j.ccell.2019.12.001\n10.1172/JCI129558\n10.1172/JCI135239\n10.1111/1759-7714.14108\n10.1136/gutjnl-2019-318419\n10.1016/j.ejcb.2010.09.008\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.06.007\n10.7554/eLife.32490\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-4149\n10.1124/jpet.107.123679\n10.1248/bpb.34.120\n10.1016/j.ccell.2015.06.009\n10.3390/cancers13081984\n10.1593/neo.04619\n10.3390/cancers13051006\n10.1038/nbt.3039\n10.1038/s12276-020-0422-0\n10.3390/cancers14030536\n10.1006/excr.2000.5074\n10.1371/journal.pone.0092762\n10.1186/1471-2407-12-26\n10.1242/dmm.003863\n10.1038/onc.2011.249\n10.1073/pnas.1609375114\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b03373\n10.1007/978-3-319-95294-9_6\n10.1016/j.bpj.2017.06.033\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.07.030\n10.1074/jbc.M111.285213\n10.1074/jbc.M110.178434\n10.1073/pnas.1613855114\n10.1177/1947601911423031\n10.1007/s00441-009-0908-5\n10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600485\n10.2174/1568009619666191114110359\n10.1038/s41598-021-94584-9\n10.1093/nar/gkv007"}
{"title": "Targeting adenosine A", "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) continues to pose a significant threat to the vision of numerous children worldwide, primarily owing to the increased survival rates of premature infants. The pathologies of ROP are mainly linked to impaired vascularization as a result of hyperoxia, leading to subsequent neovascularization. Existing treatments, including anti-vascular endothelial growth factor\u00a0(VEGF) therapies, have thus far been limited to addressing pathological angiogenesis at advanced ROP stages, inevitably leading to adverse side effects.

{"title": "Improving Skin Paddle Reliability and Muscle Gliding in Free Functional Gracilis Transfers.", "abstract": "Free functional muscle transfer is an attractive option within reconstructive surgery when seeking to restore critical muscle function. The gracilis muscle has long been utilized for this purpose due to its expendability and consistent anatomy. Historically, survival of the skin overlying the distal one-third of the myocutaneous gracilis flap has been unpredictable. To address this, the myofasciocutaneous technique was developed, with prior studies demonstrating improved distal skin paddle viability with this approach; however, the mechanism is poorly defined. This study aimed to understand what factors contribute to survival benefit in myofasciocutaneous gracilis flaps. Using cadaveric dissections followed by latex dye injections, we discuss the creation of a deep fascial sheath that contains a rich vascular network and permits adhesion-free excursion at the recipient site. This study advances our understanding of the myofasciocutaneous gracilis flap and provides wider clinical applicability in free functional muscle transfer.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

We previously demonstrated that diet enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) transforms brain lipid composition and protects from neonatal stroke. Vasculature is a critical interface between blood and brain providing a barrier to systemic infection. Here we examined whether maternal PUFA-enriched diets exert reprograming of endothelial cell signalling in 9-day old mice after endotoxin (LPS)-induced infection. Transcriptome analysis was performed on brain microvessels from pups born to dams maintained on 3 diets: standard, n-3 or n-6 enriched. N-3 diet enabled higher immune reactivity in brain vasculature, while preventing imbalance of cell cycle regulation and extracellular matrix cascades that accompanied inflammatory response in standard diet. LPS response in blood and brain was blunted in n-3 offspring. Cerebral angioarchitecture analysis revealed modified vessel complexity after LPS. Thus, n-3-enriched maternal diet partially prevents imbalance in homeostatic processes and alters inflammation rather than affects brain vascularization during early life. Importantly, maternal diet may presage offspring neurovascular outcomes later in life.", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "date": "2024-02-08", "authors": ["TetyanaChumak", "AmandineJullienne", "CJoakim Ek", "MaryamArdalan", "PernillaSvedin", "RyanQuan", "ArjangSalehi", "SirusSalari", "AndreObenaus", "Zinaida SVexler", "CarinaMallard"], "doi": "10.1101/2024.01.22.576634"}
{"title": "Developmental order, fibre caliber, and vascularization predict tract-wise declines: Testing retrogenesis and physiological predictions in white matter aging.", "abstract": "To understand the consistently observed spatial distribution of white-matter (WM) aging, developmentally driven theories of retrogenesis have gained traction, positing that the order WM development predicts declines. Regions that develop first are often expected to deteriorate the last, i.e. \"last-in-first-out\". Alternatively, regions which develop most rapidly may also decline most rapidly in aging, or the \"gains-predict-loss\" model. The validity of such theories remains uncertain, in part due to lack of clarity on the definition of developmental order. Our recent findings also suggest that WM degeneration may vary by physiological parameters such as perfusion. Furthermore, it is informative to link perfusion to fibre metabolic need, which varies with fibre size. Here we address the question of whether WM degeneration is determined by development trajectory or physiological state across both microstructural and perfusion measures using data drawn from the Human Connectome Project in Aging (HCP-A). Our results indicate that developmental order of tract myelination provides the strongest support for the retrogenesis hypothesis, with the last to complete myelination the first to decline. Moreover, higher mean axon diameter and lower macrovascular density are associated with lower degrees of WM degeneration across measures. Tract perfusion, in turn also tends to be higher and the arterial transit time longer for tracts that appear first. These findings suggest that WM degeneration in different tracts may be governed by their developmental trajectories and physiology, and ultimately influenced by each tract's metabolic demand.", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "date": "2024-02-08", "authors": ["Tyler DRobinson", "Jordan AChad", "Yutong LSun", "Paul T HChang", "J JeanChen"], "doi": "10.1101/2024.01.20.576373"}

{"title": "Long-term day-by-day tracking of microvascular networks sprouting in fibrin gels: From detailed morphological analyses to general growth rules.", "abstract": "Understanding and controlling of the evolution of sprouting vascular networks remains one of the basic challenges in tissue engineering. Previous studies on the vascularization dynamics have typically focused only on the phase of intense growth and often lacked spatial control over the initial cell arrangement. Here, we perform long-term day-by-day analysis of tens of isolated microvasculatures sprouting from endothelial cell-coated spherical beads embedded in an external fibrin gel. We systematically study the topological evolution of the sprouting networks over their whole lifespan, i.e., for at least 14\u2009days. We develop a custom image analysis toolkit and quantify (i) the overall length and area of the sprouts, (ii) the distributions of segment lengths and branching angles, and (iii) the average number of branch generations-a measure of network complexity. We show that higher concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) lead to earlier sprouting and more branched networks, yet without significantly affecting the speed of growth of individual sprouts. We find that the mean branching angle is weakly dependent on VEGF and typically in the range of 60\u00b0-75\u00b0, suggesting that, by comparison with the available diffusion-limited growth models, the bifurcating tips tend to follow local VEGF gradients. At high VEGF concentrations, we observe exponential distributions of segment lengths, which signify purely stochastic branching.

Thyroid localization is very rare, and often the cause of misdiagnosis. Pathological anatomy plays an important role in the diagnosis of certainty.

We highlight the epidemiological particularities of this case, and discuss diagnostic methods and the contribution of pathological anatomy.\nA 22\u00a0year-old male patient, with no reported pathological history, was seen in the clinic for the management of an isolated anterior cervical swelling that had been evolving for two months. Clinical examination revealed only a small thyroid nodule, with no inflammatory or vascular features. Biological tests were unremarkable. Ultrasound revealed a 2.4cm hypoechoic, homogeneous, poorly vascularized tissue mass in the left lobe, classified as EU-TIRADS 3. Fine needle aspiration with cytopathological study revealed a necrotizing granulomatous lesion suggestive of tuberculosis. A lobo-isthmectomy was performed, and histopathology revealed thyroid parenchyma destroyed by tubercular granulomas. The postoperative course was straightforward, with an exeat on postoperative day 6. Anti-tuberculosis treatment was instituted for 6\u00a0months.

Recent data shows that Molybdenum (Mo) is a potent inducer of osteogenic differentiation in human bone\u00a0marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs). On the other hand, while boron (B) has been shown to enhance vascularization in BTE applications, its impact on osteogenic differentiation is volatile: while improved osteogenic differentiation has been described, other data show that B might slow down osteogenic differentiation or reduce the calcification of the extracellular matrix (ECM) when applied in higher doses. Still, the combination of pro-osteogenic Mo and pro-angiogenic B is certainly attractive in the context of biomaterials intended for the use in BTE.\nTherefore, the combined effect of molybdenum trioxide and boric acid at different ratios was investigated in this study to evaluate the effects on the viability, proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, ECM production and maturation of BMSCs.\nMo ions proved to be stronger osteoinductive compared to B, in fact, while some osteogenic differentiation markers were downregulated in the presence of B, the presence of Mo provided compensation. The combined application of B and Mo indicated a combination of individual effects, partially even enhancing the expected combined performance of the single stimulations.\nThe combination of B and Mo might be beneficial for BTE applications since the limited osteogenic properties of B can be compensated by Mo. Furthermore, since B is known to be pro-angiogenic, the combination of both substances may synergistically lead to improved vascularization and bone regeneration. Future studies should assess the angiogenic performance of this combination in greater detail.", "journal": "Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS)", "date": "2024-02-08", "authors": ["AScheurle", "EKunisch", "A RBoccaccini", "TWalker", "TRenkawitz", "FWesthauser"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtemb.2024.127405"}

In bone tissue engineering, biofabrication strategies have been proposed as promising alternatives to solve issues associated with current therapies and to produce bone substitutes that mimic both the structure and function of native bone. Among them, laser-assisted bioprinting (LAB) has emerged as a relevant biofabrication method to print living cells and biomaterials with micrometric resolution onto a receiving substrate, also called 'biopaper'. Recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of prevascularization using LAB to promote vascularization and bone regeneration, but mechanical and biological optimization of the biopaper are needed. The aim of this study was to apply gelatin-sheet fabrication process to the development of a novel biopaper able to support prevascularization organized by LAB for bone tissue engineering applications.

In this study, three different modeling methods, including phenol mucilage combined mechanical scraping, ethanol combined mechanical scraping and ethanol modeling alone were designed. The morphological characteristics of the models were evaluated. The underlying mechanisms and fertility capacity of the ethanol modeling group were analyzed and compared to those of the sham surgery group. All three methods resulted in severe intrauterine adhesions, with ethanol being identified as a reliable modeling agent and was subsequently subjected to further evaluation. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR results indicated that the ethanol modeling group exhibited an increase in the degree of fibrosis and inflammation, as well as a significant reduction in endometrial thickness, gland number, vascularization, and endometrial receptivity, ultimately resulting in the loss of fertility capacity. The aforementioned findings indicate that the intrauterine perfusion of 95\u00a0% ethanol is efficacious in inducing the development of intrauterine adhesions in rats.

To address this issue, surgical techniques and antiadhesive treatments are applied. Given the significant role of vascularization in adhesion band formation, Avastin (Ava) that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can be applied to prevent peritoneal adhesion bands. Moreover, Alginate (Alg), a natural polysaccharide, is a promising physical barrier to prevent adhesion bands. Incorporating Ava into Alg hydrogel in a form of 3D-printed scaffold (Alg/Ava) has potential to suppress inflammation and angiogenesis, leading to reduce peritoneal adhesion bands. Following physical, morphological, and biocompatibility evaluations, the efficacy of Alg and Ava alone and their combination in Alg/Ava on the formation of postsurgical adhesions is evaluated. Upon confirming physical stability and sustained release of Ava, the Alg/Ava scaffold effectively diminishes both the extent and strength of adhesion bands. Histopathological examination shows that the reduction in fibrosis and inflammation is responsible for preventing adhesion bands by the Alg/Ava scaffold. Additionally, the cytokine assessment reveals that this is due to the inhibition in the secretion of VEGF and Interleukin 6 suppressing vascularization and inflammatory pathways.

{"title": "Review of treatment strategies after lymphadenectomy: from molecular therapeutics to immediate microsurgical lymphatic reconstruction.", "abstract": "Lymphedema is a common complication of cancer treatment, such as lymphadenectomy and radiation therapy. It is a debilitating condition with pathologic tissue changes that hinder effective curative treatment and jeopardize patients' quality of life. Various attempts to prevent the development of lymphedema have been made, with improvements in the incidence of the pathology. However, it is still prevalent among survivors of cancer. In this paper, we review both molecular therapeutics and immediate surgical lymphatic reconstruction as treatment strategies after lymphadenectomy. Specifically, we discuss pro-lymphangiogenic molecules that have proved efficient in animal models of lymphedema and clinical trials, and review currently available microsurgical techniques of immediate lymphatic reconstruction.\nA literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar through May 2022. Searches were done separately for molecular therapeutics and microsurgical techniques for immediate lymphatic reconstruction. Search terms used for (1) non-surgical methods include 'lymphangiogenesis,' 'lymphedema,' 'growth factor,' and 'gene therapy.' Search terms used for (2) surgical methods include 'lymphedema,' 'lymph node excision,' 'lymphatic vessels,' 'primary prevention,' and 'microsurgery.'\nVarious pro-lymphangiogenic factors with therapeutic potential include VEGF-C, VEGF-D, HGF, bFGF, PDGF, IGF, Retinoic acid, Ang-1, S1P, TLR4, and IL-8. Microsurgical lymphatic reconstruction for prevention of secondary lymphedema includes lymphovenous anastomosis, vascularized lymph node flap transfer, and lymph-interpositional flap transfer, with promising clinical outcomes.\nWith growing knowledge of the lymphangiogenic pathway and lymphedema pathology and advances in microsurgical techniques to restore lymphatic channels, molecular and surgical approaches may represent a promising method for primary prevention of lymphedema.", "journal": "Journal of vascular surgery.

{"title": "Robotic-assisted single-site abdominal cerclage in the bicornuate uterus patient with cervical insufficiency.", "abstract": "To demonstrate the surgical techniques for improving safety in robotic-assisted abdominal cerclage in patients with bicornuate uteri complicated by recurrent pregnancy loss and cervical insufficiency.\nStepwise demonstration with narrated video footage.\nAn academic tertiary care hospital.\nOur patient is a 22-year-old G2P0020 with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss. During her first pregnancy, she was asymptomatic until 19 weeks and delivered because of a preterm premature rupture of membranes. A transvaginal cerclage was performed for her second pregnancy at 14 weeks, which ended at 16 weeks because of preterm premature rupture of membranes. The final magnetic resonance imaging report noted a \"bicorporeal uterus with duplication of the uterine body, resulting in two markedly divergent uterine horns that are fused at the isthmus... unlike a typical didelphic uterus, a single, non septated cervix is noted, which shows normal appearances, measuring 3.8 cm in length.\" Given her history of a uterine anomaly and recurrent pregnancy loss in the absence of other biochemical factors, her maternal-fetal medicine specialist referred her to us as the patient strongly desired future viable pregnancies. The patient was counseled on multiple alternatives, including different methods of performing the cerclage, and ultimately decided on the robotic-assisted (Da Vinci Xi) prophylactic abdominal cerclage.\nThe bicornuate uterus is a rare class IV mullerian duct anomaly caused by the impaired fusion of the mullerian ducts in the uterus, classically appearing in imaging studies as a heart-shaped uterus. This patient demographic reports a high incidence of obstetric complications. Pregnancy in such a uterus causes complications like first- and second-trimester pregnancy loss, preterm labor, low-birthweight infants, and malpresentation at delivery (1). Researchers have postulated that there is an abnormal ratio of muscle fibers to connective tissue in a congenitally abnormal cervix. During pregnancy, an inadequate uterine volume may lead to increased intrauterine pressure and stress on the lower uterine segment, which can lead to cervical incompetence (2). To address cervical incompetence, cervical cerclages are a commonly utilized procedure, as recent studies demonstrate that the incidence of term pregnancies in the group with documented cervical incompetence treated with cerclage placement increased from 26% to 63% (3). One observational study noted improved obstetrical outcomes occurred with interval placement, a cerclage placed in between pregnancies in the nongravid uterus, compared with cerclage placement between 9 and 10 weeks gestation, with the mean gestational age for delivery at 32.9 weeks and 34.5 weeks when a cerclage was placed in gravid and nongravid women, respectively (4). In addition, another retrospective study was done, which demonstrated a lower incidence of neonatal death with prophylactic cerclages (5). Operating on a nonpregnant uterus offers several benefits, including its reduced size, fewer and smaller blood vessels, and simplified handling. Moreover, there are clearly no concerns regarding the fetus. In the decision to use a robotic-assisted platform vs. laparoscopic, a systematic review showed the rates of third-trimester delivery and live birth (LB) using laparoscopy during pregnancy were found to be 70% and 70%-100%, respectively. The same review demonstrated slightly improved outcomes via the robotic route regarding gestational age at delivery (median, 37 weeks), rates of LB (90%), and third-trimester delivery (90%) (6). Additional factors contributing to the preference for robotics in surgical procedures include incorporating advanced tools, which can enhance the robotic system's advantages compared with traditional laparoscopy. An invaluable tool in this context is the simultaneous utilization of Firefly mode, which employs a near-infrared camera system, achieved through injecting indocyanine green dye or integrating other light sources concurrently. The intravenous administration of indocyanine green is acknowledged widely for its safety and efficacy as a contrast agent in the evaluation of microvascular circulation and organ vascularization. This property equips surgeons with heightened precision when guiding the needle, proving especially advantageous when faced with challenges in visualizing vascular anatomy. In our specific case, we harnessed the capabilities of Firefly mode in conjunction with hysteroscopic light, enabling us to vividly illustrate the contours of a bicornuate uterus from both external and internal perspectives. We demonstrate a simplified technique of the abdominal cerclage, one cerclage around the internal cervical os of the uterus, using a robotic-assisted platform in a nongravid patient. The surgery began with the eversion of the umbilicus, and a 15-mm skin incision was made in the umbilicus. A Gelpoint mini advanced access site laparoscopy device was inserted into the incision, and CO\nThe success criteria for the surgery were identified as the patient's ability to attain a viable pregnancy after the cerclage placement, along with achieving LB.\nSubsequently, a spontaneous pregnancy was achieved. An infant weighing 3 pounds and 16 ounces was delivered by cesarean section at 36 weeks because of an oligohydramnios. The infant is currently healthy at 13 pounds.\nRobotic-assisted abdominal cerclage around the internal cervical os in a bicornuate uterus offers a possibly feasible and straightforward technique for surgeons seeking to reduce risks, although further research is needed.", "journal": "Fertility and sterility", "date": "2024-02-06", "authors": ["Nurul Farhanah Binte AbdulLatif", "ZhenkunGuan", "SylviaAsare", "XiaomingGuan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fertnstert.2024.01.036"}

DE affecting the SP was diagnosed on ultrasound by TVS, when sonographic criteria of DE were visualized in conjunction with fibers of the SP and the presence of related symptoms, so-called sacral radiculopathy. Clinical symptoms, ultrasound features and histological confirmation were analyzed for each patient included.\nTwenty-seven patients with DE infiltrating the sacral plexus were identified in 2 contributing tertiary referral centers. Median age was 37 (range, 29-45) years and all of the patients were symptomatic and presented one or more of the following neurological symptoms: dysaesthesia in the ipsilateral lower extremity (n\u00a0=\u00a017), paraesthesia in the ipsilateral lower extremity (n\u00a0=\u00a010), chronic pelvic pain radiating in the ipsilateral lower extremity (n\u00a0=\u00a09), chronic pain radiating in the pudendal region (n\u00a0=\u00a08), weakness in the ipsilateral lower extremities (n\u00a0=\u00a03). All DE lesions affecting the SP were purely solid tumors in the posterior parametrium in direct contact with or infiltrating the S1 and/or S2 and/or S3 and/or S4 roots of the SP. The median of the largest diameter of the DE nodules was 35\u2009mm and echogenicity of the DE nodules was in 86% (n=23) non-uniform. All but one of them contained hyperechoic areas. The shape of the lesions was in 89% (n=24)irregular. Only one lesion exhibited lobulated form, all other irregular lesion showed spiculated appearance. 74% (n=20) of the nodules gave an acoustic shadow, all of them internal. With color or power Doppler examination 78% (n=21) of the nodules showed no signal (Color Score 1). The remaining 22% (n=6) of the lesions manifested only a minimal color content (Color Score 2). According to pattern recognition, most DE nodules were a purely solid non-uniform hypoechoic nodule with hyperechoic areas, internal shadows and irregular spiculated contours and poorly vascularized at color/power Doppler examination.\nThe ultrasound finding of a parametrial unilateral solid non-uniform hypoechoic nodule with hyperechoic areas and possible internal shadowing as well as irregular spiculated contours demonstrating poor vascularization on Doppler examination in proximity or involving the structures of the SP reflects DE affecting these structures.

{"title": "Research progress of vascularization strategies of tissue-engineered bone.", "abstract": "The bone defect caused by fracture, bone tumor, infection, and other causes is not only a problematic point in clinical treatment but also one of the hot issues in current research. The development of bone tissue engineering provides a new way to repair bone defects. Many animal experimental and rising clinical application studies have shown their excellent application prospects. The construction of rapid vascularization of tissue-engineered bone is the main bottleneck and critical factor in repairing bone defects. The rapid establishment of vascular networks early after biomaterial implantation can provide sufficient nutrients and transport metabolites. If the slow formation of the local vascular network results in a lack of blood supply, the osteogenesis process will be delayed or even unable to form new bone. The researchers modified the scaffold material by changing the physical and chemical properties of the scaffold material, loading the growth factor sustained release system, and combining it with trace elements so that it can promote early angiogenesis in the process of induced bone regeneration, which is beneficial to the whole process of bone regeneration.

Herein, electrospun scaffolds that combined physical and biological cues were fabricated by anchoring reparative M2 macrophage-derived exosomes onto topological pore structured nanofibrous scaffolds. The topological pore structure of the fiber and the immobilization of exosomes increased the nanoscale roughness and hydrophilicity of the fibrous scaffold. In vitro cell experiments showed that exosomes could be internalized by target cells to promote cell migration, tube formation, osteogenic differentiation, and anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization. The activation of fibrosis, angiogenesis, and macrophage was elucidated during the exosome-functionalized fibrous scaffold-mediated foreign body response (FBR) in subcutaneous implantation in mice. The exosome-functionalized nanofibrous scaffolds also enhanced vascularized bone formation in a critical-sized rat cranial bone defect model. Importantly, histological analysis revealed that the biofunctional scaffolds regulated the coupling effect of angiogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, and osteogenesis by stimulating type H vessel formation. This study elaborated on the complex processes within the cell microenvironment niche during fibrous scaffold-mediated FBR and vascularized bone regeneration to guide the design of implants or devices used in orthopedics and maxillofacial surgery.

{"title": "Modic Changes in the Lumbar Spine: Exploring Their Association with Abdominal Aortic Calcification as a Potential Indicator of Systemic Atherosclerosis.", "abstract": "This was a cross-sectional study on the correlation between abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and Modic changes (MC). Little is known regarding the etiology of MC in the lumbar spine. Currently, insufficient vascularization of the endplate has been proposed to contribute to the appearance of MC. Our objective was to investigate whether AAC, a marker for a poor vascular status, is associated with MC in patients suffering from degenerative disc disease.\nRadiologic images of patients (n\u00a0= 130) suffering from degenerative lumbar disc disease were reviewed. Type and severity of MC were assessed using magnetic resonance images, and severity of AAC was evaluated using computed tomography images or fluoroscopy. Both items were dichotomized into minimal and relevant grades. The correlation between them was studied using Spearman's correlation test, with age as a covariate.\nOf the patients, 113 (87%) demonstrated MC (31% type I, 63% type II, and 6% type III) (55% relevant grade), and 68% had AAC (44% relevant grade). Spearman statistical analysis revealed that AAC was correlated with age (P < 0.001), whereas MC were not (P\u00a0= 0.142). AAC severity was significantly correlated with MC, remaining so after age adjustment (P < 0.05). While MC type I lacked correlation with AAC, MC type II were significantly correlated with AAC (0.288, P\u00a0= 0.015); however, this association lost significance after adjusting for age (P\u00a0= 0.057).\nAAC and MC (mainly MC type II) are associated, indicating that reduced blood supply or even a poor systemic vascularization status due to atherosclerotic disease may play a role in the formation of MC.

{"title": "Mechanical activation and expression of HSP27 in epithelial ovarian cancer.", "abstract": "Understanding the complex biomechanical tumor microenvironment (TME) is of critical importance in developing the next generation of anti-cancer treatment strategies. This is especially true in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the deadliest of the gynecologic cancers due to recurrent disease or chemoresistance. However, current models of EOC progression provide little control or ability to monitor how changes in biomechanical parameters alter EOC cell behaviors. In this study, we present a microfluidic device designed to permit biomechanical investigations of the ovarian TME. Using this microtissue system, we describe how biomechanical stimulation in the form of tensile strains upregulate phosphorylation of HSP27, a heat shock protein implicated in ovarian cancer chemoresistance.

A multicentric comparative study.", "abstract": "Staged laparoscopic management of intra-abdominal testes using pedicular section is recognized as gold standard technique, successful in 85\u00a0% of cases for scrotal testicular position with less than 10\u00a0% testicular atrophy. Recently, Shehata proposed a new technique without pedicular division for these testes, using spermatic vessels traction, but did not provide a comparative study of the two techniques.\nTo evaluate the laparoscopic spermatic pedicular traction (Shehata technique, ST) for the treatment of intra-abdominal testis, as an alternative to gold standard pedicular section (2-stage Fowler-Stephens, FS).\nIntra-abdominal testes of 129 patients in two tertiary pediatric urology centers were managed laparoscopically (2011-2019) either by 2-stage FS orchidopexy or ST according to the surgeon preference. Testicular position and size were statistically compared.\nA total of 147 testes were pulled down by 80 ST and 67 FS, including 18 bilateral cases. Median (IQR) age at surgery was 24.2 (15.6-46.4) months (ST) and 18.3 (13.1-38.2) months (FS) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.094). Scrotal pulling-down of the testis was performed after a median (IQR) period of 2.3 (1.6-3.4) months (ST) and 6.1 (4.7-8.3) months (FS), respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005). Although ST had collapsed in 17 cases (21.3\u00a0%), only one (1.3\u00a0%) redo procedure was required. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 22 (12-40) and 19 (8.75-37) months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.59), the testis was in the scrotum in 85\u00a0% and 81\u00a0% of ST and FS cases, respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.51). Testicular atrophy occurred in 10\u00a0% of ST and 13.4\u00a0% of FS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.61). Multivariate analysis using the propensity score analysis did not identify any difference between the two techniques.\nOur results seem to confirm that FS and ST achieve the same results regarding final testicular position and testicular atrophy rate, with a long-term follow-up. Our study supports pediatric surgeons to favor laparoscopic spermatic pedicular traction (ST) which preserves the testicular vascularization and may ensure better spermatogenesis after puberty. More details on the size and position of the testicle at the beginning of the first laparoscopy seem however essential to assess more accurately the outcomes of each surgical technique. Our outcomes will also be re-evaluated when our patients have reached puberty, from an exocrine and endocrine points of view.\nThis study showed similar results after laparoscopic traction or section of spermatic vessels for intra-abdominal testis in a long-term follow-up, providing more evidence for the use of ST as a valuable alternative to FS.", "journal": "Journal of pediatric urology", "date": "2024-02-04", "authors": ["ValeskaBidault-Jourdainne", "NathalieBotto", "MatthieuPeycelon", "ElisabethCarricaburu", "PaulineLopez", "ArnaudBonnard", "ThomasBlanc", "AlaaEl-Ghoneimi", "AnnabelPaye-Jaouen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jpurol.2024.01.017"}

However, traditional toxicity test methods (e.g., animal models and cell lines) often fail to provide accurate results. Fortunately, organoids differentiated from stem cells can more accurately, sensitively and specifically reflect the effects of harmful environmental factors on the human body. They are also suitable for specific studies and are frequently used in environmental toxicology nowadays. As a combination of organoids and organ-on-a-chip technology, organoids-on-a-chip has great potential in environmental toxicology. It is more controllable to the physicochemical microenvironment and is not easy to be contaminated. It has higher homogeneity in the size and shape of organoids. In addition, it can achieve vascularization and exchange the nutrients and metabolic wastes in time. Multi-organoids-chip can also simulate the interactions of different organs. These advantages can facilitate better function and maturity of organoids, which can also make up for the shortcomings of common organoids to a certain extent. This review firstly discussed the limitations of traditional toxicology testing platforms, leading to the introduction of new platforms: organoids and organoids-on-a-chip. Next, the applications of different organoids and organoids-on-a-chip in environmental toxicology were summarized and prospected. Since the advantages of the new platforms have not been sufficiently considered in previous literature, we particularly emphasized them. Finally, this review also summarized the opportunities and challenges faced by organoids and organoids-on-a-chip, with the expectation that readers will gain a deeper understanding of their value in the field of environmental toxicology.", "journal": "Environment international", "date": "2024-02-04", "authors": ["ChengyuHu", "ShengYang", "TianyiZhang", "YilingGe", "ZaozaoChen", "JuanZhang", "YuepuPu", "GeyuLiang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.envint.2024.108415"}
{"title": "Effect of tumor heterogeneity on enhancing drug delivery to vascularized tumors using thermo-sensitive liposomes triggered by hyperthermia: A multi-scale and multi-physics computational model.", "abstract": "In this study, a novel multi-scale and multi-physics image-based computational model is introduced to assess the delivery of doxorubicin (Dox) loaded temperature-sensitive liposomes (TSLs) in the presence of hyperthermia. Unlike previous methodologies, this approach incorporates capillary network geometry extracted from images, resulting in a more realistic physiological tumor model. This model holds significant promise in advancing personalized medicine by integrating patient-specific tumor properties. The finite element method is employed to solve the equations governing intravascular and interstitial fluid flows, as well as the transport of therapeutic agents within the tissue. Realistic biological conditions and intricate processes like intravascular pressure, drug binding to cells, and cellular uptake are also considered to enhance the model's accuracy. The results underscore the significant impact of vascular architecture on treatment outcomes. Variation in vascular network pattern yielded changes of up to 38\u00a0% in the fraction of killed cells (FKCs) parameter under identical conditions. Pressure control of the parent vessels can also improve FKCs by approximately 17\u00a0%. Tailoring the treatment plan based on tumor-specific parameters emerged as a critical factor influencing treatment efficacy. For instance, changing the time interval between the administration of Dox-loaded TSLs and hyperthermia can result in a 48\u00a0% improvement in treatment outcomes. Additionally, devising a customized heating schedule led to a 20\u00a0% increase in treatment efficacy.

Results show that the expression of grancalcin(GCA), a protein secreted by bone marrow-derived immune cells, is elevated in the wound sites of individuals and animals with diabetic ulcers. Genetic inhibition of grancalcin expression accelerates vascularization and healing in an animal model. Mechanistic studies show that grancalcin binds to transient receptor potential melastatin 8(TRPM8) and partially inactivates its downstream signaling pathways, thereby impairing angiogenesis in vitro and ex vivo.

{"title": "The opposite role of lactate dehydrogenase a (LDHA) in cervical cancer under energy stress conditions.", "abstract": "Due to insufficient and defective vascularization, the tumor microenvironment is often nutrient-depleted. LDHA has been demonstrated to play a tumor-promoting role by facilitating the glycolytic process. However, whether and how LDHA regulates cell survival in the nutrient-deficient tumor microenvironment is still unclear. Here, we sought to investigate the role and mechanism of LDHA in regulating cell survival and proliferation under energy stress conditions. Our results showed that the aerobic glycolysis levels, cell survival and proliferation of cervical cancer cells decreased significantly after inhibition of LDHA under normal culture condition while LDHA deficiency greatly inhibited glucose starvation-induced ferroptosis and promoted cell proliferation and tumor formation under energy stress conditions. Mechanistic studies suggested that glucose metabolism shifted from aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial OXPHOS under energy stress conditions and LDHA knockdown increased accumulation of pyruvate in the cytosol, which entered the mitochondria and upregulated the level of oxaloacetate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PC). Importantly, the increase in oxaloacetate production after absence of LDHA remarkably activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which increased mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, promoted mitochondrial homeostasis, thereby decreasing ROS level. Moreover, repression of lipogenesis by activation of AMPK led to elevated levels of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which effectively resisted ROS-induced cell ferroptosis and enhanced cell survival under energy stress conditions. These results suggested that LDHA played an opposing role in survival and proliferation of cervical cancer cells under energy stress conditions, and inhibition of LDHA may not be a suitable treatment strategy for cervical cancer.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2024-02-03", "authors": ["ChaoranJia", "YulunWu", "FengGao", "WeiLiu", "NaLi", "YaoChen", "LuguoSun", "ShuyueWang", "ChunleiYu", "YongliBao", "ZhenboSong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2024.01.043"}

In this approach, reactive tetraethyl orthosilicate and boric acid (pKa \u2a7e 9.24) were used as silicon and boron sources, respectively, and a solid-state gel was formed through the condensation reaction of these reactive groups with the keratin/collagen mixture.

The fabricated hybrid films were characterized structurally and mechanically. In addition, angiogenic characteristics were determined by the in ovo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, which revealed an increased vascular network within the Si-B-WK/JFC biohybrid films.

Different bleb classification schemes incorporating filtration bleb vascularization have been proposed, but the reported correlation with intraocular pressure (IOP) has been variable, possibly because of subjective vascularization grading. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate bleb vascularization after Preserflo Microshunt (PM) implantation using anterior segment OCT-angiography (AS-OCTA) as a biomarker for bleb failure.\nTwenty-three eyes of twenty-three patients underwent PM implantation. Up to 12\u2009months after surgery PM scleral passage-centred AS-OCTA measurements (PLEX Elite 9000) for bleb-vessel density (BVD) determination were performed and IOP as well as necessity for surgical revisions (needling and open revision) were documented. After multi-step image analysis (region of interest definition, artefact removal, binarization, BVD calculation), the predictive value of early postoperative BVD for surgical revisions was assessed using logistic regression modelling.\nBaseline IOP (23.57\u2009\u00b1\u20097.75\u2009mmHg) decreased significantly to 8.30\u2009\u00b1\u20092.12, 9.17\u2009\u00b1\u20092.33 and 11.70\u2009\u00b1\u20094.40\u2009mmHg after 1, 2 and 4\u2009week(s), and 13.48\u2009\u00b1\u20095.83, 11.87\u2009\u00b1\u20094.49, 12.30\u2009\u00b1\u20096.65, 11.87\u2009\u00b1\u20093.11 and 13.05\u2009\u00b1\u20094.12\u2009mmHg after 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12\u2009month(s), respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001).

{"title": "The Regenerative Microenvironment of the Tissue Engineering for Urethral Strictures.", "abstract": "Urethral stricture caused by various reasons has threatened the quality of life of patients for decades. Traditional reconstruction methods, especially for long-segment injuries, have shown poor outcomes in treating urethral strictures. Tissue engineering for urethral regeneration is an emerging concept in which special designed scaffolds and seed cells are used to promote local urethral regeneration. The scaffolds, seed cells, various factors and the host interact with each other and form the regenerative microenvironment. Among the various interactions involved, vascularization and fibrosis are the most important biological processes during urethral regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells play special roles in stricture repair and facilitate long-segment urethral regeneration, but they may also induce carcinogenesis and genomic instability during reconstruction. Nevertheless, current technologies, such as genetic engineering, molecular imaging, and exosome extraction, provide us with opportunities to manage seed cell-related regenerative risks. In this review, we described the interactions among seed cells, scaffolds, factors and the host within the regenerative microenvironment, which may help in determining the exact molecular mechanisms involved in urethral stricture regeneration and promoting clinical trials and the application of urethral tissue engineering in patients suffering from urethral stricture.", "journal": "Stem cell reviews and reports", "date": "2024-02-02", "authors": ["WenyuanLeng", "XiaoyuLi", "LeiDong", "ZhenkeGuo", "XingJi", "TianyuCai", "ChunruXu", "ZhenpengZhu", "JianLin"], "doi": "10.1007/s12015-024-10686-7\n10.1155/2019/9046430\n10.1016/j.eururo.2021.05.022\n10.1016/j.juro.2016.07.087\n10.1007/s00192-021-04906-8\n10.1097/MOU.0000000000000913\n10.1111/iju.13356\n10.1016/j.ucl.2016.08.003\n10.1159/000341138\n10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08738.x\n10.1007/s00345-019-02826-3\n10.1016/j.eururo.2017.03.026\n10.1089/end.2013.0538\n10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111425\n10.1039/C7BM00146K\n10.1155/2014/921905\n10.1002/jbm.b.33586\n10.1007/s10439-014-1103-8\n10.1007/978-3-030-82735-9_10\n10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119157\n10.1089/ten.teb.2012.0583\n10.1080/02648725.2018.1430464\n10.1002/asia.202200598\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00895\n10.1111/j.1442-2042.2012.03202.x\n10.1177/15353702221090872\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00510\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.02.048\n10.1007/s10439-019-02302-4\n10.1038/nm848\n10.1172/JCI32479\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00061.x\n10.4049/jimmunol.170.6.3369\n10.1155/2021/5502740\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.009\n10.1088/1748-605X/aa9f01\n10.1007/s00345-008-0316-6\n10.7150/thno.22080\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.11.026\n10.1039/C9BM01911A\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.112218\n10.1111/jcmm.12157\n10.4103/aja.aja_133_19\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.10.073\n10.1016/j.juro.2015.02.014\n10.3390/ijms161126050\n10.1016/j.addr.2014.11.008\n10.1021/bm200492h\n10.1371/journal.pone.0192430\n10.1038/aja.2013.2\n10.1159/000440667\n10.1080/21691401.2018.1457040\n10.1038/s41598-022-07472-1\n10.1186/s13287-017-0500-y\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2016.e00087\n10.1016/j.eururo.2012.07.041\n10.1155/2021/8854479\n10.5966/sctm.2015-0367\n10.1371/journal.pone.0088685\n10.4103/0970-1591.152809\n10.1111/iwj.12551\n10.1016/j.juro.2011.12.059\n10.1002/adma.202109522\n10.1089/ten.tea.2016.0245\n10.1177/0363546508315470\n10.1159/000492298\n10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01875.x\n10.1016/j.archoralbio.2006.05.007\n10.1002/term.1467\n10.1038/nature12586\n10.1038/nbt.1615\n10.1038/nbt.1835\n10.1038/nature09798\n10.1038/s41419-021-03733-5\n10.1053/j.gastro.2010.08.048\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.018\n10.1186/s12943-017-0674-z\n10.1172/JCI35700\n10.1073/pnas.1319738111\n10.1242/dev.103341\n10.1002/biot.201200163\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.04.006\n10.1002/term.36\n10.1002/adma.202109198\n10.1002/smll.202106824\n10.1038/s41467-020-16192-x\n10.1073/pnas.1906986116\n10.1016/S0302-2838(03)00212-4\n10.1097/01.ju.0000146554.79487.7f\n10.1016/j.urology.2006.02.044\n10.1111/j.1442-2042.2006.01587.x\n10.1016/j.eururo.2006.12.016\n10.1016/j.eururo.2007.01.099\n10.1016/j.eururo.2008.01.061\n10.1016/j.juro.2007.11.101\n10.1089/end.2009.0074\n10.1016/j.urology.2011.09.055\n10.1111/j.1442-2042.2012.03230.x\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.08.014\n10.1016/j.juro.2018.02.3102\n10.1016/j.ajur.2019.05.001\n10.1111/iju.15247"}
{"title": "Tissue engineering strategies for breast reconstruction: a literature review of current advances and future directions.", "abstract": "Mastectomy is a primary treatment for breast cancer patients, and both autologous and implant-based reconstructive techniques have shown excellent results. In recent years, advancements in bioengineering have led to a proliferation of innovative approaches to breast reconstruction. This article comprehensively explores the promising perspectives offered by bioengineering and tissue engineering in the field of breast reconstruction.\nA literature review was conducted between April and June 2023 on PubMed and Google Scholar Databases. All English and French articles related to bioengineering applied to the field of breast reconstruction were included. We used the Evidence-Based Veterinary Medicine Association (EBVM) Toolkit 14 checklist for narrative reviews as a quality assurance measure and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) tool to self-assess our methodology.\nOver 130 references related to breast bioengineering were included. The analysis revealed four key applications: enhancing the quality of the skin envelope, improving the viability of fat grafting, creating breast shape and volume via bio-printing, and optimizing nipple reconstruction through engineering techniques. The primary identified approaches revolved around establishing structural support and enhancing cellular viability. Structural techniques predominantly involved the implementation of 3D printed, decellularized, or biocompatible material scaffolds. Meanwhile, promoting cellular content trophicity primarily focused on harnessing the regenerative potential of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and increasing the tissue's survivability and cell trophicity.\nTissue and bioengineering hold immense promise in the field of breast reconstruction, offering a diverse array of approaches.

{"title": "Demystifying vascularized lymph node transfers and lymphatico-venous anastomoses.", "abstract": "Lymphedema continues to be a widely prevalent condition with no definitive cure. It affects a wide range of patients across different ages and backgrounds. The significant burden of this chronic and debilitating condition necessitates more research and comprehensive healthcare coverage for affected patients. In developed countries, cancer survivors are disproportionality affected by this condition. Risk factors including lymph node dissections and radiation render many cancer patients more susceptible to the development of lymphedema. Part of the challenge with lymphedema care, is that it exits on a broad spectrum with significant variability of symptoms. Advances and broader availability of various imaging modalities continue to foster progress in lymphedema surgery. The conservative management of lymphedema remains the primary initial management option. However, lymphedema surgeries can provide significant hope and may pave the way for significant improvements in the quality-of-life for many patients afflicted by this progressive and enfeebling condition. Reductive and physiologic procedures are becoming an important part of the armamentarium of the modern plastic and reconstructive surgeon. Recent advances in physiologic lymphedema surgeries are accelerating their transition from experimental surgeries to broadly adopted and widely accepted procedures that can lead to major successes in the fight against this condition. Prophylactic lymphedema surgery also presents a promising choice for many patients and can help prevent lymphedema development in high-risk patients.", "journal": "Annals of translational medicine", "date": "2024-02-02", "authors": ["YasserAlmadani", "PeterDavison", "Johnny IonutEfanov", "GeorgeKokosis", "JoshuaVorstenbosch"], "doi": "10.21037/atm-23-132\n10.1097/01.sap.0000257149.42922.7e\n10.1016/s0002-9343(00)00727-0\n10.1196/annals.1413.014\n10.1016/j.jaad.2017.03.022\n10.1093/qjmed/hcg126\n10.1146/annurev-med-060116-022900\n10.1002/jso.24068\n10.3390/cancers14225667\n10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70076-7\n10.1056/NEJMcp1803290\n10.1002/cncr.22684\n10.1002/cncr.25458\n10.1097/CMR.0b013e3283632c83\n10.1016/j.breast.2014.03.001\n10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1368::aid-cncr1459>3.0.co;2-9\n10.1200/JCO.2008.16.3725\n10.1245/s10434-009-0347-2\n10.1177/153857440503900107\n10.1001/archsurg.1963.01310120036007\n10.1111/cge.12173\n10.1002/bjs.18004518902\n10.7759/cureus.4779\n10.2174/1566524024605662\n10.1177/026835550702200604\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3182450b2d\n10.1172/JCI71608\n10.1093/cvr/cvq062\n10.1089/lrb.2013.1131\n10.1196/annals.1413.010\n10.1097/00006534-199602000-00018\n10.1097/01.prs.0000246516.64780.61\n10.1097/01.prs.0000437257.78327.5b\n10.1007/s00270-014-0888-z\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2014.06.004\n10.1007/s11764-012-0247-5\n10.1111/j.1365-2354.2007.00877.x\n10.1007/s00520-013-1763-1\n10.1177/0268355515586312\n10.3390/cancers12030565\n10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.01.006\n10.1007/s10549-011-1667-z\n10.1007/s00520-011-1089-9\n10.1001/archsurg.2010.231\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0168\n10.1016/j.suronc.2006.11.003\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-1245\n10.1111/j.1524-4741.2009.00855.x\n10.35772/ghm.2020.01022\n10.1016/j.ejso.2006.04.019\n10.1089/lrb.2017.0013\n10.21037/gs.2020.03.20\n10.1006/gyno.2001.6266\n10.1097/SAP.0000000000001864\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2303\n10.1089/lrb.2008.1524\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060164\n10.1007/s002470050139\n10.1038/ejhg.2015.41\n10.1016/j.suronc.2018.10.006\n10.1097/SAP.0000000000001120\n10.1007/s10549-022-06777-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0041126\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3182a4d626\n10.1002/jbio.201700132\n10.1016/j.mvr.2008.03.003\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000003362\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000000822\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000009557\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000006520\n10.3978/j.issn.2227-684X.2015.03.02\n10.3400/avd.ra.12.00080\n10.2147/CIA.S159380\n10.5535/arm.2015.39.3.347\n10.1016/j.pmrj.2012.05.003\n10.1007/s11764-020-00928-1\n10.1097/MD.0000000000023192\n10.1001/archsurg.133.4.452\n10.1007/s10147-007-0715-5\n10.1002/pon.4239\n10.1089/lrb.2022.0029\n10.1016/0002-9610(80)90276-7\n10.1097/00000637-198810000-00012\n10.1055/s-0035-1549158\n10.1016/0007-1226(89)90039-8\n10.1177/145749690309200409\n10.1002/micr.22235\n10.1080/028418600750013195\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000101506.84361.C9\n10.1097/01.prs.0000237020.29209.22\n10.1097/00006534-199906000-00009\n10.1055/s-0038-1635116\n10.1097/SAP.0000000000000853\n10.1111/tbj.12282\n10.1002/jso.24969\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000005993\n10.1097/00000637-198212000-00001\n10.1016/j.bjps.2016.06.022\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e31826ed043\n10.1055/s-0038-1635119\n10.1055/s-0038-1632401\n10.1097/01.sla.0000201258.10304.16\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182426757\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e31828bd3b3\n10.1097/SAP.0000000000002460\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2017.08.001\n10.1002/jso.25033\n10.1097/GOX.0000000000001288\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000003343\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000001374\n10.1002/micr.30126\n10.1097/GOX.0000000000002505\n10.1002/jso.25180\n10.1245/s10434-011-2017-4\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2021.03.002\n10.1097/00006534-199204000-00021\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181e5f6a9\n10.1002/bjs.9588\n10.1097/00006534-197708000-00006\n10.1016/0007-1226(89)90075-1\n10.1016/j.bjps.2013.12.056\n10.1055/s-2006-947150\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e31820cf2e2\n10.1097/GOX.0000000000002671\n10.1016/j.bjps.2017.10.004\n10.1002/micr.1025\n10.1097/01.sap.0000120319.89926.07\n10.1002/jso.24351\n10.1245/s10434-015-4721-y\n10.1245/s10434-008-0270-y\n10.1055/s-0039-3401829\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000007636\n10.1002/micr.22254\n10.1245/s10434-020-09104-2\n10.1089/wound.2021.0056\n10.1016/j.bjps.2021.11.094\n10.1097/SLA.0000000000003746\n10.1097/GOX.0000000000003431\n10.1097/IGC.0b013e318287a8e8\n10.1097/01.sap.0000222727.05869.04\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000009857\n10.1245/s10434-021-10551-8\n10.1097/SLA.0000000000002827\n10.1016/j.jvsv.2022.07.007"}
{"title": "Viral Keratitis, Surgical Intervention in Viral Keratitis, Challenges in Diagnosis and Treatment of Viral Keratitis, HSV, HZV.", "abstract": "Viral keratitis is a significant cause of ocular morbidity and visual impairment worldwide. In recent years, there has been a growing understanding of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic modalities for viral keratitis. The most common viral pathogens associated with this condition are adenovirus, herpes simplex (HSV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). However, emerging viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Vaccinia virus can also cause keratitis. Non-surgical interventions are the mainstay of treatment for viral keratitis. Antiviral agents such as Acyclovir, Ganciclovir, and trifluridine have effectively reduced viral replication and improved clinical outcomes. Additionally, adjunctive measures such as lubrication, corticosteroids, and immunomodulatory agents have alleviated symptoms by reducing inflammation and facilitating tissue repair. Despite these conservative approaches, some cases of viral keratitis may progress to severe forms, leading to corneal scarring, thinning, or perforation. In such instances, surgical intervention becomes necessary to restore corneal integrity and visual function. This review article aims to provide an overview of the current perspectives and surgical interventions in managing viral keratitis. The choice of surgical technique depends on the extent and severity of corneal involvement. As highlighted in this article, on-going research and advancements in surgical interventions hold promise for further improving outcomes in patients with viral keratitis.", "journal": "Seminars in ophthalmology", "date": "2024-02-02", "authors": ["AnithaVenugopal", "JosephineChristy", "VaidehiRaut", "PreethiP", "VeenaPatwardhan", "VeerammaV", "AditeeMadkaikar", "MangalaP", "RavindranMeenakshi", "RangappaRamakrishnan"], "doi": "10.1080/08820538.2024.2309533"}

B16F10 cells were xenografted to C57BL/6 mice treated with anti-PD1 or 0.9% NaCl. Tumor volume was measured daily while CEUS and LSCI were performed weekly. LSCI and CEUS analyses showed a decrease in tumor perfusion in both groups of mice. Although both CEUS and LSCI are useful for measuring tumor volume, LSCI appears to be more robust and effective for monitoring tumor microcirculation.

{"title": "On-chip recapitulation of the tumor microenvironment: A decade of progress.", "abstract": "One of the hurdles to the development of new anticancer therapies is the lack of in vitro models which faithfully reproduce the in vivo tumor microenvironment (TME). Understanding the dynamic relationships between the components of the TME in a controllable, scalable, and reliable setting would indeed support the discovery of biological targets impacting cancer diagnosis and therapy. Cancer research is increasingly shifting from traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture toward three-dimensional (3D) culture models, which have been demonstrated to increase the significance and predictive value of in vitro data. In this scenario, microphysiological systems (also known as organs-on-chip) have emerged as a relevant technological platform enabling more predictive investigation of cell-cell and cell-ECM interplay in cancer, attracting a significant research effort in the last years. This review illustrates one decade of progress in the field of tumor-microenvironment-on-chip (TMOC) approaches, exploiting either cell-laden microfluidic chambers or microfluidic confined tumor spheroids to model the TME. TMOCs have been designed to recapitulate several aspects of the TME, including tumor cells, the tumor-associated stroma, the immune system, and the vascular component. Significantly, the last aspect has emerged for its pivotal role in orchestrating cellular interactions and modulating drug pharmacokinetics on-chip. A further advancement has been represented by integration of TMOCs into multi-organ microphysiological systems, with the final aim to follow the metastatic cascade to target organs and to study the effects of chemotherapies at a systemic level. We highlight that the increased degree of complexity achieved by the most advanced TMOC models has enabled scientists to shed new light on the role of microenvironmental factors in tumor progression, metastatic cascade, and response to drugs.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2024-02-02", "authors": ["S MGiannitelli", "VPeluzzi", "SRaniolo", "GRoscilli", "MTrombetta", "PMozetic", "ARainer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2024.122482"}

{"title": "Use of Banked Fibula for Improved Nasal Reconstruction Following Free Fibula Midface Reconstruction.", "abstract": "Anterior maxillary deficiency caused by trauma or oncologic resection presents a complex reconstructive challenge. The authors present a technique for 2-stage midface reconstruction utilizing a vascularized free fibula flap for maxillary reconstruction, followed by nasal reconstruction at a second stage utilizing a banked fibula graft.\nThis case series utilizes a 2-stage technique for midface reconstruction. In the first stage, a fibula-free flap was used to reconstruct the maxilla with the excess banked in the abdomen. In the second stage, this bone graft was used to restore the nasal dorsum.\nTwo patients were included in this series. Patient 1 was a 28-year-old man who presented after a remote gunshot wound to his face, resulting in complete loss of his anterior maxilla and nasal support with midface collapse. Patient 2 was a 65-year-old man who presented with squamous cell carcinoma of the hard palate with extension into the maxilla and nasal septum. In both cases, the flaps healed without complication, providing midface restoration. Placement of the banked fibula graft in a second stage resulted in restoration of dorsal nasal projection.\nThe authors describe the use of \"spare\" fibula parts for nasal reconstruction after loss of the maxilla and cartilaginous septum. The use of the fibula bone as a graft to restore the nasal dorsum in a delayed manner allows for a better assessment of the esthetic needs after the massive swelling from the initial surgery has abated.

Here, we present the case of a 34-year-old man with a history of progressive visual disturbances. MRI unveiled a sella lesion with suprasellar and retrosellar extensions. Elevated prolactin levels (6125 ng/mL) confirmed the diagnosis of prolactinoma, leading to initiation of medical treatment, with gradual escalation to maximum dosing. The patient achieved only partial hormonal response and incomplete improvement of symptoms, and therefore, surgical intervention was pursued with objective of maximum safe resection. The patient consented to the procedure. An endonasal endoscopic approach was selected. Surgical procedures encompassed transsellar, transtuberculum, and transplanum approaches, extended laterally to expose the right parasellar carotid and the anterior wall of the cavernous sinus. Subsequent steps involved opening the sellar and suprasellar dura mater, anterior wall of the cavernous sinus, and transcavernous hemipituitary transposition for access to the retrosellar region.1-5 Debulking of the lesion was performed, followed by dissection of the retrosellar space and resection of tumor component within the interpeduncular cistern. Reconstruction employed dura substitute and vascularized nasoseptal flap. Histopathology confirmed diagnosis of prolactinoma. Postoperative MRI findings and significantly improved prolactin levels (50 ng/mL) were compatible with near total resection. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, resulting in discharge on the second postoperative day. The patient was additionally started on cabergoline 0.5 mg 2x/week to achieve hormonal control.

This raises concerns about a potential global heart failure pandemic stemming from COVID-19, an SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in near future. Although faced with this healthcare caveat, there is limited research on persistent viral heart infections, and no models have been established. In this study, we created an SARS-CoV-2 persistent infection model using human iPS cell-derived cardiac microtissues (CMTs). Mild infections sustained viral presence without significant dysfunction for a month, indicating persistent infection. However, when exposed to hypoxic conditions mimicking ischemic heart diseases, cardiac function deteriorated alongside intracellular SARS-CoV-2 reactivation in cardiomyocytes and disrupted vascular network formation.

{"title": "Rapid innervation and physiological epidermal regeneration by bioengineered dermis implanted in mouse.", "abstract": "Tissue-engineered skin substitutes are promising tools to cover large and deep skin defects. However, the lack of a synergic and fast regeneration of the vascular network, nerves, and skin appendages limits complete skin healing and impairs functional recovery. It has been highlighted that an ideal skin substitute should mimic the structure of the native tissue to enhance clinical effectiveness. Here, we produced a pre-vascularized dermis (PVD) comprised of fibroblasts embedded in their own extracellular matrix (ECM) and a capillary-like network. Upon implantation in a mouse full-thickness skin defect model, we observed a very early innervation of the graft in 2 weeks. In addition, mouse capillaries and complete epithelialization were detectable as early as 1 week after implantation and, skin appendages developed in 2 weeks. These anatomical features underlie the interaction with the skin nerves, thus providing a further cue for reinnervation guidance. Further, the graft displays mechanical properties, collagen density, and assembly features very similar to the host tissue.

{"title": "Acinic Cell Carcinoma of the Breast: A Case Report and Review of Literature.", "abstract": "Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) is an exceedingly rare type of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We are reporting a case of a 46-year-old female patient who presented with a palpable lump in her left breast not associated with pain, pruritis, or change of skin color. An open biopsy revealed a mass of about 20 x 25 mm of fleshy, white tan with a lobular configuration and necrosis. The histopathological examination revealed cells with cytoplasmic granularity arranged in a microglandular pattern and a solid pattern, and the case was initially reported as ACC. The most remarkable feature was the presence of small and large, brightly eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules, and some cells are clear or multivacuolated, resembling lipoblasts. Cellular pleomorphism and anaplasia are very mild, and the mitotic activity was very low. The tumor showed a scant and vascularized stroma in the area of hyalinization. Small clusters of lymphoid infiltration in the stroma were seen. Histochemical stains revealed that the acinar cells in ACC contain abundant diastase-resistant, periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive cytoplasmic granules. Mucicarmine and Alcian blue were negative. The immunohistochemistry workup revealed that the case was positive for discovered on gastrointestinal stromal tumors-1 (DOG-1) and the positivity pattern ranged from apical membranous, cytoplasmic, and complete membranous. In addition, the tumor cells were positive for low-molecular-weight cytokeratin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). The FISH workup for the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion was negative, arguing against secretory carcinoma (SC). A diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma of the breast is very rare, and the presence of cytoplasmic granules is helpful for its diagnosis. In the absence of these granules, the diagnosis is very difficult, and other diagnoses will be put in the differential diagnosis, particularly SC, lactating adenosis, and microglandular adenosis. Immunohistochemical and histochemical stains and genetic workups will support the diagnosis of ACC.", "journal": "Cureus", "date": "2024-02-01", "authors": ["Ihab SAtta"], "doi": "10.7759/cureus.51427"}

{"title": "Propranolol: a new pharmacologic approach to counter retinopathy of prematurity progression.", "abstract": "Despite the evident progress in neonatal medicine, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) remains a serious threat to the vision of premature infants, due to a still partial understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of this disease and the lack of drugs capable of arresting its progression. Although ROP is a multifactorial disease, retinal vascularization is strictly dependent on oxygen concentration. The exposition of the retina of a preterm newborn, still incompletely vascularized, to an atmosphere relatively hyperoxic, as the extrauterine environment, induces the downregulation of proangiogenic factors and therefore the interruption of vascularization (first ischemic phase of ROP). However, over the following weeks, the growing metabolic requirement of this ischemic retina produces a progressive hypoxia that specularly promotes the surge of proangiogenic factors, finally leading to proliferative retinopathy (second proliferative phase of ROP). The demonstration that the noradrenergic system is actively involved in the coupling between hypoxia and the induction of vasculogenesis paved the way for a pharmacologic intervention aimed at counteracting the interaction of noradrenaline with specific receptors and consequently the progression of ROP. A similar trend has been observed in infantile hemangiomas, the most common vascular lesion of childhood induced by pre-existing hypoxia, which shares similar characteristics with ROP. The fact that propranolol, an unselective antagonist of \u03b21/2 adrenoceptors, counteracts the growth of infantile hemangiomas, suggested the idea of testing the efficacy of propranolol in infants with ROP. From preclinical studies, ongoing clinical trials demonstrated that topical administration of propranolol likely represents the optimal approach to reconcile its efficacy and maximum safety. Given the strict relationship between vessels and neurons, recovering retinal vascularization with propranolol may add further efficacy to prevent retinal dysfunction. In conclusion, the strategy of contrasting precociously the progression of the disease appears to be more advantageous than the current wait-and-see therapeutic approach, which instead is mainly focused on avoiding retinal detachment.", "journal": "Frontiers in pediatrics", "date": "2024-01-31", "authors": ["FrancescaPascarella", "Rosa TeresaScaramuzzo", "AlessandroPini", "MaurizioCammalleri", "PaolaBagnoli", "MassimilianoCiantelli", "LucaFilippi"], "doi": "10.3389/fped.2024.1322783\n10.1542/peds.2007-0803\n10.1007/s00431-013-1966-y\n10.1002/med.21336\n10.1542/peds.2014-3673\n10.1007/s40257-013-0008-x\n10.1111/j.1525-1470.2005.00102.x\n10.1016/j.jpeds.2006.12.003\n10.1159/000521413\n10.1111/j.1525-1470.2007.00450.x\n10.1001/archdermatol.2010.1295\n10.1136/bjo.87.3.275\n10.3892/mmr.2012.1075\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2008.05.001\n10.1167/iovs.03-0249\n10.1016/j.cyto.2009.11.012\n10.1542/peds.2004-1518\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.150284\n10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc\n10.3390/ijms241512487\n10.1038/70963\n10.1186/1471-2431-10-83\n10.1001/archophthalmol.2011.319\n10.1055/s-0041-1733785\n10.1111/aos.12049\n10.1371/journal.pone.0005514\n10.3389/fped.2023.1140021\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2017.11.001\n10.1001/jama.2018.5725\n10.1055/s-0040-1713181\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2008.09.003\n10.1136/bjo.2007.135640\n10.3389/fphar.2022.835771\n10.3390/biomedicines1007160\n10.1053/j.semperi.2019.05.012\n10.3389/fped.2022.81640\n10.1017/S2040174411000766\n10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2006.02.011\n10.1016/j.oret.2020.02.001\n10.2147/EB.S95021\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2020.100878\n10.1542/peds.2006-0385\n10.1371/journal.pone.0230678\n10.1136/archdischild-2016-312533\n10.1136/archdischild-2016-310532\n10.1016/j.clp.2013.02.001\n10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2007.11.009\n10.1016/j.ajo.2018.05.024\n10.1542/peds.2004-1180\n10.1016/0895-4356(92)90168-m\n10.1542/peds.86.3.405\n10.1542/peds.67.6.924\n10.3345/cep.2021.00773\n10.4103/ijo.IJO_496_19\n10.1038/pr.2013.205\n10.1542/peds.2004-1413\n10.1016/j.survophthal.2018.04.002\n10.4103/0301-4738.33817\n10.1016/j.jaapos.2009.10.011\n10.1056/NEJMoa1007374\n10.1053/j.semperi.2019.05.011\n10.1093/pch/21.2.101\n10.1001/archopht.121.12.1684\n10.1001/archopht.1994.01090140028007\n10.5546/aap.2014.eng.160\n10.1080/02713683.2016.1196709\n10.1080/02713683.2016.1264607\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2020.12.028\n10.1542/peds.2015-3218\n10.1016/j.jaapos.2017.10.006\n10.1056/NEJMc0708819\n10.1056/NEJMoa1404710\n10.1159/000510029\n10.1152/ajpregu.1998.274.1.R19\n10.1002/ijc.25589\n10.1167/iovs.10-5536\n10.1074/jbc.M300368200\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.189605\n10.3390/ijms23095140\n10.1167/iovs.10-5176\n10.1016/S0076-6879(08)02806-1\n10.1016/j.phrs.2023.106713\n10.1038/nm1095-1024\n10.1038/nprot.2009.187\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07530.x\n10.1016/j.exer.2013.03.013\n10.1038/pr.2014.108\n10.3389/fncel.2017.00395\n10.1089/jop.2020.0092\n10.1016/j.jpeds.2013.07.049\n10.1515/jpm-2015-0357\n10.1136/archdischild-2013-303951\n10.3109/02713683.2016.1158272\n10.1136/archdischild-2016-311548\n10.3760/cma.j.issn.2096-2932.2018.04.007\n10.1007/s10792-018-1018-8\n10.22038/IJN.2023.70115.2361\n10.34172/cjmb.2022.10\n10.1002/14651858.CD011893.pub2\n10.1038/s41372-019-0503-x\n10.3389/fped.2021.631673\n10.1016/j.ajo.2023.11.012\n10.1038/pr.2016.230\n10.3389/fped.2019.00180\n10.1111/apa.16850\n10.3389/fped.2019.00479\n10.1186/1747-1028-8-1\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e318254ce7a\n10.1001/archopht.130.1.117\n10.1038/nm1750\n10.7554/eLife.43026\n10.1172/JCI151109\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e318267d3db\n10.1097/SAP.0000000000002104"}

We report such the case of a metatarsal osteoblastoma which was treated with wide excision and non-vascularized fibular autograft: a reliable method of reconstruction.\nA 25-year-old woman presented with progressive pain and swelling over the right foot for 4 years. On examination, there was a gross swelling over the fourth metatarsal region over the dorsum of the foot. Radiographs revealed a osteoblastic lesion of the fourth metatarsal bone expanding into the intermetatarsal region. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an expansile altered signal intensity lesion which was hypointense on both T1 and T2 - weighted images with no soft-tissue component. With a working diagnosis of locally aggressive bone-forming tumor, she underwent wide excision of the tumor with reconstruction using a non-vascularized fibular autograft. Intraoperative samples sent for histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of osteoblastoma. After 2 years of follow-up, the patient is able to weight bear with no pain and imaging shows graft incorporation with no signs of recurrence.\nOsteoblastoma of the metatarsal region can present a diagnostic conundrum to the treating clinician due to its rare nature.

{"title": "Fibular Grafting: A Worthwhile skill to Master for Difficult neck of Femur Fractures - A Case Series.", "abstract": "Neck of femur fractures (NOF) in younger adults are often treated by head-preserving fixation procedures. Non-union is an infrequent but troublesome complication following internal fixation, especially in atypical presentations. Vascularized (VFG) and non-VFG (NVFG) fibular grafting and realignment procedures have been described as an adjunct to internal fixation. Reports are rare regarding the versatility of fibular grafts, their use, and their outcomes in the United Kingdom.\nWe present three complex NOF cases performed in the United Kingdom. One case is a 29-year-old Asian female treated with NVFG for a pathological transverse NOF fracture secondary to fibrous dysplasia. One case is a non-union following failed surgical management and revised using NVFG and dynamic hip screws. The last case is a VFG in a complex non-union intra-capsular fracture following conservative management in a 17-year-old male. Certain patient characteristics are described which make joint preserving surgery more attractive. All fractures united with no revisions at the time of final follow-up. Distinctions between the use of VFG and NVFG grafts are discussed.\nThis case series demonstrates the important versatility of fibular grafting and how its properties are used in different cases. Fibular grafting is an effective technique in pathological, non-union, and late-presenting NOF.

{"title": "Cell Chirality of Micropatterned Endometrial Microvascular Endothelial Cells.", "abstract": "Chirality is an intrinsic cellular property that describes cell polarization biases along the left-right axis, apicobasal axis, or front-rear axes. Cell chirality plays a significant role in the arrangement of organs in the body as well as in the orientation of organelles, cytoskeletons, and cells. Vascular networks within the endometrium, the mucosal inner lining of the uterus, commonly display spiral architectures that rapidly form across the menstrual cycle. Herein, the role of endometrial-relevant extracellular matrix stiffness, composition, and soluble signals on endometrial endothelial cell chirality is systematically examined using a high-throughput microarray. Endometrial endothelial cells display marked patterns of chirality as individual cells and as cohorts in response to substrate stiffness and environmental cues. Vascular networks formed from endometrial endothelial cells also display shifts in chirality as a function of exogenous hormones. Changes in cellular-scale chirality correlate with changes in vascular network parameters, suggesting a critical role for cellular chirality in directing endometrial vessel network organization.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2024-01-31", "authors": ["Samantha GZambuto", "IshitaJain", "Hannah STheriault", "Gregory HUnderhill", "Brendan A CHarley"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202303928"}

Posttraumatic lymphedema (PTL) is a debilitating condition that remains understudied and underreported, and surgical techniques for PTL treatment are not well-represented in the literature. The purpose of this study was to systematically review all published reports of physiologic surgical interventions for PTL.\n\u2003A search was conducted on PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science, from January 1, 2000 to December 6, 2022, using keywords \"PTL,\" \"lymphedema,\" and \"surgery\" to identify reports of PTL treated with microsurgical lymphatic reconstruction techniques. PTL cases treated with ablation, debulking, or decongestive therapy were excluded.\n\u2003A total of 18 records that met the inclusion criteria were identified, representing 112 patients who underwent microsurgical operations for PTL. This included 60 cases of lymph flow restoration (LFR) via lymph axiality and interpositional flap transfer, 29 vascularized lymph node transfers, 11 lymphatic vessel free flaps, 10 lymphovenous anastomoses (LVAs), and 2 autologous lymphovenous transfers. Outcomes were primarily reported as clinical improvement or LFR by lymphatic imaging. All studies showed qualitative improvement of symptoms and reports with quantitative data showed statistically significant improvements.\n\u2003PTL is currently underrepresented in lymphedema treatment literature, however, our results show that microsurgical techniques are successful in treating lymphedema in PTL patients. Increasing awareness of PTL and establishing standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment options will help clinicians better understand how to diagnose and treat this condition. Prospective and comparative studies are needed to determine true prevalence of PTL and optimal treatment strategies.", "journal": "Journal of reconstructive microsurgery", "date": "2024-01-31", "authors": ["Victoria ADahl", "Kashyap KTadisina", "EvaHale", "NataliaFullerton", "JuanMella-Catinchi", "Kyle YXu"], "doi": "10.1055/a-2257-5345"}

{"title": "Early spiral arteriole remodeling in the uterine-placental interface: A rat model.", "abstract": "The mammalian placenta's interface with the parent is a richly vascularized tissue whose development relies upon communication between many different cell types within the uterine microenvironment. The uterine blood vessels of the interface are reshaped during pregnancy into wide-bore, flaccid vessels that convey parental blood to the exchange region of the placenta. Invasive trophoblast as well as parental uterine macrophages and Natural Killer cells are involved in the stepwise remodeling of these vessels and their respective contributions to this crucial process are still being delineated. However, the earliest steps in arteriole remodeling are understudied as they are difficult to study in humans, and other species lack the deep trophoblast invasion that is so prominent a feature of placentation in humans. Here, we further characterize the rat, with deep hemochorial placentation akin to humans, as a model system in which to tease apart the earliest, relatively understudied events in spiral arteriole remodeling. We show that the rat uterine-placental interface increases in size and vascularity rapidly, before trophoblast invasion. The remodeling stages in the arterioles of the rat uterine-placental interface follow a sequence of anatomical changes similar to those in humans, and there are changes to the arterioles' muscular tunica media prior to the marked influx of immune cells. The rat is a tractable model in which to better understand the cell/cell interactions occurring in\u00a0vivo in an intact tissue microenvironment over time.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2024-01-30", "authors": ["Sarah JBacon", "YuxiZhu", "PriyanjaliGhosh"], "doi": "10.1111/joa.14019"}

In January 2021, the first hand allotransplantation since legalization was successfully performed, and we have performed a total of three successful hand transplantation since then. By comparing and incorporating our experiences, this study aimed to provide a comprehensive reconstructive solution for hand amputation in Korea.\nRecipients were selected through a structured preoperative evaluation, and hand transplantations were performed at the distal forearm level. Postoperatively, patients were treated with three-drug immunosuppressive regimen, and functional outcomes were monitored.\nThe hand transplantations were performed without intraoperative complications. All patients had partial skin necrosis and underwent additional surgical procedures in 2 months after transplantation. After additional operations, no further severe complications were observed. Also, patients developed acute rejection within 3 months of surgery, but all resolved within 2 weeks after steroid pulse therapy. Motor and sensory function improved dramatically, and patients were very satisfied with the appearance and function of their transplanted hands.\nHand transplantation is a viable reconstructive option, and patients have shown positive functional and psychological outcomes. Although this study has limitations, such as the small number of patients and short follow-up period, we should focus on continued recovery of hand function, and be careful not to develop side effects from immunosuppressive drugs.

{"title": "Efficacy of personalized 3D-printed osteotomy guide in maximizing fibular utilization and minimizing graft length for reconstruction of large mandibular defect.", "abstract": "The study addresses the long-standing challenge of insufficient length in vascularized fibular flaps when reconstructing large mandibular defects that require dual-barrel grafts. Employing personalized 3D-printed osteotomy guides, the study aims to optimize fibular utilization and minimize the required graft length.\nTwo reconstruction methods for distal bone defects were compared: a fold-down (FD) group that employed a specialized osteotomy guide for folding down a triangular bone segment, and a traditional double-barrel (DB) group. Metrics for comparison included defect and graft lengths, as well as the graft-to-defect length ratio. Postoperative quality of life was assessed using the University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire (UW-QoL).\nBoth FD and DB groups achieved successful mandibular reconstruction. Despite larger defects in the FD group (117\u2009\u00b1\u200931.35\u00a0mm vs 84\u2009\u00b1\u200935.34\u00a0mm, p\u2009=\u20090.028), the used fibula length was not statistically longer in the FD group. The median ratio of graft-to-defect length was also lower in the FD group (1.327 vs 1.629, p\u2009=\u20090.024), suggesting that FD required only 82.47% of the graft length needed in the DB approach. Quality of life scores post-surgery were comparable between the groups.\nPersonalized 3D-printed osteotomy guides enhance fibula graft efficacy for reconstructing larger mandibular defects, necessitating shorter graft lengths while preserving postoperative quality of life.\nThis study confirms the utility of 3D printing technology as an effective and precise tool in orthopedic surgery, particularly for complex reconstructions like large mandibular defects.

However, the significant risk of donor tissue rejection requires lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Tacrolimus, a common component of immunosuppressive regimens, offers effectiveness in preventing organ rejection but poses challenges due to its narrow therapeutic window and toxicity, making it essential to carefully monitor its concentration. Tacrolimus trough levels are currently measured in blood, requiring frequent blood draws from patients, and results are available after 3 to 6\u00a0h. To address the need for a fast, minimally-invasive, and simple method to monitor tacrolimus concentrations, we have assessed a new device for at-home analysis, the Immunosuppressant Drug Monitor (IDM) that can extract, identify and quantify tacrolimus in saliva within 15\u00a0min. We included males and females hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital Transplant Unit, between the ages of 21 and 65\u00a0years, and treated with Tacrolimus. Informed consent, demographic and treatment data were collected. Each subject was asked to provide a 5\u00a0mL saliva sample that was de-identified and processed by the IDM, while a 5\u00a0mL blood sample was drawn and supplied to the MGH clinical lab for analysis by the current standard, immunoassays. The predicted tacrolimus concentration found in saliva was compared to the blood trough level results. 62 samples from 31 different patients were obtained. The male to female ratio and ethnicity distribution were well balanced. The majority of patients were within 30\u00a0days of initiating tacrolimus treatment.

Moreover, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a low-grade dermal neoplasm with a high recurrence rate. There is still no consensus on the extent of resection to prevent a recurrence.\nWe present a case of a patient who underwent the reconstruction of a large abdominal wall defect with a subtotal thigh flap after the resection of recurrent DFSP.\nA 59-year-old man killed from a recurrent huge mass in the lower abdomen with an invasion of the small intestine. His baseline characteristics and records of operations, medications, and outcomes were reviewed.\nAfter tumor excision, a 28 \u00d7 30-cm subtotal thigh flap was harvested from his left thigh to reconstruct the abdominal defect. A microvascular anastomosis with left deep inferior epigastric vessels was made eventually. The flap was in good condition, and the donor site was covered with a split-thickness skin graft.\nSubtotal thigh flap may be considered for large abdominal wall defect reconstruction as it allows good perfusion of relatively large skin paddles compared with other free flaps.

Therefore, cellular target-based immunomodulation is promising to promote wound healing as cells are the smallest unit of life in immune response. Recently, immunomodulatory hydrogels have become an attractive avenue to promote skin wound healing. However, a detailed and comprehensive review of cellular targets and related hydrogel design strategies remains lacking. In this review, the roles of the main immunoregulatory cells participating in skin wound healing are first discussed, and then we highlight the cellular targets and state-of-the-art design strategies for immunomodulatory hydrogels based on immunoregulatory cells that cover defect, infected, diabetic, burn and tumor wounds and related scar healing.

In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the field of bone regeneration. Oxygen tension regulates cellular behavior, which in turn affects tissue regeneration through metabolic programming. Biomaterials with oxygen release capabilities enhance therapeutic effectiveness and reduce tissue damage from hypoxia. However, precise control over oxygen release is a significant technical challenge, despite its potential to support cellular viability and differentiation. The matrices often used to repair large-size bone defects do not supply enough oxygen to the stem cells being used in the regeneration process. Hypoxia-induced necrosis primarily occurs in the central regions of large matrices due to inadequate provision of oxygen and nutrients by the surrounding vasculature of the host tissues. Oxygen generating biomaterials (OGBs) are becoming increasingly significant in enhancing our capacity to facilitate the bone regeneration, thereby addressing the challenges posed by hypoxia or inadequate vascularization.

{"title": "Printable oxygen-generating biodegradable scaffold for thicker tissue-engineered medical products.", "abstract": "Due to the increasing demand to generate thick and vascularized tissue-engineered constructs, novel strategies are currently being developed. An effective example is the fabrication of a 3D scaffold containing oxygen-releasing biomaterials to solve the limitations of gas\u00a0diffusion and transport within transplanted tissues or devices.\nIn this study, we developed a biodegradable scaffold made of polycaprolactone (PCL) mixed with oxygen-generating calcium peroxide (CPO) to design new structures for regenerative tissue using a 3D printer capable of forming arbitrarily shapes.\nWhen osteoblast progenitor cells (MC3T3-E1 cells) were cultured under hypoxic conditions on scaffolds fabricated with this technique, it was shown that cell death was reduced by the new scaffolds. Therefore, the results suggest that 3D-printed scaffolds made from biodegradable oxygen-releasing materials may be useful for tissue engineering and regeneration.", "journal": "Artificial organs", "date": "2024-01-29", "authors": ["ZihanPei", "KevinMontagne", "AyakaNamiki", "MakotoShinohara", "TakashiUshida", "Katsuko SFurukawa"], "doi": "10.1111/aor.14713"}
{"title": "Reconstruction of the orbitozygomatic framework: State of the art and perspectives.", "abstract": "The reconstruction of the whole orbitozygomatic framework (OZF) is complex and can be encountered in cases of congenital midface deformity, after tumor ablative surgery and in severe facial trauma. Nowadays, surgeon has a wide range of available techniques that have continually grown over the past years, optimizing the surgical management and the aesthetical outcomes. Among them, the autologous bone graft (ABG) remains one of the most suitable options : ABG is easy to harvest and has optimal biological properties for bone healing. It can be tailored to the patient anatomy thanks to the recent advances in computer-assisted surgery. However, substantial drawbacks remain such as the early resorption of the non-vascularized graft, the need of a donor site and its potential morbidity. Alloplastic reconstruction is another option that can resolve both the resorption issue and the donor site morbidity. Moreover, the 3D-printing technologies also allows the manufacturing of patient specific implants. However, alloplastic materials have a variable success, especially due to the high risk of infection or exposure. Consequently, regenerative medicine is a promising field that aims to find a procedure without the disadvantages of ABG or alloplastic based reconstructions, but displaying similar or even higher success rate. Indeed, recent tissue engineering strategies have demonstrated encouraging results for bone regeneration using natural or synthetic biomaterials, patient cells and synthetic bioactive substances. The objective of this review is to present the etiologies of OZF defect, the available reconstruction procedures as well as the current state of the research.", "journal": "Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2024-01-29", "authors": ["S\u00e9gol\u00e8neReiss", "DimitriKulker", "BorisLaure", "ArnaudPar\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jormas.2024.101788"}
{"title": "Bioinspired adhesive hydrogel based on serotonin-modified gelatin and oxidized hyaluronic acid for rapid hemostasis and wound healing.", "abstract": "A hybrid hydrogel system (GSOHA) consisting of serotonin-grafted gelatin and oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) was developed in this study to efficiently control bleeding and prevent bacterial infections during surgery and trauma. The study results showed that the incorporation of serotonin successfully produced hydrogels with rapid hemostatic, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties. The GSOHA hydrogel exhibited considerably stronger tissue adhesion (15.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36\u00a0kPa) to porcine skin than the commercial fibrin glue (1.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0kPa). In addition, the hydrogel could rapidly absorb blood cells and stimulate cell conjugation with serotonin addition. In vitro experiments using endothelial cells and erythrocytes demonstrated the excellent biocompatibility and hemocompatibility of the hydrogel. Most importantly, the GSOHA hydrogel accelerated the wound healing process in a full-thickness skin defect mice model, and the histological staining results demonstrated that GSOHA significantly promoted collagen deposition and vascularization. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the significant potential of the GSOHA hydrogel as an adhesive dressing for rapid hemostasis and wound healing.", "journal": "International journal of biological macromolecules", "date": "2024-01-29", "authors": ["YongchaoJiang", "WenjieZhang", "YingyingGuo", "XuejingZheng", "KeyongTang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.129739"}
{"title": "The Know-how of Polymeric Nanocarrier Based Vaginal Drug Delivery System: Pitfalls, Challenges and Trends.", "abstract": "Gynecological health is a global concern, and thus, the formulator researcher strives to improve the quality of life through innovative feminine pharmaceutical formulations. Vaginal delivery appears to be one of the vital strategies for local and systemic action of the therapeutically active agent. The rich vascular network, mucosal permeability, bypass of hepatic first-pass effect, and low enzymatic activity are the exclusive advantages of the vaginal route. But certain hindrances truncate the vaginal route, such as physiological factors including lower pH, self-cleansing mucus with constant secretion, and varying thickness of mucus layer due to menstrual cycle and microbiota. Significance of Review: This present review envisages the advances in the polymeric nanocarriers in the delivery to the vaginal route. Polymeric (mucoadhesive and PEGylated, etc.) nanocarriers have been recently utilized for drug delivery purposes. The modernized analysis of the updated advancements in the polymeric nanocarrier-based vaginal drug delivery system with the budding development is compiled in the present review.\nThe literature search reveals that the novel polymeric nanocarrier design strategies currently being proposed to perk up the delivery of customary drugs through the vaginal route prove effective.\nPolymeric nanocarrier for vaginal delivery has provided better therapeutic efficacy due to higher drug residence, improved permeation, and sustained release of the active therapeutic agent. The polymeric nanocarriers can deliver different proteins, peptides, nuclear materials, hormones, etc., vaginally that are difficult for administration.", "journal": "Pharmaceutical nanotechnology", "date": "2024-01-27", "authors": ["PranitaKanojiya", "RitaWadetwar", "MeghaKaremore", "SatyendraPrasad"], "doi": "10.2174/0122117385283801231212114538"}
{"title": "Developmental Associations between Neurovascularization and Microglia Colonization.", "abstract": "The temporal and spatial pattern of microglia colonization and vascular infiltration of the nervous system implies critical associated roles in early stages of nervous system development. Adding to existing reviews that cover a broad spectrum of the various roles of microglia during brain development, the current review will focus on the developmental ontogeny and interdependency between the colonization of the nervous system with yolk sac derived macrophages and vascularization. Gaining a better understanding of the timing and the interdependency of these two processes will significantly contribute to the interpretation of data generated regarding alterations in either process during early development. Additionally, such knowledge should provide a framework for understanding the influence of the early gestational environmental and the impact of genetics, disease, disorders, or exposures on the early developing nervous system and the potential for long-term and life-time effects.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2024-01-27", "authors": ["G JeanHarry"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms25021281\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.04.013\n10.1038/ni.3703\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3441-12.2013\n10.1126/science.1202529\n10.1038/nn.3358\n10.1002/glia.22389\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.07.042\n10.3390/biom11071058\n10.1126/sciadv.abk1131\n10.1146/annurev.neuro.051508.135600\n10.3109/03009734.2012.665096\n10.1038/35055553\n10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00116-8\n10.1007/s00441-007-0481-8\n10.1038/nrm1739\n10.1016/S0165-3806(99)00113-3\n10.1126/science.1194637\n10.1002/glia.22421\n10.3389/fnhum.2016.00566\n10.1016/j.conb.2017.10.004\n10.1002/dneu.22576\n10.1002/wdev.363\n10.1007/s12565-021-00631-w\n10.1182/blood.V86.1.156.bloodjournal861156\n10.1002/cne.24951\n10.1182/blood-2012-01-153486\n10.1038/nn.3318\n10.1590/S0001-37652000000100013\n10.1002/glia.22503\n10.1101/cshperspect.a020537\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.11.023\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.11.018\n10.1016/j.neuron.2018.05.014\n10.1016/j.jneuroim.2014.11.018\n10.1016/0306-4522(85)90215-5\n10.1016/0165-3806(91)90231-7\n10.1002/ar.1092320410\n10.1016/j.neures.2022.09.006\n10.4049/jimmunol.136.12.4354\n10.1242/dev.126.22.5073\n10.1128/microbiolspec.MCHD-0031-2016\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.07.009\n10.1016/S0006-8993(98)00830-0\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19990615)45:6<359::AID-JEMT4>3.0.CO;2-D\n10.1002/cne.21123\n10.1097/nen.0b013e3180517b46\n10.1111/j.1469-7580.2010.01245.x\n10.1001/archneurpsyc.1939.02270130034002\n10.1016/0165-3806(90)90109-C\n10.1093/cercor/bhh194\n10.1111/j.1365-2990.1991.tb00738.x\n10.1016/S0165-3806(99)00043-7\n10.1016/0165-3806(92)90091-A\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.01014\n10.1016/j.devcel.2022.07.015\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07630.x\n10.1002/glia.23176\n10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2008.10.006\n10.1007/s00441-003-0745-x\n10.1002/dvdy.20148\n10.1242/dev.126.21.4895\n10.1016/j.mod.2015.07.001\n10.1038/386671a0\n10.1016/0165-3806(85)90044-6\n10.4161/cam.3.2.8397\n10.1038/nprot.2013.015\n10.3389/fnana.2019.00059\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.03.014\n10.3389/fnana.2012.00038\n10.1016/0887-8994(91)90100-Y\n10.1002/cne.902410210\n10.1160/TH03-09-0582\n10.1242/dev.028845\n10.1097/00005072-198605000-00003\n10.1038/jcbfm.2012.152\n10.1016/0165-3806(95)00177-8\n10.1089/lrb.2008.1014\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.07.030\n10.1371/journal.pone.0048001\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1001469\n10.1016/j.devcel.2018.01.023\n10.1208/s12248-017-0110-8\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07174.x\n10.3389/fphar.2012.00046\n10.1038/nm.3407\n10.1038/nature09513\n10.1007/s00418-004-0665-1\n10.1016/0165-3806(96)00117-4\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2010.04.025\n10.1016/0165-3806(93)90157-6\n10.1182/blood-2009-12-257832\n10.1007/s00401-015-1524-y\n10.1007/BF02064322\n10.1007/BF01814660\n10.1002/cne.901800109\n10.1023/A:1006951423251\n10.1186/2045-824X-5-4\n10.1038/269804a0\n10.1016/0163-7258(91)90077-Y\n10.5858/2001-125-0067-ROLAEC\n10.1023/A:1006485716743\n10.1167/iovs.05-1522\n10.1017/S0952523800012335\n10.1002/cne.903630106\n10.1177/096368979700600305\n10.3390/biomedicines10071653\n10.1002/jnr.490280211\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3006-19.2020\n10.1002/glia.10031\n10.1002/glia.21220\n10.1084/jem.166.4.1138\n10.1002/aja.1001600303\n10.1002/cne.903610405\n10.1016/0306-4522(91)90267-R\n10.1002/cne.903300110\n10.1002/(SICI)1098-1136(199801)22:1<98::AID-GLIA10>3.0.CO;2-V\n10.1006/dbio.2001.0393\n10.1002/glia.21140\n10.1007/s10456-007-9065-1\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2017.11.001\n10.3389/fncel.2021.659843\n10.1038/s41583-023-00684-y\n10.1016/S0161-813X(01)00033-X\n10.1016/0026-2862(88)90028-3\n10.1038/s41467-020-14787-y\n10.1002/glia.440150409\n10.1002/glia.440140402\n10.1038/srep20636\n10.1084/jem.20081605\n10.1371/journal.pone.0015846\n10.1167/iovs.09-4978\n10.1182/blood-2010-12-327015\n10.1038/nature10085\n10.1126/science.1164594\n10.1007/s10456-019-09671-3"}

{"title": "Three dimensional (bio)printing of blood vessels: from vascularized tissues to functional arteries.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering has emerged as a strategy for producing functional tissues and organs to treat diseases and injuries. Many chronic conditions directly or indirectly affect normal blood vessel functioning, necessary for material exchange and transport through the body and within tissue-engineered constructs. The interest in vascular tissue engineering is due to two reasons: (1) functional grafts can be used to replace diseased blood vessels, and (2) engineering effective vasculature within other engineered tissues enables connection with the host's circulatory system, supporting their survival. Among various practices, (bio)printing has emerged as a powerful tool to engineer biomimetic constructs. This has been made possible with precise control of cell deposition and matrix environment along with the advancements in biomaterials. (Bio)printing has been used for both engineering stand-alone vascular grafts as well as vasculature within engineered tissues for regenerative applications. In this review article, we discuss various conditions associated with blood vessels, the need for artificial blood vessels, the anatomy and physiology of different blood vessels, available 3D (bio)printing techniques to fabricate tissue-engineered vascular grafts and vasculature in scaffolds, and the comparison among the different techniques.

{"title": "Micro- and Nanostructured Fibrous Composites via Electro-Fluid Dynamics: Design and Applications for Brain.", "abstract": "The brain consists of an interconnected network of neurons tightly packed in the extracellular matrix (ECM) to form complex and heterogeneous composite tissue. According to recent biomimicry approaches that consider biological features as active components of biomaterials, designing a highly reproducible microenvironment for brain cells can represent a key tool for tissue repair and regeneration. Indeed, this is crucial to support cell growth, mitigate inflammation phenomena and provide adequate structural properties needed to support the damaged tissue, corroborating the activity of the vascular network and ultimately the functionality of neurons. In this context, electro-fluid dynamic techniques (EFDTs), i.e., electrospinning, electrospraying and related techniques, offer the opportunity to engineer a wide variety of composite substrates by integrating fibers, particles, and hydrogels at different scales-from several hundred microns down to tens of nanometers-for the generation of countless patterns of physical and biochemical cues suitable for influencing the in vitro response of coexistent brain cell populations mediated by the surrounding microenvironment. In this review, an overview of the different technological approaches-based on EFDTs-for engineering fibrous and/or particle-loaded composite substrates will be proposed. The second section of this review will primarily focus on describing current and future approaches to the use of composites for brain applications, ranging from therapeutic to diagnostic/theranostic use and from repair to regeneration, with the ultimate goal of providing insightful information to guide future research efforts toward the development of more efficient and reliable solutions.",

{"title": "External Mechanical Stability Regulates Hematoma Vascularization in Bone Healing Rather than Endothelial YAP/TAZ Mechanotransduction.", "abstract": "Bone fracture healing is regulated by mechanobiological cues. Both, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and microvascular assembly determine the dynamics of the regenerative processes. Mechanical instability as by inter-fragmentary shear or compression is known to influence early ECM formation and wound healing. However, it remains unclear how these external cues shape subsequent ECM and microvascular network assembly. As transcriptional coactivators, the mechanotransducers yes-associated protein 1 (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) translate physical cues into downstream signaling events, yet their role in sprouting angiogenesis into the hematoma after injury is unknown. Using bone healing as model system for scar-free regeneration, the role of endothelial YAP/TAZ in combination with tuning the extrinsic mechanical stability via fracture fixation is investigated. Extrinsically imposed shear across the gap delayed hematoma remodeling and shaped the morphology of early collagen fiber orientations and microvascular networks, suggesting that enhanced shear increased the nutrient exchange in the hematoma. In contrast, endothelial YAP/TAZ deletion has\u00a0little impact on the overall vascularization of the fracture gap, yet slightly increases\u00a0the collagen fiber deposition under semi-rigid fixation. Together, these data provide novel insights into the respective roles of endothelial YAP/TAZ and extrinsic mechanical cues in orchestrating the process of bone regeneration.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2024-01-26", "authors": ["JuliaMehl", "Saeed KhomeijaniFarahani", "ErikBrauer", "AlexandraKlaus-Bergmann", "TobiasThiele", "AgnesEllinghaus", "EireenBartels-Klein", "KatharinaKoch", "KatharinaSchmidt-Bleek", "AnsgarPetersen", "HolgerGerhardt", "ViolaVogel", "Georg NDuda"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202307050"}
{"title": "Intravoxel incoherent motion magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of brain microstructure and perfusion in idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus.", "abstract": "To determine the relationship between intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI parameters and clinical changes post-tap test (TT) in idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients.\nForty-four probable iNPH patients underwent 3\u00a0T MRI before and after TT. IVIM parameters were calculated from eight different bilateral regions of interest in basal ganglia, centrum semiovale, and corona radiata. Patients were categorized based on TT response into positive (group 1) and negative (group 2) groups. A Welch two-sample t-test was used to compare differences in D, D*, f, and ADC between the two groups, while a paired t-test was employed to assess the changes within each group before and after TT. These parameters were then correlated with clinical results.\nIn the lenticular and thalamic nuclei, D value was significantly lower in the group 1 compared to group 2 both pre- and post-TT (p\u2009=\u20090.002 and p\u2009=\u20090.007 respectively). Post-TT, the positive response group exhibited a notably reduced D* value (p\u2009=\u20090.012) and significantly higher f values (p\u2009=\u20090.028).

Pre-operative (lymph)-angioregression is a promising therapeutic approach, but objective monitoring by non-invasive CV imaging is needed. The purpose of this study was to investigate anterior-segment optical coherence tomography angiography (AS-OCTA) for CV visualization and quantification, and to show its superiority over slit-lamp photography in high-risk eyes scheduled for keratoplasty. This institutional pilot study included 29 eyes of 26 patients (51\u2009\u00b1\u200916\u00a0years, 8 female) with significant CV scheduled for keratoplasty that were imaged by slit-lamp photography (Zeiss SL 800) and AS-OCTA (Zeiss Plex Elite 9000). After manual corneal layer segmentation correction, CV maximum/relative depth was measured with the inbuilt software. Slit-lamp photographs and AS-OCTA images were compared for visualization of vascular details. Angiotool software allowed a semi-automated determination of CV-related parameters in the vascular complex of AS-OCTA images. The predominant causes of CV were the herpes simplex virus keratitis (n\u2009=\u20097) and chemical burn (n\u2009=\u20094). Visualization of vascular morphology in AS-OCTA was superior to slit-lamp photography in all except one eye. Vascular metrics including total vessel length, number of junctions/endpoints, junction density, lacunarity, and vessel area/density were defined using Angiotool, with CV depth localization despite scarring and opacification.

However, ACKRs efficiently modify the availability and function of chemokines in defined microanatomical environments, can signal via intracellular effectors other than G-proteins, and play complex roles in physiology and disease, including in cancer. In this review, we summarize the findings on the diverse contributions of individual ACKRs to cancer development, progression, and tumor-host interactions. We discuss how changes in ACKR expression within tumor affect cancer growth, tumor vascularization, leukocyte infiltration, and metastasis formation, ultimately resulting in differential disease outcomes. Across many studies, ACKR3 expression was shown to support tumor growth and dissemination, whereas ACKR1, ACKR2, and ACKR4 in tumors were more likely to contribute to tumor suppression. With few notable exceptions, the insights on molecular and cellular mechanisms of ACKRs activities in cancer remain sparse, and the intricacies of their involvement are not fully appreciated.

{"title": "Core-Shell Nanoparticles for Pulmonary Drug Delivery.", "abstract": "Nanoscale drug delivery systems have provoked interest for application in various therapies on account of their ability to elevate the intracellular concentration of drugs inside target cells, which leads to an increase in efficacy, a decrease in dose, and dose-associated adverse effects. There are several types of nanoparticles available; however, core-shell nanoparticles outperform bare nanoparticles in terms of their reduced cytotoxicity, high dispersibility and biocompatibility, and improved conjugation with drugs and biomolecules because of better surface characteristics. These nanoparticulate drug delivery systems are used for targeting a number of organs, such as the colon, brain, lung, etc. Pulmonary administration of medicines is a more appealing method as it is a noninvasive route for systemic and locally acting drugs as the pulmonary region has a wide surface area, delicate blood-alveolar barrier, and significant vascularization. A core-shell nano-particulate drug delivery system is more effective in the treatment of various pulmonary disorders. Thus, this review has discussed the potential of several types of core-shell nanoparticles in treating various diseases and synthesis methods of core-shell nanoparticles. The methods for synthesis of core-shell nanoparticles include solid phase reaction, liquid phase reaction, gas phase reaction, mechanical mixing, microwave- assisted synthesis, sono-synthesis, and non-thermal plasma technology. The basic types of core-shell nanoparticles are metallic, magnetic, polymeric, silica, upconversion, and carbon nanomaterial- based core-shell nanoparticles. With this special platform, it is possible to integrate the benefits of both core and shell materials, such as strong serum stability, effective drug loading, adjustable particle size, and immunocompatibility.", "journal": "Pharmaceutical nanotechnology", "date": "2024-01-24", "authors": ["Mukesh PRatnaparkhi", "Shailendra SSalvankar", "Avinash RTekade", "Gajanan MKulkarni"], "doi": "10.2174/0122117385277725231120043600"}

{"title": "Fibronectin mediates activin A-promoted human trophoblast migration and acquisition of endothelial-like phenotype.", "abstract": "During human early placentation, a proportion of extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) migrate to the maternal decidua, differentiating into endovascular EVTs to remodel spiral arteries and ensure the establishment of blood circulation at the maternal-fetal interface. Inadequate EVT migration and endovascular differentiation are closely associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage. Activin A and fibronectin are both secretory molecules abundantly expressed at the maternal-fetal interface. Activin A has been reported to regulate EVT biological functions. However, whether fibronectin mediates activin A-promoted EVT migration and acquisition of endothelial-like phenotype as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Additionally, the role of fibronectin in pregnancy establishment and maintenance warrants further investigation.\nPrimary and immortalized (HTR8/SVneo) human EVTs were used as in vitro study models. Cultured human first-trimester chorionic villous explants were utilized for ex vivo validation. A local fibronectin knockdown model in ICR mouse uteri, achieved by nonviral in vivo transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting fibronectin 1 (si-Fn1), was employed to explore the roles of fibronectin in the establishment and maintenance of early pregnancy.\nOur results showed that activin A treatment significantly induced fibronectin 1 (FN1) mRNA expression and fibronectin protein production, which is essential for human trophoblast migration and endothelial-like tube formation. Both basal and activin A-upregulated fibronectin expression were abolished by the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor inhibitor SB431542 or siRNA-mediated knockdown of activin receptor-like kinase (ALK4) or SMAD4. Moreover, activin A-increased trophoblast migration and endothelial-like tube formation were attenuated following the depletion of fibronectin. Fibronectin knockdown via intrauterine siRNA administration reduced CD31 and cytokeratin 8 (CK8) expression at the maternal-fetal interface, resulting in a decrease in the number of implantation sites and embryos.\nOur study demonstrates that activin A promotes trophoblast cell migration and acquisition of endothelial-like phenotype via ALK4-SMAD2/3-SMAD4-mediated fibronectin upregulation. Furthermore, through a local fibronectin knockdown model in mouse uteri, we found that the absence of fibronectin at the maternal-fetal interface impedes endovascular migration of trophoblasts and decidual vascularization, thereby interfering with early embryo implantation and the maintenance of pregnancy. These findings provide novel insights into placental development during early pregnancy establishment and contribute to the advancement of therapeutic approaches for managing pregnancy complications related to trophoblast dysfunction.", "journal": "Cell communication and signaling : CCS", "date": "2024-01-24", "authors": ["XiangxinLan", "LingGuo", "CuipingHu", "QianZhang", "JianyeDeng", "YufengWang", "Zi-JiangChen", "JunhaoYan", "YanLi"], "doi": "10.1186/s12964-023-01463-z\n10.1080/19336918.2015.1089376\n10.1016/j.placenta.2020.01.004\n10.1530/REP-16-0287\n10.1016/j.siny.2004.03.006\n10.1093/humupd/dmi023\n10.1055/s-0028-1108011\n10.1111/aji.12436\n10.1007/978-1-4939-2966-5_4\n10.1038/321776a0\n10.1038/321779a0\n10.1155/2013/969473\n10.1097/AOG.0b013e31820b3c61\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2004.11.072\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.125\n10.1038/35006129\n10.1038/35043051\n10.1677/joe.1.05978\n10.1073/pnas.0911929107\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.01.014\n10.1210/jc.2014-2118\n10.1210/jc.2015-2134\n10.1210/en.2015-1228\n10.1016/j.matbio.2005.06.008\n10.1016/S0021-9258(18)31786-1\n10.7150/ijbs.72367\n10.1007/978-3-030-40146-7_4\n10.1016/j.placenta.2021.03.003\n10.1074/mcp.M113.035600\n10.1126/science.1260419\n10.1096/fj.202001604R\n10.3109/00016348709092948\n10.1067/mob.2002.123281\n10.1093/humrep/13.12.3530\n10.1111/j.1471-0528.2000.tb10402.x\n10.1016/0143-4004(95)90100-0\n10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8\n10.1186/1471-2105-15-293\n10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100141\n10.1210/jc.2011-2729\n10.1016/S1472-6483(10)61653-7\n10.1159/000443636\n10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100109-104020\n10.1073/pnas.0409844102\n10.1007/s10456-011-9247-8\n10.1146/annurev.bi.57.070188.002111\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.12.010\n10.1073/pnas.2120667119\n10.1016/j.tem.2020.12.005\n10.1038/nbt761\n10.1096/fj.201902168RR\n10.3389/fcell.2020.573781\n10.1038/s41419-017-0230-1\n10.1016/j.placenta.2022.10.004\n10.1016/j.ajog.2019.05.044\n10.1016/j.placenta.2005.12.006\n10.3389/fnmol.2022.859349\n10.1111/j.1600-0897.2007.00493.x\n10.7150/thno.50613\n10.1111/iwj.12109\n10.1128/JCM.01954-14\n10.1016/S0168-8278(00)80070-7\n10.1093/humupd/dmx032\n10.1210/jc.2013-2623\n10.1096/fj.201801193R\n10.1242/dev.119.4.1079\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2020.100915\n10.1016/S2213-2600(22)00087-X\n10.1016/j.placenta.2006.04.006\n10.1016/j.placenta.2010.03.002"}
{"title": "Classifications of anterior segment structure of congenital corneal opacity in infants and toddlers by ultrasound biomicroscopy and slit-lamp microscopic photographs: an observational study.", "abstract": "The structural features have an impact on the surgical prognosis for congenital corneal opacity (CCO). The structural classification system of CCO, however, is lacking. Based on data from ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) findings in infants and toddlers with CCO, this research proposed a classification system for the anterior segment structure severity.\nMedical records, preoperative UBM images and slit-lamp photographs of infants and toddlers diagnosed with CCO at University Third Hospital between December 2018 and June 2022 were reviewed. According to the anterior segment structural features observed in UBM images, eyes were classified as follows: U1, opaque cornea only; U2, central anterior synechia; U3, peripheral anterior synechia combined with angle closure; and U4, aniridia or lens anomaly. The opacity appearance and corneal vascularization density observed in slit-lamp photographs were assigned grades according to previous studies. The extent of vascularization was also recorded. The corresponding intraocular anomaly classifications and ocular surface lesion severity were analysed.\nAmong 81 eyes (65 patients), 41 (50.6%) were right eyes, and 40 (49.4%) were left eyes. The median age at examination was 6.91 months (n\u2009=\u200981, 1.00, 34.00). Two (2.5%) of the 81 eyes were classified as U1, 20 (24.7%) as U2, 22 (27.2%) as U3a, 11 (13.6%) as U3b and 26 (32.1%) as U4. Bilateral CCO eyes had more severe UBM classifications (P\u2009=\u20090.019), more severe dysgenesis (P\u2009=\u20090.012) and a larger angle closure (P\u2009=\u20090.009). Eyes with more severe UBM classifications had higher opacity grades (P\u2009=\u20090.003) and vascularization grades (P\u2009=\u20090.014) and a larger vascularization extent (P\u2009=\u20090.001). Eyes with dysgenesis had higher haze grades (P\u2009=\u20090.012) and more severe vascularization (P\u2009=\u20090.003 for density; P\u2009=\u20090.008 for extent), while the angle closure range was related to haze grade (P\u2009=\u20090.013) and vascularization extent (P\u2009=\u20090.003).\nThis classification method based on UBM and slit-lamp photography findings in the eyes of CCO infants and toddlers can truly reflect the degree of abnormality of the ocular surface and anterior segment and is correlated with the severity of ocular surface anomalies. This method might provide meaningful guidance for surgical procedure design and prognostic determinations for keratoplasty in CCO eyes.", "journal": "BMC ophthalmology", "date": "2024-01-24", "authors": ["JingHong", "ZijunXie", "XinWang", "TingYu", "SiyiMa", "HanzhiBen", "Shao-FengGu"], "doi": "10.1186/s12886-024-03286-z\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19980217)75:5<497::AID-AJMG8>3.0.CO;2-K\n10.1097/ICO.0000000000000182\n10.1016/j.survophthal.2008.12.011\n10.1097/ICU.0b013e328356893d\n10.1016/j.survophthal.2022.07.010\n10.1097/ICO.0b013e31829dd836\n10.1016/j.ajo.2019.12.013\n10.1097/ICO.0000000000001695\n10.1097/ICO.0000000000000552\n10.1111/aos.13040\n10.1097/ICO.0000000000002331\n10.1016/S0161-6420(99)90175-6\n10.1186/s12886-022-02473-0\n10.1097/ICU.0000000000000237\n10.1093/hmg/11.10.1185\n10.1007/s00439-018-1935-7\n10.1038/s41433-020-01184-4\n10.1136/bjo.86.1.62\n10.1016/j.jtos.2020.11.008\n10.1016/j.survophthal.2017.09.003\n10.1016/j.ajo.2020.07.048\n10.1016/j.ajo.2018.08.022\n10.1136/bjophthalmol-2015-306686\n10.3389/fcell.2020.595896\n10.1016/j.jtos.2021.09.001\n10.1159/000429697\n10.1038/sj.eye.6700559\n10.1016/j.jtos.2020.04.014\n10.1167/iovs.15-18103\n10.1167/iovs.16-21217\n10.1097/00003226-200001000-00004"}

In the present study we obtained partially reprogrammed, SSEA1-negative cells by transducing murine hepatocytes with \u03941\u03943-deleted adenoviruses that expressed the four OSKM factors. We observed that, under long-term 2D and 3D culture conditions, hepatocytes could be converted into LGR5-positive cells with self-renewal capacity that was dependent on three cross-signaling pathways: IL6/Jak/Stat3, LGR5/R-spondin, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin. Following engraftment in syngeneic mice, LGR5-positive cells that expressed the cancer markers CD51, CD166, and CD73 were capable of forming invasive and metastatic tumors reminiscent of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC): they were positive for CK19 and CK7, featured associations of cord-like structures, and contained cuboidal and atypical cells with dissimilar degrees of pleomorphism and mitosis. The LGR5+-derived tumors exhibited a highly vascularized stroma with substantial fibrosis. In addition, we identified pro-angiogenic factors and signaling pathways involved in neo-angiogenesis and vascular development, which represent potential new targets for anti-angiogenic strategies to overcome tumor resistance to current ICC treatments.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2024-01-24", "authors": ["DianaChaker", "ChristopheDesterke", "NicolasMoniaux", "Mohamed-AmineBani", "NoufissaOudrhiri", "JamilaFaivre", "Ali GTurhan", "AnneliseBennaceur-Griscelli", "FrankGriscelli"], "doi": "10.1093/stmcls/sxae006"}

The results were significantly improved by several modifications. To decrease the incidence of complications, interposing a vascularized flap after tubularization of the neourethra is recommended. The extent to which the type of interposed tissue has a direct effect on the rate of complications and cosmetic outcomes after TIPU repair is considered the answer to the main hypothesis of this study.\n\u2003This prospective controlled randomized trial was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Surgery, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt, between May 2019 and May 2023.

{"title": "Photoactive Poly-L-Lysine gel with resveratrol-magnesium metal polyphenol network: A promising strategy for preventing tracheal anastomotic complications following surgery.", "abstract": "Postoperative complications at the anastomosis site following tracheal resection are a prevalent and substantial concern. However, most existing solutions primarily focus on managing symptoms, with limited attention given to proactively preventing the underlying pathological processes. To address this challenge, we conducted a drug screening focusing on clinically-relevant polyphenolic compounds, given the growing interest in polyphenolic compounds for their potential role in tissue repair during wound healing. This screening led to the identification of resveratrol as the most promising candidate for mitigating tracheal complications, as it exhibited the most significant efficacy in enhancing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) while concurrently suppressing the pivotal fibrosis factor: transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), showcasing its robust potential in addressing these issues. Building upon this discovery, we further developed an innovative photosensitive poly-L-lysine gel integrated with a resveratrol-magnesium metal polyphenol network (MPN), named Res-Mg/PL-MA. This design allows for the enables sustained release of resveratrol and synergistically enhances the expression of VEGF and also promotes resistance to tensile forces, aided by magnesium ions, in an anastomotic tracheal fistula animal models. Moreover, the combination of resveratrol and poly-L-lysine hydrogel effectively inhibits bacteria, reduces local expression of key inflammatory factors, and induces polarization of macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, as well as inhibits TGF-\u03b21, consequently decreasing collagen production levels in an animal model of post-tracheal resection.

{"title": "Complications and Outcome of Bone Sarcoma Patients with Limb Salvage using Liquid Nitrogen-treated Bone for Reconstruction.", "abstract": "The recommended treatment method for bone sarcoma is wide local excision and reconstruction to preserve limb function. Established methods of reconstruction are mega prosthesis or biological reconstruction. This study aimed to determine the complications and functional outcomes associated with limb salvage surgery using liquid nitrogen-treated bone.\nWe retrospectively observed the short-term outcome of limb salvage surgeries where liquid nitrogen bone was used for reconstruction. A total of 15 patients underwent reconstruction with liquid nitrogen auto graft from January 2018 to December 2020. We used the free freezing method of liquid nitrogen treatment after wide local excision of sarcoma. We observed short-term outcomes after liquid nitrogen-treated bone reconstruction in limb salvage surgery. Survival of the auto grafts was recorded using the Kaplan-Meier method with a 95% confidence interval.\nThe mean follow-up was 19.83 \u00b1 4.5 months. The mean musculoskeletal tumor society score was 62.4 \u00b1 7.9%, while the average Toronto extremity score was 59.6 \u00b1 5.7%.

{"title": "What Is the Revision-free Survival of Resurfaced Allograft-prosthesis Composites for Proximal Humerus Reconstruction in Children With Bone Tumors?", "abstract": "Reconstruction of the proximal humerus in children who undergo bone tumor resection is challenging because of patients' small bone size and possible limb length discrepancy at the end of skeletal growth due to loss of the physis. There are several options for proximal humerus reconstruction in children, such as clavicula pro humero, free vascularized fibula grafting, massive bone osteoarticular allografting, endoprostheses, and allograft-prosthesis composites, but no consensus exists on the best method for reconstruction. Resurfaced allograft-prosthesis composites could be an alternative surgical option, but little is known about the results of this surgical technique.\n(1) What are the complications and what is the survivorship free from reconstruction failure associated with resurfaced allograft-prosthesis composites in a small, single-center case series? (2) What Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scores do patients achieve after reconstructions with resurfaced allograft-prosthesis composites?\nThis study was a retrospective, single-arm case analysis in a single institution. We generally considered resurfaced allograft-prosthesis composites in children with malignant bone tumors involving the metaepiphysis of the proximal humerus in whom there was no evidence of joint contamination and in whom axillary nerve preservation was possible. Between 2003 and 2021, we treated 100 children (younger than 15 years) with bone tumors of the humerus. Thirty children (30%) with diaphyseal tumors (21 children) or distal tumors (9 children) were excluded. Among the potentially eligible children, 52 were not analyzed because they were treated with other procedures such as amputation, modular prostheses, cement spacers, free vascularized fibula grafting, and massive bone osteoarticular allografts. We included 18 children (26% of the potentially eligible children) who were treated with resurfaced allograft-prosthesis composites. There were 9 boys and 9 girls, with a median age of 10 years (range 4 to 15 years) at the time of diagnosis. A long stem (\u2265 6 cm) in the resurfaced allograft-prosthesis composite was used in 9 children and a short stem (< 6 cm) was used in the remaining 9. One of the 18 children had a follow-up of less than 2 years. The median follow-up of the remaining 17 children was 4.7 years (range 2 to 19 years). The children' medical records were reviewed for clinical and functional outcomes. We performed a competing risk analysis to calculate the reconstruction failure-free survival of resurfaced allograft-prosthesis composites. Reconstruction failure was defined as removal of the implant or allograft because of implant loosening or breakage and allograft fracture or resorption. We analyzed the children's postoperative complications and functional outcomes at the end of the follow-up period using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society functional scoring system.\nThe competing risk analysis revealed that reconstruction failure was 25% (95% confidence interval 7% to 40%) at 3 years, reaching a plateau. Four of 18 children underwent surgical revision with a new reconstruction. The reasons for reconstruction revision were resorption of the allograft at the proximal part (2 children) and fracture of the allograft (2 children). Reconstruction revision was performed in 3 of 9 children who underwent reconstruction with a short stem and in 1 of 9 children who underwent reconstruction with a long stem. Several children had other complications that did not result in removal of the allograft. Allograft resorption was observed in 4 of 18 children, but no additional surgical treatment was performed. Shoulder instability or subluxation was observed in 4 of 18 children, but only 1 child underwent surgery with a reverse shoulder arthroplasty without removal of the resurfaced allograft-prosthesis composite. Limited elbow motion because of plate impingement was observed in 1 child who underwent surgical cutting of the protruding distal part of the plate. Incomplete radial nerve palsy after surgery occurred in 1 child, with spontaneous resolution after 2 months. Screw loosening occurred in 2 children who underwent surgery with removal of loose screws. Two children had a nonunion at the graft-host bone junction; 1 child underwent surgery with bone grafting and refixation of the graft-host bone junction, and the other child with both nonunion and plate breakage was treated with bone grafting and refixation of the graft-host bone junction with a new plate. Among 17 children who had a follow-up longer than 2 years, the median Musculoskeletal Tumor Society functional score at the last follow-up interval was 23 of 30 (range 20 to 26); 1 child was considered to have an excellent result (functional score \u2265 26), 15 children were considered to have a good result (functional score 21 to 25), and 1 child was considered to have a fair result (functional score \u2264 20). The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society functional score did not change after excluding 4 children who underwent replacement of resurfaced allograft-prosthesis composites (24 of 30 [range 20 to 26]). The median angle of flexion of the shoulder was 40\u00b0 (range 20\u00ba to 90\u00b0), and the median angle of abduction was 30\u00b0 (range 20\u00ba to 90\u00b0).\nResurfaced allograft-prosthesis composites showed a high risk of complications, but not all complications resulted in removal of the reconstructed allograft. We used this technique mainly for very young children with small bones and for older children who underwent axillary nerve preservation. Although its success may be limited owing to a high risk of complications, a resurfaced allograft-prosthesis composite could be an alternative surgical option in order to preserve the bone stock and achieve good functional outcomes in very young children. We recommend using a long-stem resurfaced allograft-prosthesis composite, which may reduce the risk of complications.\nLevel IV, therapeutic study.", "journal": "Clinical orthopaedics and related research", "date": "2024-01-23", "authors": ["CostantinoErrani", "HisakiAiba", "AhmedAtherley", "MarcoPalmas", "HiroakiKimura", "Davide MariaDonati", "MarcoManfrini"], "doi": "10.1097/CORR.0000000000002969"}
{"title": "Recent Insights into the Angioregulatory Role of Long Non-coding RNAs and Circular RNAs in Gliomas: From Signaling Pathways to Clinical Aspects.", "abstract": "The most prevalent and severe malignancy of the central nervous system within the brain is glioma. Glioma is a vascularized cancer, and angiogenesis is necessary for glioma growth, invasion, and recurrence. It is also believed that this factor is this factor to be accountable for therapy resistance in many cancers, including glioma. The process of angiogenesis, which plays a crucial role in both health and disease situations such as cancer, involves the creation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are unique molecules that have been found to possess a wide range of abilities to modify the expression of various genes. They carry out their gene-modulating roles at a variety of distinct levels, including post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. Long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a group of ncRNA that have attracted particular attention and are involved in the angiogenesis mechanism in cancer. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of these RNAs in the angiogenesis process in gliomas provides unique fundamental information about the process of tumor-associated neovascularization. On the other hand, due to developments in the characterisation of lncRNAs and circRNAs, these novel structures may potentially be used in clinics as possible biomarkers for treatment strategies that target tumor angiogenesis. Throughout the review, new knowledge and views about the angioregulatory function of circRNAs and lncRNAs in gliomas have been presented. Additionally, we talk about the novel idea of ncRNA-based therapeutics for gliomas in the future.", "journal": "Current medicinal chemistry", "date": "2024-01-23", "authors": ["NedaHedayati", "ZahraBabaei Aghdam", "MaliheRezaee", "RohollahMousavi Dehmordi", "MinaAlimohammadi", "AlirezaMafi"], "doi": "10.2174/0109298673259378231031061149"}
{"title": "Influence of Platelet-Rich Plasma on Recurrent Vesicovaginal Fistula-A Histological and Immunohistochemical Study.", "abstract": "Vesicovaginal fistula is a cause of deterioration in the quality of life. It is a communication between the bladder and vagina resulting in the uncontrollable leakage of urine through the vagina. Recently, regenerative methods have been used more frequently, and platelet-rich plasma is one of these methods. The functional properties of platelet-rich plasma are based on the synthesis and secretion of multiple growth factors released after platelet activation. The aim of this study was to investigate how platelet-rich plasma influences the condition of the tissue and the healing ability of the urothelium, vaginal epithelium and tissues surrounding the fistulous canal. The study included eight patients who had undergone the Latzko procedure aimed at closing the vesicovaginal fistula. Samples were collected during primary surgery without platelet-rich plasma and after failed surgery, during a second attempt. The specimens were subjected to histological and immunohistochemical evaluation. The histology demonstrated that in platelet-rich plasma patients, greater vascularization and wider subepithelial mucosa layering was observed. Inflammatory infiltration in the subepithelial layer was increased in platelet-rich plasma patients. No localization differences in growth factor proteins were found in either group, but in platelet-rich plasma-patients, the reactions were stronger. It can be concluded that the use of platelet-rich plasma improves the morphological structure of the injected tissues.", "journal": "Journal of clinical medicine", "date": "2024-01-23", "authors": ["Dominika EwelinaStreit-Cie\u0107kiewicz", "JustynaSzumi\u0142o", "Magdalena EmiliaGrzybowska", "KonradFutyma"], "doi": "10.3390/jcm13020370\n10.1016/j.ijgo.2007.06.032\n10.1186/scrt218\n10.3390/ijerph19095284\n10.1111/j.1524-475X.2008.00410.x\n10.1038/nature07039\n10.1186/ar3914\n10.1111/j.1742-481X.2009.00622.x\n10.1309/3UA5HWYVKNCE01AR\n10.1038/nri.2017.90\n10.1084/jem.20181152\n10.1172/JCI17974\n10.1016/j.jaci.2005.06.031\n10.4049/jimmunol.177.7.4861\n10.1007/s10753-007-9032-4\n10.1038/s41467-021-21533-5\n10.3390/ijms18051033\n10.18565/urology.2021.1.21-26\n10.1093/burnst/tkaa028\n10.1111/iwj.13640"}

The efficacy of calcium electroporation (CaEP) with 5 or 10 mM calcium chloride (Ca) and electrochemotherapy (ECT) with 1 or 2.5 \u00b5g/mL bleomycin in comparison to monotherapy with the tested drug or electroporation (EP) alone was investigated on the generated UM tumors. CaEP and ECT showed a similar reduction of proliferation and melanocytic expansion with a dose-dependent effect for bleomycin, whereas CaEP induced a significant increase of the apoptosis and a reduction of vascularization with varying sensitivity for the two xenograft types.

{"title": "The Inhibition of Vessel Co-Option as an Emerging Strategy for Cancer Therapy.", "abstract": "Vessel co-option (VCO) is a non-angiogenic mechanism of vascularization that has been associated to anti-angiogenic therapy. In VCO, cancer cells hijack the pre-existing blood vessels and use them to obtain oxygen and nutrients and invade adjacent tissue. Multiple primary tumors and metastases undergo VCO in highly vascularized tissues such as the lungs, liver or brain. VCO has been associated with a worse prognosis. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that undergo VCO are poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that co-opted vessels show a quiescent phenotype in contrast to angiogenic tumor blood vessels. On the other hand, it is believed that during VCO, cancer cells are adhered to basement membrane from pre-existing blood vessels by using integrins, show enhanced motility and a mesenchymal phenotype.

{"title": "Designing Composite Stimuli-Responsive Hydrogels for Wound Healing Applications: The State-of-the-Art and Recent Discoveries.", "abstract": "Effective wound treatment has become one of the most important challenges for healthcare as it continues to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Therefore, wound care technologies significantly evolved in order to provide a holistic approach based on various designs of functional wound dressings. Among them, hydrogels have been widely used for wound treatment due to their biocompatibility and similarity to the extracellular matrix. The hydrogel formula offers the control of an optimal wound moisture level due to its ability to absorb excess fluid from the wound or release moisture as needed. Additionally, hydrogels can be successfully integrated with a plethora of biologically active components (e.g., nanoparticles, pharmaceuticals, natural extracts, peptides), thus enhancing the performance of resulting composite hydrogels in wound healing applications. In this review, the-state-of-the-art discoveries related to stimuli-responsive hydrogel-based dressings have been summarized, taking into account their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,

{"title": "Nose-to-Heart Approach: Unveiling an Alternative Route of Acute Treatment.", "abstract": "Intranasal (IN) administration has emerged as a novel approach for rapid systemic absorption, with potential applicability in the management of acute cardiovascular events. This review explores the evolution of IN cardiovascular pharmacotherapy, emphasizing its potential in achieving systemic effects and bypassing the first-pass metabolism associated with oral administration. The extensive vascularization of nasal mucosa and a porous endothelial basement membrane facilitate efficient drug absorption into the bloodstream. The IN route ensures a critical swift onset of action, which allows self-administration in at-home settings. For instance, etripamil nasal spray, a first-in-class formulation, exemplifies the therapeutic potential of this approach in the treatment of spontaneous supraventricular tachycardia. The review critically assesses studies on IN formulations for angina, acute myocardial infarction, hypertensive episodes, and cardiac arrhythmias. Preclinical evaluations of beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and antianginal drugs demonstrate the feasibility of IN administration for acute cardiovascular events. A small number of clinical trials have revealed promising results, emphasizing the superiority of IN drug delivery over oral administration in terms of bioavailability and onset of action.

{"title": "Developing online communication training to request donation for vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA): improving performance to match new US organ donation targets.", "abstract": "Approaching families of dying or newly deceased patients to donate organs requires specialized knowledge and a mastery of relational communication. As the transplantation field has progressed, Donation Professionals (DPs) are also leading conversations with family decision makers (FDMs) about the donation of uncommon anatomical gifts, such as face, hands, genitalia, referred to as Vascularized Composite Allotransplants (VCA) without much training or experience. To address the need for training, we adapted and beta tested an evidenced-based communication training program for donation discussions to VCA requests. The overarching goal of Communicating Effectively about Donation for Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation (CEaD-VCA) is to increase the number of VCA authorizations and to improve the socioemotional outcomes of FDMs.\nWe developed CEaD-VCA, an online, on-demand training program based on the previously tested, evidenced-based communication skills training program designed to train DPs to have conversations about solid organ donation. The training was modified utilizing data from a national telephone survey with DPs and results of 6 focus groups conducted with members of the general public. The survey and focus groups assessed knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to VCA donation. The training was shaped by a partnership with a leading industry partner, the Gift of Life Institute.\u2122 RESULTS: Using the results as a guide, the existing CEaD training program, consisting of interactive eLearning modules, was adapted to include technical information about VCA, foundational communication skills, and two interactive example VCA donation request scenarios to facilitate active learning. Forty-two DPs from two partner Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) participated in the beta test of CEaD-VCA. Pre- and post-test surveys assessed the impact of the training.\nThe training was scored highly by DPs in effectiveness and ease of use. This project created a standardized, accessible, and comprehensive training for DPs to communicate about VCA donation. CEaD-VCA is an example of how to develop a communication skills training for difficult conversations utilizing input from stakeholders, guided by communication theory. It also demonstrates how gaps in communication skills during medical education can be filled utilizing advanced online Learning Management Systems. The training specifically addresses new CMS rules concerning OPO performance metrics.", "journal": "BMC medical education", "date": "2024-01-23", "authors": ["Laura ASiminoff", "Gerard PAlolod", "HayleyMcGregor", "Richard DHasz", "Patricia AMulvania", "Laura KBarker", "Heather MGardiner"], "doi": "10.1186/s12909-024-05026-9"}

There are a variety of research approaches dealing with cartilage tissue engineering. In addition to different biomaterials, numerous cell populations have been investigated in bioreactor-supported experimental setups to improve cartilage tissue engineering. The concept of the present study was to investigate spider silk cocoons as scaffold seeded with adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC) in a custom-made bioreactor model using cyclic axial compression to engineer cartilage-like tissue. For chemical induction of differentiation, BMP-7 and TGF-\u03b22 were added and changes in cell morphology and de-novo tissue formation were investigated using histological staining to verify chondrogenic differentiation. By seeding spider silk cocoons with ASC, a high colonization density and cell proliferation could be achieved. Mechanical induction of differentiation using a newly established bioreactor model led to a more roundish cell phenotype and new extracellular matrix formation, indicating a chondrogenic differentiation. The addition of BMP-7 and TGF-\u03b22 enhanced the expression of cartilage specific markers in immunohistochemical staining.

{"title": "Advances in Aerogels Formulations for Pulmonary Targeted Delivery of Therapeutic Agents: Safety, Efficacy and Regulatory Aspects.", "abstract": "Aerogels are the 3D network of organic, inorganic, composite, layered, or hybrid-type materials that are used to increase the solubility of Class 1 (low solubility and high permeability) and Class 4 (poor solubility and low permeability) molecules. This approach improves systemic drug absorption due to the alveoli's broad surface area, thin epithelial layer, and high vascularization. Local therapies are more effective and have fewer side effects than systemic distribution because inhalation treatment targets the specific location and raises drug concentration in the lungs. The present manuscript aims to explore various aspects of aerogel formulations for pulmonary targeted delivery of active pharmaceutical agents. The manuscript also discusses the safety, efficacy, and regulatory aspects of aerogel formulations. According to projections, the global respiratory drug market is growing 4-6% annually, with short-term development potential. The proliferation of literature on pulmonary medicine delivery, especially in recent years, shows increased interest. Aerogels come in various technologies and compositions, but any aerogel used in a biological system must be constructed of a material that is biocompatible and, ideally, biodegradable. Aerogels are made via \"supercritical processing\". After many liquid phase iterations using organic solvents, supercritical extraction, and drying are performed. Moreover, the sol-gel polymerization process makes inorganic aerogels from TMOS or TEOS, the less hazardous silane. The resulting aerogels were shown to be mostly loaded with pharmaceutically active chemicals, such as furosemide-sodium, penbutolol-hemisulfate, and methylprednisolone. For biotechnology, pharmaceutical sciences, biosensors, and diagnostics, these aerogels have mostly been researched. Although aerogels are made of many different materials and methods, any aerogel utilized in a biological system needs to be made of a substance that is both biocompatible and, preferably, biodegradable. In conclusion, aerogel-based pulmonary drug delivery systems can be used in biomedicine and non-biomedicine applications for improved sustainability, mechanical properties, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. This covers scaffolds, aerogels, and nanoparticles. Furthermore, biopolymers have been described, including cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and MXenes. A safety regulatory database is necessary to offer direction on the commercialization potential of aerogelbased formulations. After that, enormous efforts are discovered to be performed to synthesize an effective aerogel, particularly to shorten the drying period, which ultimately modifies the efficacy. As a result, there is an urgent need to enhance the performance going forward.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical biotechnology", "date": "2024-01-22", "authors": ["ShristyVerma", "PramodSharma", "RishabhaMalviya", "SanjitaDas"], "doi": "10.2174/0113892010275613231120031855"}

Given their potential to transform and advance into hypervascular HCC, these nodules have progressively attracted the interest of the scientific community. To date, however, no shared guidelines have been established for the decision management of these borderline hepatic nodules. It is therefore extremely important to identify features that indicate the malignant potential of these nodules and the likelihood of vascularization. In fact, a more complete knowledge of their history and evolution would allow outlining shared guidelines for their clinical-surgical management, to implement early treatment programs and decide between a preventive curative treatment or a watchful follow-up.

{"title": "Apoptotic Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells Promote Skin Repair by Enhancing Angiogenesis: From Death to Regeneration.", "abstract": "The promotion of angiogenesis is an effective strategy for skin wound repair. While the transplantation of endothelial cells has shown promise in vascularization, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies have suggested that transplanted cells undergo apoptosis in a short period and release apoptotic extracellular vesicles (ApoEVs) that may have therapeutic potential.\nIn this study, we isolated ApoEVs from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and characterized their properties. In vitro, we assessed the effects of ApoEVs on the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In vivo, we investigated the therapeutic role of ApoEVs-AT in full-thickness skin wounds, evaluating wound closure rate, re-epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, vascularization, scar area, and collagen 3(Col3)/collagen 1(Col 1) ratio.\nApoEVs derived from HUVECs displayed typical characteristics. In vitro, ApoEVs significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration, tube formation, and expression of angiogenic-related genes in endothelial cells and slightly promoted the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts. In vivo, ApoEVs improved the wound closure rate, re-epithelialization, the formation of granulation tissue, and vascularization.

The quality of studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 criteria. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to quantify the predictive performance. Subgroup, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the potential sources of study heterogeneity.

Intercellular communication between ECs and PCs is vital for the formation, stability, and function of blood vessels. Various signaling pathways, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor pathway and the platelet-derived growth factor-B/platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2 pathway, play roles in communication between ECs and PCs. Dysfunctional communication between these cells is associated with various diseases, including vascular diseases, central nervous system disorders, and certain types of cancers.\nThis review aimed to explore the diverse roles of ECs and PCs in the formation and reshaping of blood vessels. This review focused on the essential signaling pathways that facilitate communication between these cells and investigated how disruptions in these pathways may contribute to disease. Additionally, the review explored potential therapeutic targets, future research directions, and innovative approaches, such as investigating the impact of EC-PCs in novel systemic diseases, addressing resistance to antiangiogenic drugs, and developing novel antiangiogenic medications to enhance therapeutic efficacy.\nDisordered EC-PC intercellular signaling plays a role in abnormal blood vessel formation, thus contributing to the progression of various diseases and the development of resistance to antiangiogenic drugs.

A Step-by-step Demonstration Video\".", "abstract": "Demonstrate the usefulness of using indocyanine green after laparoscopic ovarian detorsion to save the ovary.\nA step-by-step video demonstration of a surgical technique.\nOvarian torsion is one of the most common gynecological emergencies, mainly affecting patients younger than 20 years of age [1], and causes 2% to 7% of acute abdomens [2]. It is not advisable to routinely perform ovariectomy even with a necrotic ovary appearance [1]. Furthermore only in a small percentage of cases (16%) necrosis has been confirmed histologically [2]. Some studies have demonstrated that using indocyanine green to evaluate ovarian perfusion is inexpensive, low risk, and easily reproducible [3-5].\nA 17-year-old patient was referred to our hospital for acute abdominal pain. Ultrasound revealed ovarian torsion; therefore, the patient underwent surgical treatment. During laparoscopy, the presence of a right ovarian torsion was confirmed. A lesion compatible with a hemorrhagic corpus luteum of 6 cm was present on the ovary affected. Before ovarian detorsion, indocyanine green was administered intravenously at a 0.5 mg/kg dose. The first aspect noted was the total lack of ovarian vascularization; then ovarian detorsion was performed. At this point, using technology of Rubina (KARL STORZ SE & Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany), it was possible to highlight the progressive ovarian revascularization. Ovarian reperfusion occurred starting from the ovarian hilum and ending at the periphery. We proceeded with enucleation of the hemorrhagic corpus luteum by stripping technique, with subsequent ovarian reconstruction with continuous 2-0 monofilament suture. Finally, we fixed the ovary to the stump of the right round ligament. The final view highlights good ovarian vascularization. No complications occurred; the patient was discharged on the first postoperative day. A 6-month follow-up ultrasound confirmed the recovery of the vascularization of ovary.\nUsing indocyanine green represents a valid option to evaluate ovarian perfusion after detorsion.

The rats had undergone sham-operation or TBI using lateral FPI. Rats were implanted with epidural and/or intracerebral electrodes for electroencephalogram recordings. Brains were processed for histology to screen for abscess(es). In abscess cases, (a) unfolded cortical maps were constructed to assess the cortical location and area of the abscess, (b) the abscess tissue was Gram stained to determine the presence of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and (c) immunostaining was performed to detect infiltrating neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, and glial cells as tissue biomarkers of inflammation. In vivo and/or ex vivo magnetic resonance images available from a subcohort of animals were reviewed to evaluate the presence of abscesses. Plasma samples available from a subcohort of rats were used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to determine the levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a circulating biomarker for gram-negative bacteria.\nBrain abscesses were detected in 2.6% (15/583) of the rats (6 sham, 9 TBI). In histology, brain abscesses were characterized as vascularized encapsulated lesions filled with neutrophils and surrounded by microglia/macrophages and astrocytes.

{"title": "RNF213 in moyamoya disease: Genotype-phenotype association and the underlying mechanism.", "abstract": "Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by a steno-occlusive internal carotid artery and compensatory vascular network formation. Although the precise pathogenic mechanism remains elusive, genetic association studies have identified RNF213 as the principal susceptibility gene for MMD, with the single nucleotide polymorphism p.R4810K recognized as the founder variant predominantly in the Asian populations. Distinct genotype-phenotype correlations are observable in RNF213-related MMD. The clinical manifestations linked to p.R4810K bear commonalities within Asian cohort, including familial predisposition, earlier age of onset, ischemic episodes, and involvement of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). However, despite these shared phenotypic characteristics, there is significant heterogeneity in RNF213-related MMD presentations. This diversity manifests as variations across ethnic groups, inconsistent clinical symptoms and prognosis, and occurrence of other vasculopathies involving RNF213. This heterogeneity, in conjunction with the observed low disease penetrance of RNF213 mutations, suggests that the presence of these mutations may not be sufficient to cause MMD, underscoring the potential influence of other genetic or environmental factors. Although the current research might not have fully identified these additional contributors, experimental evidence points toward the involvement of RNF213 in angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, and the immune response.

Thus, understanding the anatomy and underlying coupling mechanisms of blood vessels and nerve fibers within bone to further develop neuro-vascularized bone implant biomaterials is an extremely critical aspect in the field of bone regeneration. Hydrogels have good biocompatibility, controllable mechanical characteristics, and osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties, making them important candidates for research related to neuro-vascularized bone regeneration. This review reports the classification and physicochemical properties of hydrogels, with a focus on the application advantages and status of hydrogels for bone regeneration.

Considering the limitations of autologous bone and allogeneic bone in clinical applications, such as secondary damage or immunogenicity, injectable microhydrogels with osteogenic and angiogenic effects have received considerable attention. Herein, polydopamine (PDA)-functionalized strontium alginate/nanohydroxyapatite (Sr-Alg/nHA) composite microhydrogels loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were prepared using microfluidic technology. This composite microhydrogel released strontium ions stably for at least 42 days to promote bone formation. The PDA coating can release VEGF in a controlled manner, effectively promote angiogenesis around bone defects, and provide nutritional support for new bone formation. In in vitro experiments, the composite microhydrogels had good biocompatibility. The PDA coating greatly improves cell adhesion on the composite microhydrogel and provides good controlled release of VEGF. Therefore, this composite microhydrogel effectively promotes osteogenic differentiation and vascularization. In in vivo experiments, composite microhydrogels were injected into critical-size bone defects in the skull of rats, and they were shown by microcomputed tomography and tissue sections to be effective in promoting bone regeneration. These findings demonstrated that this novel microhydrogel effectively promotes bone formation and angiogenesis at the site of bone defects.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2024-01-19", "authors": ["ShiChen", "DaweiCheng", "WeiminBao", "RuyuanDing", "ZhenguoShen", "WenkaiHuang", "YifanLu", "PanpanZhang", "YiweiSun", "HemuChen", "CailiangShen", "YuanyinWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.3c16822"}

{"title": "Design of a Zn-based nanozyme injectable multifunctional hydrogel with ROS scavenging activity for myocardial infarction therapy.", "abstract": "The existing strategies for myocardial infarction therapy mainly focus on reinstating myocardial blood supply, often disregarding the intrinsic and intricate microenvironment created by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that accompanies myocardial infarction. This microenvironment entails cardiomyocytes apoptosis, substantial vascular cell death, excessive inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis. In such situation, the present study introduces a zinc-based nanozyme injectable multifunctional hydrogel, crafted from ZIF-8, to counteract ROS effects after myocardial infarction. The hydrogel exhibits both superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like and catalase (CAT)-like enzymatic activities, proficiently eliminating surplus ROS in the infarcted region and interrupting ROS-driven inflammatory cascades. Furthermore, the hydrogel's exceptional immunomodulatory ability spurs a notable transformation of macrophages into the M2 phenotype, effectively neutralizing inflammatory factors and indirectly fostering vascularization in the infarcted region. For high ROS and demanding for zinc of the infarcted microenvironment, the gradual release of zinc ions as the hydrogel degrades further enhances the bioactive and catalytic performance of the nanozymes, synergistically promoting cardiac function post myocardial infarction. In conclusion, this system of deploying catalytic nanomaterials within bioactive matrices for ROS-related ailment therapy not only establishes a robust foundation for biomedical material development, but also promises a holistic approach towards addressing myocardial infarction complexities. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Myocardial infarction remains the leading cause of death worldwide. However, the existing strategies for myocardial infarction therapy mainly focus on reinstating myocardial blood supply. These therapies often ignore the intrinsic and intricate microenvironment created by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hence, we designed an injectable Zn-Based nanozyme hydrogel with ROS scavenging activity for myocardial infarction therapy. ALG-(ZIF-8) can significantly reduce ROS in the infarcted area and alleviate the ensuing pathological process. ALG-(ZIF-8) gradually releases zinc ions to participate in the repair process and improves cardiac function.

Patients with diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, glaucoma, dementia, other movement disorders, or known retinal or optic nerve pathology were excluded. Images were analyzed using Vasculature Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the Retina (VAMPIRE-UWF) software, which describes retinal vessel width gradient and tortuosity, provides vascular network fractal dimensions, and conducts alpha-shape analysis to further characterize vascular morphology (complexity, Op\u03b1min; spread, OpA).\nIn the PD cohort, 53 eyes of 38 subjects were assessed; in the control cohort, 51 eyes of 33 subjects were assessed. Eyes with PD had more tortuous retinal arteries in the superotemporal quadrant (P = 0.043). In eyes with PD, alpha-shape analysis revealed decreased OpA, indicating less retinal vasculature spread compared to controls (P = 0.032). Op\u03b1min was decreased in PD (P = 0.044), suggesting increased vascular network complexity. No differences were observed in fractal dimension in any region of interest.\nThis pilot study suggests that retinal vasculature assessment on UWF images using alpha-shape analysis reveals differences in retinal vascular network spread and complexity in PD and may be a more sensitive metric compared to fractal dimension.\nRetinal vasculature assessment using these novel methods may be useful in understanding ocular manifestations of PD and the development of retinal biomarkers.", "journal": "Translational vision science & technology", "date": "2024-01-17", "authors": ["Justin PMa", "Cason BRobbins", "EmmaPead", "SarahMcGrory", "CharleneHamid", "Dilraj SGrewal", "Burton LScott", "EmanueleTrucco", "Tom JMacGillivray", "SharonFekrat"], "doi": "10.1167/tvst.13.1.15"}
{"title": "Periapical bacterial disinfection is critical for dental pulp regenerative cell therapy in apical periodontitis in dogs.", "abstract": "Application of pulp regenerative cell therapy for mature teeth with periapical lesions is a critical clinical challenge. The bacterial infection in inaccessible location within the root canal system and in the periapical lesions could cause resistance and impediment, leading to limitations in successful therapy. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of residual bacteria on the outcome of pulp regeneration in mature teeth with apical periodontitis in dogs.\nPeriapical lesions were induced in 32 root canals of 4 dogs in two different models in severities, model A and model B. Model A (moderate infection): the canal exposed to the oral cavity for 2\u00a0weeks and then closed for 2\u00a0weeks. Model B (severe infection): the canal exposed to the oral cavity for 2\u00a0months and then closed for 5\u00a0months. All root canals were irrigated with 6% sodium hypochlorite, and 3% EDTA and further with 0.015% levofloxacin-containing nanobubbles, which was also used as an intracanal medicament. The aseptic conditions were examined by bacterial anaerobic culture and/or PCR analyses. The root canal treatment was repeated several times, and allogeneic dental pulp stem cells were transplanted into the root canals. The radiographic evaluation of periapical lesions was performed by cone-beam computed tomography before the first treatment, just after cell transplantation, and after 2\u00a0months and 6\u00a0months in both model A, model B, respectively. The animals were then sacrificed and the jaw blocks were harvested for histological and histobacteriological evaluations of pulp regeneration and periapical tissue healing. Furthermore, the DiI-labelled DPSCs were transplanted into the root canals after complete disinfection (n\u2009=\u20094) or without root canal treatment (n\u2009=\u20094) in the apical periodontitis model (model A) in one dog, and cell localization was compared 72\u00a0h after transplantation.\nIn 8 out of 12 canals from model A, and 10 out of 15 canals from model B, pulp regeneration with good vascularization, innervation, and a significant reduction in the radiolucent area of the periapical lesions were observed. However, in the other 4 canals and 5 canals from model A and model B, respectively, no pulp tissue was regenerated, and inflammation in the periapical tissue, and external resorption or healed external resorption were detected. The presence of residual bacteria in the periapical tissues and severe inflammation were significantly associated with inhibition of regenerated pulp tissue in these 9 unsuccessful canals (P\u2009<\u20090.05, each) (OR\u2009=\u20090.075, each) analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis. For cellular kinetics, transplanted cells remained in the disinfected root canals, while they were not detected in the infected root canals, suggesting their migration through the apical foramen under the influence of inflammation.\nA true pulp-dentin complex was regenerated in the root canal by the pulp regenerative therapy in mature teeth with apical lesions.

{"title": "Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase enhances the dentin-pulp complex regeneration mediated by crosstalk between vascular endothelial cells and dental pulp stem cells.", "abstract": "Revascularization and restoration of normal pulp-dentin complex are important for tissue-engineered pulp regeneration. Recently, a unique periodontal tip-like endothelial cells subtype (POTCs) specialized to dentinogenesis was identified. We have confirmed that TPPU, a soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor targeting epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) metabolism, promotes bone growth and regeneration by angiogenesis and osteogenesis coupling. We hypothesized that TPPU could also promote revascularization and induce POTCs to contribute to pulp-dentin complex regeneration. Here, we in vitro and in vivo characterized the potential effect of TPPU on the coupling of angiogenesis and odontogenesis and investigated the relevant mechanism, providing new ideas for pulp-dentin regeneration by targeting sEH.\nIn vitro effects of TPPU on the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cocultured DPSCs and HUVECs were detected using cell counting kit 8 (CCK8) assay, wound healing, transwell, tube formation and RT-qPCR. In vivo, Matrigel plug assay was performed to outline the roles of TPPU in revascularization and survival of grafts. Then we characterized the VEGFR2\u2009+\u2009POTCs around odontoblast layer in the molar of pups from C57BL/6 female mice gavaged with TPPU. Finally, the root segments with DPSCs mixed with Matrigel were implanted subcutaneously in BALB/c nude mice treated with TPPU and the root grafts were isolated for histological staining.\nIn vitro, TPPU significantly promoted the migration and tube formation capability of cocultured DPSCs and HUVECs. ALP and ARS staining and RT-qPCR showed that TPPU promoted the osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation of cultured cells, treatment with an anti-TGF-\u03b2 blocking antibody abrogated this effect. Knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 in HUVECs significantly reversed the effect of TPPU on the expression of angiogenesis, osteogenesis and odontogenesis-related genes in cocultured cells. Matrigel plug assay showed that TPPU increased VEGF/VEGFR2-expressed cells in transplanted grafts. TPPU contributed to angiogenic-odontogenic coupling featured by increased VEGFR2\u2009+\u2009POTCs and odontoblast maturation during early dentinogenesis in molar of newborn pups from C57BL/6 female mice gavaged with TPPU. TPPU induced more dental pulp-like tissue with more vessels and collagen fibers in transplanted root segment.\nTPPU promotes revascularization of dental pulp regeneration by enhancing migration and angiogenesis of HUVECs, and improves odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs by TGF-\u03b2. TPPU boosts the angiogenic-odontogenic coupling by enhancing VEGFR2\u2009+\u2009POTCs meditated odontoblast maturation partly via upregulating HIF-1\u03b1, which contributes to increasing pulp-dentin complex for tissue-engineered pulp regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of translational medicine", "date": "2024-01-17", "authors": ["LingwenyaoKong", "JuanjuanLi", "YuwenBai", "ShaoyangXu", "LinZhang", "WeixianChen", "LuGao", "FuWang"], "doi": "10.1186/s12967-024-04863-y\n10.1177/0022034518808754\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00058\n10.1590/0103-6440201702451\n10.1155/2016/7231038\n10.1016/j.joen.2017.06.023\n10.1016/S0163-7827(03)00049-3\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2016.06.002\n10.1074/jbc.M501730200\n10.1152/ajpcell.00454.2021\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2018.07.002\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2018.07.004\n10.1073/pnas.1311565110\n10.1111/cpr.13403\n10.1016/j.joen.2006.09.013\n10.1200/JCO.2005.06.081\n10.3389/fonc.2022.993573\n10.1200/JCO.2002.10.088\n10.1084/jem.20211789\n10.1007/s10753-016-0448-6\n10.1096/fj.202000415R\n10.1007/s00441-015-2262-0\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01641.x\n10.1186/s12967-023-04198-0\n10.1016/j.joen.2018.02.011\n10.1177/0022034520925427\n10.1186/s13287-021-02493-5\n10.3390/jcm12072656\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf3227\n10.1007/s11684-018-0628-x\n10.1186/s12967-023-03917-x\n10.1073/pnas.1601532113\n10.1177/0091270010397049\n10.1111/bcp.12855\n10.1016/j.joen.2017.09.003\n10.1016/j.joen.2021.04.012\n10.1016/j.joen.2014.12.019\n10.1152/ajpcell.00230.2008\n10.3892/mmr.2017.6831\n10.1007/s11064-014-1456-2\n10.1038/s41598-018-22823-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0209158\n10.1186/s13287-022-02996-9\n10.1073/pnas.0708474105\n10.1177/00220345221091528\n10.1186/1479-5876-9-10\n10.1002/jbm.a.35968\n10.1073/pnas.2136855100\n10.1186/s12860-017-0127-y"}

This paper presents an anatomic study of the nasal tip artery and its clinical applications for columellar repair.\nThis study investigated the nasal tip perforator artery during nasal tip flap surgery for columellar repair in patients with sequels after nasal continuous positive airway pressure use. A descriptive anatomic study was conducted using intraoperative vascular dissection of patients operated on for nasal columellar defects by the author between 2013 and 2018. An observational study of a group of patients operated on for columellar repair using the axial nasal tip flap is presented here.\nThe nasal tip artery was found in all the intraoperative dissections. Location and trajectory are described. Observed columellar length and width in operated patients have been nonstatistical and significantly different than controls in this study.\nThe presence and trajectory of the nasal tip artery have been consistent in all the studied cases.

{"title": "Platelet-rich fibrin for rehydration and pre-vascularization of an acellular, collagen membrane of porcine origin.", "abstract": "Pre-vascularization of the collagen membranes with autologous platelet concentrates is a standard procedure in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This study analyzed the possible interaction of an acellular collagen membrane of porcine origin (NM) with platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) regarding its rehydration protocol with differences in pH values and effect on angiogenesis.\nNM was analyzed alone and combined with solid PRF by plotting or co-culturing with injectable PRF. Different media (venous blood, buffer solution with a fixed pH value of 7, saline solution, and injectable PRF) were used to analyze the influence on pH value during rehydration. Chorion allantois membrane assay (CAM) was applied to check pro-angiogenic effects after 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h, followed by immunohistochemical analysis.\nRehydration in injectable PRF showed acidity over time (p\u2009<\u20090.05). A definite pro-angiogenic effect of NM alone was found regarding neo-vessel formation supported by the respective light microscopically analysis without significant differences to PRF alone (p\u2009>\u20090.005). This pro-angiogenic effect could not be exaggerated when NM was combined with liquid/solid PRF (each p\u2009>\u20090.005).\nRehydration with liquid PRF of the collagen membrane results in acidity compared to a saline solution or patient's blood.

However, it remains unclear whether the salivary gland ultrasonography findings are reversible in response to treatment. We present a case of a woman in her 20s who presented with parotid swelling and pain lasting for three months. The patient was diagnosed with anti-SS-A antibody-positive Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome with active sialadenitis, and short-term glucocorticoid treatment resulted in resolution of clinical symptoms and improvement of salivary gland ultrasonography findings by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials scoring system. Notably, the anechoic/hypoechoic foci and vascular signals in the parotid and submandibular glands were reduced after treatment. Furthermore, peak systolic blood flow velocity of the facial artery entering the submandibular gland was decreased. Our case highlights that the findings of \"inflammatory\" structural changes and vascularization on salivary gland ultrasonography, including the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials scoring system, reflect the disease active of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and are reversible with treatment. Salivary gland ultrasonography has the potential to be a useful tool for monitoring treatment response and stratifying patients by disease activity in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, therefore further research is needed on the relationship of salivary gland ultrasonography findings with the pathophysiological mechanisms of sialadenitis and long-term clinical outcomes.", "journal": "Modern rheumatology case reports", "date": "2024-01-16", "authors": ["TakashiKida", "YutakaKawahito", "YusukeSuzuki", "ShigenoriTamaki", "IkukoTanaka"], "doi": "10.1093/mrcr/rxae002"}

{"title": "Synthetic optical coherence tomography angiographs for detailed retinal vessel segmentation without human annotations.", "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can acquire high-resolution volumes of the retinal vasculature and aid the diagnosis of ocular, neurological and cardiac diseases. Segmenting the visible blood vessels is a common first step when extracting quantitative biomarkers from these images. Classical segmentation algorithms based on thresholding are strongly affected by image artifacts and limited signal-to-noise ratio. The use of modern, deep learning-based segmentation methods has been inhibited by a lack of large datasets with detailed annotations of the blood vessels. To address this issue, recent work has employed transfer learning, where a segmentation network is trained on synthetic OCTA images and is then applied to real data. However, the previously proposed simulations fail to faithfully model the retinal vasculature and do not provide effective domain adaptation. Because of this, current methods are unable to fully segment the retinal vasculature, in particular the smallest capillaries. In this work, we present a lightweight simulation of the retinal vascular network based on space colonization for faster and more realistic OCTA synthesis. We then introduce three contrast adaptation pipelines to decrease the domain gap between real and artificial images. We demonstrate the superior segmentation performance of our approach in extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on three public datasets that compare our method to traditional computer vision algorithms and supervised training using human annotations. Finally, we make our entire pipeline publicly available, including the source code, pretrained models, and a large dataset of synthetic OCTA images.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "date": "2024-01-15", "authors": ["LinusKreitner", "Johannes CPaetzold", "NikolausRauch", "ChenChen", "Ahmed MHagag", "Alaa EFayed", "SobhaSivaprasad", "SebastianRausch", "JulianWeichsel", "Bjoern HMenze", "MatthiasHarders", "BenjaminKnier", "DanielRueckert", "Martin JMenten"], "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2024.3354408"}

Arteries and veins are the conduits that carry blood, while capillaries are where blood exchanges substances with tissues. Blood vessels are mainly composed of collagen fibers, elastic fibers, glycosaminoglycans and other macromolecular substances. There are about 19 feet of blood vessels per square inch of skin in the human body, which shows how important blood vessels are to the human body. Because cardiovascular disease and vascular trauma are common in the population, a great number of researches have been carried out in recent years by simulating the structures and functions of the person's own blood vessels to create different levels of tissue-engineered blood vessels that can replace damaged blood vessels in the human body. However, due to the lack of effective oxygen and nutrient delivery mechanisms, these tissue-engineered vessels have not been used clinically. Therefore, in order to achieve better vascularization of engineered vascular tissue, researchers have widely explored the design methods of vascular systems of various sizes. In the near future, these carefully designed and constructed tissue engineered blood vessels are expected to have practical clinical applications. Exploring how to form multi-scale vascular networks and improve their compatibility with the host vascular system will be very beneficial in achieving this goal.

Hydrogels are extensively used in various forms to promote chronic wound healing and provide a three-dimensional spatial structure, through growth factors or cell transport.\nWe present a novel multicenter regenerative model that is capable of regenerating and merging simultaneously to form a complete layer of skin. This method significantly reduces wound healing time compared to the traditional centripetal healing model. We believe that our model can improve clinical outcomes and pave the way for further research into regenerative medicine.\nWe prepared a novel multi-island double-layer microneedle (MDMN) using gelatin-methacryloylchitosan (GelMA-CS). The MDMN was loaded with keratinocytes (KCs) and dermal fibroblasts (FBs). Our aim in this study was to explore the therapeutic potential of MDMN in a total skin excision model.\nThe MDMN model replicated the layered structure of full-thickness skin and facilitated tissue regeneration and healing via dual omni-bearing. Multi-island regeneration centres accomplished horizontal multicentric regeneration, while epidermal and dermal cells migrated synchronously from each location. This produced a healing area approximately 4.7 times greater than that of the conventional scratch tests. The MDMN model exhibited excellent antibacterial properties, attributed to the chitosan layer. During wound healing in diabetic mice, the MDMN achieved earlier epidermal coverage and faster wound healing through multi-island regeneration centres and the omnidirectional regeneration mode.

Supported by experimental data, here a broadly applicable predictive computational model capable of recapitulating both encapsulation strategies is developed. The model is employed to comparatively study the oxygen concentration at different levels of vascularization, transplanted cell density, and spatial distribution, as well as with codelivered adjuvant cells. The model is then validated to be predictive of experimental results of oxygen pressure and local and systemic drug biodistribution in a direct vascularization device with local immunosuppressant delivery. The model highlights that dense vascularization can minimize cell hypoxia while allowing for high cell loading density.

{"title": "Local Dialogues Between the Endocrine and Exocrine Cells in the Pancreas.", "abstract": "For many years, it has been taught in medical textbooks that the endocrine and exocrine parts of the pancreas have separate blood supplies that do not mix. Therefore, they have been studied by different scientific communities, and patients with pancreatic disorders are treated by physicians in different medical disciplines, where endocrine and exocrine function are the focus of endocrinologists and gastroenterologists, respectively. The conventional model that every islet in each pancreatic lobule receives a dedicated arterial blood supply was first proposed in 1932, and it has been inherited to date. Recently, in\u00a0vivo intravital recording of red blood cell flow in mouse islets as well as in situ structural analysis of 3D pancreatic vasculature from hundreds of islets provided evidence for preferentially integrated pancreatic blood flow in six mammalian species. The majority of islets have no association with the arteriole, and there is bidirectional blood exchange between the two segments. Such vascularization may allow an entire downstream region of islets and acinar cells to be simultaneously exposed to a topologically and temporally specific plasma content, which could underlie an adaptive sensory function as well as common pathogeneses of both portions of the organ in pancreatic diseases, including diabetes.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2024-01-12", "authors": ["MarjanSlak Rupnik", "ManamiHara"], "doi": "10.2337/db23-0760"}
{"title": "Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals tumoral microenvironment heterogenicity and hypervascularization in human carotid body tumor.", "abstract": "Carotid body tumor (CBT) is a rare neck tumor located at the adventitia of the common carotid artery bifurcation. The prominent pathological features of CBT are high vascularization and abnormal proliferation. However, single-cell transcriptome analysis of the microenvironment composition and molecular complexity in CBT has yet to be performed. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on human CBT to define the cells that contribute to hypervascularization and chronic hyperplasia. Unbiased clustering analysis of transcriptional profiles identified 16 distinct cell populations including endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), neuron cells, macrophage cells, neutrophil cells, and T cells. Within the ECs population, we defined subsets with angiogenic capacity plus clear signs of later endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to normal ECs. Two populations of macrophages were detectable in CBT, macrophage1 showed enrichment in hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and as well as an early EPCs cell-like population expressing CD14 and vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition to HIF-1-related transcriptional protein expression, macrophages1 also display a neovasculogenesis-promoting phenotype. SMCs included three\u00a0populations showing platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta\u00a0and vimentin\u00a0expression, indicative of a cancer-associated fibroblast\u00a0phenotype. Finally, we identified three types of neuronal cells, including chief cells and sustentacular cells, and elucidated their distinct roles in the pathogenesis of CBT and abnormal proliferation of tumors. Overall, our study provided the first comprehensive characterization of the transcriptional landscape of CBT at scRNA-seq profiles, providing novel insights into the mechanisms underlying its formation.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2024-01-12", "authors": ["GaopoCai", "ZhaohuiHua", "LinfengZhang", "YutianChen", "XuLi", "KeMa", "ZongpingXia", "ZhenLi"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.31175"}
{"title": "Role of Angiogenesis and Its Biomarkers in Development of Targeted Tumor Therapies.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis plays a significant role in the human body, from wound healing to tumor progression. \"Angiogenic switch\" indicates a time-restricted event where the imbalance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors results in the transition from prevascular hyperplasia to outgrowing vascularized tumor, which eventually leads to the malignant cancer progression. In the last decade, molecular players, i.e., angiogenic biomarkers and underlying molecular pathways involved in tumorigenesis, have been intensely investigated. Disrupting the initiation and halting the progression of angiogenesis by targeting these biomarkers and molecular pathways has been considered as a potential treatment approach for tumor angiogenesis. This review discusses the currently known biomarkers and available antiangiogenic therapies in cancer, i.e., monoclonal antibodies, aptamers, small molecular inhibitors, miRNAs, siRNAs, angiostatin, endostatin, and melatonin analogues, either approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or currently under clinical and preclinical investigations.", "journal": "Stem cells international",

{"title": "The Role of Natural Extracts in the Management of Infantile Hemangiomas and Vascular Tumors.", "abstract": "Hemangiomas are vascular tumors resulting from the proliferation of endothelial-like cells; they are the most common childhood tumors, affecting approximately 5-10% of newborns and infants. Besides hemangiomas, which are definitely benign tumors despite their overgrowth potential, there are other vascular tumors like hemangioendotheliomas, which may display intermediate characteristics between benign hemangiomas and highly malignant angiosarcomas. Standard therapy may be constricted by serious adverse effects, high cost, or traumatic influence. Diet is a major resource for health preservation, disease prevention, and treatment. The therapeutic property of edible berries, marine products, or medicinal plants have long been known and used in traditional medicine; a plant-based nutrition can prevent the development and progression of diseases associated with extensive neo-vascularization. The purpose of our review is to highlight those natural treatments that hemangioma and vascular tumor patients can receive in the future, both for their benefit and that of their families. We performed the review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metanalysis Statement. We used the Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE engines for the study, and searched for the association of hemangioma with naturopathic treatment/plant extract/plants in published articles. We found that natural extracts from plants and fruits are cost-effective and safe treatments for hemangiomas and vascular tumors, as well as for other forms of cancer.

{"title": "Mussel-inspired electroactive, antibacterial and antioxidative composite membranes with incorporation of gold nanoparticles and antibacterial peptides for enhancing skin wound healing.", "abstract": "Large skin wounds are one of the most important health problems in the world. Skin wound repair and tissue regeneration are complex processes involving many physiological signals, and effective wound healing remains an enormous clinical challenge. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a strategy to rapidly kill bacteria, promote cell proliferation and accelerate wound healing. At present, electrical stimulation (ES) is often used in the clinical treatment of skin wounds and can simulate the endogenous biological current of the body and accelerate the repair process of skin wounds. However, a single ES strategy has difficulty covering the entire wound area, which may lead to unsatisfactory therapeutic effects. To overcome this deficiency, it is essential to develop a collaborative treatment strategy that combines ES with other treatments. In this study,\u00a0gold nanoparticles and antibacterial peptides (Os) were loaded on the surface of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) material through the reducibility and adhesion of polydopamine (PDA) and improved the electrical activity, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and biocompatibility properties of the polymer material. At the same time, this composite membrane material (Os/Au-PDA@PLGA) combined with ES was used in wound therapy to improve the wound healing rate. The results show that the new wound repair material has good biocompatibility and can effectively promote cell proliferation and migration. Through the combined application of gold nanoparticles and antibacterial peptides Os, the polymer materials have more efficient bactericidal and antioxidant effects. The antibacterial experiment results showed that gold\u00a0nanoparticles could further enhance the antibacterial activity of antibacterial peptides. Furthermore, the Os/Au-PDA@PLGA composite membrane has good hydrophilicity and electrical activity, which can provide a more favorable cell microenvironment for wound healing. In vivo studies using a full-thickness skin defect model in rats showed that the Os/Au-PDA@PLGA composite membrane had a better therapeutic effect than the pure PLGA material. More importantly, the combination of the Os/Au-PDA@PLGA composite with ES significantly accelerated the rate of vascularization and collagen deposition and promoted wound healing compared with non-ES controls. Therefore, the combination of the Au/Os-PDA@PLGA composite membrane with ES may provide a new strategy for the effective treatment of skin wounds.", "journal": "Journal of biological engineering", "date": "2024-01-12", "authors": ["YongkangDong", "ZhengWang", "JiapengWang", "XuediSun", "XiaoyuYang", "GuominLiu"], "doi": "10.1186/s13036-023-00402-3\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.2003.12454.x\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.01.139\n10.1039/c6ra26020a\n10.1007/s10856-007-3276-2\n10.1021/nn101373r\n10.1021/acs.biomac.7b01180\n10.1002/art.22401\n10.1111/srt.12626\n10.1002/jper.18-0674\n10.1039/c7ra12062a\n10.1002/psc.2505\n10.1039/c1cs15237h\n10.1016/j.clindermatol.2006.09.007\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00023.2004\n10.1248/bpb.19.530\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.01.190"}
{"title": "ANGPTL4 accelerates ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma carcinogenesis and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment by activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and interacting with ESM1.", "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a malignant neoplasm that displays increased vascularization. Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) is a secreted glycoprotein that functions as a regulator of cell metabolism and angiogenesis and plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. However, the precise role of ANGPTL4 in the OC microenvironment, particularly its involvement in angiogenesis, has not been fully elucidated.\nThe expression of ANGPTL4 was confirmed by bioinformatics and IHC in OC. The potential molecular mechanism of ANGPTL4 was measured by RNA-sequence. We used a series of molecular biological experiments to measure the ANGPTL4-JAK2-STAT3 and ANGPTL4-ESM1 axis in OC progression, including MTT, EdU, wound healing, transwell, xenograft model, oil red O staining, chick chorioallantoic membrane assay and zebrafish model. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms were confirmed by Western blot, Co-IP and molecular docking.\nOur study demonstrates a significant upregulation of ANGPTL4 in OC specimens and its strong association with unfavorable prognosis. RNA-seq analysis affirms that ANGPTL4 facilitates OC development by driving JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway activation. The interaction between ANGPTL4 and ESM1 promotes ANGPTL4 binding to lipoprotein lipase (LPL), thereby resulting in reprogrammed lipid metabolism and the promotion of OC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In the OC microenvironment, ESM1 may interfere with the binding of ANGPTL4 to integrin and vascular-endothelial cadherin (VE-Cad), which leads to stabilization of vascular integrity and ultimately promotes angiogenesis.\nOur findings underscore that ANGPTL4 promotes OC development via JAK signaling and induces angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment through its interaction with ESM1.", "journal": "Journal of translational medicine", "date": "2024-01-12", "authors": ["Yu-KunLi", "An-BoGao", "TianZeng", "DanLiu", "Qun-FengZhang", "Xiao-MinRan", "Zhen-ZiTang", "YanLi", "JueLiu", "TingZhang", "Gang-QingShi", "Wen-ChaoZhou", "Wen-daZou", "JuanPeng", "JuanZhang", "HuiLi", "JuanZou"], "doi": "10.1186/s12967-023-04819-8\n10.1007/s12094-009-0406-y\n10.1097/CCO.0b013e328363e0da\n10.1056/NEJMoa1103799\n10.3390/ijms18081786\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-11-0519\n10.1182/blood-2011-01-328716\n10.1074/jbc.RA118.005932\n10.3389/fcvm.2022.926631\n10.1038/s41388-021-02172-y\n10.1016/j.canlet.2021.07.036\n10.3390/ijms20225625\n10.3892/or.2011.1176\n10.1038/onc.2013.174\n10.1038/s41419-019-1384-9\n10.15252/embj.2020105450\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0859\n10.1007/s10549-016-4057-8\n10.1002/jcla.22079\n10.7150/ijbs.66839\n10.1038/ng1180\n10.1186/gb-2003-4-5-p3\n10.3389/fonc.2022.1021558\n10.1073/pnas.0604026103\n10.1530/JOE-17-0580\n10.3389/fcell.2021.702508\n10.3892/or_00000897\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-19-0691\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-2273\n10.1038/s41698-019-0094-1\n10.1038/mt.2014.102\n10.1016/j.molmed.2019.05.010\n10.3390/ijms23168968\n10.31557/APJCP.2022.23.5.1699\n10.3181/00379727-148-38537\n10.1016/j.jlr.2021.100150\n10.3390/cancers10070227\n10.1038/s41388-017-0093-z\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.157776\n10.1371/journal.pone.0221640\n10.1038/s41598-017-11769-x\n10.1172/jci.insight.163019\n10.1186/s12935-021-01865-4\n10.1038/ncb1752\n10.1074/jbc.M408877200"}

This study was exempted from requiring hospital institutional review board approval.\nTeaching hospital.\nA 34-year-old woman (G8P3) with a medical history of 2 cesarean sections, 1 partial mole, and a missed abortion with 2.8 L of blood loss. The patient presented after 10 weeks of amenorrhea. Ultrasound revealed a large blood-filled niche in the cesarean section scar with a thin overlying myometrium. A partial mole was suspected as well as increased vascularization in the myometrium and enhanced myometrial vascularity with arterial flow velocities of 100 cm/s. A risk of heavy blood loss in conjunction with curettage was anticipated. The patient had a strong preference for a fertility-preserving treatment, and after informed consent, she opted for transient occlusion of the uterine arteries with subsequent suction evacuation of the molar pregnancy. The patient signed a consent form accepting the procedure. The patient included in this video provided consent for publication of the video and posting of the video online including social media, the journal website, and scientific literature websites. Institutional review board approval was not required in accordance with the IDEAL guidelines.\nA vaginal incision was made over the bladder, and the vaginal mucosa was dissected.

Pathology confirmed a partial molar pregnancy.\nUterine or internal iliac artery ligation can be lifesaving in situations with massive bleeding from the uterus. Current minimally invasive approaches are laparoscopic vessel ligation and, more commonly, uterine artery embolization, which has unclear impact on fertility and has shown an increased risk of intrauterine growth restriction, miscarriage, and prematurity. As the patient was undergoing a vaginal evacuation of pregnancy, a vaginal and retroperitoneal approach of artery ligation was deemed least invasive. In patients with fertility-preserving wishes, care should to be taken to avoid as much trauma as possible to the endometrium. Optimized blood control, and a shorter duration of using a curette, may potentially reduce the risk of endometrial damage.

{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "When conventional wound closure methods, whether for cosmetic or functional reasons, prove impractical, the need arises for additional tissue reconstruction. This necessitates the use of grafts or flaps. Grafts, like split-thickness skin or mucosal grafts, serve as non-vascularized tissue patches. In contrast, flaps are vascularized, contributing to high success rates in healing. Flaps can originate from distant body sites, requiring microsurgical blood vessel anastomosis near the wound site, earning them the label microvascular \"free\" flaps. \"Regional\" flaps involve tissue transfer from non-adjacent areas without such microsurgical connections, while \"local\" flaps move tissue immediately neighboring the primary defect. Local flaps are further classified into transposition, rotation, advancement, and interpolation, with the latter sometimes categorized as a hallmark of regional flaps by different authors.\u00a0Advancement flaps are conceptually the simplest local flaps and, along with rotation flaps, are sometimes known as \"sliding\" flaps. For sliding flaps, the tissue is moved or \"slid\" directly into the adjacent defect without crossing over or under normal tissue, as\u00a0is seen in transposition and interpolated flaps. Local flap advancement is a versatile cornerstone in cutaneous surgery for several compelling reasons. Firstly, these flaps boast a straightforward conceptual framework, demanding far less spatial reasoning or geometric finesse in their design compared to transposition flaps like z-plasties and bilobed flaps.\u00a0Secondly, they possess the distinct advantage of not leaving secondary defects that necessitate subsequent closure at the flap's initial elevation or harvesting site, a challenge common to transposition, interpolated, regional, and free flaps. Moreover, tissue advancement techniques find utility beyond wound closure scenarios. For instance, V to Y advancement aids in lengthening the columella of the nose in cleft lip cases, restoring the position of the lobule in post-rhytidectomy pixie ear deformities, correcting partial syndactyly, and releasing scar bands that distort anatomical structures such as the eyelid. Furthermore, these techniques extend their utility to cosmetic or gender-affirming procedures like lowering the hairline with scalp advancement and forming the basis of facelift surgery through cheek advancement.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["Jeremy R.Etzkorn", "Patrick M.Zito", "Marc H.Hohman", "MarthaCouncil"], "doi": null}
{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "Decompression illness is caused by bubbles that appear in the bloodstream or other tissues in the body by ascending too fast from underwater depth to the surface or from the surface to an altitude, such as in high-altitude fighter pilots. When ambient pressure increases, such as during diving, so will the pressure of any gas the person is breathing. This gas is distributed throughout the body at different speeds, where highly vascularized tissues equilibrate faster. Bubbles are formed when the ambient pressure is reduced faster than the ability of the blood or tissue to transport the gas, which is in solution (usually nitrogen), to the lungs to get exhaled. These bubbles can have various complex effects on the body, from blood and lymph flow obstruction to nerve injury by direct irritation or inflammatory mediators. These effects can be mild, resulting in pain or paresthesias, or severe, leading to paralysis and death. The most widely used classifications of decompression illness include decompression sickness type 1 (DCS1) with mild pain or mild skin symptoms, decompression sickness type 2 (DCS2) with neurological involvement, and arterial gas embolism, resulting from pulmonary barotrauma.\u00a0The primary treatment of decompression illness is recompression in a hyperbaric chamber, which will increase the ambient pressure again, reduce the speed of new bubble formation and existing bubble size, and create a large diffusion gradient for the offending gas by breathing 100% oxygen. The appropriate treatment of decompression illness is usually very effective, especially if began early after the injury, leaving either minimal or no residual effects. As the body tries to heal, most residual effects will improve even further with time. However, some residual effects may be permanent. In addition, a diver may also suffer from barotrauma to air-filled spaces such as ears, sinuses, and lungs during a dive. After an episode of decompression illness or other diving-related injuries, many divers want to go diving again, either for recreation, work, or military service. A thorough understanding of the factors that led to the injury and a careful clinical exam will help the diving medicine specialist decide if additional tests are indicated and advise the diver of his future risk with a return to diving.

Previous ex vivo experimentation has failed to account for the role of prestretch in the mechanical behavior of the dura. Here we aim to estimate the prestretch in mouse cranial dura mater and determine its dependency on direction and age. We performed transverse and longitudinal incisions in parietal dura excised from newborn (day [Formula: see text]4) and mature (12\u00a0weeks) mice and calculated the ex vivo normalized incision opening (measured width over length). Then, similar incisions were simulated under isotropic stretching within Abaqus/Standard. Finally, prestretch was estimated by comparing the ex vivo and in silico normalized openings. There were no significant differences between the neonatal and adult mice when comparing cuts in the same direction, but adult mice were found to have significantly greater stretch in the anterior-posterior direction than in the medial-lateral direction, while neonatal dura was essentially isotropic.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can enhance fat regeneration and increase the fat retention rate after transplantation. However, the quick release of growth factors (GFs) in PRP decreases therapeutic efficiency. This study aimed to achieve a slow release of PRP to promote fat retention.\nWe prepared a dual-network hydrogel (DN gel) based on FDA-approved PRP and sodium alginate (SA) through a simple \"one-step\" activation process. In vivo study, adipose tissue with saline (control group), SA gel (SA gel group), PRP gel (PRP gel group), and DN gel (DN gel group) was injected subcutaneously into the dorsum of nude mice. At 4 and 12 weeks after injection, tissues were assessed for volume and weight. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and immunofluorescence staining were performed for histological assessment.\nDN gel exhibits long-lasting growth factor effects, surpassing conventional clinical PRP gel regarding vascularization potential. In fat transplantation experiments, DN gel demonstrated improved vascularization of transplanted fat and increased retention rates, showing promise for clinical applications.\nDN gel-assisted lipofilling can significantly improve the retention rate and quality of transplanted fat. DN gel-assisted lipofilling, which is considered convenient, is a promising technique to improve neovascularization and fat survival.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each submission to which Evidence-Based Medicine rankings are applicable.

We here investigated the effects of short-term moderate hypoxia on the heart, focusing on ventricular adaptation, in terms of hemodynamics and structural traits. Functional evaluations revealed that animals exposed to 4\u00a0days of environmental hypoxia increased the hemodynamic performance evaluated on ex vivo cardiac preparations. This was associated with a thicker and more vascularized ventricular compact layer and a reduced luminal lacunary space. Compared to normoxic animals, ventricular cardiomyocytes of goldfish exposed to hypoxia showed an extended mitochondrial compartment and a modulation of proteins involved in mitochondria dynamics. The enhanced expression of the pro-fission markers DRP1 and OMA1, and the modulation of the short and long forms of OPA1, suggested a hypoxia-related mitochondria fission. Our data propose that under hypoxia, the goldfish heart undergoes a structural remodelling associated with a potentiated cardiac activity.

The literature review was performed on PubMed. Articles were limited to English, but there was no limitation in terms of date.\nManagement of FUS is divided between endoscopic and open surgical repair. Urethral dilation with or without urethrectomy can be offered as a first-line treatment. However, the rate of success of this procedure remains inferior to open surgical repair, and its efficacy decreases with the number of previous dilations. For distal urethral strictures, distal urethrectomy and advancement meatoplasty may be considered. Vaginal flaps are readily available, easy to harvest, well-vascularized, and allow for a dorsal or ventral orientation urethroplasty. The results of this procedure are promising, but most studies are small and retrospective. Labia flaps are easily accessible, wet, hairless, and elastic. The main limitations with the use of vaginal or labial tissues are co-existing conditions such as lichen sclerosis or vaginal atrophy, which may affect future results. Vaginal and labial graft urethroplasty can be used when it is not possible to mobilize an adequate flap. Stricture-free rates of this technique are variable. In cases of more severe stricture, an augmentation urethroplasty using buccal mucosa graft may be necessary.

{"title": "Understanding organotropism in cancer metastasis using microphysiological systems.", "abstract": "Cancer metastasis, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, remains a complex challenge in medical science. Stephen Paget's \"seed and soil theory\" introduced the concept of organotropism, suggesting that metastatic success depends on specific organ microenvironments. Understanding organotropism not only offers potential for curbing metastasis but also novel treatment strategies. Microphysiological systems (MPS), especially organ-on-a-chip models, have emerged as transformative tools in this quest. These systems, blending microfluidics, biology, and engineering, grant precise control over cell interactions within organ-specific microenvironments.

{"title": "SH2 domain protein E and ABL signaling regulate blood vessel size.", "abstract": "Blood vessels in different vascular beds vary in size, which is essential for their function and fluid flow along the vascular network. Molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of a vascular lumen of appropriate size, or tubulogenesis, are still only partially understood. Src homology 2 domain containing E (She) protein was previously identified in a screen for proteins that interact with Abelson (Abl)-kinase. However, its biological role has remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that She and Abl signaling regulate vessel size in zebrafish embryos and human endothelial cell culture. Zebrafish she mutants displayed increased endothelial cell number and enlarged lumen size of the dorsal aorta (DA) and defects in blood flow, eventually leading to the DA collapse. Vascular endothelial specific overexpression of she resulted in a reduced diameter of the DA, which correlated with the reduced arterial cell number and lower endothelial cell proliferation. Chemical inhibition of Abl signaling in zebrafish embryos caused a similar reduction in the DA diameter and alleviated the she mutant phenotype, suggesting that She acts as a negative regulator of Abl signaling. Enlargement of the DA size in she mutants correlated with an increased endothelial expression of claudin 5a (cldn5a), which encodes a protein enriched in tight junctions. Inhibition of cldn5a expression partially rescued the enlarged DA in she mutants, suggesting that She regulates DA size, in part, by promoting cldn5a expression. SHE knockdown in human endothelial umbilical vein cells resulted in a similar increase in the diameter of vascular tubes, and also increased phosphorylation of a known ABL downstream effector CRKL. These results argue that SHE functions as an evolutionarily conserved inhibitor of ABL signaling and regulates vessel and lumen size during vascular tubulogenesis.", "journal": "PLoS genetics", "date": "2024-01-08", "authors": ["Jennifer ASchumacher", "Zo\u00eb AWright", "DiandraRufin Florat", "Surendra KAnand", "ManishDasyani", "Surya Prakash RaoBatta", "ValentinaLaverde", "KaitlinFerrari", "LauritaKlimkaite", "Nina OBredemeier", "SumanGurung", "Gretchen MKoller", "Kalia NAguera", "Griffin PChadwick", "Riley DJohnson", "George EDavis", "SauliusSumanas"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgen.1010851\n10.1242/jcs.064964\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00902.x\n10.1242/jcs.115.6.1123\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309094\n10.1074/jbc.M308373200\n10.1016/B978-0-12-386041-5.00003-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0147758\n10.1242/dev.125260\n10.1016/s0002-9440(10)65038-9\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.01.013\n10.1242/jcs.175521\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.22.012703.104753\n10.1542/peds.2015-3257\n10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.023\n10.1073/pnas.0703077104\n10.1371/journal.pone.0124960\n10.1038/ncb1096\n10.1242/jcs.035691\n10.1152/ajpcell.00373.2011\n10.1073/pnas.1304188110\n10.1084/jem.20132330\n10.1371/journal.pone.0085231\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.118.312315\n10.1038/sj.onc.1201299\n10.1002/dvdy.21990\n10.1080/15384101.2017.1364324\n10.1038/ng875\n10.1016/j.febslet.2012.04.054\n10.1126/science.1099480\n10.1021/jm901808w\n10.1016/j.devcel.2023.11.001\n10.1242/jcs.248237\n10.1242/jcs.020693\n10.1016/s1074-5521(02)00098-4\n10.1002/j.1460-2075.1994.tb06518.x\n10.4161/sgtp.29716\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2016.11.018\n10.1111/cns.12764\n10.1093/nar/gks608\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1862-1_7\n10.1089/zeb.2014.1047\n10.1002/dvdy.21354\n10.1242/dev.02087\n10.1242/dev.048785\n10.1242/dev.129.12.3009\n10.1016/s0091-679x(08)61821-x\n10.1182/blood-2004-12-4653\n10.1038/s41467-020-16515-y\n10.1242/dev.165753\n10.1101/pdb.prot069633\n10.1093/nar/gkz365\n10.1016/S0076-6879(08)02005-3\n10.1182/blood-2010-11-316752\n10.1007/978-1-62703-604-7_2"}
{"title": "[Treatment of osteochondritis dissecans].", "abstract": "Osteochondritis dissecans (OD) is a\u00a0rare condition with an incidence of 30/100,000. It especially affects male patients aged 10-20\u00a0years old. During the staged progression the osteochondral fragments can detach from their base. These can damage the adjacent articular cartilage, which can lead to premature osteoarthritis. Most commonly affected are the knee, ankle and elbow joints. The exact pathogenesis of OD has so far not been clearly confirmed. Several risk factors that can lead to the development of OD are discussed. These include repeated microtrauma and vascularization disorders that can lead to ischemia of the subchondral bone and to a\u00a0separation of the fragments close to the joint and therefore to the development of free joint bodies. For an adequate clarification patients should undergo a\u00a0thorough radiological evaluation including X\u2011ray imaging followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the integrity of the cartilage-bone formation with determination of the OD stage. The assessment is based on criteria of the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS). The instability of the cartilage-bone fragment increases with higher stages. Stages\u00a0I and\u00a0II with stable cartilage-bone interconnection can be treated conservatively. For stages\u00a0III and\u00a0IV, i.e., instability of the OD fragment or the presence of free fragments, surgical treatment should be performed. Primarily, refixation of a\u00a0free joint body should be carried out depending on the size and vitality of the fragment. In cases of unsuccessful conservative treatment or fixation, a\u00a0debridement, if necessary in combination with a bone marrow stimulating procedure, can be employed corresponding to the size of the defect. For larger cartilage defects, an osteochondral graft transplantation should be considered. Overall, OD lesions in stages\u00a0I and\u00a0II show a\u00a0good healing tendency under conservative treatment. In cases of incipient unstable OD, refixation can also lead to good clinical and radiological results.\nDie Osteochondrosis dissecans (OD) ist eine seltene Erkrankung mit einer Inzidenz von 30/100.000. Sie betrifft insbesondere m\u00e4nnliche Patienten im Alter von 10\u00a0bis 20\u00a0Jahren. Im Rahmen des stadienhaften Verlaufs kann es bis zu einer Abl\u00f6sung des gebildeten osteochondralen Fragments aus seinem Bett kommen. Dies f\u00fchrt zu einer Zerst\u00f6rung des angrenzenden Gelenkknorpels und kann in eine vorzeitige Arthrose m\u00fcnden. Am h\u00e4ufigsten betroffenen sind das Knie\u2011, Sprung- und Ellenbogengelenk. Die genaue Pathogenese der OD ist bislang nicht eindeutig belegt. Es werden verschiedene Risikofaktoren diskutiert, die zu einer Entwicklung der OD f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Dabei werden wiederholte Mikrotraumata sowie Vaskularisierungsst\u00f6rungen als Ursachen genannt. Aufgrund dessen kommt es zu einer Isch\u00e4mie des subchondralen Knochens, die bis zu einer Separierung des gelenknahen Fragmentes und damit zur Entwicklung freier Gelenkk\u00f6rper f\u00fchren kann. Eine ad\u00e4quate Abkl\u00e4rung beinhaltet die R\u00f6ntgen- sowie MRT(Magnetresonanztomographie)-Bildgebung zur Erhebung des Knorpel-Knochen-Status mit Bestimmung des vorliegenden OD-Stadiums. Die Einteilung der Stadien erfolgt anhand der International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS). Dabei nimmt mit zunehmendem Stadium die Instabilit\u00e4t des Knorpel-Knochen-Fragments zu. Bei stabilem Knorpel-Knochen-Fragment, kann eine konservative Therapie eingeleitet werden. Bei Anhalt f\u00fcr eine Instabilit\u00e4t des OD-Fragmentes oder Vorliegen eines freien Fragmentes ist ein operatives Prozedere indiziert. Prim\u00e4r sollte in Abh\u00e4ngigkeit der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe sowie Vitalit\u00e4t des Fragmentes eine Refixation zum Erhalt des Fragmentes erfolgen. Sollte dies nicht m\u00f6glich sein, kann entsprechend der Defektgr\u00f6\u00dfe ein D\u00e9bridement, ggf. in Kombination mit Knochenmark-stimulierenden Verfahren, angewandt werden. Bei gr\u00f6\u00dferen Defekten kann eine Knorpel-Knochen-Transplantation erwogen werden. Insgesamt zeigt die OD im Stadium\u00a0I und\u00a0II eine gute Einheilungstendenz unter konservativer Therapie. Bei beginnender instabiler OD kann auch eine Refixierung zu guten klinischen und radiologischen Ergebnissen f\u00fchren.", "journal": "Orthopadie (Heidelberg, Germany)", "date": "2024-01-08", "authors": ["FranziskaBreulmann", "JulianMehl", "AlexanderOtto", "SebastianLappen", "SebastianSiebenlist", "PeterRab"], "doi": "10.1007/s00132-023-04461-8\n10.1007/s11999-013-2824-y\n10.1177/0363546513510390\n10.1111/j.1440-1827.2006.02015.x\n10.3109/17453677608988756\n10.1302/0301-620X.69B1.3818743\n10.1177/0363546514538406\n10.1016/S0278-5919(05)70270-2\n10.1016/S0278-5919(05)70243-X\n10.1177/1947603520985182\n10.5435/00124635-200407000-00005\n10.1053/jars.2001.19979\n10.1097/00008480-200302000-00007\n10.1097/BPO.0000000000000212\n10.1097/BPO.0000000000001174\n10.1053/ar.1999.v15.015002\n10.1177/0363546520905567\n10.1177/1071100715581477\n10.1007/s00247-003-0876-y\n10.1177/1947603517715736\n10.1007/s00402-005-0018-0\n10.1177/0363546509346542\n10.1177/1947603510397535\n10.5435/JAAOS-D-15-00464\n10.2106/JBJS.K.00275\n10.1097/BPO.0000000000000323\n10.1177/03635465211027178\n10.1016/j.ocl.2012.01.001\n10.1055/s-2008-1048620\n10.1148/rg.2018180044\n10.1016/0749-8063(91)90087-E\n10.1177/19476035221121789\n10.1177/1758573218821151\n10.1177/0363546516637175\n10.2106/00004623-199806000-00014\n10.1177/1947603518758435\n10.1177/0363546509354969\n10.1177/0363546508324970\n10.1007/s00167-009-0942-6\n10.2106/00004623-200706000-00007\n10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181cfcd2e\n10.2106/JBJS.G.01103\n10.1177/03635465990270060701\n10.1016/j.jor.2022.08.005\n10.5435/00124635-201009000-00007\n10.5435/00124635-201105000-00007\n10.1007/s00167-013-2531-y\n10.1177/03635465010290050701\n10.1016/S0749-8063(05)80506-7\n10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181c6318c\n10.1007/s00167-004-0521-9\n10.1177/19476035211003325\n10.1177/03635465980260040801\n10.1055/a-1663-6807\n10.1007/s00064-021-00737-4\n10.1016/j.arthro.2010.08.008\n10.1016/j.eats.2021.11.013\n10.1302/0301-620X.88B2.17009\n10.1007/s00132-010-1608-2\n10.1007/s11678-020-00604-x\n10.1016/j.knee.2011.08.007\n10.1177/0363546517717679\n10.1177/03635465020300011601\n10.1177/1947603510381095\n10.1177/0363546511420127\n10.1016/j.ocl.2019.08.004\n10.1007/s00167-021-06489-9\n10.1177/0363546505282620\n10.1016/j.eats.2022.03.014\n10.1007/s12178-020-09611-5\n10.1055/s-0040-1718605"}
{"title": "VEGF-delivering PEG hydrogels promote vascularization in the porcine subcutaneous space.", "abstract": "For cell therapies, the subcutaneous space is an attractive transplant site due to its large surface area and accessibility for implantation, monitoring, biopsy, and retrieval. However, its poor vascularization has catalyzed research to induce blood vessel formation within the site to enhance cell revascularization and survival. Most studies focus on the subcutaneous space of rodents, which does not recapitulate important anatomical features and vascularization responses of humans. Herein, we evaluate biomaterial-driven vascularization in the porcine subcutaneous space. Additionally, we report the first use of cost-effective fluorescent microspheres to quantify perfusion in the porcine subcutaneous space. We investigate the vascularization-inducing efficacy of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-delivering synthetic hydrogels based on 4-arm poly(ethylene) glycol macromers with terminal maleimides (PEG-4MAL). We compare three groups: a non-degradable hydrogel with a VEGF-releasing PEG-4MAL gel coating (Core+VEGF gel); an uncoated, non-degradable hydrogel (Core-only); and na\u00efve tissue. After 2\u2009weeks, Core+VEGF gel has significantly higher tissue perfusion, blood vessel area, blood vessel density, and number of vessels compared to both Core-only and na\u00efve tissue.

{"title": "MHO or MUO? White adipose tissue remodeling.", "abstract": "In this review, we delve into the intricate relationship between white adipose tissue (WAT) remodeling and metabolic aspects in obesity, with a specific focus on individuals with metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO). WAT is a highly heterogeneous, plastic, and dynamically secreting endocrine and immune organ. WAT remodeling plays a crucial role in metabolic health, involving expansion mode, microenvironment, phenotype, and distribution. In individuals with MHO, WAT remodeling is beneficial, reducing ectopic fat deposition and insulin resistance (IR) through mechanisms like increased adipocyte hyperplasia, anti-inflammatory microenvironment, appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, appropriate vascularization, enhanced WAT browning, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SWAT) deposition. Conversely, for those with MUO, WAT remodeling leads to ectopic fat deposition and IR, causing metabolic dysregulation. This process involves adipocyte hypertrophy, disrupted vascularization, heightened pro-inflammatory microenvironment, enhanced brown adipose tissue (BAT) whitening, and accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (VWAT) deposition. The review underscores the pivotal importance of intervening in WAT remodeling to hinder the transition from MHO to MUO.

Cardiopulmonary progenitors (CPPs) are stem cells for both heart and lung, but their repairing role in damaged heart is still unknown. Here, we obtained CPPs from E9.5 mouse embryos, maintained their stemness while expanding, and identified their characteristics by scRNA-seq, flow cytometry, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and differentiation assays. Moreover, we employed mouse MI model to investigate whether CPPs could repair the injured heart. Our data identified that CPPs exhibit hybrid fibroblastic, endothelial, and mesenchymal state, and they could differentiate into cell lineages within the cardiopulmonary system. Moreover, intramyocardial injection of CPPs improves cardiac function through CPPs exosomes (CPPs-Exo) by promotion of cardiomyocytic proliferation and vascularization. To uncover the underlying mechanism, we used miRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and bioinformatic approaches, and found the highly expressed miR-27b-3p in CPPs-Exo and its target gene Sik1, which can influence the transcriptional activity of CREB1. Therefore, we postulate that CPPs facilitate cardiac repair partially through the SIK1-CREB1 axis via exosomal miR-27b-3p.

Nevertheless, Res-NP inhibited CSCs proliferation and reduced the expression of metastatic and angiogenic markers, in ovo blood vascularization, NO production and MMPs expression. Res-NP delinked the association between AM-M1 and CAFs by blocking IL-6 production and also disrupted the potential connection between IL-6 and PD-L1 with considerable decrease in p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 expressions. IL-6 depletion inhibited stemness and angiogenesis in oral CSCs by downregulating PD-L1 via JAK2/STAT3 cascade. Similar observations were also observed in Res-NP treated xenograft mice. Thus, data demonstrate that CSCs growth is dependent on IL-6/PD-L1 axis. Res-NP deregulates the association between AM-M1 and CAFs along-with attenuates carcinogenesis in in vitro, in ovo, ex vivo and in vivo model systems by inhibiting PD-L1 via IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 axis.", "journal": "The Journal of nutritional biochemistry", "date": "2024-01-08", "authors": ["RajalaxmiPradhan", "SubarnoPaul", "Sushree SubhadraAcharya", "SaptarshiSinha", "Somya RanjanDash", "Chanakya NathKundu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jnutbio.2024.109568"}
{"title": "Effects of Innervation on Angiogenesis and Osteogenesis in Bone and Dental Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "The repair and regeneration of critical-sized bone defects remain an urgent challenge. Bone tissue engineering represents an exciting solution for regeneration of large bone defects. Recently, the importance of innervation in tissue-engineered bone regeneration has been increasingly recognized. The cross talk between nerve and bone provides important clues for bone repair and regeneration. Furthermore, the promotion of angiogenesis by innervation can accelerate new bone formation. However, the mechanisms involved in the promotion of vascular and bone regeneration by the nervous system have not yet been established. In addition, simultaneous neurogenesis and vascularization in bone tissue engineering have not been fully investigated. This article represents the first review on the effects of innervation in enhancing angiogenesis and osteogenesis in bone and dental tissue engineering. Cutting-edge research on the effects of innervation through biomaterials on bone and dental tissue repairs is reviewed. The effects of various nerve-related factors and cells on bone regeneration are discussed. Finally, novel clinical applications of innervation for bone, dental, and craniofacial tissue regeneration are also examined.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are crucial in TNBC progression; however, understanding the molecular basis of stromal cell activation and tumor-stromal crosstalk in TNBC is limited. To investigate therapeutic targets in the TNBC stromal niche, we used an advanced human in vitro microphysiological system called the vascularized micro-tumor (VMT). Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we revealed that normal breast tissue stromal cells activate neoplastic signaling pathways in the TNBC TME. By comparing interactions in VMTs with clinical data, we identified therapeutic targets at the tumor-stromal interface with potential clinical significance. Combining treatments targeting Tie2 signaling with paclitaxel resulted in vessel normalization and increased efficacy of paclitaxel in the TNBC VMT. Dual inhibition of HER3 and Akt also showed efficacy against TNBC. These data demonstrate the potential of inducing a favorable TME as a targeted therapeutic approach in TNBC.", "journal": "Breast cancer research : BCR", "date": "2024-01-06", "authors": ["Stephanie JHachey", "Christopher JHatch", "DanielaGaebler", "AneelaMocherla", "KevinNee", "KaiKessenbrock", "Christopher C WHughes"], "doi": "10.1186/s13058-023-01760-y\n10.1038/s41523-022-00468-0\n10.3322/caac.21763\n10.1186/s13058-020-01296-5\n10.1002/cncr.27581\n10.1038/s41571-021-00565-2\n10.1080/2162402X.2021.2020984\n10.1016/j.omto.2022.02.003\n10.1073/pnas.1919764117\n10.1080/14728222.2022.2170779\n10.1002/cac2.12291\n10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2017.03.10\n10.1038/srep31589\n10.1039/C6LC01422D\n10.1039/C8LC00330K\n10.1039/D0LC01216E\n10.1016/j.trsl.2022.11.011\n10.1126/sciadv.aba1862\n10.1038/s41467-020-20294-x\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.031\n10.1186/s13059-020-02238-2\n10.1007/s10456-016-9509-6\n10.1023/A:1014918512569\n10.1186/s13045-021-01187-y\n10.1096/fj.09-150540\n10.1080/21655979.2021.1957754\n10.1091/mbc.e11-05-0393\n10.1038/s41598-021-04662-1\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0754\n10.1038/bjc.2013.80\n10.1038/nmeth.4402\n10.1038/s41467-022-30755-0\n10.1093/jnci/djt164\n10.15252/embr.201847046\n10.1089/omi.2011.0118\n10.15252/embj.2019104063\n10.15252/embj.2020107333\n10.1038/s41467-022-33052-y\n10.1073/pnas.1820006116\n10.1186/s12575-019-0093-1\n10.4081/oncol.2018.355\n10.1172/JCI74527\n10.1186/s13058-019-1154-8\n10.1200/JCO.19.00368\n10.1038/s41598-020-59514-1\n10.1038/nchembio.1986\n10.1038/nrc.2016.73\n10.1359/jbmr.2001.16.8.1486\n10.1084/jem.20200712\n10.1038/s41467-018-05220-6\n10.1007/s10549-016-3979-5\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-1012\n10.1126/scisignal.2005125\n10.1080/23808993.2018.1456333\n10.1089/ten.tec.2012.0430\n10.1038/s41588-023-01298-x\n10.1038/nbt.4096\n10.1038/nbt.3192\n10.1016/j.cels.2019.03.003\n10.1186/s12859-021-03957-4\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00186.2002\n10.1038/s41467-020-17740-1\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000431\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.11.051\n10.1038/s41590-018-0276-y\n10.1093/gigascience/giy083\n10.15252/msb.20209923\n10.1038/s41467-021-21246-9\n10.1038/s41598-022-07959-x\n10.1038/s41467-020-18873-z\n10.1093/nar/gkaa183\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btab370\n10.1038/nbt.2859"}
{"title": "First-in-Human Whole-Eye Transplantation: Ensuring an Ethical Approach to Surgical Innovation.", "abstract": "As innovations in the field of vascular composite allotransplantation (VCA) progress, whole-eye transplantation (WET) is poised to transition from non-human mammalian models to living human recipients. Present treatment options for vision loss are generally considered suboptimal, and attendant concerns ranging from aesthetics and prosthesis maintenance to social stigma may be mitigated by WET. Potential benefits to WET recipients may also include partial vision restoration, psychosocial benefits related to identity and social integration, improvements in physical comfort and function, and reduced surgical risk associated with a biologic eye compared to a prosthesis. Perioperative and postoperative risks of WET are expected to be comparable to those of facial transplantation (FT), and may be similarly mitigated by immunosuppressive protocols, adequate psychosocial support, and a thorough selection process for both the recipient and donor. To minimize the risks associated with immunosuppressive medications, the first attempts in human recipients will likely be performed in conjunction with a FT. If first-in-human attempts at combined FT-WET prove successful and the biologic eye survives, this opens the door for further advancement in the field of vision restoration by means of a viable surgical option.

Any observational study comparing bone transport based on Illizarov external fixator and free vascularized fibula grafting techniques for treating lower limb long bone segmental defects was entailed in this study.\nThis systematic review comprised of five retrospective studies. A total of 96 patients were treated by the Illizarov-based bone transport technique and 72 patients were treated by the free vascularized fibula grafting technique. The free vascularized fibula grafting technique yielded a shorter mean time to union (average difference 9.3 months), relatively shorter external fixator time (average difference 5.32 months), and external fixator index (average difference 0.57\u00a0months/cm). However, there was no difference in terms of bony and functional outcomes between both techniques when used for the reconstruction of bony defects in the lower limb.

The osteogenic and angiogenic potentials were also investigated in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that the HA hydrogel loaded with RPP and NGF on the PEEK surface degraded slowly and could sustainably release various growth factors, including NGF. The results of in vitro tests showed that the hybrid hydrogel on the surface of PEEK effectively promoted osteogenesis and angiogenesis. The in vivo experiment also confirmed that the PEEK surface hydrogel could promote osseointegration of the implant and the integration of new bone and neovascularization.

{"title": "ADAMTS13 regulates angiogenic markers via Ephrin/Eph signaling in human mesenchymal stem cells under serum-deprivation stress.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to facilitate angiogenesis and promote neo-vascularization via secretion of trophic factors. Here, we explored the molecular mechanism adopted by ADAMTS13 in modulating the expression of some key angiogenic markers in human umbilical cord-derived MSCs under serum-deprivation stress. Wharton's jelly MSCs (WJ-MSCs) were isolated from the perivascular region of human umbilical cords by explant culture. ADAMTS13 was upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in WJ-MSCs under serum-deprivation stress. Correspondingly, some key angiogenic markers were also seen to be upregulated. By screening signaling pathways, p38 and JNK pathways were identified as negative and positive regulators for expression of ADAMTS13, and the angiogenic markers, respectively. Our results also indicated the Notch pathway and p53 as other probable partners modulating the expression of ADAMTS13 and the angiogenic markers. Knockdown of ADAMTS13 using siRNA led to reversal in the expression of these angiogenic markers. Further, ADAMTS13 was shown to act via the EphrinB2/EphB4 axis followed by ERK signaling to control expression of the angiogenic markers. Interestingly, stronger expression levels were noted for ADAMTS13, VEGF and PDGF under a more stringent nutrient stress condition.

We aim to improve the method of this surgery by recommending the optimal location of the iliac pedicle to satisfy the vascular length for transposition and the blood supply of the vascularized iliac graft.\n\u2003The DCIA and its surrounding tissues were assessed on computed tomography angiography images for 100 sides (left and right) of 50 patients. The length of the vascular pedicle required for transposition and the length of the pedicle at different iliac spine positions were compared. The diameter and cross-sectional area of the DCIA and the distance between the DCIA and iliac spine were measured at different points to assess blood supply. We also compared differences in sex and left-right position.\n\u2003The diameter and cross-sectional area of the DCIA gradually decreased after crossing the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), and it approached the iliac bone. However, when the DCIA was 4\u2009cm behind the ASIS (54 sides, 54%), it coursed posteriorly and superiorly away from the iliac spine. The vascular length of the pedicle was insufficient to transpose the vascularized iliac graft to the desired position when it was within 1\u2009cm of the ASIS. The vascular length requirement was satisfied, and the blood supply was sufficient when the pedicle was positioned at 2 or 3\u2009cm.\n\u2003To obtain a satisfactory pedicle length and sufficient blood supply, the DCIA pedicle of the vascularized iliac graft should be placed 2 to 3\u2009cm behind the ASIS.

{"title": "Added Value of Contrast-enhanced US for Evaluation of Female Pelvic Disease.", "abstract": "Since the first application of contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) in the late 1960s, the use of US contrast agents has grown tremendously, and this examination has proved to be a valuable adjunct to diagnostic US for detection and characterization of disease. Also, CEUS has emerged as an excellent option for evaluation of indeterminate lesions that require additional imaging, given its excellent safety profile, including that in patients with end-stage renal disease or allergies to contrast material who are unable to undergo contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. US traditionally has been considered the imaging modality of choice for evaluation of the female pelvis, followed by MRI and rarely fluoroscopy, CT, PET, or angiography. CEUS has the potential to add significant value in imaging gynecologic disease, and indications for its use in the female pelvis are expected to continue evolving. It can aid in evaluation of nonvascular structures, such as assessment of tubal patency, uterine cavity morphology, and pelvic fistulas. CEUS can help characterize poorly vascularized gynecologic tumors or tissues with slow flow by using qualitative and quantitative parameters and aid in image-guided interventions or biopsies by facilitating visualization of lesions that are difficult to see with other imaging modalities. The authors provide an overview of current applications of US contrast agents in the female pelvis and discuss associated factors such as technique, interpretation, and image optimization. They also discuss the limitations of CEUS and describe its utility in the evaluation of female pelvic disease by using an organ system case-based approach.

{"title": "Vascularization of the gastrointestinal tract of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu 1821).", "abstract": "Odontocetes primarily rely on fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans as their main source of nutrition. In the digestive system, their polygastric complex exhibits similarities to that of their closest terrestrial relatives such as cows, sheep, and giraffes, while the entero-colic tract shares similarities with terrestrial carnivores. The morphology, caliber, and structure of the odontocete intestine are relatively constant, and, since there is no caecum, a distinction between the small and large intestine and their respective subdivisions is difficult. To address this issue, we used the intestinal vascularization pattern, specifically the course and branching of the celiac artery (CA) and the cranial and caudal mesenteric arteries (CrMA and CdMA). A series of pictures and dissections of 10 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were analyzed. Additionally, we performed a cast by injecting colored polyurethane foam in both arteries and veins to measure the caliber of the arteries and clarify their monopodial or dichotomous branching. Our results showed the presence of multiple duodenal arteries (DAs) detaching from the CA. The CrMA gave origin to multiple jejunal arteries, an ileocolic artery (ICA), and, in six cases, a CdMA. In four specimens, the CdMA directly originated from the abdominal aorta. The ICA gave rise to the mesenteric ileal branches (MIB) and mesenteric anti-ileal branches and the right colic arteries (RCA) and the middle colic arteries. From the CdMA originated the left colic and cranial rectal arteries (LCA and CrRA). The measurements revealed a mixed monopodial and dichotomous branching scheme. The analysis of the arteries and their branching gave us an instrument, based on comparative anatomy, to distinguish between the different intestinal compartments. We used the midpoint of anastomoses between MIB and RCA to indicate the border between the small and the large intestine, and the midpoint of anastomoses between LCA and CrRA, to tell the colon from the rectum. This pattern suggested an elongation of the duodenum and a shortening of the colic tract that is still present in this species. These findings might be related to the crucial need to possess a long duodenal tract to digest prey ingested whole without chewing. A short aboral part is also functional to avoid gas-producing colic fermentation. The rare origin of the CdMA on the CrMA might instead be a consequence of the cranial thrust of the abdominopelvic organs related to the loss of the pelvic girdle that occurred during the evolution of cetaceans.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2024-01-04", "authors": ["TommasoGerussi", "Jean-MarieGra\u00efc", "KseniaOrekhova", "BrunoCozzi", "AnnamariaGrandis"], "doi": "10.1111/joa.13989\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(199805)251:1<50::AID-AR9>3.0.CO;2-I\n10.1053/j.sempedsurg.2014.06.002\n10.1007/s12565-009-0047-9\n10.1016/B978-0-12-407229-9.00008-7\n10.1007/s12565-014-0240-3\n10.1098/rspb.2020.2888\n10.1111/j.1469-7580.2007.00819.x\n10.1002/ar.24421\n10.1016/b978-0-12-802446-1.00006-0\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-012110-142152\n10.1006/jtbi.1997.0586\n10.1007/s00418-022-02116-x\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199710)234:1<37::AID-JMOR4>3.0.CO;2-K\n10.1002/aja.1000730302\n10.1111/ahe.12066\n10.1515/pp-2016-0023\n10.2535/ofaj1936.48.6_427\n10.1016/B978-0-12-804327-1.00105-9\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00604.2003\n10.2535/ofaj1936.51.1_29\n10.2535/ofaj1936.52.1_1"}

We sought to test if structural information on these epitopes could indicate mutagenesis targets for designing a hypoallergen and evaluated the reduction in IgE binding via immunochemistry and a mouse model of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA).\nX-ray crystallography characterized the conformational epitopes in detail, followed by mutational analysis of key residues to modify monoclonal antibody (mAb) and serum IgE binding, assessed by ELISA and biolayer interferometry.

{"title": "Advances in lymphedema: An under-recognized disease with a hopeful future for patients.", "abstract": "Lymphedema has traditionally been underappreciated by the healthcare community. Understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and treatments beyond compression have been limited until recently. Increased investigation has demonstrated the key role of inflammation and resultant fibrosis and adipose deposition leading to the clinical sequelae and associated reduction in quality of life with lymphedema. New imaging techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), indocyanine green lymphography, and high-frequency ultrasound offer improved resolution and understanding of lymphatic anatomy and flow. Nonsurgical therapy with compression, exercise, and weight loss remains the mainstay of therapy, but growing surgical options show promise. Physiologic procedures (lymphovenous anastomosis and vascularized lymph node transfers) improve lymphatic flow in the diseased limb and may reduce edema and the burden of compression.

ILK was reported to play key roles in both fibrosis and angiogenesis, which are two important factors during wound healing. However, the function of ILK during vascularization in wounds remains unclear. In our study, we found increased ILK expression in chronic wound tissues compared to adjacent tissue, as well as a positive relationship between ILK expression and microvessel density. Moreover, fibroblasts overexpressing ILK showed an enhanced ability to promote HUVEC migration and tube formation, during which PI3K/Akt, downstream of ILK, played key roles and VEGFA was the key cytokine. Considering the important function of ILK in wound healing and the lack of an ILK activator, we investigated microRNAs targeting ILK and found that miR-758-3p could target ILK to regulate its transcription.

It was hypothesized that combined injections would be superior to sole IA injections.\nControlled laboratory study.\nA total of 48 rats were divided into 6 groups: sham (only joint puncture during OA induction with IA+IO saline injection treatment) and 5 groups with OA induction, control (IA+IO saline injection), PRP (IA PRP+IO saline injection), BMAC IA (IA BMAC+IO saline injection), PRP IA+IO (IA+IO PRP injection), and BMAC IA+IO (IA+IO BMAC injection). OA was induced by IA injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA). Rats were administered different orthobiologics according to their grouping 3 weeks after the MIA injection. Pain changes were evaluated using the weightbearing ratio assay at weeks 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 after OA induction.

These patients were diagnosed with severe humerus defects due to gunshot injury in battlefield zone in various areas of Ukraine. Data was collected within period between February, 24th 2022 till January, 01st 2023. The following approaches were applied to replace bone defect: preoperative 3D printing with polyetheretherketone (PEEK) as orthobiological material; closed reduction, percutaneous lag screw and Ilizarov external fixation; vascularized fibula grafting.\nData analyses of the segmental defects of humerus showed 5\u00a0cm defect in 3 (13\u00a0%) patients, from 5 to 10\u00a0cm in 4 (17\u00a0%) patients, over 10\u00a0cm in 17 (71\u00a0%) patients. Analyses were performed in these 17 (71\u00a0%) patients, showing 5 patients treated with 3D-printed PEEK implants, 6 patients with vascular-pedicle graft of fibula, 6 patients with closed reduction, percutaneous lag screw, Ilizarov external fixation. Osteomyelitis was diagnosed in one case (20\u00a0%) after the use of PEEK implants, requiring to remove both PEEK implant and metal implants followed by application of the antibiotic joint spacers and Ex-Fix fragments of the humerus. In our opinion, the osteomyelitis happened due to inadequate debridement of the wound and non-compliance with the conversion criteria (replacement of the fixation method).

Here, we demonstrate that heterotypic interactions between human adipose tissue-derived endothelial cells and perivascular cells can be exploited to accelerate the endothelialization of an electrospun ionomeric polyurethane scaffold. The scaffold was used to physically separate endothelial cells from perivascular cells to prevent their diffuse neo-intimal hyperplasia and spontaneous tubulogenesis, yet enable their paracrine cross-talk to accelerate the integration of the endothelial cells into a temporally stable endothelial lining of a continuous, elongated, and aligned morphology. Perivascular cells stimulated endothelial basement membrane protein production and suppressed their angiogenic and inflammatory activation to accelerate this biomimetic morphogenesis of the endothelium. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and underscore the value of exploiting heterotypic interactions between endothelial cells and perivascular cells for the fabrication of an endothelial lining intended for small diameter arterial reconstruction. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Adipose tissue is an abundant, accessible, and uniquely dispensable source of endothelial cells and perivascular cells for vascular tissue engineering. While their spontaneous self-assembly into microvascular networks is routinely exploited for the vascularization of engineered tissues, it threatens the temporal stability of an endothelial lining intended for small diameter arterial reconstruction. Here, we demonstrate that an electrospun polyurethane scaffold can be used to physically separate endothelial cells from perivascular cells to prevent their spontaneous capillary morphogenesis, yet enable their cross-talk to promote the formation of a stable endothelium.

ANGPTL1 is well-known for its anti-angiogenic property; nevertheless, its role in GBM is yet to be explored. Recently, the crucial role of exosomes (Exos) as intercellular communication mediators has gained prominence in GBM therapy. This work aimed to explore the role of exosomal ANGPTL1 in GBM angiogenesis and its mechanisms.\nBioinformatic analysis was performed to evaluate ANGPTL expression in GBM. Human GBM cell lines (U87 and U251) and a xenograft mouse model were employed. Exos were isolated from oe-NC- and oe-ANGPTL-transfected bone mesenchymal stem cells and identified. Cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were detected. Immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying exosomal ANGPTL1 against GBM angiogenesis. Besides, tube generation and transmission electron microscope assays were conducted to assess GBM angiogenesis.\nLow ANGPTL1 expression was observed in GBM tumor tissues and cells. Functionally, e-ANGPTL-Exos inhibited GBM malignant progression and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, e-ANGPTL-Exos reduced VEGFA expression and blocked the VEGFR2/Akt/eNOS pathway in GBM cells and tumor tissues. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed a link between ANGPTL1 and VEGFA in GBM cells. Notably, oe-VEGFA abolished the suppressive functions of e-ANGPTL-Exos in GBM progression and angiogenesis and the VEGFR2/Akt/eNOS axis. The VEGFR2 inhibitor, vandetanib, eliminated the promotive effects of oe-VEGFA on GBM angiogenesis with suppressed VEGFR2/Akt/eNOS pathway.\nExosomal ANGPTL1 suppressed GBM angiogenesis by inhibiting the VEGFA/VEGFR2/Akt/eNOS axis.", "journal": "Journal of neuroimmunology", "date": "2023-12-28", "authors": ["DongWang", "HuichenLi", "TianxiangZeng", "QiangChen", "WeilongHuang", "YujingHuang", "YuqingLiao", "QiuhuaJiang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jneuroim.2023.578266"}

In this study, by means of subcutaneous preimplantation, we successfully constructed demineralized bone matrix (DBM) grafts with immunoregulatory and vascularized microenvironments. According to the current results, at the early time points (days 1 and 3), subcutaneously implanted DBM grafts recruited a large number of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages with positive expression of CD68 and iNOS, while at the later time points (days 7 and 14), these inflammatory cells gradually subsided, accompanying increased presence of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages with positive expression of CD206 and Arg-1, indicating a gradually enhanced anti-inflammatory microenvironment. At the same time, the gradually increased angiogenesis was observed in the DBM grafts with implantation time. In addition, the positive cells of CD105, CD73, and CD90 were observed in the inner region of the DBM grafts, implying the homing of mesenchymal stem cells. The repair results of cranial bone defects in a rat model further confirmed that the subcutaneous DBM xenografts at 7 days significantly improved bone regeneration.

The Cierny-Maiden criteria classify it according to the anatomical aspects (I to IV) and also by physiological class (A host being in good immune condition and B hosts being locally (L) or systemically (S) compromised). The surgical approach to chronic osteomyelitis involves radical debridement and dead space reconstruction. Two-stage management with delayed reconstruction is the most common surgical management, while one-stage treatment with concomitant reconstruction is a more aggressive approach with less available literature. Which method gives the best results is unclear. The purpose of this study is to compare single and two-stage techniques.\nThe authors carried out a retrospective multicentric cohort study to compare two primary outcomes (bone union and infection healing) in one versus two-stage reconstructions with vascularized bone flaps in 23 cases of limb osteomyelitis (22 patients, 23 extremities). Thirteen subjects (56.5%) sustained a single-stage treatment consisting of a single surgery of radical debridement, concomitant soft tissue coverage, and bone reconstruction. Ten cases (43.5%) sustained a two-stage approach: radical debridement, simultaneous primary soft tissue closure, and antibiotic PMMA spacers implanted in 7 patients.\nNo statistical differences were observed between one- and two-stage approaches in bone union rate and infection recurrence risk. Even though bone union seems to be higher and faster in the two-stage than in the one-stage group, and all infection relapses occurred in the one-stage group, data did not statistically confirm these differences. Two of the six cases (33.3%) of bone nonunion occurred in compromised hosts (representing only 17.4% of our sample). The B-hosts bone union rate was 50.0%, while it reached 78.9% in A-hosts, but the difference was not statistically significant (p\u2009=\u2009.5392). Infection recurrence was higher in B-hosts than in A-hosts (p\u2009=\u2009.0086) and in Pseudomonas aeruginosa sustained infections (p\u2009=\u2009.0208), but in the latter case, the treatment strategy did not influence the outcome (p\u2009=\u2009.4000).\nBone union and infection healing rates are comparable between one and two-stage approaches. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections have a higher risk of infection relapse, with similar effectiveness of one- and two-stage strategies. B-hosts have a higher infection recurrence rate without comparable data between the two approaches.

Exploring the role of circRNAs in breast cancer (BC) enables us to understand the development mechanism of BC more comprehensively. Here, we screened out and verified an up-regulated circRNA in BC from GEO data. Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that circ_0065214 had a high expression level in BC patients. Besides, circ_0065214 had good diagnostic value in BC serum, and the area under the diagnostic curve, sensitivity and specificity were 0.78, 0.63 and 0.85, respectively. The combined application of circ_0065214 with CEA and CA-153 can further improve the diagnostic efficiency. The knockdown of circ_0065214 in vivo and in vitro inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of BC, but promoted autophagy. At last, dual-luciferase reporter assay and rescue assays revealed that circ_0065214 acted as a decoy to adsorb miR-188-3p, and then relieved the repressive effect of miR-188-3p on its target GPNMB. Our results demonstrated that circ_0065214 regulated the expression of GPNMB by competitively binding to miR-188-3p, thus promoting the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and inhibiting autophagy.

This requires coordinated mobilization of osteoblast precursors with blood vessels. In adult bone, vessel-adjacent osteoblast precursors are maintained by mechanical stimuli; however, the mechanisms by which these cells mobilize and respond to mechanical cues during embryonic development are unknown. Here, we show that the mechanoresponsive transcriptional regulators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) spatially couple osteoblast precursor mobilization to angiogenesis, regulate vascular morphogenesis to control cartilage remodeling, and mediate mechanoregulation of embryonic murine osteogenesis. Mechanistically, YAP and TAZ regulate a subset of osteoblast-lineage cells, identified by single-cell RNA sequencing as vessel-associated osteoblast precursors, which regulate transcriptional programs that direct blood vessel invasion through collagen-integrin interactions and Cxcl12. Functionally, in 3D human cell co-culture, CXCL12 treatment rescues angiogenesis impaired by stromal cell YAP/TAZ depletion.

Postoperative acuities were 20/20 and 20/25 in the right and left eyes, respectively. When his left eye progressed with loss of central acuity despite peak intraocular pressures (IOPs) in the middle to upper teens, neuro-ophthalmology consultation was obtained (Figure 1JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202401000-00017/figure1/v/2023-12-22T124801Z/r/image-tiff). That workup included magnetic resonance imaging scan and hematologic screening, but all results were negative, and the neuro-ophthalmic consultant concluded that the vision loss was likely on the basis of glaucoma. Accordingly, a trabeculectomy was performed in the left eye achieving consistent IOPs in the range of 7 to 10 mm Hg without medications, rending the left eye stable since the filtration surgery nearly 2 years previously. The right eye continued to progress both subjectively and objectively, and on recent examination, the IOP measured 20 mm Hg and 09 mm Hg in the right and left eyes, respectively (Figure 2JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202401000-00017/figure2/v/2023-12-22T124801Z/r/image-tiff).

To maintain the function of transplanted islets in vivo, it is imperative to induce angiogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying angiogenesis triggered by islets remain unclear. In this study, we introduced a microphysiological system to study the angiogenic capacity and dynamics of individual islets. The system, which features an open-top structure, uniquely facilitates the inoculation of islets and the longitudinal observation of vascular formation in in vivo like microenvironment with islet-endothelial cell communication. By leveraging our system, we discovered notable islet-islet heterogeneity in the angiogenic capacity. Transcriptomic analysis of the vascularized islets revealed that islets with high angiogenic capacity exhibited upregulation of genes related to insulin secretion and downregulation of genes related to angiogenesis and fibroblasts. In conclusion, our microfluidic approach is effective in characterizing the vascular formation of individual islets and holds great promise for elucidating the angiogenic mechanisms that enhance islet transplantation therapy.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2023-12-22", "authors": ["YujiNashimoto", "AnKonno", "TakutoImaizumi", "KaoriNishikawa", "KosukeIno", "TakeshiHori", "HirokazuKaji", "HirofumiShintaku", "MasafumiGoto", "HitoshiShiku"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.28631"}

Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) and decellularized bone matrix (DBM) are natural scaffolds for tissue regeneration. The microcarrier scaffolds enable better vascularization and cell proliferation. This study compared the effect of microcarrier forms of DBM and ADM-loaded with adipose stem cells (ASCs) in the repair of compact bone defect in-vivo.\nFifty-four male rats were divided into 4 groups; (i) Group (Gp) I: sham control; (ii) GpII: underwent femur bone defect induction and left to heal spontaneously; (iii) GpIII (ADM-Gp): included 2 subgroups; IIIa and IIIb: the bone defects were filled with non-loaded ADM and ADM-loaded with ASCs, respectively; (iv) GpIV (DBM-Gp): included 2 subgroups; IVa and IVb: the bone defects were filled with non-loaded DBM and DBM-loaded with ASCs, respectively. Animals were euthanized after 1, 2 and 3 months and their femur sections were stained with H&E, Masson's trichrome and immunohistochemistry for CD31, osteopontin and osteocalcin.\nHistological analysis illustrated limited bone regeneration in the cortical defect of GpII after 3 months. The histomorphometric analysis showed significant delayed mature collagen deposition as well as CD31, osteopontin and osteocalcin expression. Superior capacity of new bone regeneration was detected with bio-scaffold micro-carriers; loaded or non-loaded with ASCs. However, DBM-loaded with ASCs displayed enhanced regeneration properties confirmed by the apparently normal architecture of the new bone and accelerated expression of CD31, osteopontin and osteocalcin in the regenerated bone after 3 months.\nWe concluded that decellularized scaffolds significantly improved compact bone regeneration with superiority of ASCs seeded-bone scaffolds.", "journal": "Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft", "date": "2023-12-22", "authors": ["Alshaymaa GamalAboulkhair", "Asmaa AAboZeid", "Hanan HassanBeherei", "Samaa SamirKamar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aanat.2023.152203"}

Biological alternatives require prolonged restrictions on weight-bearing and have high rates of infection, nonunion, and fracture. A novel method of utilizing a vascularized fibula in combination with an intercalary prosthesis was developed to complement the immediate stability of the prosthesis with the long-term biological fixation of a vascularized fibular graft.\nA prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients who underwent reconstruction of an oncological intercalary femoral defect using an intercalary prosthesis and an inline fibular free flap (FFF). They were compared with patients who underwent femoral reconstruction using an intercalary allograft and an FFF.\nFemoral reconstruction with an intercalary metal prosthesis and an FFF was performed in 8 patients, and reconstruction with an allograft and an FFF was performed in 16 patients. The mean follow-up was 5.3 years and 8.5 years, respectively (p = 0.02). In the bioprosthetic group, radiographic union of the fibula occurred in 7 (88%) of 8 patients, whereas in the allograft group, 13 (81%) of 16 patients had allograft union (p = 1.00) and all 16 patients had fibular union (p = 0.33). The mean time to fibular union in the bioprosthetic group was 9.0 months, whereas in the allograft group, the mean time to allograft union was 15.3 months (p = 0.03) and the mean time to fibular union was 12.5 months (p = 0.42).

Prophylactic lymphedema surgery (PLS) has previously demonstrated promising results in reducing secondary lymphedema in breast cancer and urogenital cancer patients. We conducted a study to adapt this principle for patients with lower-extremity sarcomas.\nInclusion criteria included patients with tumors on the medial aspect of the thigh and leg and tumor size larger than 5\u00a0cm. Group A (19 patients) comprised a prospective cohort (2020-2023) in which a PLS protocol was executed. Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) was performed when lymphatic channels were interrupted due to tumor resection, intraoperatively verified by indocyanine green. Lymph node transfer was employed exclusively in cases involving preoperative radiotherapy and inguinal lymph node resection. Measurements were collected both preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Group B (26 patients) constituted a retrospective cohort (2017-2020) without PLS reconstruction, where the prevalence of lymphedema was determined.\nIn total, we enrolled 45 patients with soft tissue sarcomas located on the inner aspect of the thigh and leg (26 in the control group vs. 19 in the prophylactic group). In the control group, lymphedema was observed in 10 out of 27 patients (37.04%). In the prophylactic group, two patients exhibited signs of lower-extremity lymphedema (2/19, 10.52%) with a median follow-up of 14.15 months (6 months-33months), demonstrating statistically significant differences between the two groups (p = 0.02931).\nPLS for lower limb soft tissue sarcomas shows promising results, although it is premature to reach solid conclusions.

{"title": "Direct thrombin inhibitors fail to reverse the negative effects of heparin on lung growth and function after murine left pneumonectomy.", "abstract": "Neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) frequently require cardiopulmonary bypass and systemic anticoagulation. We previously demonstrated that even subtherapeutic heparin impairs lung growth and function in a murine model of compensatory lung growth (CLG). The direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) bivalirudin and argatroban preserved growth in this model. Although DTIs are increasingly used for systemic anticoagulation clinically, patients with CDH may still receive heparin. In this experiment, lung endothelial cell proliferation was assessed following treatment with heparin-alone or mixed with increasing concentrations of bivalirudin or argatroban. The effects of subtherapeutic heparin with or without DTIs in the CLG model were also investigated. C57BL/6J mice underwent left pneumonectomy and subcutaneous implantation of osmotic pumps. Pumps were preloaded with normal saline, bivalirudin, or argatroban; treated animals received daily intraperitoneal low-dose heparin. In vitro, heparin-alone decreased endothelial cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The effect of heparin on proliferation, but not apoptosis, was reversed by the addition of bivalirudin and argatroban. In vivo, low-dose heparin decreased lung volume compared with saline-treated controls. All three groups that received heparin demonstrated decreased lung function on pulmonary function testing and impaired exercise performance on treadmill tolerance testing. These findings correlated with decreases in alveolarization, vascularization, angiogenic signaling, and gene expression in the heparin-exposed groups. Together, these data suggest that bivalirudin and argatroban fail to reverse the inhibitory effects of subtherapeutic heparin on lung growth and function. Clinical studies on the impact of low-dose heparin with DTIs on CDH outcomes are warranted.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Generation of porcine endometrial organoids and their use as a model for enhancing embryonic attachment and elongation.", "abstract": "Porcine endometrial organoids (EOs) were isolated and characterized, revealing distinctive features such as unique extracellular matrix formation, fusion into uterine bud-like structures, and facilitation of embryo elongation. The yield of EOs was significantly enhanced by cryopreservation medium supplemented with the rock inhibitor (Y-27632), resulting in reduced expression of apoptotic mRNAs and microRNAs.\nEndometrial organoids (EOs) are acceptable models for understanding maternal-embryonic cross talk. This study was conducted to generate EOs and optimize their cryopreservation and provide coculture modeling with embryos. The endometrial tissues were used for culturing the organoids inside domes of Matrigel\u00ae. To improve the long-term storage of EOs, 10 \u00b5M ROCK inhibitor (RI) was added to the cryopreservation medium. Day 7 parthenogenetically activated embryos were cocultured with EOs or EO outgrowths, and embryonic cell numbers and embryo attachment were monitored. Spherical EOs 100-300 \u00b5m in size can be retrieved on day 7 of culture, and larger EOs, approximately 1.5 mm in diameter, can be maintained in the Matrigel\u00ae dome for 21 days. The nuclear expression of Ki67 indicates that more than 80% of EOs nuclei were proliferative. EOs exhibit unique novel characters such as formation of extracellular matrix and ability for fusion. RI increased the yield and quality of organoids after freezing or thawing. The cell number of cocultured embryos increased five-fold, and the proportion of trophoblast outgrowths increased seven-fold compared with those of control embryos. The embryos cultured with EO-conditioned medium showed a better attachment rate than the other models, and - for the first time - we report embryonic elongation. Immunofluorescence staining of the attached embryos showed CDX2 in the periphery of EOs outgrowths. The 3D assembly and cryopreservation of EOs was optimized, and EO coculture supported embryo attachment, trophoblast outgrowth, and elongation, which would provide a valuable tool for studying the intricate processes involved in porcine embryo implantation.", "journal": "Reproduction (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2023-12-19", "authors": ["Islam MSaadeldin", "AyeongHan", "SeonggyuBang", "HeejaeKang", "HeyyoungKim", "Mariam MAbady", "Ji-SeonJeong", "Ha-JeongKwon", "SanghoonLee", "JongkiCho"], "doi": "10.1530/REP-23-0429"}

Among 3D biomaterials, hydrogels and hydrogel composites have been explored for bone regeneration, however, their inferior clinical performance in comparison to autografts is mainly attributed to variable rates of degradation and lack of vascularization. In this study, we report hydrogel composite magnetic scaffolds formed from calcium carbonate, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), using PVA as matrix and calcium carbonate particles in vaterite phase as filler, to enhance the cross-linking of matrix and porosity with MNPs that can target and regulate cell signaling pathways to control cell behavior and improve the osteogenic and angiogenic potential. The physical and mechanical properties were evaluated, and cytocompatibility was investigated by culturing human osteoblast-like cells onto the scaffolds. The vaterite phase due to its higher solubility in comparison to calcium phosphates, combined with the freezing-thawing process of PVA, yielded porous scaffolds that exhibited adequate thermal stability, favorable water-absorbing capacity, excellent mineralization ability, and cytocompatibility. An increasing concentration from 1, 3, and 6 wt % MNPs in the scaffolds showed a statistically significant increase in compressive strength and modulus of the dry specimens that exhibited brittle fracture.

PBM holds significant promise for bone tissue applications due to its non-invasive nature and ability to stimulate cellular activity and vascularization within the healing framework. Notwithstanding, the impact of PBM on bone functionality remains largely undisclosed, particularly in the absence of influencing factors such as pathologies or regenerative therapies. This study aims to investigate the potential effects of PBM using red (660\u00a0nm) (RED) and near-infrared (808\u00a0nm) (NIR) wavelengths within an ex vivo bone culture system - the organotypic embryonic chicken femur model. A continuous irradiation mode was used, administering a total energy dose of 1.0\u00a0J, at an intensity of 100\u00a0mW for 10\u00a0s, which was repeated four times over the course of the 11-day culture period. The primary focus is on characterizing the expression of pivotal osteoblastic genes, the maturation and deposition of collagen, and the formation of bone mineral. Exposing femora to both RED and NIR wavelengths led to a notable increase in the expression of osteochondrogenic transcription factors (i.e., SOX9 and RUNX2), correlating with enhanced mineralization. Notably, NIR irradiation further elevated the expression of bone matrix-related genes and fostered enhanced deposition and maturation of fibrillar collagen. This study demonstrates that PBM has the potential to enhance osteogenic functionality within a translational organotypic bone culture system, with the NIR wavelength showing remarkable capabilities in augmenting the formation and maturation of the collagenous matrix.", "journal": "Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy", "date": "2023-12-18", "authors": ["Guilherme SilvaFurtado", "VictorMartin", "RitaAra\u00fajo", "Pedro SousaGomes", "Andr\u00e9a Dias NevesLago"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pdpdt.2023.103936"}
{"title": "Evaluation of tissue blood supply during esophagectomy using fluorescent diagnostics and diffuse scattering spectroscopy in visible region.", "abstract": "The success of the surgical treatment of a tumor or obstruction of the esophagus with subsequent anastomosis application depends on the level of blood supply to the stitched tissues. Intraoperative assessment of blood flow is widely used in medicine and can be used as a diagnostic method that affects the outcome of surgery and reduces the frequency of postoperative complications for the patient.\nIn this work, the assessment of blood supply during esophageal resection operations was carried out using two techniques sequentially: fluorescent diagnostics with indocyanine green and measurement of hemoglobin oxygen saturation by diffuse scattering spectroscopy in the visible wavelength range. The first method was used to assess the integrity of the vascular network structure in the area of anastomosis and blood flow through the sutured tissues, the second one - for local assessment of hemoglobin oxygen saturation in the investigated area.\nConducted clinical study involved the participation of nine patients with malignant neoplasms (six cases) or esophageal obstruction (three cases). The presence of postoperative complications was compared with the measurement results. Anastomosis failure was observed in only one patient. According to the results of the study, with the use of the investigated method of assessing blood supply, there is a tendency towards a decrease in the frequency of anastomosis leaks (11.1\u00a0% compared with 21.4\u00a0%).\nTherefore, fluorescent diagnostics with indocyanine green and measurement of hemoglobin oxygen saturation using diffuse scattering spectroscopy were affirmed as methods that allow increasing the safety of surgical procedures by assessing the risk of postoperative complications, including anastomosis failures.", "journal": "Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy", "date": "2023-12-17", "authors": ["Anna AKrivetskaya", "Daniil MKustov", "Vladimir VLevkin", "Sergey VOsminin", "Sergey SKharnas", "Evgenia VEventeva", "Fedor PVetshev", "Roman NKomarov", "Kirill GLinkov", "Tatiana ASavelieva", "Victor BLoschenov"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pdpdt.2023.103937"}

In this contribution, we explore\u00a0the osteohistology of its appendicular bones and a rib, aiming to infer growth patterns and ontogeny. In all analyzed bones (except in the rib) from three individuals, we found fibrolamellar bone (FLB) throughout the cortices, a pattern shared with other histologically sampled basal loricatans. We found evidence that suggests an early ontogenetic stage for all studied specimens: absence of secondary osteons, lack of transition from an inner highly vascularized FLB matrix to a poor vascularized parallel-fibred bone, one line of arrested growth, open vascular canals in the external surface of the cortex and absence of an external fundamental system. In addition, we observed that the neurocentral sutures in the caudal to cervical vertebrae of the holotype are unfused, strongly suggesting that these individuals were not skeletally mature, as had been previously assumed. In addition, our data support the prior hypothesis that Decuriasuchus is the oldest-known archosaur to show evidence of gregarious behavior and adds a probable cause of this as a strategy to obtain food and avoid predation until becoming independent as adults. Furthermore, our results open the possibility that Decuriasuchus may represent an earlier growth stage of the larger Prestosuchus chiniquensis, with two specimens recovered from the same stratigraphic level and paleontological site. Since the adult form of Decuriasuchus remains unknown, a deeper anatomical study is needed to discuss the validity of the species.

The lack of clinically efficacious treatments to treat these recalcitrant wounds can lead to amputations for those worst affected. Biomaterial-based approaches offer great hope in this regard, as they provide a template for cell infiltration and tissue repair. However, there is an additional need to treat the underlying pathophysiology of DFUs, in particular insufficient vascularization of the wound which significantly hampers healing. Thus, the addition of pro-angiogenic moieties to biomaterials is a promising strategy to promote the healing of DFUs and other chronic wounds.

The aim of the Transfer of Thoracic Aortic Vascular Emergencies to Regional Specialist INstitutes Group study was to establish an interdisciplinary consensus on the interhospital transfer of patients with AAS to specialist high-volume aortic centres.\nConsensus on the key aspects of interhospital transfer of patients with AAS was established using the Delphi method, in line with Conducting and Reporting of Delphi Studies guidelines. A national patient charity for aortic dissection was involved in the design of the Delphi study. Vascular and cardiothoracic surgeons, emergency physicians, interventional radiologists, cardiologists, intensivists and anaesthetists in the United Kingdom were invited to participate via their respective professional societies.\nThree consecutive rounds of an electronic Delphi survey were completed by 212, 101 and 58 respondents, respectively. Using predefined consensus criteria, 60 out of 117 (51%) statements from the survey were included in the consensus statement. The study concluded that patients can be taken directly to a specialist aortic centre if they have typical symptoms of AAS on the background of known aortic disease or previous aortic intervention. Accepted patients should be transferred in a category 2 ambulance (response time <18\u2009min), ideally accompanied by transfer-trained personnel or Adult Critical Care Transfer Services. A clear plan should be agreed in case of a cardiac arrest occurring during the transfer. Patients should reach the aortic centre within 4\u2009hours of the initial referral from their local hospital.\nThis consensus statement is the first set of national interdisciplinary recommendations on the interhospital transfer of patients with AAS.

URP20 is an antimicrobial peptide that has been proven to treat bacterial keratitis in rats through antibacterial and anti-NV effects. Therefore, in this study, the protective effect and influence mechanism of URP20 were explored in a rat model of alkali burn together with pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) infection. In addition, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) were selected to verify the effects of URP20 on vascularization and oxidative stress. The results showed that URP20 treatment could protect corneal tissue, reduce corneal turbidity, and reduce the NV pathological score. Furthermore, URP20 significantly inhibited the expression of the vascularization marker proteins VEGFR2 and CD31. URP20 also reduced the migration ability of HUVECs.

The Masquelet-induced membrane technique involves placing a cement spacer in the defect to create a biologically active membrane. In the second stage, the gold standard for filling the defect is an autologous cancellous bone graft of 1-2\u00a0mm in size. This study aims to examine the effects of using a non-vascularized fibula as a support combined with a cancellous graft in the Masquelet technique for treating compound fractures of the distal femur.\nThe study was conducted between December 2017 and December 2020 and included 11 patients who underwent the Masquelet technique. The procedure involved a lateral locked plate and an antibiotic-impregnated bone cement spacer, followed by a 20-30\u00a0mm longer ipsilateral fibula used as a strut graft. The remaining area was filled with cancellous bone from the iliac crest. The size of the defect, Time to the bony union, the average range of motion of the knee, and any complications are analysed. The final evaluation was done at 18 months using the Lower Extremity functional scale to assess functional outcomes.\nThe study included 11 patients (8 male and 3 female) with a mean age of 45.8 years. The average time to bony union was 6.6 months, and the average range of motion of the knee was 2.2\u00b0 to 93.3 \u00b0 (0-110\u00a0\u00b0). No complications such as infection, non-union, or implant failure were observed.\nThe Masquelet Technique combined with a fibular strut graft is a feasible solution for complex distal femur fractures with bone loss.

Because of their overlapping features, the accurate diagnosis and classification of these tumors are often challenging. Herein, we report two unique cases of SMARCB1/INI1-deficient soft tissue neoplasm with epithelioid and myxoid features occurring in male paratesticular region. The first case was a 52-year-old man presented with an intermittent painful left paratesticular mass for 1\u00a0year. The second case was a 41-year-old man presented with a painless paratesticular mass on the right side for 3\u00a0months. Both patients underwent an orchiectomy. After 6 and 26\u00a0months of follow-up, both were alive with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis. In both cases, the tumor was relatively well-demarcated and showed monomorphic round to epithelioid cells arranged in a nested, trabecular, reticular, and corded pattern, setting in a myxohyalinized and vascularized matrix. The tumor cells showed relatively uniform round nuclei with vesicular chromatin and variably prominent nucleoli. No rhabdoid cells were identified. Mitoses numbered 3 and 2 per 10 high-power fields. Tumor necrosis or lymphovascular invasion was absent. Immunohistochemically, both tumors expressed epithelial membrane antigen (focal), calponin (focal), and CD99. SMARCB1/INI1 expression was deficient in both cases. In addition, case 1 diffusely expressed pan-cytokeratin, and case 2 diffusely expressed CD34 and synaptophysin. Molecular genetically, case 1 showed SMARCB1 homozygous deletion as detected by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and case 2 demonstrated SMARCB1 copy number deletions by next-generation sequencing and SMARCB1 monoallelic deletion by FISH. Both cases lacked EWSR1 rearrangements by FISH. The overall clinicopathologic profiles of the two cases made it difficult to classify them as one of the established categories of SMARCB1/INI1-deficient mesenchymal tumors.

The Kono-S anastomosis was designed to exclude the mesentery from a wide anastomotic lumen, limit luminal distortion and fecal stasis, and preserve innervation and vascularization.\nTo review postoperative complications and long-term outcomes of the Kono-S anastomosis in a large series of consecutive unselected patients with Crohn's disease.\nRetrospective study of prospectively collected patients.\nFour tertiary referral centers.\nConsecutive patients with Crohn's disease who underwent resection with Kono-S anastomosis between May 2010 and June 2022.\nExtracorporeal handsewn Kono-S anastomosis.\nPostoperative outcomes and recurrence defined as endoscopic, clinical, laboratory, or surgical, including endoscopic, intervention.\nA total of 262 consecutive patients (53.4% male) were included. The mean duration of disease at surgery was 145.1 months. One hundred thirty-five patients (51.5%) had previous abdominal surgery for Crohn's disease. Forty-four patients (17%) were actively smoking and 150 (57.3%) were on biologic therapy. Anastomotic failure occurred in 4 (1.5%), with 2 patients requiring reoperation (0.7%). Sixteen patients had postoperative surgical site infection (6.1%). With a median follow-up of 49.4 months, 20 patients (7.6%) were found to have surgical recurrence. In the multivariate analysis, perianal disease (OR = 2.83, p = 0.001), urgent/emergent surgery (OR = 3.23, p = 0.007), and postoperative use of steroids (OR = 2.29, p = 0.025) were associated with increased risk of overall recurrence.\nRetrospective study and variability of perioperative medical therapy.\nThis study showed very low postoperative complication rates despite the complexity of the patient population. There was a low rate of surgical recurrence, likely due to the intrinsic advantages of the anastomotic configuration and the low rate of postoperative septic complications. In experienced hands, the Kono-S anastomosis is a safe technique with very promising short- and long-term results. Randomized controlled trials are underway to validate this study's findings. See Video Abstract .\nANTECEDENTES:La recurrencia posoperatoria sigue siendo un problema importante en la enfermedad de Crohn y el mesenterio est\u00e1 implicado en la fisiopatolog\u00eda. La anastomosis Kono-S fue dise\u00f1ada para excluir el mesenterio de una anastomosis amplia, limitar la distorsi\u00f3n luminal y la estasis fecal y preservar la inervaci\u00f3n y vascularizaci\u00f3n.OBJETIVO:Revisar las complicaciones posoperatorias y los resultados a largo plazo de la anastomosis Kono-S en una gran serie de pacientes consecutivos no seleccionados con enfermedad de Crohn.DISE\u00d1O:Estudio retrospectivo de pacientes recolectados prospectivamente.ESCENARIO:Cuatro centros de referencia terciarios.PACIENTES:Pacientes consecutivos con enfermedad de Crohn sometidos a resecci\u00f3n con anastomosis Kono-S entre mayo de 2010 y junio de 2022.INTERVENCIONES:Anastomosis Kono-S extracorp\u00f3rea manual.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:Resultados posoperatorios y recurrencia definidos como endosc\u00f3picos, cl\u00ednicos, de laboratorio o quir\u00fargicos, incluida la intervenci\u00f3n endosc\u00f3pica.RESULTADOS:Se incluyeron un total de 262 pacientes consecutivos (53,4% varones). La duraci\u00f3n media de la enfermedad al momento de la cirug\u00eda fue de 145,1 meses. Ciento treinta y cinco pacientes (51,5%) hab\u00edan tenido cirug\u00eda abdominal previa por enfermedad de Crohn. Cuarenta y cuatro pacientes (17%) eran fumadores activos y 150 (57,3%) estaban en tratamiento biol\u00f3gico. Se produjo filtraci\u00f3n anastom\u00f3tica en 4 (1,5%) y 2 pacientes requirieron reoperaci\u00f3n (0,7%). Diecis\u00e9is pacientes tuvieron infecci\u00f3n postoperatoria del sitio quir\u00fargico (6,1%). Con una mediana de seguimiento de 49,4 meses, se encontr\u00f3 que 20 pacientes (7,6%) tuvieron recurrencia quir\u00fargica. En el an\u00e1lisis multivariado, la enfermedad perianal (OR = 2,83, p = 0,001), la cirug\u00eda urgente/emergente (OR = 3,23, p = 0,007), el uso postoperatorio de esteroides (OR = 2,29, p = 0,025) se asociaron con un mayor riesgo de recurrencia general.LIMITACI\u00d3N:Estudio retrospectivo. Variabilidad del tratamiento m\u00e9dico perioperatorio.CONCLUSIONES:Nuestro estudio mostr\u00f3 tasas de complicaciones postoperatorias muy bajas a pesar de la complejidad de la poblaci\u00f3n de pacientes. Hubo una baja tasa de recurrencia quir\u00fargica, probablemente debido a las ventajas intr\u00ednsecas de la configuraci\u00f3n anastom\u00f3tica y la baja tasa de complicaciones s\u00e9pticas posoperatorias. En manos experimentadas, la anastomosis Kono-S es una t\u00e9cnica segura con resultados muy prometedores a corto y largo plazo.

Such concentroids consisted of a pro-angiogenic core, containing neuronal and outer radial glia cells, surrounded by an astroglia-dense outer layer. Incorporating PSC-derived endothelial cells (EC) around and/or in the concentroids promoted vascularization, accompanied by differential outgrowth and differentiation of neuronal and astroglia cells, as well as the development of ectodermal-derived pericyte-like mural cells co-localizing with EC networks. Single nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed an enhanced neural cell subtype maturation and diversity in EC-containing concentroids, which better resemble the fetal human brain compared to classical organoids or NPC-only concentroids.

Among GTD is the gestational choriocarcinoma (CC), which is a highly malignant gestational trophoblastic tumor that causes high mortality without timely treatment. The incidence of CC is about 1 in 50,000 pregnancies in developed countries and even higher in developing countries. CC developed from molar pregnancies exhibits even higher incidence rates (3-20 in 1000 pregnancies). In the present invention, we developed the first orthotopic animal model of CC. We demonstrate how to mimic the development of this cancer and observe rapid metastasis, which is seen in CC patients, by injecting the luciferase-positive JEG-3 (JEG-3-Luc) cells directly in the placenta of gravid SCID mice. Gravid mice were injected at 7.5\u00a0days post coitus (dpc) and followed throughout gestation to assess the parameters of CC development and metastasis. Mice imaged at day 19.5\u00a0dpc showed placental tumor development and large sites of metastases in the liver, spleen, lung, and peritoneum. This finding emphasizes the importance of placental vascularization in the rapid dissemination of tumor cells. Morphological analyses and histopathological examinations were performed to confirm JEG-3 cell dissemination in different organs of the gravid mice.

However, the extensive use of antibiotics has limited local antibacterial effects at the infection site and is prone to side effects. In order to address the issue of bacterial infection during the transplantation of bone implants, four types of bone scaffold implants with long-term antimicrobial functionality have been constructed, including direct contact antimicrobial scaffold, dissolution-penetration antimicrobial scaffold, photocatalytic antimicrobial scaffold, and multimodal synergistic antimicrobial scaffold. The direct contact antimicrobial scaffold involves the physical penetration or disruption of bacterial cell membranes by the scaffold surface or hindrance of bacterial adhesion through surface charge, microstructure, and other factors. The dissolution-penetration antimicrobial scaffold releases antimicrobial substances from the scaffold's interior through degradation and other means to achieve local antimicrobial effects. The photocatalytic antimicrobial scaffold utilizes the absorption of light to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) with enhanced chemical reactivity for antimicrobial activity. ROS can cause damage to bacterial cell membranes, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), proteins, and other components. The multimodal synergistic antimicrobial scaffold involves the combined use of multiple antimicrobial methods to achieve synergistic effects and effectively overcome the limitations of individual antimicrobial approaches.

One hypothesis is that changes in immune cells observed in adenomyosis-affected uteri may alter fertility, notably the physiological immune environment necessary for successful implantation and a healthy pregnancy.\nRandomly selected CD-1 female neonatal pups were orally dosed by administration of tamoxifen to induce adenomyosis (TAM group), while others received solvent only (control group). From 6\u2009weeks of life, CD-1 mice of both groups were mated to study impaired fertility and related local and/or systemic immune cell changes during the early implantation period.\nTo evaluate fertility and pregnancy outcomes, ultrasound imaging was performed at E (embryonic day) 7.5 and E11.5 to count the number of gestational sacs and the number of resorptions in eight mice of the TAM group and 16 mice of the control group. The mice were sacrificed at E18.5, and morphometric, functional (quantitative reverse transcription PCR; RT-qPCR), and histological analyses were performed on the placentas. To identify local and/or systemic immune changes during the early implantation period, 8 mice of the TAM group and 12 mice of the control group were sacrificed at E4.5. Uterine horns and spleens were collected for flow cytometry and RT-qPCR analyses to study the immune cell populations. To investigate the profile of the cytokines secreted during the early implantation period at the systemic level, supernatants from stimulated spleen cells were analyzed by multiplex immunoassay analysis.\nBy ultrasound imaging, we observed a lower number of implantation sites (P\u2009<\u20090.005) and a higher number of resorptions (P\u2009<\u20090.001) in the TAM group, leading to smaller litters (average number of fetuses per litter: 1.00 [0.00; 5.25] in the TAM group versus 12.00 [9.50; 13.75] in the control group (P\u2009<\u20090.001).

In the TAM group, the percentages of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DC) were significantly decreased in the uterus around the implantation period. However, the number of M1 macrophages was increased. Both macrophages and DC had an increased activation profile (higher expression of MCHII, P\u2009=\u20090.012; CD80, P\u2009=\u20090.015; CCR7, P\u2009=\u20090.043 for macrophages, and higher expression of CD206, P\u2009=\u20090.018; CXCR4, P\u2009=\u20090.010; CCR7, P\u2009=\u20090.006, MCHII, P\u2009=\u20090.010; and CD80, P\u2009=\u20090.012 for DC).

{"title": "Enhancement of mitochondrial energy metabolism by melatonin promotes vascularized skeletal muscle regeneration in a volumetric muscle loss model.", "abstract": "Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is a condition that results in the extensive loss of 20\u00a0% or more of skeletal muscle due to trauma or tumor ablation, leading to severe functional impairment and permanent disability. The current surgical interventions have limited functional regeneration of skeletal muscle due to the compromised self-repair mechanism. Melatonin has been reported to protect skeletal muscle from exercise-induced oxidative damage and holds great potential to treat muscle diseases. In this study, we hypothesize that melatonin can enhance myoblast differentiation and promote effective recovery of skeletal muscle following VML. In vitro administration of melatonin resulted in a significant enhancement of myogenesis in C2C12 myoblast cells, as evidenced by the up-regulation of myogenic marker genes in a dose-dependent manner. Further experiments revealed that silent information of regulator type 3 (SIRT3) played a critical role in the melatonin-enhanced myoblast differentiation through enhancement of mitochondrial energy metabolism and activation of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Silencing of Sirt3 completely abrogated the protective effect of melatonin on the mitochondrial function of myoblasts, evidenced by the increased reactive oxygen species, decreased adenosine triphosphate production, and down-regulated myoblast-specific marker gene expression. In order to attain a protracted and consistent release, liposome-encapsuled melatonin was integrated into gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel (GelMA-Lipo@MT). The implantation of GelMA-Lipo@MT into a tibialis anterior muscle defect in a VML model effectively stimulated the formation of myofibers and new blood vessels in situ, while concurrently inhibiting fibrotic collagen deposition. The findings of this study indicate that the incorporation of melatonin with GelMA hydrogel has facilitated the de novo vascularized skeletal muscle regeneration by augmenting mitochondrial energy metabolism. This represents a promising approach for the development of skeletal muscle tissue engineering, which could be utilized for the treatment of VML and other severe muscle injuries.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2023-11-27", "authors": ["XiaoyangGe", "ChengyueWang", "GuanyuYang", "DimulatiMaimaiti", "MingzhuangHou", "HaoLiu", "HuilinYang", "XiChen", "YongXu", "FanHe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2023.11.021"}

Given the complex microenvironment of diabetic wounds and the high prevalence of diabetes, the design and development of novel wound dressing materials with versatile capabilities is urgent. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human umbilical cord blood have demonstrated the potential to counter inflammation and accelerate wound healing. Herein, we explored the efficacy of incorporating human umbilical cord blood-derived exosomes (UCB-Exos) into an ABA-type amphiphilic hydrogel, which possesses the attributes of exosome (Exo) encapsulation, temperature-triggered reversible sol-gel conversion, and Exo-regulated release, for enhancing the stability and retention of Exos. We sought to examine the feasibility of this strategy in augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of UCB-Exos for the healing of diabetes-related wounds. The injectable hydrogel was conveniently applied directly onto the wound surface and the enclosed Exo significantly facilitated the healing process, resulting in faster wound closure, enhanced collagen deposition, accelerated re-epithelialization, and enhanced neo-vascularization within two weeks compared with the hydrogel-only treatment group.

Previous work has shown that cells can communicate mechanically via the transmission of cell-generated forces through their surrounding extracellular matrix, but this process is not well understood. Here, mechanically defined, synthetic electrospun fibrous matrices are utilized in conjunction with a microfabrication-based cell patterning approach to examine mechanical intercellular communication (MIC) between endothelial cells (ECs) during their assembly into interconnected multicellular networks. It is found that cell force-mediated matrix displacements in deformable fibrous matrices underly directional extension and migration of neighboring ECs toward each other prior to the formation of stable cell-cell connections enriched with vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin). A critical role is also identified for calcium signaling mediated by focal adhesion kinase and mechanosensitive ion channels in MIC that extends to multicellular assembly of 3D vessel-like networks when ECs are embedded within fibrin hydrogels. These results illustrate a role for cell-generated forces and ECM mechanical properties in multicellular assembly of capillary-like EC networks and motivates the design of biomaterials that promote MIC for vascular tissue engineering.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2023-11-24", "authors": ["Christopher DDavidson", "Firaol SMidekssa", "Samuel JDePalma", "Jordan LKamen", "William YWang", "Danica Kristen PJayco", "Megan EWieger", "Brendon MBaker"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202306210"}

While hiPSC-derived 3D CNS organoids hold promise in providing a human-specific platform for studying CNS development and diseases, most of them do not incorporate the full range of implicated cell types, including vascular cell components and microglia, limiting their ability to accurately recreate the CNS environment and their utility in the study of certain aspects of the disease. Here we have developed a novel approach, called vascularized brain assembloids, for constructing hiPSC-derived 3D CNS structures with a higher level of cellular complexity. This is achieved by integrating forebrain organoids with common myeloid progenitors and phenotypically stabilized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (VeraVecs), which can be cultured and expanded in serum-free conditions. Compared with organoids, these assembloids exhibited enhanced neuroepithelial proliferation, advanced astrocytic maturation, and increased synapse numbers. Strikingly, the assembloids derived from hiPSCs harboring the tauP301S mutation exhibited increased levels of total tau and phosphorylated tau, along with a higher proportion of rod-like microglia-like cells and enhanced astrocytic activation, when compared to the assembloids derived from isogenic hiPSCs. Additionally, the tauP301S assembloids showed an altered profile of neuroinflammatory cytokines.

Their lesional and non-lesional skin was comprehensively and non-invasively assessed with standardized 2D-photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), microbial profiling including Malassezia species identification, functional skin barrier assessments and ceramide profiling. The presence of inflammation was established through significant increases in erythema, epidermal thickness, vascularization and superficial roughness in lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin. Lesional skin showed a perturbed skin barrier with an underlying skewed ceramide subclass composition, impaired chain elongation and increased chain unsaturation. Changes in ceramide composition correlated with barrier impairment indicating interdependency of the functional barrier and ceramide composition. Lesional skin showed significantly increased Staphylococcus and decreased Cutibacterium abundances but similar Malassezia abundances and mycobial composition compared to non-lesional skin.

For dual targeting of malignant cells and tumor vascular microenvironment, we designed a multivalent fusion protein SRH-DR5-B-iRGD with antiangiogenic VEGFR2-specific peptide SRH at the N-terminus and a tumor-targeting and -penetrating peptide iRGD at the C-terminus of receptor-selective TRAIL variant DR5-B. SRH-DR5-B-iRGD obtained high affinity for DR5, VEGFR2 and \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin in nanomolar range. Fusion of DR5-B with effector peptides accelerated DR5 receptor internalization rate upon ligand binding. Antitumor efficacy was evaluated in vitro in human tumor cell lines and primary patient-derived glioblastoma neurospheres, and in vivo in xenograft mouse model of human glioblastoma.

{"title": "Extrusion 3D-printing and characterization of poly(caprolactone fumarate) for bone regeneration applications.", "abstract": "Polycaprolactone fumarate (PCLF) is a cross-linkable PCL derivative extensively considered for tissue engineering applications. Although injection molding has been widely used to develop PCLF scaffolds, platforms developed using such technique lack precise control on architecture, design, and porosity required to ensure adequate cellular and tissue responses. In particular, the scaffolds should provide a suitable surface for cell attachment and proliferation, and facilitate cell-cell communication and nutrient flow. 3D printing technologies have led to new architype for biomaterial development with micro-architecture mimicking native tissue. Here, we developed a method for 3D printing of PCLF structures using the extrusion printing technique. The crosslinking property of PCLF enabled the unique post-processing of 3D printed scaffolds resulting in highly porous and flexible PCLF scaffolds with compressive properties imitating natural features of cancellous bone. Generated scaffolds supported excellent attachment and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). The high porosity of PCLF scaffolds facilitated vascularized membrane formation demonstrable with the stringency of the ex ovo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) implantation. Furthermore, upon implantation to rat calvarium defects, PCLF scaffolds enabled an exceptional new bone formation with a bone mineral density of newly formed bone mirroring native bone tissue. These studies suggest that the 3D-printed highly porous PCLF scaffolds may serve as a suitable biomaterial platform to significantly expand the utility of the PCLF biomaterial for bone tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Adipocyte Glucocorticoid Receptor Activation With High Glucocorticoid Doses Impairs Healthy Adipose Tissue Expansion by Repressing Angiogenesis.", "abstract": "In humans, glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly prescribed because of their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. However, high doses of GCs often lead to side effects, including diabetes and lipodystrophy. We recently reported that adipocyte glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-deficient (AdipoGR-KO) mice under corticosterone (CORT) treatment exhibited a massive adipose tissue (AT) expansion associated with a paradoxical improvement of metabolic health compared with control mice. However, whether GR may control adipose development remains unclear. Here, we show a specific induction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression in GR-deficient adipocytes of AdipoGR-KO mice compared with control mice, together with an increased adipose vascular network, as assessed by three-dimensional imaging. GR activation reduced HIF-1\u03b1 recruitment to the Vegfa promoter resulting from Hif-1\u03b1 downregulation at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Importantly, in CORT-treated AdipoGR-KO mice, the blockade of VEGFA by a soluble decoy receptor prevented AT expansion and the healthy metabolic phenotype. Finally, in subcutaneous AT from patients with Cushing syndrome, higher VEGFA expression was associated with a better metabolic profile. Collectively, these results highlight that adipocyte GR negatively controls AT expansion and metabolic health through the downregulation of the major angiogenic effector VEGFA and inhibition of vascular network development.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2023-11-14", "authors": ["AnnaVali", "H\u00e9lo\u00efseDalle", "AlyaLoubaresse", "J\u00e9r\u00f4meGilleron", "EmmanuelleHavis", "MarieGarcia", "CarineBeaup\u00e8re", "Cl\u00e9mentineDenis", "NatachaRoblot", "KarinePoussin", "TatianaLedent", "BenjaminBouillet", "MireilleCormont", "Jean-Fran\u00e7oisTanti", "JacquelineCapeau", "CamilleVatier", "BrunoF\u00e8ve", "AlexandraGrosfeld", "MartheMoldes"], "doi": "10.2337/db23-0165"}

The aims of this study were to investigate the role of vascularisation in proximal duodenal ulceration and describe clinical aspects, endoscopic features and treatment in dogs.\nPolyurethane foam casts of gastroduodenal vessels were obtained from five dogs which had died from disorders unrelated to the digestive system. In addition, 12 dogs having proximal duodenal ulcers diagnosed by endoscopic examination were enrolled in a treatment trial. After the endoscopic diagnosis of a duodenal ulcer, all the dogs were treated medically and, in the absence of resolution, were subsequently treated by endoscopic electrocauterisation or by surgery.\nA submucosal vascular network was evident in all the casts, with a prominent venous plexus seen exclusively in the first half inch of the duodenum. In clinical cases, on endoscopic examination, the duodenal ulcer was located at the proximal part of the duodenum, involving the mesenteric portion of the wall.

Our aim was to shed light on this issue of arterial distribution in candidates for surgery.\nThe study included consecutive patients diagnosed with Goligher grade III and IV haemorrhoids, who had undergone Doppler-guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation (DG-HAL) and rectoanal repair (RAR) at 2 medical centres in Spain. The main objective was to evaluate the number and 12-h clock locations of arterial ligatures necessary to achieve Doppler silence.\nIn total, 146 patients were included: 111 (76%) men, and 35 (24%) women.

This is especially pronounced in lower limb cases, where the soft tissue below the knee is thin. The supra-fascial superficial circumflex iliac perforator (SCIP) flap overcomes this problem, but venous congestion remains a concern. We aim to examine the venous anatomy of the SCIP flap through cadaveric dissections and clinical data analyses to enhance the understanding of the venous anatomy and reduce venous congestion in future procedures.\nEight cadaveric groins underwent venous dye injection and dissection to identify the superficial circumflex iliac vein (SCIV) and venae comitantes (VC) vascular networks. The venous anatomy was studied for dominant drainage. From April 2015 to December 2019, we conducted 102 SCIP flap reconstructions, mainly using the superficial circumflex iliac artery's superficial branch. Clinical data were analyzed and correlated with cadaveric dissections. SCIP flaps were categorized into three groups: dual drainage (VC and SCIV) in group I, SCIV-only in group II, and VC-only in group III.\nCorrelations between clinical cases and cadaveric dissections revealed the SCIV as an independent drainage system with oscillating links to the VC. The SCIV is approximately twice the diameter of the VC, and the area of each vascular network suggests codominance. No significant difference in flap loss or venous congestion rates was noted when SCIV was the sole drainage, compared with VC or dual drainage.\nThe SCIP flap with one artery and SCIV anastomosis, exhibits low venous congestion rates.

{"title": "FAM222A, Part of the BET-Regulated Basal Endothelial Transcriptome, Is a Novel Determinant of Endothelial Biology and Angiogenesis-Brief Report.", "abstract": "BETs (bromodomain and extraterminal domain-containing epigenetic reader proteins), including BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4), orchestrate transcriptional programs induced by pathogenic stimuli, as intensively studied in cardiovascular disease and elsewhere. In endothelial cells (ECs), BRD4 directs induced proinflammatory, proatherosclerotic transcriptional responses; BET inhibitors, like JQ1, repress these effects and decrease atherosclerosis. While BET effects in pathogenic conditions have prompted therapeutic BET inhibitor development, BET action under basal conditions, including ECs, has remained understudied. To understand BET action in basal endothelial transcriptional programs, we first analyzed EC RNA-Seq data in the absence versus presence of JQ1 before using BET regulation to identify novel determinants of EC biology and function.\nRNA-Seq datasets of human umbilical vein ECs without and with JQ1 treatment were analyzed. After identifying C12orf34, also known as FAM222A (family with sequence similarity 222 member A), as a previously unreported, basally expressed, potently JQ1-induced EC gene, FAM222A was studied in endothelial and angiogenic responses in vitro using small-interference RNA silencing and lentiviral overexpression, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, including aortic sprouting, matrigel plug assays, and murine neonatal oxygen-induced retinopathy.\nResting EC RNA-Seq data indicate BETs direct transcriptional programs underlying core endothelial properties including migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis. BET inhibition in resting ECs also significantly induced a subset of mRNAs, including FAM222A-a unique BRD4-regulated gene with no reported EC role. Silencing endothelial FAM222A significantly decreased cellular proliferation, migration, network formation, aorta sprouting, and Matrigel plug vascularization through coordinated modulation of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and NOTCH mediator expression in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo; lentiviral FAM222A overexpression had opposite effects. In vivo, siFAM222A significantly repressed retinal revascularization in neonatal murine oxygen-induced retinopathy through similar angiogenic signaling modulation.\nBET control over the basal endothelial transcriptome includes FAM222A, a novel, BRD4-regulated, key determinant of endothelial biology and angiogenesis.", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "date": "2023-11-09", "authors": ["AspasiaTzani", "StefanHaemmig", "Henry SCheng", "DanielP\u00e9rez-Cremades", "Marina AugustoHeuschkel", "AnuragJamaiyar", "Sasha ASingh", "MasanoriAikawa", "Paul BYu", "TianxiWang", "YeSun", "Mark WFeinberg", "JorgePlutzky"], "doi": "10.1161/ATVBAHA.123.319909"}
{"title": "Sonographic Findings of Vascular Signals for Retained Products of Conception in Women Following First-Trimester Termination of Pregnancy.", "abstract": "To evaluate the occurrence of retained products of conception (RPOC) after termination of pregnancy in the first trimester and to assess the vascular signals with transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) examination in the detection of retained products.\nA retrospective cohort study was performed using TVUS examination in patients following termination of pregnancy. In cases of RPOC, 3 scales of vascular signal were identified: type 1, no or small amount, spot flow signals; type 2, medium amount, strip-like flow signals; type 3, rich amount, circumferential-like flow signals. The correlation between vascular signals and placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) staging was proposed by sonography and histopathology findings.\nThe 3 vascular patterns were differently distributed within non-RPOC as well as RPOC patients with and without PAS: type 1 vascular signal detection rates of non-RPOC and RPOC were 97.8% (262/268) and 28.1% (18/64), respectively. Of 64 cases of RPOC, 48.4% (31/64) of the patients had type 2 vascular signals. Vascular signals were enhanced in RPOC with PAS patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology.\nThe vascularity (amount of flow), vascular pattern (spot, strip- or circumferential-like flow), and the flow penetrating myometrium were significant findings for distinguishing concomitant RPOC with and without PAS. Additionally, RPOC may contribute to PAS progression, or PAS and RPOC in coordination strengthen the observed vascular signals.", "journal": "Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC", "date": "2023-11-09", "authors": ["FangfangLin", "ZongbingChen", "HuanTao", "XinyiRen", "PeiyanMa", "Gendie ELash", "HanlinShuai", "PingLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jogc.2023.102266"}
{"title": "PEComa with ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion: expanding the molecular genetic spectrum of TFE3-rearranged PEComa with an emphasis on overlap with alveolar soft part sarcoma.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal neoplasms involving TFE3 gene fusions are diverse, mainly include alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) that is characterised by ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion, and a small subset of perivascular epithelioid cell tumours (PEComas) referred to as TFE3-rearranged PEComa, that most frequently harbours SFPQ::TFE3 fusion. Historically, ASPS and TFE3-rearranged PEComa are considered two distinctive entities despite their known morphological overlap. However, recent studies have suggested a potential histogenetic relationship between them, and several neoplasms that showed morphological features more closely fit PEComa rather than ASPS but harboured ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion have been documented. In this study, we report three cases of PEComa with ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion.\nClinicopathological features were assessed and partner agnostic targeted next-generation sequencing on clinically validated platforms were performed. The patients are two females and one male with age at presentation ranging from\u00a021 to 51\u2009years. All three tumours were located in the viscera (rectum, kidney and cervix). On a relatively limited follow-up period (range\u2009=\u20099-15\u2009months), all patients are alive without evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. The neoplasms were composed of tight nested architecture of epithelioid clear cells separated by a delicate vascular network, two of which were associated with sheets of plump spindle cells, and none showed significant discohesive tumour morphology. Immunohistochemically, in addition to TFE3 protein, all three neoplasms demonstrated co-expression of melan-A and smooth muscle actin. RNA-sequencing identified ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion in all three cases that were confirmed by subsequent fluorescence in-situ hybridisation analyses.\nOur study expands the molecular genetic spectrum of TFE3-rearranged PEComa and further indicates its close relationship to ASPS.", "journal": "Histopathology", "date": "2023-11-08", "authors": ["MingZhao", "YanHuang", "XiaonaYin", "JiayunXu", "YuefangSun", "JianWang"], "doi": "10.1111/his.15087"}
{"title": "Epicardial deletion of Sox9 leads to myxomatous valve degeneration and identifies Cd109 as a novel gene associated with valve development.", "abstract": "Epicardial-derived cells (EPDCs) are involved in the regulation of myocardial growth and coronary vascularization and are critically important for proper development of the atrioventricular (AV) valves. SOX9 is a transcription factor expressed in a variety of epithelial and mesenchymal cells in the developing heart, including EPDCs. To determine the role of SOX9 in epicardial development, an epicardial-specific Sox9 knockout mouse model was generated. Deleting Sox9 from the epicardial cell lineage impairs the ability of EPDCs to invade both the ventricular myocardium and the developing AV valves. After birth, the mitral valves of these mice become myxomatous with associated abnormalities in extracellular matrix organization. This phenotype is reminiscent of that seen in humans with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MVD). An RNA-seq analysis was conducted in an effort to identify genes associated with this myxomatous degeneration. From this experiment, Cd109 was identified as a gene associated with myxomatous valve pathogenesis in this model. Cd109 has never been described in the context of heart development or valve disease. This study highlights the importance of SOX9 in the regulation of epicardial cell invasion-emphasizing the importance of EPDCs in regulating AV valve development and homeostasis-and reports a novel expression profile of Cd109, a gene with previously unknown relevance in heart development.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2023-11-08", "authors": ["Andrew BHarvey", "Ren\u00e9lyn AWolters", "Raymond NDeepe", "Hannah GTarolli", "Jenna RDrummond", "AllisonTrouten", "AuvaZandi", "Jeremy LBarth", "RupakMukherjee", "Martin JRomeo", "Silvia GVaena", "GeTao", "RobinMuise-Helmericks", "Paula SRamos", "Russell ANorris", "AndyWessels"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2023.11.002"}
{"title": "Integrating Melt Electrowriting and Fused Deposition Modeling to Fabricate Hybrid Scaffolds Supportive of Accelerated Bone Regeneration.", "abstract": "Emerging additive manufacturing (AM) strategies can enable the engineering of hierarchal scaffold structures for guiding tissue regeneration. Here, the advantages of two AM approaches, melt electrowriting (MEW) and fused deposition modelling (FDM), are leveraged and integrated to fabricate hybrid scaffolds for large bone defect healing. MEW is used to fabricate a microfibrous core to guide bone healing, while FDM is used to fabricate a stiff outer shell for mechanical support, with constructs being coated with pro-osteogenic calcium phosphate (CaP) nano-needles. Compared to MEW scaffolds alone, hybrid scaffolds prevent soft tissue collapse into the defect region and support increased vascularization and higher levels of new bone formation 12 weeks post-implantation. In an additional group, hybrid scaffolds are also functionalized with BMP2 via binding to the CaP coating, which further accelerates healing and facilitates the complete bridging of defects after 12 weeks. Histological analyses demonstrate that such scaffolds support the formation of well-defined annular bone, with an open medullary cavity, smooth periosteal surface, and no evidence of abnormal ectopic bone formation. These results demonstrate the potential of integrating different AM approaches for the development of regenerative biomaterials, and in particular, demonstrate the enhanced bone healing outcomes possible with hybrid MEW-FDM constructs.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2023-11-07", "authors": ["Kian FEichholz", "PierlucaPitacco", "RossBurdis", "FarhadChariyev-Prinz", "XavierBarcel\u00f3", "BrookeTornifoglio", "RyanPaetzold", "OrquideaGarcia", "Daniel JKelly"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202302057"}
{"title": "A Self-Adaptive Biomimetic Periosteum Employing Nitric Oxide Release for Augmenting Angiogenesis in Bone Defect Regeneration.", "abstract": "The periosteum plays a vital role in the regeneration of critical-size bone defects and highly comminuted fractures, promoting the differentiation of osteoblasts, accelerating the reconstruction of the vascular network, and guiding bone tissue regeneration. However, the materials loaded with exogenous growth factors are limited by the release and activity of the elements. Therefore, the material structure must be carefully designed for the periosteal function. Here, a self-adaptive biomimetic periosteum strategy is proposed, which is a novel interpenetrating double network hydrogel consisting of diselenide-containing gelatin and calcium alginate (modified natural collagen and polysaccharide) to enhance the stability, anti-swelling, and delayed degradation of the hydrogel. The diselenide bond continuously releases nitric oxide (NO) by metabolizing endogenous nitrosated thiols (RSNO), activates the nitric oxide-cycle guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) signal pathway, coordinates the coupling effect of angiogenesis and osteogenesis, and accelerates the repair of bone defects. This self-adaptive biomimetic periosteum with the interpenetrating double network structure formed by the diselenide-containing gelatin and calcium alginate has been proven to be safe and effective in repairing critical-size bone defects and is expected to provide a promising strategy for solving clinical problems.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2023-11-06", "authors": ["ZhangzheZhou", "YangLiu", "WenjingLi", "ZhijianZhao", "XiaoweiXia", "JunlinLiu", "YaogeDeng", "YubinWu", "XiangqiangPan", "FanHe", "HuilinYang", "WeihongLu", "YongXu", "XuesongZhu"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202302153"}

{"title": "Embedded 3D bioprinting - An emerging strategy to fabricate biomimetic & large vascularized tissue constructs.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional bioprinting is an advanced tissue fabrication technique that allows printing complex structures with precise positioning of multiple cell types layer-by-layer. Compared to other bioprinting methods, extrusion bioprinting has several advantages to print large-sized tissue constructs and complex organ models due to large build volume. Extrusion bioprinting using sacrificial, support and embedded strategies have been successfully employed to facilitate printing of complex and hollow structures. Embedded bioprinting is a gel-in-gel approach developed to overcome the gravitational and overhanging limits of bioprinting to print large-sized constructs with a micron-scale resolution. In embedded bioprinting, deposition of bioinks into the microgel or granular support bath will be facilitated by the sol-gel transition of the support bath through needle movement inside the granular medium. This review outlines various embedded bioprinting strategies and the polymers used in the embedded systems with advantages, limitations, and efficacy in the fabrication of complex vascularized tissues or organ models with micron-scale resolution. Further, the essential requirements of support bath systems like viscoelasticity, stability, transparency and easy extraction to print human scale organs are discussed. Additionally, the organs or complex geometries like vascular constructs, heart, bone, octopus and jellyfish models printed using support bath assisted printing methods with their anatomical features are elaborated.

{"title": "Adhesive, Flexible, and Fast Degradable 3D-Printed Wound Dressings with a Simple Composition.", "abstract": "3D printing technology has revolutionized the field of wound dressings, offering tailored solutions with mechanical support to facilitate wound closure. In addition to personalization, the intricate nature of the wound healing process requires wound dressing materials with diverse properties, such as moisturization, flexibility, adhesion, anti-oxidation and degradability. Unfortunately, current materials used in digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing have been inadequate in meeting these crucial criteria. This study introduces a novel DLP resin that is biocompatible and consists of only three commonly employed non-toxic compounds in biomaterials, that is, dopamine, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, and N-vinylpyrrolidone. Simple as it is, this material system fulfills all essential functions for effective wound healing. Unlike most DLP resins that are non-degradable and rigid, this material exhibits tunable and rapid degradation kinetics, allowing for complete hydrolysis within a few hours. Furthermore, the high flexibility enables conformal application of complex dressings in challenging areas such as finger joints. Using a difficult-to-heal wound model, the manifold positive effects on wound healing in vivo, including granulation tissue formation, inflammation regulation, and vascularization are substantiated. The simplicity and versatility of this material make it a promising option for personalized wound care, holding significant potential for future translation.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2023-11-02", "authors": ["YuHu", "HaoTang", "NanXu", "XiaowoKang", "WeijunWu", "ChuhanShen", "JunshengLin", "YinyinBao", "XingyuJiang", "ZhiLuo"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.202302063"}

The elongated structure of cardiomyocytes requires tuning of substrate properties and application of biophysical stimuli to drive its mature phenotype. Landmark advances have already been achieved with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac patches that advanced to human testing. Heart-on-a-chip platforms are now commonly used by a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Here, we provide an overview of cardiac physiology in order to better define the requirements for functional tissue recapitulation. We then discuss the biomaterials most commonly used in both cardiac tissue engineering and heart-on-a-chip, followed by the discussion of recent representative studies in both fields. We outline significant challenges common to both fields, specifically: scalable tissue fabrication and platform standardization, improving cellular fidelity through effective tissue vascularization, achieving adult tissue maturation, and ultimately developing cryopreservation protocols so that the tissues are available off the shelf.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Molecular mechanisms underlying microglial sensing and phagocytosis in synaptic pruning.", "abstract": "Microglia are the main non-neuronal cells in the central nervous system that have important roles in brain development and functional connectivity of neural circuits. In brain physiology, highly dynamic microglial processes are facilitated to sense the surrounding environment and stimuli. Once the brain switches its functional states, microglia are recruited to specific sites to exert their immune functions, including the release of cytokines and phagocytosis of cellular debris. The crosstalk of microglia between neurons, neural stem cells, endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes contributes to their functions in synapse pruning, neurogenesis, vascularization, myelination, and blood-brain barrier permeability. In this review, we highlight the neuron-derived \"find-me,\" \"eat-me,\" and \"don't eat-me\" molecular signals that drive microglia in response to changes in neuronal activity for synapse refinement during brain development. This review reveals the molecular mechanism of neuron-microglia interaction in synaptic pruning and presents novel ideas for the synaptic pruning of microglia in disease, thereby providing important clues for discovery of target drugs and development of nervous system disease treatment methods targeting synaptic dysfunction.", "journal": "Neural regeneration research", "date": "2023-10-31", "authors": ["AnranHuo", "JialiWang", "QiLi", "MengqiLi", "YuwanQi", "QiaoYin", "WeifengLuo", "JijunShi", "QifeiCong"], "doi": "10.4103/1673-5374.385854\n10.1101/2020.09.11.291427"}

Revascularization, the restoration of blood flow to ischemic or damaged tissue, is a key step in wound healing. Adequate vascularization has been recognized as a necessary factor for successful tissue regeneration. In the later stage of revascularization and tissue remodeling in wound healing, stem cells regulate other repair cells and matrix formation by influencing the maturation of blood vessels. The reductive oxidation (REDOX) state may be a key mechanism through stem/progenitor cells to influence endothelial cells to mature blood vessels and improve the quality of healing.

{"title": "A bioartificial and vasculomorphic bone matrix-based organoid mimicking microanatomy of flat and short bones.", "abstract": "We engineered an in vitro model of bioartificial 3D bone organoid consistent with an anatomical and vascular microenvironment common to mammalian flat and short bones. To achieve this, we chose the decellularized-decalcified matrix of the adult male rat scapula, implemented with the reconstruction of its intrinsic vessels, obtained through an original intravascular perfusion with polylevolactic (PLLA), followed by coating of the PLLA-fabricated vascularization with rat tail collagen. As a result, the 3D bone and vascular geometry of the native bone cortical and cancellous compartments was reproduced, and the rat tail collagen-PLLA biomaterial could in vitro act as a surrogate of the perivascular extracellular matrix (ECM) around the wall of the biomaterial-reconstituted cancellous vessels. As a proof-of-concept of cell compatibility and site-dependent osteoinductive properties of this bioartificial 3D construct, we show that it in vitro leads to a time-dependent microtopographic positioning of rat mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), initiating an osteogenic fate in relation to the bone compartment. In addition, coating of PLLA-reconstructed vessels with rat tail collagen favored perivascular attachment and survival of MSC-like cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), confirming its potentiality as a perivascular stroma for triggering competence of seeded MSCs. Finally, in vivo radiographic topography of bone lesions in the human jaw and foot tarsus of subjects with primary osteoporosis revealed selective bone cortical versus cancellous involvement, suggesting usefulness of a human 3D bone organoid engineered with the same principles of our rat organoid, to in vitro investigate compartment-dependent activities of human MSC in flat and short bones under experimental osteoporotic challenge. We conclude that our 3D bioartificial construct offers a reliable replica of flat and short bones microanatomy, and promises to help in building a compartment-dependent mechanistic perspective of bone remodeling, including the microtopographic dysregulation of osteoporosis.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Treatment of Intrathecal Drug Pump Flipping Using Fascial Flaps: A Technical Description and Case Series.", "abstract": "Intrathecal drug therapy is a common treatment for dystonia, pain, and spasticity using implanted pump and catheter systems. Standardized management of intrathecal drug pump (ITDP) migration and flipping has not been well established in the literature. This study reports the use of soft tissue to address less common pump complications such as pump flipping, migration, and difficulty in medication refill.\nA retrospective chart review of intrathecal pump cases performed by two surgeons between February 2020 and August 2022 was conducted. Patients with complications such as pump flipping, migration, or challenges in medication refill treated with soft tissue flaps were included. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative data were collected.\nA total of five patients with ITDP complicated by pump flipping, migration, malposition, or difficulty in medication refill that were treated using fascial flaps were included in the study. Three technical considerations when revising ITDP complications are secure pump anchoring, reliable wound closure, and ease of pump medication refill. Cases 1 and 2 demonstrate the technique of secure pump anchoring with a rectus fascial flap. Cases 3 and 4 show a technique to achieve reliable vascularized wound closure, and case 5 describes a technique to solve an uncommon problem of a thick subcutaneous abdominal tissue preventing the refill of the ITDP medication.\nSoft tissue flaps may serve as a treatment option for patients with uncommon ITDP complications. De-epithelialized dermal fasciocutaneous or fascial flaps may be developed to anchor the pump more securely.

{"title": "Three-Dimensional Bioprinting in Vascular Tissue Engineering and Tissue Vascularization of Cardiovascular Diseases.", "abstract": "In the 21st century, significant progress has been made in repairing damaged materials through material engineering. However, the creation of large-scale artificial materials still faces a major challenge in achieving proper vascularization. To address this issue, researchers have turned to biomaterials and three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting techniques, which allow for the combination of multiple biomaterials with improved mechanical and biological properties that mimic natural materials. Hydrogels, known for their ability to support living cells and biological components, have played a crucial role in this research. Among the recent developments, 3D bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for constructing hybrid scaffolds. However, there are several challenges in the field of bioprinting, including the need for nanoscale biomimicry, the formulation of hydrogel blends, and the ongoing complexity of vascularizing biomaterials, which requires further research. On a positive note, 3D bioprinting offers a solution to the vascularization problem due to its precise spatial control, scalability, and reproducibility compared with traditional fabrication methods. This paper aims at examining the recent advancements in 3D bioprinting technology for creating blood vessels, vasculature, and vascularized materials. It provides a comprehensive overview of the progress made and discusses the limitations and challenges faced in current 3D bioprinting of vascularized tissues. In addition, the paper highlights the future research directions focusing on the development of 3D bioprinting techniques and bioinks for creating functional materials.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Furthermore, there were no variations in union rates among genders, extremities, age, fracture locations, or among smokers. However, a higher union rate was noted in office workers and those who received conservative treatment.\nNonunions were higher in our study than in the literature, as our department is a referral center for established nonunion cases.

The primary goals of surgical treatment are represented by maximal safe resection and visual recovery; therefore, appropriate patient selection is critical to optimize results. In the last 2 decades, the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has appeared as a successful and viable strategy for the management of these tumors. The authors identified preoperative factors associated with extent of resection and visual outcome after EEA for TSM.\nIn this retrospective cohort study, the authors analyzed patients who underwent extended endoscopic endonasal surgery for TSM between January 2005 and April 2022 at the Division of Neurosurgery, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy. Tumor size, vessel encasement, and optic canal involvement were classified according to University of California, San Francisco, score. Visual acuity and visual fields were analyzed according to the visual impairment score (VIS), defined as a four-level classification: grade 1 (VIS 0-25), grade 2 (VIS 26-50), grade 3 (VIS 51-75), and grade 4 (VIS 76-100). Ophthalmological functions were tested preoperatively and during the early postoperative period (within 6 months after surgery) and late postoperative period.\nA total of 48 patients were enrolled. Forty-one (85.4%) patients experienced blurred vision or visual field defect as a presenting sign. Gross-total resection was achieved in 40 (83.3%), near-total resection in 2 (4.2%), and subtotal resection in 6 (12.5%). Visual defect improved in 82.9% (34/41) of cases, 12.2% (5/41) had no significant changes, and 2.4% (1/41) had worsened visual defect. The mean change in VIS was 42% (95% CI 58.77-31.23). Visual outcome was poorer when preoperative VIS (VIS-pre) was greater than 25 (p = 0.02). Six postoperative CSF leaks occurred (12.5%), and 1 patient (2.1%) required revision surgery.\nThe EEA is a safe and effective approach for TSM removal, with the advantage of preserving optic apparatus vascularization, and can promote gross-total resection and visual improvement. The authors have defined four categories based on VIS that relate to postoperative outcome: the lower the VIS-pre, the higher the rate of postoperative VIS improvement.

Typically, such lesions require a multidisciplinary approach involving both neurosurgery and plastic surgery for optimal resection and reconstruction. The authors present a retrospective analysis of patients with scalp malignancies who underwent resection and reconstruction.\nPatients presenting with scalp malignancies (1993-2021, n = 84) who required neurosurgical assistance for tumor resection were prospectively entered into a database. These data were retrospectively reviewed for this case series. The extent of neurosurgical resection was classified into four levels of involvement: scalp (level I), calvarial (level II), dural (level III), or intraparenchymal (level IV). Complications and evidence of local, locoregional, or regional recurrence were documented.\nPatients underwent level I (n = 2), level II (n = 61), level III (n = 13), and level IV (n = 8) resections. Pathologies consisted of primarily squamous cell carcinoma (n = 50, 59.5%), basal cell carcinoma (n = 11, 13.1%), and melanoma (n = 9, 10.7%), with infrequent lesions including sarcoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. For cases requiring a cranioplasty, 92.2% were done using titanium mesh and 7.8% with methylmethacrylate. At a mean follow-up of 35.5 \u00b1 45.9 months, the overall survival was 48.8% (n = 41) and recurrence-free survival was 31.0% (n = 43). Scalp-based reconstruction involving plastic surgery was performed in 75 (89.3%) patients. The most commonly used free flap was a latissimus dorsi muscle flap (n = 46, 61.3%). One or more postoperative complications occurred in 21.4% of all patients, the most common being wound dehiscence or delayed wound healing in 13% (n = 11).\nA multidisciplinary approach with aggressive neurosurgical resection is associated with good outcomes in patients with primary malignant scalp tumors, despite invasive disease on presentation. This analysis suggests that aggressive resection (level II and higher) is effective at reducing locoregional recurrence and is not associated with a higher risk of complications relative to resection without craniectomy.

{"title": "Free vascularized bone graft from the lateral epicondylar region of the humerus for treatment of scaphoid nonunion.", "abstract": "Free vascularized bone grafting (FVBG) has become one of the essential methods for treating scaphoid nonunion complicated by avascular necrosis. However, commonly used bone graft, including the medial femoral condyle bone graft and iliac crest bone graft, still present challenges such as a high rate of donor site complications and variations of vascular pedicle. In this study, we have introduced a novel bone graft-the lateral humeral condyle bone graft with the posterior branch of the radial collateral artery (PBRCA) as the vascular pedicle-as an alternative option, with the aim of overcoming some of the limitations of previously described FVBG procedures.\nNine patients who had a nonunion of the scaphoid that had been present for an average of 16.8\u2009months (range 9-35\u2009months) were managed with use of a free vascularized bone graft obtained from the lateral humeral epicondylar region. Avascularity of the scaphoid, as assessed on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative bone marrow puncture test. Postoperatively, regular X-ray and CT scans examinations were conducted to assess the progress of fracture healing. Active motion of the wrist, and grip strength recovery were measured periodically. Wrist pain was graded using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), while wrist joint functionality was evaluated using the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Quick-DASH) questionnaire and the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) scale. The elbow functional outcome was evaluated by the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS).\nAll of nine lateral humeral epicondylar bone grafts were successfully harvested. The blood supply of the graft during surgery was excellent in six cases and good in three cases. The size of the bone grafts ranges from 1.0\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009cm to 2.0\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009cm. The average vascular pedicle length was 3.4\u2009cm (range 2.0-6.0\u2009cm). There were no early complications in either the donor or recipient areas after surgery. Union was successfully achieved in all nine patients, with an average time to union of 14.3\u2009weeks (range 11-20\u2009weeks) after surgery. The average follow-up period was 31.2\u2009months (range 26-40\u2009months). At the final follow-up, the average palmar flexion, dorsal extension, radial deviation, and ulnar deviation angles of the injured wrist joint were 56.1\u00b0 (range 45\u00b0-70\u00b0), 56.1\u00b0 (range 40\u00b0-80\u00b0), 10.6\u00b0 (range 5\u00b0-20\u00b0), and 22.2\u00b0 (range 15\u00b0-35\u00b0), respectively, which reached 79.0%, 82.1%, 59.4%, and 72.8% of the average activity of the contralateral normal side. The average grip strength of the injured side was 35.2\u2009kg (range 22-51\u2009kg), which was equivalent to 81.3% of the average grip strength of the contralateral side. The average VAS score for wrist joint pain was 1.0 point (range 0-2 points); the Quick-DASH score was 9.2 points (range 6-18 points); and the PRWE score was 13.1 points (range 9-16 points), the Mayo Elbow Performance Index was 100 points (range 100-100 points). One patient reported a feeling of friction during movement but no pain. One patient reported numbness in the donor site. One patient complained of pain when applying force to the scar in the donor area. During the follow-up period, these complications showed improvement without any treatment.\nThe FVBG technique has been considered an effective method for treating scaphoid nonunion with avascular necrosis. Compared to traditional FVBG, the lateral humeral epicondylar bone graft exhibits a higher union rate, fewer complications, and easier accessibility, making it a favorable choice.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2023-10-25", "authors": ["NuoChen", "YulingWang", "JuyuTang"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.31128"}
{"title": "Pulmonary fibrosis: Is stem cell therapy the way forward?", "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic and fatal lung disease affecting millions of people worldwide, is characterized by the scarring of lung tissue, thereby impairing oxygen exchange between the lungs and blood. The etiology of pulmonary fibrosis is multifactorial, involving environmental exposures, comorbidities, and genetic mutations. Current pharmacological treatments can only slow the disease progression, and lung transplantation is limited by donor availability and complications. Stem cell therapy has emerged as a potential alternative treatment for pulmonary fibrosis, in which stem cells modulate the inflammatory response, differentiate into lung epithelial cells, secrete growth factors and extracellular matrix components, and enhance vascularization and tissue regeneration. Various sources of stem cells, such as endogenous lung stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells, have been investigated in animal models and human trials. Various delivery routes, such as intravenous injection, intratracheal instillation, and inhalation, have been tested for safety and efficacy. However, several challenges and limitations remain to be overcome, such as high costs, ethical issues, immunological compatibility, cell survival and homing, and long-term outcomes. Further research is needed to optimize the protocols and parameters in stem cell therapy for pulmonary fibrosis, and to evaluate the clinical benefits and risks for patients.\n\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u0648\u064a \u0645\u0631\u0636 \u0631\u0626\u0648\u064a \u0645\u0632\u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644

However, its use is limited owing to vascular complications. Human adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments (HaMVFs)\u00a0are vascularized units that form vascular networks by rapid reassembly. In this study, we designed a vascularized bionic skin tissue using a three-dimensional (3D) bioprinter of HaMVFs and human fibroblasts encapsulated in a hybrid hydrogel composed of GelMA, HAMA, and fibrinogen. Tissues incorporating HaMVFs showed good in vitro vascularization and mechanical properties after UV crosslinking and thrombin exposure. Thus, the tissue could be sutured appropriately to the wound. In vivo, the vascularized 3D bioprinted skin promoted epidermal regeneration, collagen maturation in the dermal tissue, and vascularization of the skin tissue to accelerate wound healing. Overall, vascularized 3D bioprinted skin with HaMVFs is an effective material for treating skin defects and may be clinically applicable to reduce the necrosis rate of skin grafts.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2023-10-25", "authors": ["ZhiqiangZhang", "ChiXu", "LeiXu", "JiamingWan", "GaobiaoCao", "ZheLiu", "PengxiangJi", "QianhengJin", "YiFu", "YingyingLe", "JihuiJu", "RuixingHou", "GuangliangZhang"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.28588"}

This paper introduces a new distinctive phase interdependency model to address these problems for delineating centerline patterns of the vascular network. We capture the inherent property of vascular centerlines by obtaining the inter-scale dependency information that exists between neighboring symmetrical wavelets in complex Poisson domain. In particular, the proposed phase interdependency model identifies vascular centerlines as the distinctive features that have high magnitudes over adjacent symmetrical coefficients whereas the coefficients caused by background noises are decayed rapidly along adjacent wavelet scales. The potential relationships between the neighboring Poisson coefficients are established based on the coherency of distinctive symmetrical wavelets. The proposed phase model is assessed on the OCTA-500 database (300 OCTA images + 200 OCT images), ROSE-1-SVC dataset (9 OCTA images), ROSE-1 (SVC+ DVC) dataset (9 OCTA images), and ROSE-2 dataset (22 OCTA images).

A bioprinted artificial tumor model is introduced with endothelial and stromal cells self-organizing into perfusable and functional vascular structures. This model uses 3D hydrogel matrices to embed multicellular tumor spheroids, allowing them to grow to mesoscopic scales and to interact with endothelial cells. It is shown that angiogenic multicellular tumor spheroids promote the growth of a vascular network, which in turn further enhances the growth of cocultivated tumor spheroids. The self-developed vascular structure infiltrates the tumor spheroids, forms functional connections with the bioprinted endothelium, and can be perfused by erythrocytes and polystyrene microspheres. Moreover, cancer cells migrate spontaneously from the tumor spheroid through the self-assembled vascular network into the fluid flow. Additionally, tumor type specific characteristics of desmoplasia, angiogenesis, and metastatic propensity are preserved between patient-derived samples and tumors derived from this same material growing in the bioreactors.

As emerging bioengineering methods have led to the optimization of cell culture protocols, spinal cord organoids technology has made remarkable advancements in the past decade. Our literature search found that current spinal cord organoids do not only dynamically simulate neural tube formation but also exhibit diverse cytoarchitecture along the dorsal-ventral and rostral-caudal axes. Moreover, fused organoids that integrate motor neurons and other regionally specific organoids exhibit intricate neural circuits that allows for functional assessment. These qualities make spinal cord organoids valuable tools for disease modeling, drug screening, and tissue regeneration. By utilizing this emergent technology, researchers have made significant progress in investigating the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of spinal cord diseases.

The natural evolution to more preservation with less invasive forms of these flaps has been driven by both patient and surgeon satisfaction. Nevertheless, obese patients are challenging due to the increased risk of compromised flap perfusion and donor site morbidity. This challenge is compounded by the prevalence of obesity worldwide, resulting in more free abdominal flaps being performed for breast reconstruction in obese patients. The authors present the outcomes of a modified supra-arcuate fascial muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous (FMS-TRAM) technique compared to standard muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous (MS-TRAM) technique to reduce the donor site morbidity while providing a well-vascularized large volume of autologous tissue.\nA retrospective comparative data analysis was conducted at two centers: Cairo University Hospitals, Egypt, and University Hospitals Birmingham, United Kingdom. Standard MS-TRAM was performed in 65 patients between 2008 and 2011 (Group 1) versus 275 patients between 2011 and 2020 (Group 2) who underwent FMS-TRAM. The modified technique involved limiting the fascial incision to above or at the level of the arcuate line to preserve the integrity of the anterior rectus sheath caudally. All patients included were of the obese population (BMI\u226530\u2009kg/m\nThe median age and BMI for Group 1 were 43 and 32, respectively. While for Group 2, they were 47 and 33, respectively. Flap weight ranged from 560 to 1470\u2009g (Mean 705) for Group 1, while Group 2 ranged from 510 to 1560 (mean 715). The majority (280/340 [82%]) of the patients in both groups received radiotherapy. 7.7% of Group 1 were smokers, while in Group 2 it was 4.7%. The percentage of delayed versus immediate reconstruction in Group 1 was 60%/40%, while in Group 2, it was 43%/56%. The incidence of fat necrosis, partial necrosis, and total necrosis was 7.6%.1.5%, and 3%, respectively, for Group 1 and 8%, 1.4%, and 2.6%, respectively, for Group 2.

{"title": "Association of metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease.", "abstract": "The prevalence of kidney disease is increasing rapidly worldwide, reflecting rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and associated metabolic syndrome (MetS). Chronic kidney disease and related comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension place a significant financial burden on healthcare systems. Despite the widespread use of RAAS inhibitors, intensive blood pressure and glycemic control, and newer therapeutic options consisting of sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, a significant risk of progression to end-stage renal disease remains in the high-risk obese and diabetic population. The MetS is a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors that adversely affect the development and progression of chronic kidney failure. According to the criteria of the World Health Organization, it is defined by visceral adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, raised blood pressure, and microalbuminuria with a albumin-to-creatinine ratio \u226530\u2009mg/g. At molecular level MetS is marked by a proinflammatory state and increased oxidative stress leading to various pathophysiological changes causing endothelial dysfunction and a hypercoagulable state. Because the kidney is a highly vascularized organ, it is especially susceptible for those microvascular changes. Therefore, the MetS and its individual components are associated with the premature development, acceleration, and progression of chronic kidney disease. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of MetS-associated chronic kidney disease in order to develop new strategies for preventing and slowing the progression of renal disease. In this review, we will elucidate (i) the renal structural, hemodynamic, and metabolic changes that occur in obesity and obesity-related kidney injury; (ii) the clinicopathological characteristics of obesity-related kidney injury, primarily focusing on obesity-associated glomerulopathy; (iii) the potential additional factors or predisposing factors that may turn patients more susceptible to renal structural or functional compensatory failure and subsequent injury.", "journal": "Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity", "date": "2023-10-03", "authors": ["Florian GScurt", "Maximilian JGanz", "CarolinHerzog", "KatrinBose", "Peter RMertens", "ChristosChatzikyrkou"], "doi": "10.1111/obr.13649"}

{"title": "Imaging in gynecological disease (27): clinical and ultrasound characteristics of recurrent ovarian stromal cell tumors.", "abstract": "To describe the clinical and ultrasound characteristics of recurrent granulosa cell and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors.\nThis was a retrospective observational study performed at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, IRCCS, Rome (Gemelli center), Italy. Patients with a histological diagnosis of recurrent granulosa cell tumor or Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor were identified from the database of the Department of Gynecological Oncology. Those who had undergone a preoperative ultrasound examination at the Gemelli center between 2012 and 2020 were included, and the data retrieved from the original ultrasound reports. In all of these reports, the recurrent tumors were described using International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) terminology. If a patient had more than one episode of relapse, information from all episodes was collected. If there was more than one recurrent tumor at the same ultrasound examination, all tumors were included. One expert sonographer also reviewed all available ultrasound images to identify typical ultrasound patterns using pattern recognition.\nWe identified 30 patients with a histological diagnosis of recurrent granulosa cell tumor (25 patients, 55 tumors) or Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (five patients, seven tumors). All 30 had undergone at least one preoperative ultrasound examination at the Gemelli center and were included. These women had a total of 66 episodes of relapse, of which a preoperative ultrasound examination had been performed at the Gemelli center in 34, revealing 62 recurrent lesions: one in 22/34 (64.7%) episodes of relapse, two in 4/34 (11.8%) episodes and three or more in 8/34 (23.5%) episodes. Most recurrent granulosa cell tumors (38/55, 69.1%) and recurrent Sertoli-Leydig tumors (6/7, 85.7%) were classified as solid or multilocular-solid tumors, while 8/55 (14.5%) recurrent granulosa cell tumors and 1/7 (14.3%) recurrent Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors were unilocular cysts and 9/55 (16.4%) recurrent granulosa cell tumors were multilocular cysts. The nine unilocular cysts had contents that were anechoic (n\u2009=\u20092) or had low-level echogenicity (n\u2009=\u20097), had either smooth (n\u2009=\u20094) or irregular (n\u2009=\u20095) internal cyst walls, and ranged in largest diameter from 8 to 38\u2009mm, with three being <\u200920\u2009mm and five being 20-30\u2009mm. On retrospective review of the images, two typical ultrasound patterns were described: small solid tumor measuring <\u20092\u2009cm (15/62, 24.2%) and tumor with vascularized echogenic ground-glass-like content (12/62, 19.4%).\nSome granulosa cell and Sertoli-Leydig cell recurrences manifest one of two typical ultrasound patterns, while some appear as unilocular cysts. These are usually classified as benign, but in patients being followed up for a granulosa cell tumor or Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, a unilocular cyst should be considered suspicious of recurrence. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

{"title": "Pathogenesis of Reinke's Edema of the Vocal Fold.", "abstract": "The most frequent etiologic factor of Reinke's edema (RE) is considered to be smoking. However, the mechanism for the onset and development of the disease remains unclear. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is an oxygen-dependent transcriptional activator which plays crucial roles in angiogenesis in hypoxic microenvironments. HIF-1\u03b1 induces the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which involves angiogenesis and enhances vascular permeability. This study investigated the roles of HIF-1\u03b1 in the pathogenesis of RE.\nSurgical specimens of RE from patients who underwent endolaryngeal microsurgery were used. Normal vocal folds were used as a control group. Expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Three-dimensional fine structures of the vessels in RE were investigated using correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) technique.\nHIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF were broadly expressed in the stromal, inflammatory, and endothelial cells in the lamina propria of the vocal fold of RE. The expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF of RE were significantly higher than in the lamina propria of the normal vocal fold mucosa. CLEM showed vascularization and telangiectasia and there were many dilated capillaries with thin endothelium not covered with pericytes indicating the vessels were fragile.\nTranscription factor HIF-1\u03b1 and induced VEGF likely play roles in the pathogenesis of RE. And increased vascular permeability with fragile vessels in angiogenesis is likely to be an etiology of RE. Transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1 and induced VEGF are potential therapeutic targets for RE.\nNA Laryngoscope, 134:1785-1791, 2024.", "journal": "The Laryngoscope", "date": "2023-09-29", "authors": ["KiminobuSato", "TakashiKurita", "FumihikoSato", "KiminoriSato", "Shun-IchiChitose", "TakeharuOno", "HirohitoUmeno"], "doi": "10.1002/lary.31084"}

Since bladder regeneration is a complex articulated process, the aim of this study is to investigate whether combining multiple pathways by exploiting a combination of biomaterials, cells, and bioactive factors, contributes to the improvements of smooth muscle regeneration and vascularization in tissue-engineered bladder. Autologous endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and bladder smooth muscle cells (BSMCs) are cultured and incorporated into our previously prepared porcine bladder acellular matrix (BAM) for bladder augmentation in rabbits. Simultaneously, exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) mixed with Matrigel were injected around the implanted cells-BAM complex. In the results, compared with control rabbits received bladder augmentation with porcine BAM seeded with BSMCs, the experimental animals showed significantly improved smooth muscle regeneration and vascularization, along with more excellent functional recovery of tissue-engineered bladder, due to the additional combination of autologous EPCs and bioactive factors, including VEGF and PDGF-BB. Furthermore, cell tracking suggested that the seeded EPCs could be directly involved in neovascularization. Therefore, it may be an effective method to combine multiple pathways for tissue-engineering urinary bladder.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The ocular examination included best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp bio-microscopy, and ocular surface assessment. Mutational analysis of the coding region of GJB2 (Cx26) was performed by bidirectional Sanger sequencing.\nAll four individuals had the characteristic systemic features of keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome. Each patient was found to have a missense mutation, resulting in the substitution of aspartic acid with asparagine at codon 50 (p.D50N). Main ophthalmic features were vascularizing keratopathy, ocular surface disease, hyperkeratotic lid lesions, recurrent epithelial defects, and corneal stromal scarring. One patient had multiple surgical procedures, including superficial keratectomies and lamellar keratoplasty, which failed to prevent severe visual loss. In contrast, oral therapy with ketoconazole stabilized the corneal and skin disease in two other patients with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome.

Convincingly, the hBMSC-dECM group exhibited comparable functional recoveries to the autograft group by postoperative week 12. In the comprehensive analysis, the molecular regulations in the hBMSC-dECM group were more intricate and nuanced compared to the autograft group. Nevertheless, both groups displayed similar molecular regulatory processes in terms of vascularization and extracellular matrix. Notably, the hBMSC-dECM group demonstrated sustained high levels of regulation in axon and myelin regeneration at week 12, while the immunomodulation returned to the normal levels after peaking at week 2.

{"title": "Ultrasound appearance of decidualized non-ovarian endometriotic lesions during pregnancy and after delivery.", "abstract": "To evaluate the changes in the ultrasound characteristics of decidualized non-ovarian endometriotic lesions that occur during pregnancy and after delivery.\nThis was a prospective observational cohort study carried out at a single tertiary center between December 2018 and October 2021. Pregnant women with endometriosis underwent a standardized transvaginal ultrasound examination with color Doppler imaging once in every trimester and after delivery. Non-ovarian endometriotic lesions were measured and evaluated by subjective semiquantitative assessment of blood flow. Lesions with moderate-to-marked blood flow were considered decidualized. The size and vascularization of decidualized and non-decidualized lesions were compared between the gravid state and after delivery. Only patients with non-ovarian endometriotic lesion(s) who underwent postpartum examination were included in the final analysis.\nOverall, 26 pregnant women with a surgical or sonographic diagnosis of endometriosis made prior to conception were invited to participate in the study, of whom 24 were recruited. Of those, 13 women with non-ovarian endometriosis who attended the postpartum examination were included. In 7/13 (54%) cases, the lesion(s) were decidualized. In 4/7 (57%) women with decidualized lesion(s), the size of the largest lesion increased during pregnancy, while in 3/7 (43%), the size was unchanged. The size of non-decidualized lesions did not change during pregnancy. On postpartum examination, only seven lesions were observed, of which three were formerly decidualized and four were formerly non-decidualized. Lesions that were detected after delivery appeared as typical endometriotic nodules and were smaller compared with during pregnancy. The difference in maximum diameter between the gravid and postpartum states was statistically significant in decidualized lesions (P\u2009<\u20090.01), but not in non-decidualized lesions (P\u2009=\u20090.09). The reduction in mean diameter was greater in decidualized compared with non-decidualized lesions (P\u2009=\u20090.03).\nDecidualization was observed in 54% of women with non-ovarian endometriotic lesion(s) and resolved after delivery. Our findings suggest that the sonographic features of decidualization, which might mimic malignancy, are pregnancy-related and that expectant management and careful monitoring should be applied in these cases. Clinicians should be aware of the changes observed during pregnancy to avoid misdiagnosing decidualized lesions as malignancy and performing unnecessary surgery. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

{"title": "Endocytic Roles of Glycans on Proteins and Lipids.", "abstract": "Most cell surface proteins are decorated by glycans, and the plasma membrane is rich in glycosylated lipids. The mechanisms by which the enormous complexity of these glycan structures on proteins and lipids is exploited to control glycoprotein activity by setting their cell surface residence time and the ways by which they are taken up into cells are still under active investigation. Here, two mechanisms are presented, termed galectin lattices and glycolipid-lectin (GL-Lect)-driven endocytosis, which are among the most prominent to establish a link between glycan information and endocytosis. Types of glycans on glycoproteins and glycolipids are reviewed from the angle of their interaction with glycan-binding proteins that are at the heart of galectin lattices and GL-Lect-driven endocytosis. Examples are given to show how these mechanisms affect cellular functions ranging from cell migration and signaling to vascularization and immune modulation.

While non-operative and operative treatment strategies have advanced, the restoration of native tendon and ligament structures after injury is still challenging due to its innate limited regenerative ability. Cell sheet technology is an innovative tool for tissue fabrication and cell transplantation in regenerative medicine. In this review, we first summarize different harvesting procedures and advantages of cell sheet technology, which preserves intact cell-to-cell connections and extracellular matrix. We then describe the recent progress of cell sheet technology from preclinical studies, focusing on the application of stem cell-derived sheets in treating tendon and ligament injuries, as well as highlighting its effects on mitigating inflammation and promoting tendon/graft-bone interface healing. Finally, we discuss several prerequisites for future clinical translation including the selection of appropriate cell source, optimization of preparation process, establishment of suitable animal model, and the fabrication of vascularized complex tissue.

{"title": "Multifunctional PtCuTe Nanosheets with Strong ROS Scavenging and ROS-Independent Antibacterial Properties Promote Diabetic Wound Healing.", "abstract": "Nanozymes, as one of the most efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging biomaterials, are receiving wide attention in promoting diabetic wound healing. Despite recent attempts at improving the catalytic efficiency of Pt-based nanozymes (e.g., PtCu, one of the best systems), they still display quite limited ROS scavenging capacity and ROS-dependent antibacterial effects on bacteria or immunocytes, which leads to uncontrolled and poor diabetic wound healing. Hence, a new class of multifunctional PtCuTe nanosheets with excellent catalytic, ROS-independent antibacterial, proangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and immuno-modulatory properties for boosting the diabetic wound healing, is reported. The PtCuTe nanosheets show stronger ROS scavenging capacity and better antibacterial effects than PtCu. It is also revealed that the PtCuTe can enhance vascular tube formation, stimulate macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype and improve fibroblast mobility, outperforming conventional PtCu. Moreover, PtCuTe promotes crosstalk between different cell types to form a positive feedback loop. Consequently, PtCuTe stimulates a proregenerative environment with relevant cell populations to ensure normal tissue repair. Utilizing a diabetic mouse model, it is demonstrated that PtCuTe significantly facilitated the regeneration of highly vascularized skin, with the percentage of wound closure being over 90% on the 8th day, which is the best among the reported comparable multifunctional biomaterials.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2023-09-19", "authors": ["YaruGuo", "ShuaiDing", "ChangshuaiShang", "ChenguangZhang", "MenggangLi", "QinghuaZhang", "LinGu", "Boon ChinHeng", "ShihanZhang", "FengMei", "YingHuang", "XuehuiZhang", "MingmingXu", "JiuhuiJiang", "ShaojunGuo", "XuliangDeng", "LiliChen"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.202306292"}

However, the pathways controlling the temporally and spatially restricted mechanisms underlying the formation of this vascular network remain poorly understood. In recent years, the increasing use and refinement of transgenic mouse models has played an instrumental role in offering new insights into the cellular origins of the coronary vasculature, as well as identifying a continuum of transitioning cell states preceding the full maturation of the coronary vasculature. Coupled with the emergence of single cell RNA sequencing platforms, these technologies have begun to uncover the key regulatory factors mediating the convergence of distinct cellular origins to ensure the formation of a collectively functional, yet phenotypically diverse, vascular network.

However, they are still burdened with a high postoperative complication rate. Our hypothesis is that the immunogenicity of residual cells in the graft is involved in this issue. Decellularization by perfusion might therefore be the answer to process and create more biologically effective massive bone allografts. Seventy-two porcine bones were used to characterize the efficiency of our sodium hydroxide-based decellularization protocol. A sequence of solvent perfusion through each nutrient artery was set up to ensure the complete decellularization of whole long bones. Qualitative (histology and immunohistochemistry [IHC]) and quantitative (fluoroscopic absorbance and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) evaluations were performed to assess the decellularization and the preservation of the extracellular matrix in the bone grafts. Cytotoxicity and compatibility were also tested. Comparatively to nontreated bones, our experiments showed a very high decellularization quality, demonstrating that perfusion is mandatory to achieve an entire decellularization. Moreover, results showed a good preservation of the bone composition and microarchitecture, Haversian systems and vascular network included. This protocol reduces the human leukocyte antigen antigenic load of the graft by >50%. The majority of measured growth factors is still present in the same amount in the decellularized bones compared to the nontreated bones. Histology and IHC show that the bones were cell compatible, noncytotoxic, and capable of inducing osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.

{"title": "Bioactive decellularized adipose matrix prepared using a rapid, nonchemical/enzymatic method for adipogenesis.", "abstract": "Recent developments in the field of regenerative surgeries and medical applications have led to a renewed interest in adipose tissue-enriched mesenchymal stem cell scaffolds. Various advantages declared for the decellularized adipose matrix (DAM) have caused its extensive use in the transfer of stem cells or growth factors for soft tissue regeneration induction. Meanwhile, the long-term application of detergents toward DAM regeneration has been assumed as a risky obstacle in this era. Herein, a rapid, mechanical protocol was developed to prepare DAM (M-DAM) without chemicals/enzymes and was comprehensively compared with the ordinary DAM (traditional chemical method). Accordingly, this method could effectively hinder oils and cells, sustain the structural and biological elements, and contain a superior level of collagen content. In addition, more protein numbers, as well as higher basement membrane elements, glycoproteins, and extracellular matrix-related proteins were detected in the regenerated M-DAM. Also, superior adipogenesis and angiogenesis proteins were distinguished. The noncytotoxicity of the M-DAM was also approved, and a natural ecological niche was observed for the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, confirming its great potential for vascularization and adipogenesis in vivo. The suggested technique could effectively prepare the modified DAM in variant constructions of tablets, powders, emulsions, hydrogels, and different three-dimensional-printed structures. Hence, this rapid, mechanical process can produce bioactive DAM, which has the potential to be widely used in various research fields of regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2023-09-11", "authors": ["JizhongYang", "JiezhangTang", "JuanliDang", "XiangkeRong", "KaiWang", "ZhaoxiangZhang", "MengmengHou", "ZhouYu", "ChenggangYi"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.28547"}

Its median survival is still short even with maximum standard care. There is a need to identify potential new molecules and mechanisms, that are involved in the interactions of GB cells with the tumor microenvironment (TME), for therapeutic intervention. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a multi-faceted matricellular protein which plays a significant role in development, physiology and pathology including cancer. Recent studies have pinpoint an important role of TSP1 in GB development which will be summarized and discussed herein. We will discuss studies, mainly from preclinical research, which should lead to a deeper understanding of TSP1's role in GB development.

In parallel with the developments in microsurgery, various techniques have been developed to perfect the technique. Microvascular anastomotic coupler device (MACD) is one of these techniques. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of anastomoses created by using hand-sewn microsurgery (HSM) and MACD.\nTwenty male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 to 300\u00a0g were divided into 2 groups randomly. Arteriovenous shunt was performed between carotid artery and internal jugular vein with the principles of HSM in the first group (n=10) and by using the 1-mm anastomotic microvascular device in the second group (n=10). Groups were evaluated for anastomose time, success of anastomosis, thrombosis formation, color Doppler ultrasonography, and histopathological features.\nAnastomotic time was faster with the coupler device compared with HSM technique. Flow rates were found significantly higher in the MACD group. Endothelialization and wall integrity rates were better in MACD group.\nMicrovascular anastomotic coupler device is faster than HSM.

{"title": "A paintable and adhesive hydrogel cardiac patch with sustained release of ANGPTL4 for infarcted heart repair.", "abstract": "The infarcted heart undergoes irreversible pathological remodeling after reperfusion involving left ventricle dilation and excessive inflammatory reactions in the infarcted heart, frequently leading to fatal functional damage. Extensive attempts have been made to attenuate pathological remodeling in infarcted hearts using cardiac patches and anti-inflammatory drug delivery. In this study, we developed a paintable and adhesive hydrogel patch using dextran-aldehyde (dex-ald) and gelatin, incorporating the anti-inflammatory protein, ANGPTL4, into the hydrogel for sustained release directly to the infarcted heart to alleviate inflammation. We optimized the material composition, including polymer concentration and molecular weight, to achieve a paintable, adhesive hydrogel using 10% gelatin and 5% dex-ald, which displayed in-situ gel formation within 135\u00a0s, cardiac tissue-like modulus (40.5\u00a0kPa), suitable tissue adhesiveness (4.3\u00a0kPa), and excellent mechanical stability. ANGPTL4 was continuously released from the gelatin/dex-ald hydrogel without substantial burst release. The gelatin/dex-ald hydrogel could be conveniently painted onto the beating heart and degraded in vivo. Moreover, in vivo studies using animal models of acute myocardial infarction revealed that our hydrogel cardiac patch containing ANGPTL4 significantly improved heart tissue repair, evaluated by echocardiography and histological evaluation. The heart tissues treated with ANGPTL4-loaded hydrogel patches exhibited increased vascularization, reduced inflammatory macrophages, and structural maturation of cardiac cells. Our novel hydrogel system, which allows for facile paintability, appropriate tissue adhesiveness, and sustained release of anti-inflammatory drugs, will serve as an effective platform for the repair of various tissues, including heart, muscle, and cartilage.", "journal": "Bioactive materials", "date": "2023-09-08", "authors": ["MingyuLee", "Yong SookKim", "JunggeonPark", "GoeunChoe", "SanghunLee", "Bo GyeongKang", "Ju HeeJun", "YoonminShin", "MinchulKim", "YoungkeunAhn", "Jae YoungLee"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bioactmat.2023.08.020\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000001052\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.05.023\n10.1007/s12013-015-0553-4\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.00300\n10.1007/s00395-020-0775-5\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.01.022\n10.1021/acsami.9b17907\n10.1016/j.healun.2015.12.007\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.120906\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.04.018\n10.2147/IJN.S386763\n10.1038/s41427-021-00330-y\n10.1002/adma.201704235\n10.1002/adfm.201505372\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.03.015\n10.1002/adfm.201903863\n10.1038/s41586-019-1710-5\n10.1089/ten.tec.2016.0492\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.01.073\n10.1002/path.4805\n10.2353/ajpath.2010.100129\n10.1172/jci.insight.125437\n10.1016/j.msec.2021.112604\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.08.027\n10.1039/C4TB01221F\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.11.011\n10.1002/adfm.202003759\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.11.115\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119513\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.05.147\n10.1049/bsb2.12016\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00798\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.023\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.117598\n10.1039/C5RA19467A\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.09.209\n10.1038/s41551-019-0380-9\n10.1038/s41467-021-24804-3\n10.1007/s10856-016-5763-9\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1002/adma.201603027\n10.1002/advs.202202964\n10.7150/thno.16614\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.08.023\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.09.081\n10.1021/acs.biomac.7b01133\n10.1002/pola.28099\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.916346\n10.1007/s10456-013-9381-6\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.029980\n10.1038/nm.3778"}

The study model involved a deep plane facelift procedure with the use of a hemostatic net. The first step, involving 4 hemifaces, included dissections and two-/three-dimensional angiographies by digital microangiography and computed tomography scan, respectively. The purpose was to evaluate the influence of the hemostatic net on vascular perfusion. The second step involved a sequential dye perfusion study performed on 10 other hemifaces that underwent facelift procedures with the hemostatic net to determine its impact on skin perfusion.\nThe anatomic and radiologic techniques enabled visualization of skin, and showed the arterial system reaching the subdermal vascular plexus and branching between the vascular territories, without interference from the net. The sequential dye perfusion study showed staining after injection in each facelift flap, with comparable coloration distributions before and after the application of the net.\nThe hemostatic net did not affect the skin blood supply, correlating with no clinical increases in ischemia and necrosis rates in the facelift flap.

Although this process appears to routinely occur in embryonic tissue, the biologic rules for sprout fusion and lumenization in adult regenerating tissue are unknown. To investigate this process, we grafted portions of the regenerating post-pneumonectomy lung onto the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Grafts from all 4 lobes of the post-pneumonectomy right lung demonstrated peri-graft angiogenesis as reflected by fluorescent plasma markers; however, fluorescent microsphere perfusion primarily occurred in the lobe of the lung that is the dominant site of post-pneumonectomy angiogenesis-namely, the cardiac lobe. Vascularization of the cardiac lobe grafts was confirmed by active tissue growth (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Functional vascular connections between the cardiac lobe and the CAM vascular network were demonstrated by confocal fluorescence microscopy as well as corrosion casting and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bulk transcriptional profiling of the cardiac lobe demonstrated the enhanced expression of many genes relative to alveolar epithelial cell (CD11b", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2023-08-26", "authors": ["KenjiChamoto", "Barry CGibney", "Willi LWagner", "MaximilianAckermann", "Hassan AKhalil", "Steven JMentzer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2023.104596"}

However, few studies have used EVs derived from clinical-grade stem cells and their derivatives with stable quality. Moreover, there is little information on the mechanism and time course of the multifactorial effect of EV therapy from the acute to the chronic phase, the affected cells, and whether the effects are direct or indirect.\nInduced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSCM) were produced using a clinical-grade differentiation induction system. EVs were isolated from the conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation and characterized in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. A rat model of myocardial infarction was established by left anterior descending artery ligation and treated with iPSCM-derived EVs.\niPSCM-derived EVs contained microRNAs and proteins associated with angiogenesis, antifibrosis, promotion of M2 macrophage polarization, cell proliferation, and antiapoptosis. iPSCM-derived EV treatment improved left ventricular function and reduced mortality in the rat model by improving vascularization and suppressing fibrosis and chronic inflammation in the heart. EVs were uptaken by cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages in the cardiac tissues. The pleiotropic effects occurred due to the direct effects of microRNAs and proteins encapsulated in EVs and indirect paracrine effects on M2 macrophages.\nClinical-grade iPSCM-derived EVs improve cardiac function by regulating various genes and pathways in various cell types and may have clinical potential for treating ischemic heart disease.", "journal": "The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation", "date": "2023-08-24", "authors": ["YujiTominaga", "TakujiKawamura", "EmikoIto", "MakiTakeda", "AkimaHarada", "KosukeTorigata", "RyotoSakaniwa", "YoshikiSawa", "ShigeruMiyagawa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.healun.2023.08.011"}

Patient demographics, defect characteristics, surgical techniques, and outcomes were investigated.\nThe hatchet flap was used to repair 70 defects in 69 patients, aged 41.6 to 90.0 years (mean, 66.1). Defects measured 0.6 to 23.6\u2009cm 2 (mean, 4.8) and resulted from Mohs surgery (n = 62), exenteration (n = 2), benign lesion excision (n = 3), or cicatricial ectropion/fistula repair (n = 3). The flap tail was managed with 3 techniques: V-Y plasty (n = 26), transposition (n = 34), and excision (n = 10). Ancillary procedures were often used during reconstructions (skin grafts: 29; double hatchet flap: 2; additional skin flaps: 26; tarsoconjunctival flaps: 6; and other grafts: 7). Small distal eschars healed in 7 flaps without necrosis. Four patients with subcutaneous thickening improved after steroid injections. Mild hatchet flap contracture may have contributed to postoperative cicatricial ectropion in 1 patient. There were no other flap related complications.\nIn selected patients, the hatchet flap is a versatile technique to mobilize vascularized tissue into eyelid/midfacial defects resulting from the excision of lesions or treatment of cicatricial ectropion/fistulas. Individuals without laxity in the plane perpendicular to the flap base may not be good candidates for this procedure. The hatchet flap can be modified by advancing, transposing, or excising the flap tail. Reconstruction is often combined with other flaps/grafts.

Tracheas were explanted two weeks post-implantation. Micro-Computed Tomography was conducted to assess for graft patency, and histological analysis was used to assess for epithelialization and neovascularization.\nMost animals (greater than 80%) survived until the planned endpoint and did not exhibit respiratory symptoms. MicroCT confirmed the preservation of graft patency. Grossly, the PDTG component of CTG remained intact. Examining the electrospun component of CTG, PGA degraded significantly, while PLCL+PDTG and PLCL/PGA\u2009+\u2009PDTG maintained their structure. Microvasculature was observed across the surface of CTG and infiltrating the pores. There were no signs of excessive cellular infiltration or encapsulation. Graft microvasculature and epithelium appear similar in all groups, suggesting that CTG did not hinder endothelialization and epithelialization.\nWe found that all electrospun nanofiber CTGs are biocompatible and did not affect graft patency, endothelialization and epithelialization.

{"title": "The role of cardiac pericytes in health and disease: therapeutic targets for myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Millions of cardiomyocytes die immediately after myocardial infarction, regardless of whether the culprit coronary artery undergoes prompt revascularization. Residual ischaemia in the peri-infarct border zone causes further cardiomyocyte damage, resulting in a progressive decline in contractile function. To date, no treatment has succeeded in increasing the vascularization of the infarcted heart. In the past decade, new approaches that can target the heart's highly plastic perivascular niche have been proposed. The perivascular environment is populated by mesenchymal progenitor cells, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and pericytes, which can together mount a healing response to the ischaemic damage. In the infarcted heart, pericytes have crucial roles in angiogenesis, scar formation and stabilization, and control of the inflammatory response. Persistent ischaemia and accrual of age-related risk factors can lead to pericyte depletion and dysfunction. In this Review, we describe the phenotypic changes that characterize the response of cardiac pericytes to ischaemia and the potential of pericyte-based therapy for restoring the perivascular niche after myocardial infarction. Pericyte-related therapies that can salvage the area at risk of an ischaemic injury include exogenously administered pericytes, pericyte-derived exosomes, pericyte-engineered biomaterials, and pharmacological approaches that can stimulate the differentiation of constitutively resident pericytes towards an arteriogenic phenotype. Promising preclinical results from in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that pericytes have crucial roles in the treatment of coronary artery disease and the prevention of post-ischaemic heart failure.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

The mucosal flaps allow such reconstruction, but their dissections are difficult and not always possible, particularly for large defects of the nasal sidewall unit.

This technique includes 3 stages, all done under local anaesthesia: 1st stage: a vertical paramedian forehead flap is classically raised and it's undersurface is full thickness skin grafted, it is then repositioned on it's site for 4 weeks; 2nd stage: this flap is raised again and split at the level of fat, just superficial to the muscle, in two flaps: the full thickness skin grafted frontalis muscle flap for the lining; and the forehead flap, without it's frontalis muscle, for the skin coverage; a sculpted cartilaginous graft is inserted between these two flaps and sutured to the lining with the aim of obtaining a symmetrical nasal sidewall and the necessary rigidity to avoid the heminasal collapse during inspiration; 3rd stage: 4 weeks after the second stage, the pedicles of these two flaps are severed.

Images were acquired with a 1024\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01024 matrix and reconstructed with DLR and hybrid iterative reconstruction algorithm. To simulate conventional CT, images with a 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0512 matrix were also reconstructed. Two radiologists (R1, R2) independently evaluated the number of blood vessels entering the nidus and crossing the bone cortex, as well as vessel identification and image quality with a 5-point scale. Standard deviation (SD) of attenuation in the adjacent muscle and that of air were used as image noise and recorded.\nThirteen patients with 13 osteoid osteomas were included.

{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "The adrenal glands are paired retroperitoneal structures located above the kidneys. Adrenal glands are divided into two physiologically separated segments: the cortex and the medulla. The cortex has three distinct layers: the zona glomerulosa, which secretes aldosterone; the zona fasciculata, which secretes cortisol; and the zona reticularis, which secretes androgens. The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine in response to dopamine, which is secreted during stress reactions.\u00a0Cortical hyperplasia is enlargement of the adrenal glands, usually due to functional or, more commonly, non-functional nodules. Adrenal tumors are very common and often discovered incidentally on imaging for unrelated issues. Present in up to 4% of the general population, the incidence increases with age, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Increased detection is also due to imaging technology advances and increased frequency of imaging studies. For example, in the US and Canada, between 2000 and 2016, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computerized tomography (CT scans) performed doubled, and in some cases even tripled in number. These incidentally found lesions are often called \"incidentalomas\" due to the benign nature of most lesions. However, there are some exceptions, notably functional adrenal lesions (usually secreting cortisol) comprising fewer than 10% of the total lesions, and adrenocortical carcinoma, comprising fewer than 2% of all cases but with the potential for metastases. In addition, the adrenal gland is highly vascularized, despite its small size, and therefore is at risk for metastatic disease. The most common primary malignancies for this are lung (about 35%), gastrointestinal, kidney, and breast. Bilateral nodules are more common with metastatic disease than other etiologies, so this should raise concern for metastatic disease.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["NowreenHaq", "MehranTaherian", "PreetiRout"], "doi": null}
{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "Low back pain is a common cause of disability among the general population, with a well-documented cost burden placed on the U.S. healthcare system. There are multiple sources of chronic low back pain, often divided into whether the pain is facet-mediated, myofascial, herniation-related, secondary to fracture, or discogenic in nature. This article will focus on the pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of lumbosacral discogenic syndrome and pain arising from intervertebral disc pathology. Intervertebral discs are pads of fibrocartilage that sit between the spinal vertebrae, occupying roughly one-third of the height of the spinal column.\u00a0Their primary role is transmitting mechanical loading from body weight and muscle activity, allowing bending, flexion, and torsion of the bony spine. Each disc has two main components: a central, gel-like substance called the nucleus pulposus and an outer, firmer annulus fibrosis. The consistency of the nucleus is due to its water and proteoglycan content and is held together by a network of type II collagen and elastin fibers. This network's high anionic glycosaminoglycan content gives the nucleus pulposus its osmotic properties, allowing it to resist compression. The annulus fibrosis comprises bundles of type I collagen arranged in multiple oblique layers called lamellae. Characteristics of a normal, healthy disc demonstrate high water content in the nucleus and inner annulus. The outermost annulus provides tensile strength. A healthy disc is typically 7\u00a0to 10 mm thick and 4 cm in diameter in the lumbar region, with approximately 20 layers of lamellae. The sinuvertebral nerve (SVN) supplies the interverbal discs, which innervates the posterior annulus and posterior longitudinal ligament. In healthy subjects, the neural penetration of the annulus is about 3 mm, corresponding to the outer three lamellae. It is a mixed nerve containing a somatic root from the ventral ramus and an autonomic root from the grey ramus. Once the nerve takes a recurrent course through the intervertebral foramen and enters the spinal canal, it divides into superficial and deep networks. The superficial network branches to multiple vertebral levels and contains mostly sympathetic fibers, while the deep network contains primarily somatic fibers and innervates the corresponding segment. The intervertebral discs are relatively avascular, with the nucleus and inner annulus being supplied by capillaries that arise in the vertebral bodies and terminate at the bone-disc junction. Nutrients and small molecules such as glucose and oxygen reach the disc cells by diffusion.\u00a0Additionally, only the outermost portion of the annulus is vascularized. As a result, intervertebral discs are very limited in their ability to heal from injury, and degenerative changes overtake the healing process. This is not just due to avascularity but also to a decreased cell population, which diminishes the structure's ability to break down and turn over large collagen bundles. Axial back pain may be of discogenic origin. However, not all damaged or degenerated discs cause pain. Disc abnormalities are commonly seen on MRI in asymptomatic individuals. Considering other possible axial low back pain etiologies with similar clinical presentation, this presents a challenge to the treatment provider.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["SanketPathak", "TillConermann"], "doi": null}
{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "The reconstruction of large eyelid defects or scars\u00a0can present a significant clinical challenge; there is a need for static eyelid height that permits dynamic function and tear production while simultaneously preventing corneal exposure due to eyelid scarring and\u00a0retraction. Accomplishing these goals in an aesthetically sensitive area relies on eyelid-sharing\u00a0flap techniques. The underlying principle of eyelid-sharing flaps is replacing \"like-with-like\"; eyelid-sharing flaps provide well-vascularized local tissue with an excellent color and texture match.\u00a0The main goals of eyelid-sharing flap procedures are recreating a functional eyelid that protects the corneal surface, providing aesthetically pleasing reconstruction, and limiting the morbidity of the donor eyelid. Considering the reconstructive ladder is imperative in any attempt to repair a defect. The components of the reconstructive ladder, from simplest to most complex, include healing by secondary intention, immediate or delayed primary closure, employing split- or full-thickness skin grafts, using tissue expanders, or executing an adjacent tissue transfer, regional flap, or free flap. More minor eyelid defects may be well served using a free autograft or adjacent tissue transfer using a local or rotational flap. However, reconstruction\u00a0of defects encompassing\u00a0more\u00a0than 50% of the eyelid benefits from a staged procedure, allowing the transposition of vascularized tissue with\u00a0the later division of the vascular pedicle performed after the 1 to 4 weeks required for neovascularization. The staged eyelid-sharing flap techniques most commonly employed in lower and upper eyelid reconstruction are the Hughes and Cutler-Beard flap procedures.\u00a0 Wendell Hughes first described his eponymous tarsoconjunctival flap in 1937 to reconstruct lower lid defects encompassing more than 33% of the total lid area. This technique recreates a well-vascularized posterior lamella; the anterior lamellae can be reconstructed with a skin graft. Norman Cutler and Crowell Beard described their eponymous full-thickness cutaneoconjunctival flap in 1955 to reconstruct upper eyelid defects measuring\u00a0more\u00a0than 50% of the lid margin. Such defects are commonly encountered in the setting of congenital abnormalities, the resection of malignancies, and eyelid trauma, including burns.\u00a0The original description of the Cutler-Beard flap technique reconstructs the anterior and posterior lamellae but not necessarily the tarsus.

{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "The conjunctiva of the eye provides protection and lubrication of the eye by the\u00a0production of mucus and tears. It prevents microbial entrance into the eye and plays a role in immune surveillance. It lines the inside of\u00a0the eyelids and provides a covering to the sclera. It is highly vascularized\u00a0and home to extensive lymphatic vessels. The conjunctiva can be divided into three regions: the palpebral or tarsal conjunctiva, the bulbar or ocular conjunctiva, and the conjunctival fornices. The palpebral conjunctiva is further divided into the marginal, tarsal, and orbital regions. The bulbar conjunctiva is divided into scleral and limbal parts. Finally, the conjunctival fornices are divided into the superior, inferior, lateral, and medial regions. The palpebral conjunctiva lines the eyelids. The bulbar conjunctiva is found on the eyeball over the anterior sclera. Tenon's capsule binds it to the underlying sclera. The potential space between Tenon\u2019s capsule and the sclera is frequently used for local anesthesia. The conjunctiva has an average thickness of 33 microns. Lastly, the conjunctival fornices form the junction between the palpebral and bulbar conjunctivas. This protective covering is loose and flexible, unlike its bulbar counterpart, allowing for movement of the globe and eyelids. The conjunctiva of the eye consists of an epithelial layer composed of stratified squamous and stratified columnar epithelium. It is non-keratinized with interspersed goblet cells. There are also present within this epithelial layer blood vessels, fibrous tissue, lymphatic channels, melanocytes, T- and B-cell lymphocytes, Langerhans cells, and accessory lacrimal glands. A deeper layer, the substantia propria or conjunctival submucosa, consists of superficial lymphoid and fibrous tissue. The substantia propria is a tissue layer that only exists in the conjunctiva, but not in other eye tissues. Numerous lymphocytes, mast cells, plasma cells, and neutrophils are present within this connective tissue layer. Finally, the deepest fibrous layer contains the nerves and vessels providing innervation and blood supply to the conjunctiva. Also located\u00a0within this deep layer are the glands of Krause.\u00a0 The conjunctival epithelium has a thickness of 3 to 5 cell layers thick. The basal cells of the epithelium are cuboidal and become more flattened as they approach the surface. In the area closest to the fornix, the conjunctiva has the greatest number of goblet cells. These unicellular mucous glands are especially common in the inferior and medial conjunctiva and near the medial canthus. Away from the fornix, the number of goblet cells decreases. Additionally, the fornix has a greater number of patches of lymphocytes, which are mostly suppressor T-cells.

FD is characterized by a decreasing width of the peripheral cornea between the arcus senilis and limbus. Very little focus has been made on further examining the pathophysiology and etiology of furrow degeneration, possibly due to its benign course. Unlike many other corneal degenerative diseases, furrow degeneration lacks true vascularization and inflammation as part of the pathological pathway, leading to a painless, and asymptomatic, thinning of the peripheral cornea with a low risk of perforation and little need for medical follow up. Patients with FD will not experience any changes in vision due to the circumferential thinning that occurs evenly throughout the cornea. A few case studies have been conducted that show the natural progression of the disease; however, due to its rarity, many questions remain unanswered.

{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "Organ transplantation is the removal of an organ from one person (the donor), and placement into another (the recipient). Transplantation is performed in patients with end-stage organ failure and can increase life expectancy while also improving the patient's quality of life. The most commonly transplanted solid organ is the kidney, followed by the liver, heart, and lungs. Pancreatic and intestinal transplants are performed as well but are less common. More recently, vascularized composite allografts (VCAs, e.g., face, hand, penis) have been performed for reconstructive procedures.\u00a0Non-vital tissues, such as bones, corneas, and tendons, may also be transplanted. Organ donations can arise from living or deceased donors, but deceased donors are more common. Deceased patients are the major contributor to donor organs, and the most common causes of death are cerebrovascular accidents followed closely by traumatic brain injuries. In recent years, opioid overdoses have become another significant source of deceased organ donation.\u00a0The dead donor rule holds that patients must be declared dead before the harvesting of donor organs. Donations can arise from patients who have suffered brain death or circulatory death.\u00a0Brain death is a clinical diagnosis, defined as\u00a0the permanent loss of brain function. This condition requires an irreversible loss of consciousness, absence of brain stem reflexes, and a lack of spontaneous respiration.\u00a0The diagnosis of brain death must be made before organ harvesting occurs. The definition of circulatory death is the irreversible loss of cardiopulmonary function.\u00a0Donation after circulatory death has been increasing in attempts to address the demand/supply mismatch of donor organs worldwide.\u00a0This process involves the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, followed by a declaration of death after permanent cessation of circulation. To avoid any conflicts of interest, the decision to withdraw care must take place before any discussion of organ donation, and members of the organ procurement/transplant teams should not be involved in the process of care withdrawal or the declaration of death. Living donations are less common but still serve to increase the existing donor pool. Over 7300 living donations were performed in the United States in 2019, saving patients from a potentially long-wait on the transplant list. The most frequently donated organ is a kidney, but portions of the liver or lung are transplanted as well. More recently, living donations of VCAs have been explored.\u00a0There are three types of living donations, the most common being directed donation. In directed donations, the donor designates to whom their organ will be given - most frequently a family member or close social acquaintance. In non-directed donation, also-known-as altruistic donation, the donor does not specify a recipient, and the organ is matched to a patient in need. Paired donations are more complicated, but generally involved two (or more) patients with a willing donor who is not a match for them. The pairs are then grouped, and the organs are 'traded' to ensure that all patients receive a compatible transplant. Living donations are considered safe, as donation has shown limited harmful outcomes,\u00a0but patients must be closely followed to assess for medical and psychological harm.\u00a0Long-term studies have suggested no adverse psychological outcomes with a living donation, and high levels of overall life satisfaction, both for directed and non-directed donation.\u00a0Non-donors - potential donors who were unable to donate due to a negative match or withdrawal from consideration - were found to have lower levels of life satisfaction than living donors. The number of patients awaiting organ transplantation far outstrips the availability of donor organs. In the United States, estimates are that a new patient is added to the transplant list every ten minutes, and twenty patients die every day while awaiting transplant. In 2019, surgeons performed nearly 40,000 transplants, but at the end of the year, over 110,000 patients remained on the waiting list. While there are multiple ways\u00a0to consent to organ donation (including a signed donor designation, designation on a driver's license, or signed consent from the deceased's next-of-kin), the estimate is that only 30\u00a0to 40% of potential donors in the United States become actual organ donors.\u00a0Approximately 80% of Americans support organ donation, but only 40% have an appropriate designation in place to donate their organs after death. This disconnect can be attributed, in part, to how the question of donation is presented.\u00a0The United States operates under an opt-in system, where the default is not to be an organ donor, and an active action is necessary to become an organ donor. In an alternative strategy, the\u00a0presumed consent system, citizens are designated as organ donors unless they elect to opt-out. This strategy, commonly used in retirement savings, has shown mixed results in practice, with increased organ donation in countries with very low rates,\u00a0but no significant increase in others.\u00a0Critics of this strategy argue that the policy is unethical, as failing to object is not equivalent to informed consent.\u00a0Others have shown that increasing the pool of potential donors will not increase the number of transplants performed if the proper infrastructure is not in place.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["Ryan D.Rosen", "AbhishekSingh", "BrackenBurns"], "doi": null}

{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "Skin grafting is the transfer of cutaneous tissue from one portion of the body to another, often used to cover large wounds. The rationale of skin grafts is to take skin from a donor site that will heal and transfer the skin to an area of need. After incorporation, skin grafts provide wounds with protection from the environment, pathogens, temperature, and excessive water loss like normal skin. A split-thickness skin graft (STSG), by definition, refers to a graft that contains the epidermis and a portion of the dermis, which is in contrast to a full-thickness skin graft (FTSG) which consists of the epidermis and entire dermis. Unlike flaps, skin grafts\u00a0do not have their own blood supply, so they must rely on a well-vascularized wound bed for graft in-growth.\u00a0Split-thickness skin grafts are obtainable from multiple sources (autograft, homograft, allograft, or xenograft), multiple anatomical locations, and in various thicknesses. Most commonly, STSG autografts are taken from the lateral thigh, as well as\u00a0trunk, as these sites are both aesthetically hidden, as well as easy to harvest from due to their broad surfaces. Split-thickness skin grafts classify according to their thickness into thin STSGs (0.15 to 0.3mm), intermediate STSGs (0.3 to 0.45mm), and thick STSGs (0.45\u00a0to 0.6mm).\u00a0Because split-thickness skin graft donor sites retain portions of the dermis, including dermal appendages, the donor site can regrow new skin in 2 to 3 weeks. Thus, donor sites can be used more than once after appropriate healing has taken place, which makes STSGs versatile in burn surgery and large wounds where there are limited donor sites. The advantages and disadvantages of STSGs are best highlighted by comparison\u00a0with FTSGs. Considerations of proper skin graft selection should include graft take, contracture of skin graft, donor site morbidity, aesthetic match, and durability.

{"title": "In view of ovarian steroidogenesis and luteal construction to explore the effects of Bushen Huoxue recipe in mice of ovarian hyperstimulation.", "abstract": "Bushen Huoxue recipe (BSHXR) is a widely used prescription medicine for treating gynecological diseases. We have previously found that BSHXR can improve the pregnancy outcome of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) mice by modulating the abnormal high level of progesterone. While the pharmacological mechanism of such therapeutic effect is not clear.\nWe aimed to investigate the effects of BSHXR on the ovarian steroidogenesis and luteal function in mice undergoing COH.\nA COH mouse model was established via an intraperitoneal injection of 0.4 IU/g pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and 1 IU/g human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). The histological features of ovaries were observed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. The expression levels of FSHR, LHCGR, and key molecules in ovarian steroidogenesis, including CYP11A1, CYP17A1, CYP19A1, HSD3B1, and StAR, were examined via immunohistochemical staining, western blotting, and RT-qPCR. CD31, VEGFA, and FGF2 levels were assessed to evaluate ovarian vascularization. The protein and mRNA levels of ovarian ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, MEK1/2, and p-MEK1/2 were also detected using western blotting, RT-qPCR, or immunofluorescence staining.\nCOH mice had a significantly increased volume and weight of the ovary and number of corpora lutea. In particular, COH exhibited a long-term influence on ovarian FSHR and LHCGR expression, disrupting the levels of CYP11A1, HSD3B1, and CYP17A1, causing poorer luteal angiogenesis. Compared with normal mice, the expression levels of ovarian VEGFA and FGF2 in COH mice were considerably lower on Day 1 after PMSG. On concomitant HCG treatment, both VEGFA and FGF2 expression surged dramatically on ED1 and then declined on ED4 and ED8. Moreover, the expression pattern of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 was almost consistent with that of VEGFA and FGF2. After treatment, BSHXR increased ovarian LHCGR, FSHR, CYP11A1, HSD3B1, and CYP17A1 levels, boosted luteal vascularization, and restored MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling in COH mice.\nBSHXR restored the abnormally high progesterone level by regulating the CYP11A1 and HSD3B1 expression as well as promoted luteal angiogenesis, which was related with LHCGR-MEK1/2-ERK1/2-VEGFA/FGF2 signaling pathway in the ovary. This effect prevented the fluctuation of sex hormones in COH mice and benefited the outcome of pregnancy.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2023-07-22", "authors": ["YufanSong", "RunanHu", "FanLi", "YanjingHuang", "ZhuoLiu", "YuliGeng", "JiahuiDing", "WenwenMa", "KunkunSong", "HaoxuDong", "MingminZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2023.116913"}

Biodegradable nerve conduits, which are currently commercially available, include Chitosan or collagen-based ones. As histological aspects of their degradation are highly relevant for the progress of neuronal regeneration, the aim of this study was to report the histopathological signs of such nerve conduits, which were removed during revision surgery.\nEither Chitosan (n\u2009=\u20092) or collagen (n\u2009=\u20092) nerve conduits were implanted after neuroma resection and nerve grafting (n\u2009=\u20092) or traumatic nerve lesion after cut (n\u2009=\u20091) or crush injury (n\u2009=\u20091) in two females and two men, aged between 17 and 57\u2009years. Revision surgery with removal of the nerve conduits was indicated due to persisting neuropathic pain and sensorimotor deficits, limited joint motion, or neurolysis with hardware removal at a median time of 17\u2009months (range: 5.5-48\u2009months). Histopathological analyses of all removed nerve conduits were performed.\nA scar neuroma was diagnosed in one out of four patients. Mechanical complication occurred in one patient after nerve conduit implantation bridged over finger joints. Intraoperatively no or only initial signs of degradation of the nerve conduits were observed. Chitosan conduits revealed largely unchanged shape and structure of chitosan, and coating of the conduit by a vascularized fibrous membrane. The latter contained deposits taken up by macrophages, most likely representing dissolved chitosan. Characteristic histopathologic features of the degradation of collagen conduits were a disintegration of the compact collagen into separate fine circular strands, No foreign body reaction was observed in all removed nerve conduits.\nBoth Chitosan nerve conduits have not been degraded. The collagen nerve conduits showed a beginning degradation process. Furthermore, wrapping the repaired nerve with a nerve conduit did neither prevent adhesions nor improved nerve gliding. Therefore, biodegradation in time should be particularly addressed in further developments of nerve conduits.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2023-07-21", "authors": ["SusanneRein", "RalfSchober", "JulianPoetschke", "ThomasKremer"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.31093"}

Previous studies have confirmed the indispensable role of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 in normal pregnancy. Bushen Antai recipe (BAR) is a satisfactory formula commonly used in practice, based on the rationale of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for SA.\nThe current study explores the potential therapeutic effects and mechanistic insights of BAR in STAT3-deficient abortion-prone mice.\nA STAT3-deficient abortion-prone mouse model was developed using intraperitoneal injection of stattic from embryo day (ED) 5.5 to ED9.5 among pregnant females (C57BL/6). We separately administered BAR1 (5.7\u00a0g/kg), BAR2 (11.4\u00a0g/kg), progesterone (P4), or distilled water at 10\u00a0ml/kg/day from ED0.5 until ED10.5. The embryo resorption rate and placenta-uterus structure were observed on ED10.5. The systemic immune status was examined by analyzing the frequency of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), the ratio of two macrophage (M) subtypes, and the protein expression of associated molecules. Morphological observation, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting were used to evaluate the vascularization conditions at the maternal-fetal interface.\nBAR1, BAR2, or P4 treatment exerted remarkable effects in alleviating embryo resorption rate and disordered placental-uterus structure in STAT3-deficient abortion-prone mice. Western blotting indicated the deficiency of phosphorylated STAT3 and two prime target molecules, PR and HIF-1\u03b1, at the maternal-fetal interface under STAT3 inhibition.

The systemic immune environment was disrupted, indicated by the reduced serum cytokine concentrations, MDSCs frequency, M2/M1 ratio, and the expression of immunomodulatory factors. Nonetheless, BAR2 or P4 treatment revived the immune tolerance for semi-allogenic embryos by enhancing the immune cells and factors. Besides, the western blot and immunohistochemistry results revealed that BAR2 or P4 treatment upregulated VEGFA/FGF2 and activated ERK/AKT phosphorylation.

In the Myrtaceae, three types of colleters were previously described: petaloid, conical, and euriform. In Argentina, most species of the Myrtaceae family grow in subtropical regions and a few in the temperate-cold zones of Patagonia. We evaluated the vegetative buds of five species of the subfamily Myrtoideae, tribe Myrtea: Amomyrtus luma, Luma apiculata, and Myrceugenia exsucca, native to the temperate rainforests of Patagonia and Myrcianthes pungens and Eugenia moraviana from the riparian forest of northwestern Corrientes, in order to analyze the presence and morphological types and main secretion products of colleters. Optical and scanning electron microscopy was used to identify the presence of colleters in vegetative organs. Histochemical tests were performed to identify the main secretion products in these structures. The colleters are on the inner side of the leaf primordia and cataphylls and on the edge of the petiole, where they replace the stipules. They are classified as homogeneous because they consist of epidermis and internal parenchyma, both formed by cells with similar characteristics. They lack vascularization and originate from the protodermis.

{"title": "Synergistic effect of cold gas plasma and experimental drug exposure exhibits skin cancer toxicity in vitro and in vivo.", "abstract": "Skin cancer is often fatal, which motivates new therapy avenues. Recent advances in cancer treatment are indicative of the importance of combination treatments in oncology. Previous studies have identified small molecule-based therapies and redox-based technologies, including photodynamic therapy or medical gas plasma, as promising candidates to target skin cancer.\nWe aimed to identify effective combinations of experimental small molecules with cold gas plasma for therapy in dermato-oncology.\nPromising drug candidates were identified after screening an in-house 155-compound library using 3D skin cancer spheroids and high content imaging. Combination effects of selected drugs and cold gas plasma were investigated with respect to oxidative stress, invasion, and viability. Drugs that had combined well with cold gas plasma were further investigated in vascularized tumor organoids in ovo and a xenograft mouse melanoma model in vivo.\nThe two chromone derivatives Sm837 and IS112 enhanced cold gas plasma-induced oxidative stress, including histone 2A.X phosphorylation, and further reduced proliferation and skin cancer cell viability. Combination treatments of tumor organoids grown in ovo confirmed the principal anti-cancer effect of the selected drugs. While one of the two compounds exerted severe toxicity in vivo, the other (Sm837) resulted in a significant synergistic anti-tumor toxicity at good tolerability. Principal component analysis of protein phosphorylation profiles confirmed profound combination treatment effects in contrast to the monotherapies.\nWe identified a novel compound that, combined with topical cold gas plasma-induced oxidative stress, represents a novel and promising treatment approach to target skin cancer.", "journal": "Journal of advanced research", "date": "2023-07-01", "authors": ["LarsBoeckmann", "JuliaBerner", "MarcelKordt", "EleaLenz", "MirijamSch\u00e4fer", "Marie-LuiseSemmler", "AnnaFrey", "Sanjeev KumarSagwal", "HenrikeRebl", "LeaMiebach", "FelixNiessner", "MarieSawade", "MartinHein", "RobertRamer", "EberhardGrambow", "ChristianSeebauer", "Thomasvon Woedtke", "BarbaraNebe", "Hans-RobertMetelmann", "PeterLanger", "BurkhardHinz", "BrigitteVollmar", "SteffenEmmert", "SanderBekeschus"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jare.2023.06.014\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2012.10830.x\n10.1111/1346-8138.15804\n10.1200/JCO.2010.33.2312\n10.3238/arztebl.2019.0497\n10.2174/138920010791526060\n10.1016/j.redox.2020.101753\n10.1016/j.mam.2018.02.003\n10.1016/j.addr.2009.02.005\n10.3390/cancers12071748\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2013.12.007\n10.1111/php.13190\n10.1155/2021/6816214\n10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03243.x\n10.1038/s41580-022-00456-z\n10.1016/j.redox.2021.102116\n10.1109/trpms.2021.3135118\n10.1088/0022-3727/45/26/263001\n10.1088/0741-3335/59/1/014031\n10.1088/0022-3727/47/14/145201\n10.1088/0022-3727/46/27/275201\n10.3390/app10196898\n10.1088/1361-6463/ac9398\n10.1016/j.cpme.2015.02.001\n10.1016/j.cpme.2017.09.001\n10.1016/j.jcms.2016.07.001\n10.1016/j.jaad.2016.09.004\n10.1111/jdv.14465\n10.1038/s41392-021-00572-w\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2082\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4709\n10.1002/ppap.201900088\n10.1088/1361-6463/aab3ad\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2022.01.014\n10.3390/cancers12071993\n10.3389/fphy.2020.569618\n10.3390/cancers12123575\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0589\n10.1002/advs.202003395\n10.1074/jbc.M114.603555\n10.1016/j.redox.2016.07.004\n10.1155/2021/2060986\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.04.026\n10.1007/s12325-016-0338-1\n10.1182/blood-2015-12-687814\n10.1002/smll.201703617\n10.1038/nrc.2017.17\n10.1002/advs.202204365\n10.1002/adfm.202100243\n10.1038/s41467-018-06655-7\n10.1002/advs.201903438\n10.1038/s41598-021-94130-7\n10.1088/1361-6463/aaafc4\n10.1038/s41419-018-1221-6\n10.5812/ijpr-124106\n10.3390/ijms21207646\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2022.03.001\n10.3390/ijms22083956\n10.1002/ppap.202000226\n10.1371/journal.pone.0052653\n10.1002/ppap.201500123\n10.3390/cancers12020348\n10.1038/s41598-018-31031-2\n10.1109/Tps.2010.2041075\n10.3390/cimb44050135\n10.3390/cancers11122011\n10.1021/acsami.8b16487\n10.1038/bjc.2016.12\n10.1038/s41598-020-73457-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0064498\n10.3390/cancers13081780\n10.3390/cancers14133116\n10.3390/cancers13174485\n10.1063/5.0017913\n10.1021/acsabm.2c00018\n10.1002/ppap.201900258\n10.1016/j.fitote.2019.04.012\n10.1515/znc-2007-5-622\n10.1111/cbdd.13951\n10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01720\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.164\n10.1038/emm.2016.174\n10.1002/cyto.a.20426\n10.1155/2019/8535163\n10.1016/j.bpj.2017.04.030\n10.1016/j.ejmech.2016.05.053\n10.18632/oncotarget.2566\n10.1038/s41467-019-11622-x\n10.1007/s13167-021-00242-5"}
{"title": "The Optimal Layer for Breast Augmentation in an Autologous Fat Grafting Murine Model.", "abstract": "Fat grafting is an effective procedure for breast augmentation, but the variations in this technique result in unpredictable fat retention. Therefore, animal models are needed to simulate the operation and the optimal layer for fat retention.\nAn autologous fat grafting murine model for breast augmentation was built to detect a new layer for fat grafting in the chest.\nThe left side of the female rat inguinal fat flap was harvested, dissected into small pieces, and autotransplanted into 3 different layers of the breast. Retention rate and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were measured at 1, 4, 8 12, and 16 weeks. Immunofluorescence staining was utilized to detect adipocytes and endothelial cells, and immunohistochemistry was conducted to evaluate the expression of integrins \u03b21 and \u03b16.\nThe volume of fat grafts slightly grew in the intramuscular and submuscular layers at Week 4. Retention rates in the subcutaneous layer and submuscular layer were significantly higher than the intramuscular layer at Week 16. H&E staining showed that oil cysts existed in the subcutaneous layer throughout the 16 weeks. At the terminal time point, well-vascularized mature adipose structures were observed in intramuscular and submuscular layers, with smaller adipocytes in intramuscular layers. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that integrin \u03b21 was identically expressed in every adipocyte in all the layers, whereas integrin \u03b16 selectively expressed in bigger adipocytes in the intramuscular layer. The expression intensities of integrin \u03b21 and \u03b16 were significantly higher in the intramuscular layer than in the subcutaneous and submuscular layers.\nThe angiogenic and moderate mechanical environment makes the submuscular layer the optimal layer for fat retention.", "journal": "Aesthetic surgery journal", "date": "2023-06-27", "authors": ["ZiangZhang", "ZijinQin", "YuLi", "JieLong", "GuoChen", "BotaoGao", "XuhuaZhou", "YugeZhang", "BaoqiangSong"], "doi": "10.1093/asj/sjad201"}

Current approaches utilize a variety of materials including free mucosal grafts and vascularized flaps, but post-op leaks continue to be reported. Steroid-eluting bioabsorbable stents (SES) are used during functional endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis to reduce inflammation and scarring while maintaining patency of sinus ostia.\nThe aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of SES as a graft/flap bolster for endoscopic endonasal CSF leak repair.\nThis is a retrospective review of patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal CSF leak repair with SES placed as part of the bolster technique at a tertiary care center between January 2019 and May 2022. Age, sex, BMI, comorbid idiopathic intracranial hypertension, pathology, location of CSF leak, intraoperative CSF leak flow, reconstruction type, and presence of post-op CSF leak were recorded.\nTwelve patients (mean age 52, median BMI 30.9, 58% female) had SES placement as part of the bolster technique. The most common pathology was meningoencephalocele (75%). Reconstruction was performed with either a free mucosal graft (6), or a flap (6). No post-op CSF leaks occurred at a reconstruction site with a stent, and no known complications were reported.

In patients afflicted with critical limb ischemia, comorbidities may limit common revascularization strategies. Cell-encapsulating modular microbeads possess a variety of advantageous properties, including the ability to support prevascularization in vitro while retaining the ability to be injected in a minimally invasive manner in vivo. Here, fibrin microbeads containing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were cultured in suspension for 3\u2009days (D3 PC microbeads) before being implanted within intramuscular pockets in a SCID mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. By 14\u2009days post-surgery, animals treated with D3 PC microbeads showed increased macroscopic reperfusion of ischemic foot pads and improved limb salvage compared to the cellular controls. Delivery of HUVEC and MSC via microbeads led to the formation of extensive microvascular networks throughout the implants. Engineered vessels of human origins showed evidence of inosculation with host vasculature, as indicated by erythrocytes present in hCD31+ vessels. Over time, the total number of human-derived vessels within the implant region decreased as networks remodeled and an increase in mature, pericyte-supported vascular structures was observed.

This article reviews the unique considerations for VCA candidacy in postsepsis patients with upper limb amputation. These insights may also be relevant to postsepsis patients undergoing other forms of transplantation or to VCA patients requiring additional future solid organ transplants.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2023-06-05", "authors": ["Kevin JZuo", "David ALeonard", "Jaimie TShores", "Simon GTalbot"], "doi": "10.1097/TP.0000000000004665"}

Surgical interventions are usually considered when functional use of the finger cannot be obtained after intense hand therapy. The authors introduce their newly described lambda (\u03bb) repair, which is an easy-to-learn, straightforward surgical technique. The method involves an end-to-side tenorrhaphy of the lateral bands, resembling the Greek \u03bb. Patients who underwent a lambda repair were retrospectively evaluated with preoperative and postoperative measurements of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint movement. Four patients (two male, two female; median age, 35.5 years) with a median follow-up period of 9.1 months were included. Three patients underwent lambda repairs for isolated boutonni\u00e8re deformities, and one patient received a vascularized free toe transfer combined with a lambda repair. The preoperative average PIP joint extension lag or deficit was 28.75 degrees and could be reduced to 15 degrees. Preoperative average PIP joint active flexion was 60 degrees, which was improved to 88.75 degrees. No complications were observed.

Chemosensitivity assay was used to measure the impact of CLCA1 on Sorafenib.\nCLCA1 was dramatically downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and tissues. Ectopic expression of CLCA1 induced cell apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest while suppressed cell growth, inhibited migration and invasion, reversal of epithelial mesenchymal transition in vitro and reduced xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, CLCA1 could co-localize and interact with TGFB1, thereby suppressing HCC angiogenesis through the TGFB1/SMAD/VEGF signaling cascade in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, CLCA1 also enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to the first-line targeted therapy, Sorafenib.\nCLCA1 sensitizes HCC cells to Sorafenib and suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma angiogenesis through downregulating TGFB1 signaling cascade.

The adipose layer appears to gradually thin or even disappear in long-term expansion. The response and contribution of adipose tissue to skin expansion remain to be elucidated.\nThe authors established a novel expansion model by transplanting luciferase-transgenic adipose tissue into the rat dorsum, followed by integrated expansion, to trace the dynamic changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue during expansion and the migration of adipose tissue-derived cells. In vivo luminescent imaging was performed to continuously track the adipose tissue changes. Histologic analysis and immunohistochemical staining evaluated the regeneration and vascularization of the expanded skin. Growth factor expression in expanded skin with or without adipose tissue was determined to evaluate the paracrine effect of adipose tissue. Adipose tissue-derived cells were traced in vitro by anti-luciferase staining, and their fate was determined by costaining for PDGFR\u03b1, DLK1, and CD31.\nIn vivo bioimaging showed that cells in adipose tissue were alive during expansion. After expansion, the adipose tissue exhibited fibrotic-like structures, with more DLK1 + preadipocytes. Skin expanded with adipose tissue was significantly thicker than that without adipose tissue, with more blood vessels and cell proliferation. Vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor expression was higher in adipose tissue than in skin, indicating paracrine support from adipose tissue. Luciferase-positive adipose tissue-derived cells were observed in expanded skin, indicating direct participation in skin regeneration.\nAdipose tissue transplantation can effectively promote long-term skin expansion by contributing to vascularization and cell proliferation by means of various mechanisms.\nThe authors' findings suggest that it would be better if the expander pocket is dissected over the superficial fascia to preserve a layer of adipose tissue with skin.

The acellular adipose matrix (AAM) is a promising biomaterial for the construction of engineered adipose tissue. However, AAM lacks sufficient adipoinduction potency because of the abundant loss of matrix-bound adipokines during decellularization.\nAn adipose-derived extracellular matrix collagen scaffold, \"adipose collagen fragment\" (ACF), was prepared using a novel mechanical method that provides sustained release of adipokines. Here, the authors used label-free proteomics methods to detect the protein components in AAM and ACF. In vivo, ACF was incorporated into AAM or acellular dermal matrix and implanted into nude mice to evaluate adipogenesis. Neoadipocytes, neovessels, and corresponding gene expression were evaluated. The effects of ACF on adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells and tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells were tested in vitro.\nProteomics analysis showed that ACF contains diverse adipogenic and angiogenic proteins. ACF can release diverse adipokines and induce highly vascularized, mature adipose tissue in AAM, and even in nonadipogenic acellular dermal matrix. Higher expression of adipogenic markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha and greater numbers of tubule structures were observed in ACF-treated groups in vitro.\nThe combination of ACF and AAM could serve as a novel and promising strategy to construct mature, vascularized adipose tissue for soft-tissue reconstruction.\nThe combined use of AAM and ACF has been proven to induce a highly vascularized, mature, engineered adipose tissue in the nude mouse model, which may serve as a promising strategy for soft-tissue reconstruction.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2023-05-12", "authors": ["MimiXu", "YunfanHe", "YibaoLi", "KaiyangLiu", "YuchenZhang", "TingSu", "YaoYao", "XiaoxuanJin", "XiangdongZhang", "FengLu"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0000000000010649"}

Six specimens were used, and their arterial systems filled with red latex before fixation in 10% formaldehyde, and fragments of the rete mirabile were processed for histological analysis using light and scanning electron microscopy. In these species, the aortic arch had two branches: the brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery. The initial portion of the abdominal aorta presented four different ramifications, besides to the peculiarities of the adrenal, renal, and iliac arteries. Microscopy of the rete mirabile revealed a muscular artery surrounded by smaller muscular arteries, veins, nerves, and lymphatic tissue joined by connective tissue. Thus, the data obtained have clinical and surgical importance, with applicability in procedures involving vascularization of the thoracic and abdominal organs. We suggest that the rete mirabile is an efficient thermoregulatory structure because it allows the accumulation of blood and the countercurrent heat exchange, as there is no blood mixing.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2023-04-29", "authors": ["Natacha Cintia FerreiraFernandes", "\u00c9rikaBranco", "Elisa Carla BarraFreire", "Andr\u00e9 Luisde Sousa Nogueira Lima", "Elane GuerreiroGiese", "Ellen Yasmin EguchiMesquita", "Ana Ritade Lima"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.25232"}

Guided by the all-in-one-step reconstruction rule, the chimeric superficial circumflex iliac artery perforator (SCIAP) flap, generally considered as a promising multiple-type tissue provider (eg, vascularized skin paddle, fascia, iliac flap), can fulfill the reconstructive demands and has an edge over the two-stage countermeasure. The authors adopted tripartite SCIAP flaps to reconstruct distal complex thumb or toe injuries in eight cases (six thumbs and two halluces), all of which were reattached with vascularized fascia lata-iliac crest conjunctions using a pull-out technique. All SCIAP flaps survived uneventfully without donor-site complications. The remodeled interphalangeal joints regained nearly normal radiologic manifestation. The chimeric SCIAP flap may be a promising technique for distal complex extensor tendon injury; providing vascularized skin paddle and fascia lata-iliac crest graft, it also qualifies for the all-in-one-stage reconstruction concept.\nTherapeutic, IV.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2023-04-27", "authors": ["TinggangChu", "JianXiao", "XijieZhou", "KangLin", "ZhenyuTao"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0000000000010599"}

In the setting of ambiguity regarding coding for physiologic procedures [lymphovenous bypass (LVB) and vascularized lymph node transplant (VLNT)], we hypothesized that there would be variation in commercial reimbursement based on coding pattern.\nThe authors performed a cross-sectional analysis of 2021 nationwide hospital pricing data for 21 CPT codes encompassing excisional (direct excision, liposuction), physiologic (LVB, VLNT), and ancillary (lymphangiography) procedures. Within-hospital ratios (WHRs) and across-hospital ratios (AHRs) for adjusted commercial rates per CPT code quantified price variation. Mixed effects linear regression modeled associations of commercial rate with public payer (Medicare and Medicaid), self-pay, and chargemaster rates.\nA total of 270,254 commercial rates, including 95,774 rates for physiologic procedures, were extracted from 2863 hospitals. Lymphangiography codes varied most in commercial price (WHR, 1.76 to 3.89; AHR, 8.12 to 44.38). For physiologic codes, WHRs ranged from 1.01 (VLNT; free omental flap) to 3.03 (LVB; unlisted lymphatic procedure), and AHRs ranged from 5.23 (LVB; lymphatic channel incision) to 10.36 (LVB; unlisted lymphatic procedure). Median adjusted commercial rates for excisional procedures ($3635.84) were higher than for physiologic procedures ($2560.40; P < 0.001). Commercial rate positively correlated with Medicare rate for all physiologic codes combined, although regression coefficients varied by code.\nCommercial payer-negotiated rates for physiologic procedures were highly variable both within and across hospitals, reflective of variation in CPT codes.

Postoperative computed tomography (CT) data of all patients were collected at each postoperative follow-up point, and after the age of 18 years. The length and height of the grafted fibula and the length of the remaining mandible were evaluated by measuring the three-dimensional CT data using ProPlan CMF 3.0 software. Lower limb function was evaluated using the Enneking evaluation scale. Facial symmetry was self-evaluated and scored. Statistical analysis was performed on the data obtained.\nFourteen patients were included in this study. All flaps were successful. The CT measurement results showed growth in the length of the grafted fibula that reconstructed the mandibular ramus and the residual mandible ( P < 0.05). The height of the grafted fibula remained stable ( P > 0.05). Eight patients were followed up until they were older than 18 years, and the CT measurement results after 18 years showed an essentially symmetric mandible profile ( P > 0.05). All patients were satisfied with their postoperative facial symmetry.

The arteriovenous loop (AVL) technique can overcome this issue by allowing for the de novo generation of axially vascularized soft-tissue flaps from vein grafts embedded into different matrices. Application of the AVL technique has been limited by insufficient long-term volume retention and poor tissue stability. The authors investigated the suitability of a novel human dermal scaffold to improve volume retention and tissue stability.\nAVLs were created in 28 immunocompetent rats and embedded in either decellularized human dermal scaffolds (experimental group, n = 14) (Epiflex) or bovine collagen/elastin matrices (control group, n = 14) (MatriDerm) in subcutaneous polytetrafluoroethylene chambers. The weight and volume of engineered tissues, the extent of angiogenesis, and the proportion of proliferating cells were compared between groups on postoperative days (PODs) 21 and 28 by means of immunohistochemistry and micro-computed tomography.\nOn POD 28, both groups displayed homogeneous microvascular networks on histopathology and micro-computed tomography. Mean microvessel counts and surface areas and the percentage of proliferating cells did not differ between the groups. However, the experimental human scaffold group displayed significantly smaller volume loss and significantly less tissue degradation compared with bovine matrix controls (volume retention, 102% \u00b1 5% versus 27% \u00b1 7% on POD 21, and 79% \u00b1 12% versus 12% \u00b1 7% on POD 28, respectively; P < 0.0001).\nCompared with bovine matrices, decellularized human scaffolds allow for superior volume retention and tissue stability of de novo engineered soft-tissue AVL flaps in rats.\nAVLs allow for the de novo generation of vascularized soft-tissue flaps.

All subcutaneous tissue was removed from these samples sterilely. Host CD-1 nude mice were then anesthetized, and dorsal skin was sterilized. A 1.2-cm-diameter, full-thickness section of dorsal skin was excised. The foreskin sample was then placed into the full-thickness defect in the host mice and sutured into place. Xenografts underwent dermal wounding using a 4-mm punch biopsy after engraftment. Xenografts were monitored for 14 days after wounding and then harvested.\nAt 14 days postoperatively, all mice survived the procedure. Grossly, the xenograft wounds showed formation of a human scar at postoperative day 14. Hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichome staining confirmed scar formation in the wounded human skin. Using a novel artificial intelligence algorithm using picrosirius red staining, scar formation was confirmed in human wounded skin compared with the unwounded skin. Histologically, CD31 + immunostaining confirmed vascularization of the xenograft. The xenograft exclusively showed human collagen type I, CD26 + , and human nuclear antigen in the human scar without any staining of these human markers in the murine skin.\nThe proposed model demonstrates wound healing to be a local response from tissue resident human fibroblasts and allows for reproducible evaluation of human skin wound repair in a preclinical model.\nRadiation-induced fibrosis is a widely prevalent clinical phenomenon without a well-defined treatment at this time.

{"title": "Effect of Acupuncture on Endometrial Blood Flow in Women Undergoing in vitro Fertilization Embryo Transfer: A Single Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial.", "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of manual acupuncture on endometrial blood flow parameters by three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler ultrasound in women undergoing in vitro fertilization embryo transfer (IVF-ET).\nSeventy patients undergoing IVF-ET were equally randomized into traditional or sham acupuncture treatment group for totally 4 days (from the day of oocyte aspiration to the day of embryo transfer) of treatment by random envelope method at the Reproductive Medicine Center and Outpatient Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medicine College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 2013 to December 2015. Patients in the traditional acupuncture group accepted traditional acupuncture methods with manual acupuncture, and Zhongji (CV3), Qihai (CV 6), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Taichong (LR 3), Tianshu (ST 25), Guilai (ST 29) and Zusanli (ST 36) were chosen. Patients at the sham acupuncture group accepted shallow acupuncture methods at 4 non-meridian points at each shoulder and upper arm. Outcome measures included endometrial ultrasonic indices such as vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI), endometrial thickness and volume, subendometrial VI (sVI), subendometrial FI (sFI), subendometrial VFI (sVFI), implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, abortion rate, live birth rate and number of live births.\nFinally, 34 patients in the traditional acupuncture group and 35 in the sham acupuncture group completed this trial. VI, FI and VFI of the traditional acupuncture group were significantly higher than those in the sham acupuncture group (P<0.05). No significant differences were found in endometrial thickness, endometrial volume, sVI, sFI, sVFI, implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, abortion rate, live birth rate and number of live births (P>0.05).\nManual acupuncture performed after oocyte aspiration and before transplantation improved the endometrial blood flow parameters VI, RI and VFI in women who underwent IVF-ET, instead of sVI, sFI and sVFI. Therefore, acupuncture might be beneficial in women undergoing IVF-ET by increasing endometrial blood flow and endometrial receptivity.

{"title": "Concurrent management of lymphedema and breast reconstruction with single-stage omental vascularized lymph node transfer and autologous breast reconstruction: A case series.", "abstract": "The omentum has gained recent popularity in vascularized lymph node transfers (VLNT) as well as its novel use as a free flap for autologous breast reconstruction. The omentum has multiple unique advantages. It can be harvested laparoscopically or in an open fashion when utilized with abdominally-based free flaps. Additionally, it can be split into multiple flaps for simultaneous autologous breast reconstruction with VLNT or for multiple sites of VLNT. We present the safe and advantageous use of the omentum for VLNT with simultaneous autologous breast reconstruction in a series of patients.\nFrom the years 2019-2022, patients who underwent breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) or muscle sparing tram (MS-TRAM) flaps with concurrent omental VLNT through a mini-laparotomy or breast reconstruction with Omental Fat-Augmented Free Flap (O-FAFF) with concurrent laparoscopic harvesting of omental VLNT were studied. Patient demographics included age, gender, comorbidities, prior radiation or chemotherapy, body mass index, complications, hospital length of stay, and surgical outcomes.\nA total of seven patients underwent omental VLNT with breast reconstruction for a total of 12 breasts and eight limbs treated. Three of the patients underwent autologous breast reconstruction using omental free flap. The mean age was 52.3 (range 40-75) years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 29.3 (range 23-38) kg/m\nWe demonstrate here additional evidence to the growing body of literature of the versatility and safety of the omentum to be utilized as an independent tool for surgical treatment of lymphedema as well as its simultaneous use with autologous breast reconstruction.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2023-02-10", "authors": ["Jiwon SCrowley", "Farrah CLiu", "Nada MRizk", "DungNguyen"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.31017"}

It is a skin ailment that is defined by particular, drab-red or peach-pink stiff areas with silvery scales patches. Other typical characteristics include the proliferation of epidermal layer, aberrant keratinization, hyperkeratosis, increased micro capillary vascularization, and infiltration of inflammatory mediator loaded cells. Conventional pharmacotherapies currently available can only provide minor advantages. Nanomedicines based on nanotechnology can potentially improve the efficacy and safety of psoriasis medications. Apoptosis plays an important pathogenetic role in many chronic inflammatory diseases, including those of dermatological interest, in particular, regarding psoriasis. In this regard, treatments with antioxidant properties could be appropriate therapeutic options. We reviewed the available studies on the efficacy of antiapoptotic therapies in psoriasis. We'll look at phytochemicals in this review, which are natural components found in plants with antiapoptotic activity that are frequently used to treat psoriasis. For improved topical treatment, we also take into consideration the advantages of loading phytoconstituents as medicines into lipid based nanocarriers. The utilization of herbal nanomedicines in psoriasis, as well as nano delivery carrier system for phytoconstituents with improved therapeutic profiles and decreased toxicity, are the subjects of this review. The study's purpose is to find more effective herbal nanomedicines for treating psoriasis. In the treatment of psoriasis, phytoconstituents that have shown antipsoriatic potential in recent years, as well as phytoconstituents loaded based nanomedicines, have a lot of promising roles to be explored. Furthermore, very few patents have been found in the field of nanotechnology utilizing lipid-based nanocarrier system for the treatment of psoriasis. Therefore, this review greatly compels the researcher to validate the process development of lipid-based drug delivery system for the patentability of the product. This should be in a view of shifting in the applicability of the drug delivery system for general public health as a potential treatment option in psoriasis.", "journal": "Recent patents on nanotechnology", "date": "2023-02-02", "authors": ["PankajSingh Patel", "RajnishSrivastava", "SunitaPanchawat"], "doi": "10.2174/1872210517666230201103935"}

In the early tumor immune response, dendritic cells (DCs) participate in tumor recognition and antigen presentation in local lymphatics. Here, we investigated the impact of VLNT on DC dynamics against cancer in mouse models.\nForty-seven 8-week-old C57BL/6\u2009N male mice were divided into three surgical groups: a VLNT model in which a vascularized inguinal lymph node (LN) flap was transferred into the ipsilateral fossa after a popliteal LN was removed; a LN dissection (LND) model in which the popliteal LN was dissected; and a control model in which a skin incision was made at the popliteal fossa and an ipsilateral inguinal LN was removed. Postoperative lymphatic flows were observed by indocyanine green lymphography and B16-F10-luc2 mouse melanoma were implanted into the ipsilateral footpad. The proportion of DCs in the transplanted nodes was measured by CD11c immunohistochemistry using digital imaging analysis 4\u2009days after cancer implantation. Metastases to the lungs and LNs were quantitatively evaluated by luciferase assay 4\u2009weeks after cancer implantation.\nAfter VLNT, lymphatic reconnection was observed in 59.2% of mice. The proportion of DCs was significantly higher in the VLNT group with lymphatic reconnection (8.6%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0%) than in the na\u00efve LN (4.3%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4%) (p\u2009<\u2009.001). The tumor burden of lung metastases was significantly less in the VLNT group with lymphatic reconnection compared with the LND group (p\u00a0=\u00a0.049).\nMetastasis decreased in mice with reconnected lymphatics after VLNT.

The patent initially underwent bi-frontal craniotomy, exenteration of the frontal sinus, abdominal fat graft, resection of intra-cerebral abscesses, and repair of high flow anterior skull base CSF leak with a pedicled pericranial flap (PF). Eighteen months after the patient's surgery, he had resumed his use of cocaine and suffered necrosis of his PF. This caused his high flow CSF leak to recur.

Finding the source of chronic axial LBP is clinically challenging, and often 80% of diagnoses are described as non-specific LBP, and in only 20% of cases, an anatomical source can be attributed.\u00a0Perhaps it is due to this variability and uncertainty that many interventions for the treatment of chronic axial LBP directly targeting anatomical structures, such as IVD, muscles, facet joints, and ligaments, have limited success rates and variable outcomes in the general population. Several studies have reported a high incidence of vertebral endplate damage in up to 43% of subjects suffering from chronic axial LBP symptoms. These tend to manifest differently than when the etiology is from other structures. Often, vertebral endplate pain patients tend to present with significant functional impairment and debilitating pain while seated, standing, or during spinal flexion (in contrast to extension), with the pain reported as a burning, deep and achy, located in the midline region of the lumbar spine without radicular symptoms, and without motor weakness, numbness or tingling. In fact, vertebral pain from damaged endplates tends to present clinically different than non-specific etiologies with reported greater frequency and longer duration of painful episodes and worse outcomes with conservative treatment and surgery. Treatment options for chronic axial LBP from damaged vertebral endplates start with conservative care, similar to other treatment algorithms, such as oral analgesics, opioids, and therapeutic exercises.

These structures are well-vascularized with many glands and ducts to promote\u00a0the formation, storage, and ejaculation of sperm for fertilization, and to produce important androgens for male development.\u00a0The major male androgen is testosterone, which is produced from Leydig cells in the testes. Testosterone can be converted in the periphery to a more active form, dihydrotestosterone via 5-alpha-reductase, or estradiol via aromatase. Other key hormones include inhibin B and Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) hormone, both produced by the Sertoli cells in the testes. Important hormones that modulate these include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are released from the anterior pituitary gland and are regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), produced by the hypothalamus. Together, these hormones form the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis that promotes and maintains sexual development and function in the male.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["PurnimaGurung", "EkremYetiskul", "IshwarlalJialal"], "doi": null}

{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Impairment in left ventricular dysfunction can result from a spectrum of myocardial injury, including ischemia\u00a0and myocardial necrosis, causing progressive tissue remodeling.\u00a0Approximately half of the patients with coronary artery disease can have dysfunctional hibernating myocardium that is potentially reversible with restoration of blood flow. Earlier identification of these areas can have profound prognostic implications.\u00a0The majority of noninvasive imaging techniques such as an echocardiogram, coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear studies can assess wall motion abnormalities and function. However, each of these techniques has their distinct characteristics that can help decide which study should be performed based on the clinical indication.An echocardiogram is often the initial study of choice for assessing cardiac function in critically ill or unstable patients as it can be conveniently performed at the bedside and is not associated with radiation. Thus it\u00a0can be safely used in pregnant and pediatric patients.\u00a0CCTA is the best non-invasive technique to evaluate anomalous vessels, luminal irregularities, and stenosis\u00a0of the coronary vasculature. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and nuclear studies can better characterize abnormalities within myocardial tissue, such as scar formation or infiltrative processes. Additionally, myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) provide information regarding tissue viability and perfusion defects and can further guide treatment.

{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "Bony defects are most often caused by trauma, tumor, infection, or congenital anomaly, and these can lead to poor quality of life and occasionally amputation.

Bone grafts have been used in reconstructive surgery for a century\u00a0and recent advances in microvascular techniques have made free fibula flap transfer a viable option for reconstruction of long bony defects. In\u00a01975, Taylor et al harvested and transferred the first free fibula through\u00a0a posterior approach, and the technique was further improved by Gilbert, who described the lateral approach, which was later\u00a0further developed by Chuang et al, who popularized the osteomyocutaneous fibular flap.\u00a0In 1994, Hidalgo further expanded indications for fibular free tissue transfer by describing osteotomy techniques that permit shaping the fibula to mimic that of the mandible, making the fibula the workhorse for head and neck reconstruction that it is today. There are many ways of employing fibular bone for reconstruction: cancellous and cortical autografts, bone allografts, endoprosthetic replacement, vascularized bone grafts, fibular osteocutaneous flaps, and fibular osteomuscular flaps.\u00a0Among these options, free vascularized fibular grafting is unique in that it provides immediate mechanical support but it also can grow or hypertrophy depending on the patient's situation.\u00a0Vascularized fibular grafting is not a solution in all cases that require bony reconstruction; however, it is a frequently-used option for bony defects >6 cm, failed\u00a0non-vascularized\u00a0bone grafting, infected nonunion with a bony defect, or following tumor resection, particularly when postoperative radiation therapy is planned.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["MuhammadTaqi", "SivashanmugamRaju"], "doi": null}
{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "Fasciocutaneous flaps originally called an axial flap, are tissue flaps that include skin, subcutaneous tissue, and deep fascia. Including the underlying fascia with its prefascial and subfacial vascular plexus improves the vascularization of fasciocutaneous flaps. Also allowing us to have a greater length-to-width ratio compared with skin flaps. History of Fasciocutaneous Flaps:Pont\u00e9n\u00a0was the first to define the concept of a fasciocutaneous flap in the leg in 1981. After that, fasciocutaneous flaps gained popularity as a reliable technique to cover bone and tendon in the lower leg and elsewhere. Pont\u00e9n showed the importance of the deep fascia in the survival of a flap in the leg, but without demonstrating the kind of vascularization. Previously, skin flaps were based on the concept of random flaps with a limited length to width ratio (usually 1/1 of the lower limb). According to Pont\u00e9n, the average ratio of fasciocutaneous flaps is from 2/1 to 3/1. More than that may result in skin necrosis. In the years that followed, many authors detailed the clinical applications and the physiological bases of these flaps. At that time, the advantages of the fasciocutaneous flaps had several aesthetic and functional advantages over both myocutaneous and muscle flaps. Haertsch\u00a0and Barclay et al.\u00a0established the anatomical bases when describing that the fact of including the fascia allows respecting the longitudinal anastomotic vascular networks, especially the suprafascial plexus, which is the most developed.\u00a0Acland et al.\u00a0described in 1981 the saphenous flap on the medial aspect of the knee and applied it as a free flap. Later on, Cormack and Lamberty\u00a0classified the fascio-cutaneous flaps according to their patterns of vascularization. The development of microsurgical techniques and perforating flaps was carried out at the expense of pedicle fasciocutaneous flaps, which still retain specific indications due to their ease and speed of execution.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["Jorge G.Boretto", "Franco L.De Cicco"], "doi": null}
