{"title": "Development of Printable Natural Cartilage Matrix Bioink for 3D Printing of Irregular Tissue Shape.", "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to provide instructive cues for cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation, and ultimately tissue regeneration. The use of decellularized ECM scaffolds for regenerative-medicine approaches is rapidly expanding. In this study, cartilage acellular matrix (CAM)-based bioink was developed to fabricate functional biomolecule-containing scaffolds. The CAM provides an adequate cartilage tissue-favorable environment for chondrogenic differentiation of cells. Conventional manufacturing techniques such as salt leaching, solvent casting, gas forming, and freeze drying when applied to CAM-based scaffolds cannot precisely control the scaffold geometry for mimicking tissue shape. As an alternative to the scaffold fabrication methods, 3D printing was recently introduced in the field of tissue engineering. 3D printing may better control the internal microstructure and external appearance because of the computer-assisted construction process. Hence, applications of the 3D printing technology to tissue engineering are rapidly proliferating. Therefore, printable ECM-based bioink should be developed for 3D structure stratification. The aim of this study was to develop printable natural CAM bioink for 3D printing of a tissue of irregular shape. Silk fibroin was chosen to support the printing of the CAM powder because it can be physically cross-linked and its viscosity can be easily controlled. The newly developed CAM-silk bioink was evaluated regarding printability, cell viability, and tissue differentiation. Moreover, we successfully demonstrated 3D printing of a cartilage-shaped scaffold using only this CAM-silk bioink.

To achieve the same, n-HAP is grafted with poly(d-lactic acid) (PDLA) via in situ ring-opening polymerization of d-lactide, followed by blending with poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA), which yields sPLA/n-HAP biocomposite with improved storage modulus even at temperatures higher than 140 \u00b0C. X-ray diffraction and calorimetric analysis ensure the presence of 100% stereocomplex crystallites of biocomposite along with significant improvement in the melting temperature (\u223c227 \u00b0C). Noteworthy improvements in the mechanical and gas-barrier properties of the developed biocomposites are achieved due to the uniform dispersion of n-HAP (\u223c60 nm) confirmed by morphological studies. An unusual improvement in elongation at break (\u223c130% at 1 wt % HAP loading) makes this composite a toughened material. However, the tensile strength is improved by \u223c16%, whereas oxygen permeability and water vapor transmission rate are found to reduce by \u223c48 and \u223c34%, respectively. Interestingly, the developed material is processed as monofilament, followed to 3D printing to yield a middle phalanx bone as a representative example of orthopedic implants.

{"title": "Support-Free Hollowing.", "abstract": "Offsetting-based hollowing is a solid modeling operation widely used in 3D printing, which can change the model's physical properties and reduce the weight by generating voids inside a model. However, a hollowing operation can lead to additional supporting structures for fabrication in interior voids, which cannot be removed. As a consequence, the result of a hollowing operation is affected by these additional supporting structures when applying the operation to optimize physical properties of different models. This paper proposes a support-free hollowing framework to overcome the difficulty of fabricating voids inside a solid. The challenge of computing a support-free hollowing is decomposed into a sequence of shape optimization steps, which are repeatedly applied to interior mesh surfaces. The optimization of physical properties in different applications can be easily integrated into our framework. Comparing to prior approaches that can generate support-free inner structures, our hollowing operation can reduce more volume of material and thus provide a larger solution space for physical optimization.

Partition-based methods are efficient means in realizing this objective. Although some algorithms exist for support-free fabrication of solid models, no algorithm ever considers the problem of support-free fabrication for shell models (i.e., hollowed meshes). In this paper, we present a skeleton-based algorithm for partitioning a 3D surface model into the least number of parts for 3D printing without using any support structure. To achieve support-free fabrication while minimizing the effect of the seams and cracks that are inevitably induced by the partition, which affect the aesthetics and strength of the final assembled surface, we put forward an optimization system with the minimization of the number of partitions and the total length of the cuts, under the constraints of support-free printing angle. Our approach is particularly tailored for shell models, and it can be applicable to solid models as well. We first rigorously show that the optimization problem is NP-hard and then propose a stochastic method to find an optimal solution to the objectives. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm for a special case when the skeleton graph satisfies the requirement that the number of partitioned parts and the degree of each node are bounded by a small constant.

{"title": "[Research on preparation and performance of ceramic denture materials applied for three dimensional printing].", "abstract": "The micro-flow extrusion forming of ceramic material has not been developed in three dimensional (3D) printing field. The shape forming of material is by bonding and stacking of filaments of ceramic slurry extruded through micro-sized pores with rather large gaps and porosities, which can affect material's density after sintering and its mechanical property thereafter. Aiming at such a deficiency of this process, the preparation method of ceramic denture printing paste applicable to the process is studied, and the properties of slurry and sintering performance are analyzed and tested. It is concluded that the rheological properties of the prepared ceramic slurry conforms the requirement of micro-flow extrusion process, and the green body after sintering can satisfy the mechanical property requirement of oral denture. This is a technologic breakthrough, laying a foundation for the application of micro-flow extrusion forming in 3D printing of ceramic material, and promoting its development and maturation.\n\u9676\u74f7\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5fae\u6d41\u6324\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u662f\u4e09\u7ef4\u6253\u5370\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u5c1a\u672a\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u719f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6210\u578b\u5de5\u827a\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u5c06\u9676\u74f7\u6d46\u6599\u7ecf\u5fae\u7c73\u7ea7\u5b54\u9053\u6324\u51fa\u6210\u4e1d\u540e\u81ea\u7531\u7c98\u7ed3\u5806\u79ef\u6210\u5f62\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u7a7a\u9699\u548c\u6c14\u5b54\u7387\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u70e7\u7ed3\u540e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6750\u6599\u7684\u81f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u7f3a\u9677\u9996\u5148\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u5de5\u827a\u7684\u9676\u74f7\u4e49\u9f7f\u6253\u5370\u6d46\u6599\u7684\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6d46\u6599\u7684\u7406\u5316\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u70e7\u7ed3\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5f97\u51fa\uff1a\u914d\u5236\u7684\u9676\u74f7\u6d46\u6599\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ece\u6d41\u53d8\u7279\u6027\u4e0a\u7b26\u5408\u5fae\u6d41\u6324\u51fa\u6210\u5f62\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u6210\u5f62\u576f\u4f53\u70e7\u7ed3\u540e\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e5f\u6ee1\u8db3\u53e3\u8154\u4e49\u9f7f\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u6b64\u5de5\u827a\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u6253\u5370\u9676\u74f7\u6750\u6599\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u5de5\u827a\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u9010\u6b65\u8d70\u5411\u6210\u719f\u3002.", "journal": "Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi", "date": "2018-05-16", "authors": ["JingZhou", "GuolinDuan"], "doi": "10.7507/1001-5515.201607023"}

However, significant limitations affect current treatment options and clinical demand for bone grafts continues to rise due to conditions such as trauma, cancer, infection and arthritis. Developing bioactive three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds to support bone regeneration has therefore become a key area of focus within bone tissue engineering (BTE). A variety of materials and manufacturing methods including 3D printing have been used to create novel alternatives to traditional bone grafts. However, individual groups of materials including polymers, ceramics and hydrogels have been unable to fully replicate the properties of bone when used alone. Favourable material properties can be combined and bioactivity improved when groups of materials are used together in composite 3D scaffolds. This review will therefore consider the ideal properties of bioactive composite 3D scaffolds and examine recent use of polymers, hydrogels, metals, ceramics and bio-glasses in BTE.

While PDMS-based electrophoresis devices are popular, the separation efficiency is often an issue due to the hydrophobic nature of PDMS. In this study, a hybrid microfluidic capillary device was fabricated to utilize the positive features of PDMS along with the electrophoretic performance of fused silica. A capillary loop was embedded in a polystyrene base that can be coupled with PDMS microchannels at minimal dead volume interconnects. A method for cleaning out the capillaries after a wet-polishing step was devised through the use of 3D printed syringe attachment. By comparing the separation efficiency of fluorescein and CBI-glycine with both a PDMS-based serpentine device and the embedded capillary loop device, it was shown that the embedded capillary loop device maintained higher theoretical plates for both analytes. A Pd decoupler with a carbon or Pt detection electrode were embedded along with the loop allowing integration of the electrophoretic separation with electrochemical detection. A series of catecholamines were separated to show the ability to resolve similar analytes and detect redox active species. The release of dopamine and norepinephrine from PC 12 cells was also analyzed showing the compatibility of these improved microchip separations with high ionic cell buffers associated with cell culture.", "journal": "Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications", "date": "2018-05-01", "authors": ["Benjamin TMehl", "R ScottMartin"], "doi": "10.1039/C7AY02505J"}

Methods to isolate and culture primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), the gold standard for building human liver\u00a0models, were developed several decades ago; however, PHHs show a precipitous decline in phenotypic functions in 2-dimensional extracellular matrix-coated conventional culture formats, which does not allow chronic treatment with drugs and other stimuli. The development of several engineering tools, such as cellular\u00a0microarrays, protein micropatterning, microfluidics, biomaterial scaffolds, and bioprinting, now allow precise control over the cellular microenvironment for enhancing the function of both PHHs and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human hepatocyte-like cells; long-term (4+ weeks) stabilization of hepatocellular function typically requires co-cultivation with liver-derived or non-liver-derived nonparenchymal cell types. In addition, the recent development of liver organoid culture systems can provide a strategy for the enhanced expansion of therapeutically relevant cell types. Here, we discuss advances in engineering approaches for constructing in\u00a0vitro human liver models that have utility in\u00a0drug screening and for determining microenvironmental determinants of liver cell differentiation/function.

Therefore, meticulous surgical planning has always been mandatory. However, it is known that during the surgery things may often get slippery, leaving the surgeon no chance but improvisation. Because of this shortcoming it is not a rare occasion to find unhappy patients that have undergone deformity correction surgery.\nOur patient was an eighteen-year-old male who had 40\u00b0 cubitus varus deformity (with 20\u00b0 flexion and extension deficits) due to a right humerus supracondylar fracture, obtained eight years ago. He had two prior surgeries at the year of injury. Considering the severity of the deformity we decided to plan the surgery with 3D software, obtain 3D printed models (to further help with surgical fixation options) and finally, use a custom 3D printed resection guide to apply the plan during the surgery.\nTraditional methods of skeletal deformity correction lack the preoperative precision and tools to perform the plan during the surgery. Deformity correction with 3D images and 3D printed patient specific instruments do help the surgeon to accomplish correct deformities with results identical to surgical plan.\nSuperior precision of the 3D planning and very easy utilization of the patient specific 3D printed instruments during the skeletal deformity surgery provides unparalleled and foreseeable results.

{"title": "A thermoreversible, photocrosslinkable collagen bio-ink for free-form fabrication of scaffolds for regenerative medicine.", "abstract": "As a biomaterial, collagen has been used throughout tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Collagen is native to the body, is highly biocompatible, and naturally promotes cell adhesion and regeneration. However, collagen fibers and the inherent weak mechanical properties of collagen hydrogels interfere with further development of collagen as a bio-ink. Herein, we demonstrate the use of a modified type-I collagen, collagen methacrylamide (CMA), as a fibril-forming bio-ink for free-form fabrication of scaffolds. Like collagen, CMA can self-assemble into a fibrillar hydrogel at physiological conditions. In contrast, CMA is photocrosslinkable and thermoreversible, and photocrosslinking eliminates thermoreversibility. Free-form fabrication of CMA was performed through self-assembly of the CMA hydrogel, photocrosslinking the structure of interest using a photomask, and cooling the entire hydrogel, which results in cold-melting of unphotocrosslinked regions. Printed hydrogels had a resolution on the order of ~350 \u03bcm, and can be fabricated with or without cells and maintain viability or be further processed into freeze-dried sponges, all while retaining pattern fidelity. A subcutaneous implant study confirmed the biocompatibility of CMA in comparison to collagen.

{"title": "3D-micro-patterned fibrous dosage forms for immediate drug release.", "abstract": "At present, the most prevalent pharmaceutical dosage forms, the orally-delivered immediate-release tablets and capsules, are porous, granular solids. They disintegrate into their constituent particulates upon ingestion to release drug rapidly. The design, development, and manufacture of such granular solids, however, is inefficient due to difficulties associated with the unpredictable inter-particle interactions. Therefore, to achieve more predictable dosage form properties and processing, we have recently introduced melt-processed polymeric cellular dosage forms. The cellular forms disintegrated and released drug rapidly if the cells were predominantly interconnected. Preparation of interconnected cells, however, relies on the coalescence of gas bubbles in the melt, which is unpredictable. In the present work, therefore, new melt-processed fibrous dosage forms with contiguous void space are presented. The dosage forms are prepared by melt extrusion of the drug-excipient mixture followed by patterning the fibrous extrudate on a moving surface. It is demonstrated that the resulting fibrous structures are fully predictable by the extruder nozzle diameter and the motion of the surface. Furthermore, drug release experiments show that the disintegration time of the fibrous forms prepared in this work is of the order of that of the corresponding single fibers. The thin fibers of polyethylene glycol (excipient) and acetaminophen (drug) in turn disintegrate in a time proportional to the fiber radius and well within immediate-release specification. Finally, models of dosage form disintegration and drug release by single fibers and fibrous dosage forms are developed. It is found that drug release from fibrous forms is predictable by the physico-chemical properties of the excipient and such microstructural parameters as the fiber radius, the inter-fiber spacing, and the volume fraction of water-soluble excipient in the fibers.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

For this purpose, the rheology analyses have been performed on different bioinks and a specific solution comprising 8% gelatin, 2% elastin and 0.5% sodium hyaluronate has been selected as the most suitable composition for printing a structured membrane for GTR application. Each membrane is composed of 6 layers with strand angles from the first layer to the last layer of 45, 135, 0, 90, 0 and 90\u00b0. Confirmed by 3D Laser Measuring imaging, the membrane has small pores on one side and large pores on the other to be able to accommodate different cells like osteoblasts, fibroblasts and keratinocytes on different sides. The ultimate cross-linked product is a 150\u03bcm thick flexible and bendable membrane with easy surgical handling. Static and dynamic mechanical testing revealed static tensile modules of 1.95\u00b10.55MPa and a dynamic tensile storage modulus of 314\u00b150kPa.

{"title": "[Development and application of artificial vertebral body].", "abstract": "Artificial vertebral body has achieved good results in treating spinal tumors, tuberculosis, fracture and other diseases. Currently, artificial vertebral body with variety of kinds and pros and cons, is generally divided into two types: fusion type and movable type. The former according to whether the height could be adjusted and strength of self-stability is divided into three types: support-fixed type, adjust-fixed type and self-fixed type. Whether the height of self-fixed type could be adjusted is dependent on structure of collar thread rotation. The latter is due to mobile device of ball-and-socket joints or hollow structures instead of the disc which retains the activity of the spine to some extent. Materials of artificial vertebral body include metals, ceramics, biomaterials, polymer composites and other materials. Titanium with a dominant role in the metal has developed to the third generation, but there are still defects such as poor surface bioactivity; ceramics with the representative of hydroxyapatite composite, magnetic bioceramics, polycrystalline alumina ceramics and so on, which have the defects of processing complex and uneven mechanical properties; biological material is mainly dominated by xenogeneic bone, which is closest to human bone in structure and properties, but has defects of low toughness and complex production; polymer composites according to biological characteristics in general consists of biodegradable type and non-biodegradable type which are respectively represented by poly-lactide and polyethylene, each with advantages and disadvantages. Although the design and materials of prosthesis have made great progress, it is difficult to fully meet requirements of spinal implants and they need be further optimized. 3D printing technology makes process of the complex structure of prosthesis and individual customization possible and has broad development prospects. However, long production cycles and high cost of defect should be overcome.

By alternating bolus type over the course of therapy, each patient served as her own control.\nFor 16 patients undergoing chest wall radiation therapy, a custom 5.0 mm thick bolus was designed based on the treatment planning computed tomography scan and 3D printed using polylactic acid. Cone beam computed tomography scanning was used to image and quantify the accuracy of fit of the 2 bolus types with regard to air gaps between the bolus and skin. As a quality assurance measure for the 3D printed bolus, optically stimulated luminescent dosimetry provided in vivo comparison of surface dose at 7 points on the chest wall. Durations of patient setup and image guidance were recorded and compared.\nIn 13 of 16 patients, the bolus was printed without user intervention, and the median print time was 12.6 hours. The accuracy of fit of the bolus to the chest wall was improved significantly relative to standard sheet bolus, with the frequency of air gaps 5 mm or greater reduced from 30% to 13% (P < .001) and maximum air gap dimension diminished from 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 to 0.3 \u00b1 0.3 mm on average.

{"title": "Direct Bio-printing with Heterogeneous Topology Design.", "abstract": "Bio-additive manufacturing is a promising tool to fabricate porous scaffold structures for expediting the tissue regeneration processes. Unlike the most traditional bulk material objects, the microstructures of tissue and organs are mostly highly anisotropic, heterogeneous, and porous in nature. However, modelling the internal heterogeneity of tissues/organs structures in the traditional CAD environment is difficult and oftentimes inaccurate. Besides, the de facto STL conversion of bio-models introduces loss of information and piles up more errors in each subsequent step (build orientation, slicing, tool-path planning) of the bio-printing process plan. We are proposing a topology based scaffold design methodology to accurately represent the heterogeneous internal architecture of tissues/organs. An image analysis technique is used that digitizes the topology information contained in medical images of tissues/organs. A weighted topology reconstruction algorithm is implemented to represent the heterogeneity with parametric functions. The parametric functions are then used to map the spatial material distribution. The generated information is directly transferred to the 3D bio-printer and heterogeneous porous tissue scaffold structure is manufactured without STL file.

{"title": "Effects of Shear Stress Gradients on Ewing Sarcoma Cells Using 3D Printed Scaffolds and Flow Perfusion.", "abstract": "In this work, we combined three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds with flow perfusion bioreactors to evaluate the gradient effects of scaffold architecture and mechanical stimulation, respectively, on tumor cell phenotype. As cancer biologists elucidate the relevance of 3D in vitro tumor models within the drug discovery pipeline, it has become more compelling to model the tumor microenvironment and its impact on tumor cells. In particular, permeability gradients within solid tumors are inherently complex and difficult to accurately model in vitro. However, 3D printing can be used to design scaffolds with complex architecture, and flow perfusion can simulate mechanical stimulation within the tumor microenvironment. By modeling these gradients in vitro with 3D printed scaffolds and flow perfusion, we can identify potential diffusional limitations of drug delivery within a tumor. Ewing sarcoma (ES), a pediatric bone tumor, is a suitable candidate to study heterogeneous tumor response due to its demonstrated shear stress-dependent secretion of ligands important for ES tumor progression. We cultured ES cells under flow perfusion conditions on poly(propylene fumarate) scaffolds, which were fabricated with a distinct pore size gradient via extrusion-based 3D printing. Computational fluid modeling confirmed the presence of a shear stress gradient within the scaffolds and estimated the average shear stress that ES cells experience within each layer. Subsequently, we observed enhanced cell proliferation under flow perfusion within layers supporting lower permeability and increased surface area. Additionally, the effects of shear stress gradients on ES cell signaling transduction of the insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway elicited a response dependent upon the scaffold gradient orientation and the presence of flow-derived shear stress.

A moderate amount of residual compressive strain within elastomer foam increases the applied force \u223c1.4\u2009\u00d7 or stroke \u223c2\u2009\u00d7 compared with actuators without residual strain. The origin of these improved characteristics is explained analytically. These actuators are applied in a direct cardiac compression (DCC) device design, a type of implanted mechanical circulatory support that avoids direct blood contact, mitigating risks of clot formation and stroke. This article describes a first step toward a pneumatically powered, patient-specific DCC design by employing elastomer foam as the mechanism for cardiac compression. To form the device, a mold of a patient's heart was obtained by 3D printing a digitized X-ray computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan into a solid model. From this model, a soft, robotic foam DCC device was molded. The DCC device is compliant and uses compressed air to inflate foam chambers that in turn apply compression to the exterior of a heart. The device is demonstrated on a porcine heart and is capable of assisting heart pumping at physiologically relevant durations (\u223c200\u2009ms for systole and \u223c400\u2009ms for diastole) and stroke volumes (\u223c70\u2009mL).

All the technical approaches in the area of liver tissue engineering are based on allocating adult hepatocytes or stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells within a three-dimensional structure able to ensure their survival and to maintain their functional phenotype. The hosting structure can be a construct in which hepatocytes are embedded in alginate and/or gelatin or are seeded in a pre-arranged scaffold made with different types of biomaterials. According to a more advanced methodology termed three-dimensional bioprinting, hepatocytes are mixed with a bio-ink and the mixture is printed in different forms, such as tissue-like layers or spheroids. In the last decade, efforts to engineer a cell microenvironment recapitulating the dynamic native extracellular matrix have become increasingly successful, leading to the hope of satisfying the clinical demand for tissue (or organ) repair and replacement within a reasonable timeframe.

A 50-year-old man presented to our craniofacial referral center 1 year after failed reduction of complex left orbital, zygomatic, and frontal bone fractures due to a motorcycle collision. The patient's chief complaint was debilitating diplopia in all fields of gaze. On examination, he had left enophthalmos, left canthal displacement, lower eyelid ectropion, vertical orbital dystopia, and a laterally and inferiorly displaced, comminuted zygoma with orbital rim and frontal bone defects. The normal orbit was mirrored to precisely guide repositioning of the globe, orbital reconstruction, and cranioplasty. Preinjury appearance with normal globe position was restored with complete resolution of diplopia. Modern 3D technology allows the surgeon to better analyze complex orbital deformities and precisely plan surgical correction with the option of printing a PCI.

The patient was immediately sent to the emergency orthopedics department after the accident.\nHe was diagnosed as severed mangled limb crash injury at the level of the right wrist with a Mangled Extremity Severity Score of 8.\nA wrist disarticulation was performed and a 3D-printed prosthetic hand was designed and manufactured for this child. A personalized prosthetic rehabilitation training was applied after the prosthesis installation at 6 months postoperatively. The function of the prosthesis was evaluated at 1-month and 3-month follow-up using the Children Amputee Prosthetics Projects (CAPP) score and the University Of New Brunswick Test Of Prosthetic Function for Unilateral Amputees (UNB test).\nThe materials cost <20 dollars. The printing took <8\u200ahours and the component assembling was completed within 20 minutes. During the 3-month follow-up, the child's parents were satisfied with the prosthesis and the UNB test showed the significantly improved function of the prosthesis.\nThis novel 3D-printed upper limb prosthesis in a child with the traumatic wrist amputation might serve as a practical and affordable alternative for children in developing countries and those lacking access to health care providers.

{"title": "A Cost-Effective, In-House, Positioning and Cutting Guide System for Orthognathic Surgery.", "abstract": "Technological advances in 3D printing can dramatically improve orthognathic surgical planning workflow. Custom positioning and cutting guides enable intraoperative reproduction of pre-planned osteotomy cuts and can result in greater surgical accuracy and patient safety.\nThis short paper describes the use of freeware (some with open-source) combined with in-house 3D printing facilities to produce reliable, affordable osteotomy cutting guides.\nOpen-source software (3D Slicer) is used to visualise and segment three-dimensional planning models from imported conventional computed tomography (CT) scans. Freeware (Autodesk Meshmixer \u00a9) allows digital manipulation of maxillary and mandibular components to plan precise osteotomy cuts. Bespoke cutting guides allow exact intraoperative positioning. These are printed in polylactic acid (PLA) using a fused-filament fabrication 3D printer. Fixation of the osteotomised segments is achieved using plating templates and four pre-adapted plates with planned screw holes over the thickest bone. We print maxilla/ mandible models with desired movements incorporated to use as a plating template.\nA 3D printer capable of reproducing a complete skull can be procured for \u00a31000, with material costs in the region of \u00a310 per case. Our production of models and guides typically takes less than 24 hours of total print time. The entire production process is frequently less than three days. Externally sourced models and guides cost significantly more, frequently encountering costs totalling \u00a31500-\u00a32000 for models and guides for a bimaxillary osteotomy.\nThree-dimensional guided surgical planning utilising custom cutting guides enables the surgeon to determine optimal orientation of osteotomy cuts and better predict the skeletal maxilla/mandible relationship following surgery.

A significant benefit of a typical porous scaffold is a high surface-to-volume ratio which provides increased effective adhesion sites for cell attachment and growth. Controlling the printing process by fine-tuning the system parameters enables high reproducibility in the quality of the printed scaffolds. It also provides a flexible manufacturing platform for users to tailor the morphological structures of the scaffolds to their specific requirements.

This review outlines five technical steps required to complete a printed model: They include (1) selecting the anatomical area of interest, (2) the creation of the 3D geometry, (3) the optimisation of the file for the printing and the appropriate selection of (4) the 3D printer and (5) materials. All of these steps require time, expertise and money. A thorough understanding of educational needs is therefore essential in order to optimise educational value. At present, most of the available printing materials are rigid and therefore not optimum for flexibility and elasticity unlike biological tissue. We believe that the manipuation and tuning of material properties through the creation of composites and/or blending materials will eventually allow for the creation of patient-specific models which have both anatomical and tissue fidelity.", "journal": "BMJ simulation & technology enhanced learning", "date": "2018-01-23", "authors": ["JustineGarcia", "ZhiLinYang", "RosaireMongrain", "Richard LLeask", "KevinLachapelle"], "doi": "10.1136/bmjstel-2017-000234\n10.1108/RPJ-07-2012-0065\n10.1007/s11548-010-0476-x\n10.1016/j.jss.2015.06.051\n10.1007/s00256-015-2282-6\n10.1148/rg.2015140260\n10.1007/s10278-015-9803-7\n10.1016/j.jcct.2015.12.004\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.09.031\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2009.07.046\n10.1007/s00268-015-3218-y\n10.4103/2156-7514.179408\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.03.115\n10.1243/09544119JEIM83\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.12.030\n10.1007/s10334-005-0019-6\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2014.12.059\n10.1093/ejcts/ezu310\n10.1007/s10439-016-1690-7\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.12.075\n10.1016/j.amjoto.2015.02.012\n10.1177/0194599813518008\n10.1080/00016480410016478\n10.1002/lary.24919\n10.1016/j.jcms.2013.10.001\n10.1016/j.wneu.2016.02.081\n10.1007/s00701-016-2781-9\n10.1371/journal.pone.0136370\n10.1007/s00381-002-0657-1\n10.3171/2013.11.JNS131066\n10.1583/13-4450MR.1\n10.1177/1553350610395031\n10.1126/science.1160379\n10.1089/3dp.2013.0010\n10.1080/17452759.2012.731369\n10.1080/17452759.2011.586949\n10.1186/1532-429X-15-2\n10.5402/2012/208760\n10.1007/s11465-013-0248-8\n10.1243/09544054JEM724\n10.1557/jmr.2014.200\n10.1016/j.tcm.2008.11.001\n10.1097/MAO.0000000000000848\n10.1007/BF01192281\n10.1053/j.jfas.2012.01.014\n10.1159/000345264\n10.3389/fsurg.2015.00025\n10.1007/s12262-015-1326-4\n10.1007/s00268-016-3541-y\n10.1097/01.mat.0000217962.98619.ab\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.03.018\n10.1016/j.matdes.2015.11.022\n10.1016/j.addma.2016.06.006\n10.1016/j.cjca.2015.10.015\n10.1002/jmrs.212\n10.1016/j.jcrc.2007.12.004\n10.5811/westjem.2010.10.1909\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2007.10.016\n10.1510/icvts.2008.194134"}

Accurate osteotomy was performed with the assistant of the navigate template in the operation. Internal fixation of the osteotomy site was performed with 2 Kirschner wires. After surgery, a long arm plaster was applied with 20\u00b0 of elbow flexion. All the patients underwent radiographic and clinical evaluations before surgery and at the follow-up examination.\nDuring the operation, the navigate template with the individual design of 3D printing technology matched the bony markers of distal humerus. Accurate and simple osteotomy were performed along the resected surface of the navigation template. None of the cases required any kinds of revision surgery or had any complaint of cosmetic appearance. Average union time was 6.7 weeks(ranged, 6 to 8 weeks). Twelve patients got an excellent result and 2 got a good result according to the criteria described by Bellemore. There were no cases with complications of infection or ulnar nerve palsy or joint stiffness.\nWith the help of 3D printing technology, the accurate osteotomy in cubitus varus assisted by individualized navigate template can be realized.

{"title": "Printing Non-Euclidean Solids.", "abstract": "Geometrically frustrated solids with a non-Euclidean reference metric are ubiquitous in biology and are becoming increasingly relevant in technological applications. Often they acquire a targeted configuration of incompatibility through the surface accretion of mass as in tree growth or dam construction. We use the mechanics of incompatible surface growth to show that geometrical frustration developing during deposition can be fine-tuned to ensure a particular behavior of the system in physiological (or working) conditions. As an illustration, we obtain an explicit 3D printing protocol for arteries, which guarantees stress uniformity under inhomogeneous loading, and for explosive plants, allowing a complete release of residual elastic energy with a single cut.

{"title": "Scale-up of a Luminescent Solar Concentrator-Based Photomicroreactor via Numbering-up.", "abstract": "The use of solar energy to power chemical reactions is a long-standing dream of the chemical community. Recently, visible-light-mediated photoredox catalysis has been recognized as the ideal catalytic transformation to convert solar energy into chemical bonds. However, scaling photochemical transformations has been extremely challenging due to Bouguer-Lambert-Beer law. Recently, we have pioneered the development of luminescent solar concentrator photomicroreactors (LSC-PMs), which display an excellent energy efficiency. These devices harvest solar energy, convert the broad solar energy spectrum to a narrow-wavelength region, and subsequently waveguide the re-emitted photons to the reaction channels. Herein, we report on the scalability of such LSC-PMs via a numbering-up strategy. Paramount in our work was the use of molds that were fabricated via 3D printing. This allowed us to rapidly produce many different prototypes and to optimize experimentally key design aspects in a time-efficient fashion. Reactors up to 32 parallel channels have been fabricated that display an excellent flow distribution using a bifurcated flow distributor (standard deviations below 10%). This excellent flow distribution was crucial to scale up a model reaction efficiently, displaying yields comparable to those obtained in a single-channel device. We also found that interchannel spacing is an important and unique design parameter for numbered-up LSC-PMs, which influences greatly the photon flux experienced within the reaction channels.", "journal": "ACS sustainable chemistry & engineering", "date": "2018-01-16", "authors": ["FangZhao", "DarioCambi\u00e9", "JeroenJanse", "Eric WWieland", "Koen P LKuijpers", "VolkerHessel", "Michael GDebije", "TimothyNo\u00ebl"], "doi": "10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02687\n10.1073/pnas.0603395103\n10.1126/science.aam6284\n10.1021/ja403685a\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00002\n10.1038/nchem.1145\n10.1038/nmat4767\n10.1038/nchem.1861\n10.1016/j.solener.2011.01.018\n10.1016/j.rser.2011.07.148\n10.1016/j.apcatb.2013.08.025\n10.1021/acsnano.6b08251\n10.1021/ar2003013\n10.1126/science.1239176\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00057\n10.1021/acs.joc.6b01449\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b01754\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00720\n10.1351/pac199870112167\n10.1115/1.1354996\n10.1002/anie.201611101\n10.1002/aenm.201100554\n10.3762/bjoc.8.229\n10.1002/chem.201400283\n10.1007/3418_2015_155\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00707\n10.1007/3418_2015_152\n10.1016/j.cej.2011.11.105\n10.1016/j.ces.2014.04.036\n10.1016/j.ces.2010.05.044\n10.1016/j.cej.2012.08.068\n10.1021/acs.oprd.5b00414\n10.1039/C5RE00021A\n10.1039/C7RE00024C\n10.1002/aic.690480218\n10.1021/ef9007455\n10.1021/ie050472s\n10.1002/aic.11991\n10.1016/j.cej.2003.11.031\n10.1039/C4LC00700J\n10.1021/ie401924x\n10.1016/j.ces.2016.12.005\n10.1006/jcat.2002.3584\n10.1039/C4LC00987H\n10.1039/C6LC00163G\n10.1039/C6LC00284F\n10.1038/nprot.2009.234\n10.1039/C7RE00077D\n10.1126/science.36.926.385"}

The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of utilising 3D printed liver models as clinical tools in pre-operative planning for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions.\nHigh-resolution contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images were acquired and utilized to generate a patient-specific 3D printed liver model. Hepatic structures were segmented and edited to produce a printable model delineating intrahepatic anatomy and a resectable HCC lesion. Quantitative assessment of 3D model accuracy compared measurements of critical anatomical landmarks acquired from the original CT images, standard tessellation language (STL) files, and the 3D printed liver model. Comparative analysis of surveys completed by two radiologists investigated the clinical value of 3D printed liver models in radiology. The application of utilizing 3D printed liver models as tools in surgical planning for resectable HCC lesions was evaluated through kappa analysis of questionnaires completed by two abdominal surgeons.\nA scaled down multi-material 3D liver model delineating patient-specific hepatic anatomy and pathology was produced, requiring a total production time of 25.25 hours and costing a total of AUD $1,250. A discrepancy was found in the total mean of measurements at each stage of production, with a total mean of 18.28\u00b19.31 mm for measurements acquired from the original CT data, 15.63\u00b18.06 mm for the STL files, and 14.47\u00b17.71 mm for the 3D printed liver model. The 3D liver model did not enhance the radiologists' perception of patient-specific anatomy or pathology. Kappa analysis of the surgeon's responses to survey questions yielded a percentage agreement of 80%, and a \u03ba value of 0.38 (P=0.24) indicating fair agreement.\nStudy outcomes indicate that there is minimal value in utilizing the 3D printed models in diagnostic radiology. The potential usefulness of utilizing patient-specific 3D printed liver models as tools in surgical planning and intraoperative guidance for HCC treatment is verified. However, the feasibility of this application is currently challenged by identified limitations in 3D model production, including the cost and time required for model production, and inaccuracies potentially introduced at each stage of model fabrication.", "journal": "Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery", "date": "2018-01-10", "authors": ["ElizabethPerica", "ZhonghuaSun"], "doi": "10.21037/qims.2017.11.02\n10.1053/j.ro.2016.02.004\n10.4254/wjh.v8.i13.591\n10.1007/s00383-015-3709-9\n10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2016.0075\n10.1016/j.amsu.2016.07.002\n10.1097/MOP.0000000000000395\n10.1186/s40644-017-0110-z\n10.1148/radiol.14132362\n10.1007/s00268-014-2740-7\n10.1148/rg.2015140320\n10.3348/kjr.2016.17.2.182\n10.1002/lt.23729\n10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.10.002\n10.1002/ase.1345\n10.1371/journal.pone.0136198\n10.1007/s11548-017-1527-3\n10.1177/1553350615607641\n10.1089/tmj.2017.0049\n10.1371/journal.pone.0178540\n10.1177/1553350616689414\n10.1007/s00595-016-1383-8\n10.1002/jmrs.212\n10.1117/1.JMI.3.3.033501\n10.1016/j.sapharm.2012.04.004\n10.11613/BM.2012.031\n10.1016/j.acra.2016.04.010"}

To enhance this management, a natural teeth-retained splint based on a patient-specific 3-dimensional (3D) printed mandible was used in vestibuloplasty to provide sufficient keratinized mucosa around dental implants to support long-term implant maintenance.\nA 28-year-old male patient had a fracture of the anterior andible 1 year ago, and the fracture was treated with titanium.\nThe patient had lost mandibular incisors on both the sides and had a shallow vestibule and little keratinized mucosa.\nIn the first-stage implant surgery, 2 implants were inserted and the titanium fracture fixation plates and screws were removed at the same time. During second-stage implant surgery, vestibuloplasty was performed, and the natural teeth-retained splint was applied. The splint was made based upon a patient-specific 3D-printed mandible. At 30-day follow-up, the splint was modified and reset. The modified splint was removed after an additional 60 days, and the patient received prosthetic treatment.\nAfter prosthetic treatment, successful oral rehabilitation was achieved.

Precisely controlled bio-nanopatterns, printed electronic components, and sensors/actuators are all examples of such surface features. However, the vast majority of the refined technologies that are currently available for creating functional surface features work only on flat surfaces. Here we present initially flat constructs that upon triggering by high temperatures change their shape to a pre-programmed 3D shape, thereby enabling the combination of surface-related functionalities with complex 3D shapes. A number of shape-shifting materials have been proposed during the last few years based on various types of advanced technologies. The proposed techniques often require multiple fabrication steps and special materials, while being limited in terms of the 3D shapes they could achieve. The approach presented here is a single-step printing process that requires only a hobbyist 3D printer and inexpensive off-the-shelf materials. It also lends itself to a host of design strategies based on self-folding origami, instability-driven pop-up, and 'sequential' shape-shifting to unprecedentedly expand the space of achievable 3D shapes.

However, the main shortcomings of ceramic scaffolds are their brittleness and low retention level of various growth factors or drugs. To overcome these shortcomings, we have reinforced ceramic scaffolds using synthetic and natural polymers as composites. Here, we designed a new bone-biomimetic composite consisting of calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA), collagen, and plate-rich plasma (PRP) using low temperature printing process. In the biocomposite, we manipulated the release of the bioactive component, PRP, which has several growth factors, for a long culture period (up to 35 days) by using a polyphenol, tannic acid. The mesh-structured biocomposite showed structural stability. We also tested the in vitro biocompatibilities of the biocomposite using preosteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) and found that the biocomposite showed better cell growth and differentiation compared to the control (fabricated without PRP).

Bioprinting, involving computer-controlled deposition of cells and scaffolds into spatially controlled patterns, is able to control not only the macro but also micro and nanoarchitecture and could offer the potential to more faithfully replicate native skin.\nWe conducted a literature review using PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science for studies on skin 3D bioprinting between 2009 and 2016, evaluating the bioprinting technique, cell source, scaffold type and in vitro and in vivo outcomes.\nWe outline the evolution of biological skin replacements, principles of bioprinting and how they apply to the skin tissue engineering field, potential clinical applications as well the current limitations and future avenues for research. Of the studies analysed, the most common types of bioinks consisted of keratinocytes and fibroblasts combined with collagen, although stem cells are gaining increasing recognition. Laser assisted deposition was the most common printing modality, although ink-jet and pneumatic extrusion have also been tested. Bioprinted skin promoted accelerated wound healing, was able to mimic stratified epidermis but not the thick, elastic, vascular dermis.\nAlthough 3D bioprinting shows promise in engineering skin, evidenced by large collective investments from the cosmetic industry, the research is still in its infancy. The resolution, vascularity, optimal cell and scaffold combinations and cost of bioprinted skin are hurdles that need to be overcome before the clinical applicability can be realised.

{"title": "Mechanical behaviour of alginate-gelatin hydrogels for 3D bioprinting.", "abstract": "Hydrogels comprised of alginate and gelatin have demonstrated potential as biomaterials in three dimensional (3D) bioprinting applications. However, as with all hydrogel-based biomaterials used in extrusion-based bioprinting, many parameters influence their performance and there is limited data characterising the behaviour of alginate-gelatin (Alg-Gel) hydrogels. Here we investigated nine Alg-Gel blends by varying the individual constituent concentrations. We tested samples for printability and print accuracy, compressive behaviour and change over time, and viability of encapsulated mesenchymal stem cells in bioprinted constructs. Printability tests showed a decrease in strand width with increasing concentrations of Alg-Gel. However due to the increased viscosity associated with the higher Alg-Gel concentrations, the minimum width was found to be 0.32mm before blends became too viscous to print. Similarly, printing accuracy was increased in higher concentrations, exceeding 90% in some blends. Mechanical properties were assessed through uniaxial compression testing and it was found that increasing concentrations of both Alg and Gel resulted in higher compressive modulus. We also deemed 15min crosslinking in calcium chloride to be sufficient. From our data, we propose a blend of 7%Alg-8%Gel that yields high printability, mechanical strength and stiffness, and cell viability. However, we found the compressive behaviour of Alg-Gel to reduce rapidly over time and especially when incubated at 37\u00b0C. Here we have reported relevant data on Alg-Gel hydrogels for bioprinting. We tested for biomaterial properties and show that these hydrogels have many desirable characteristics that are highly tunable.

{"title": "The cutting edge - Micro-CT for quantitative toolmark analysis of sharp force trauma to bone.", "abstract": "Toolmark analysis involves examining marks created on an object to identify the likely tool responsible for creating those marks (e.g., a knife). Although a potentially powerful forensic tool, knife mark analysis is still in its infancy and the validation of imaging techniques as well as quantitative approaches is ongoing. This study builds on previous work by simulating real-world stabbings experimentally and statistically exploring quantitative toolmark properties, such as cut mark angle captured by micro-CT imaging, to predict the knife responsible. In Experiment 1 a mechanical stab rig and two knives were used to create 14 knife cut marks on dry pig ribs. The toolmarks were laser and micro-CT scanned to allow for quantitative measurements of numerous toolmark properties. The findings from Experiment 1 demonstrated that both knives produced statistically different cut mark widths, wall angle and shapes. Experiment 2 examined knife marks created on fleshed pig torsos with conditions designed to better simulate real-world stabbings. Eight knives were used to generate 64 incision cut marks that were also micro-CT scanned. Statistical exploration of these cut marks suggested that knife type, serrated or plain, can be predicted from cut mark width and wall angle. Preliminary results suggest that knives type can be predicted from cut mark width, and that knife edge thickness correlates with cut mark width. An additional 16 cut marks walls were imaged for striation marks using scanning electron microscopy with results suggesting that this approach might not be useful for knife mark analysis. Results also indicated that observer judgements of cut mark shape were more consistent when rated from micro-CT images than light microscopy images. The potential to combine micro-CT data, medical grade CT data and photographs to develop highly realistic virtual models for visualisation and 3D printing is also demonstrated. This is the first study to statistically explore simulated real-world knife marks imaged by micro-CT to demonstrate the potential of quantitative approaches in knife mark analysis.

A goal of treatment is to achieve symmetry and projection to match the native breast, and/or the contralateral breast in the case of a unilateral reconstruction. Autologous reconstruction, particularly with the deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap, is particularly advantageous as it can be manipulated to mimic the shape and turgor of the native breast. However, very few techniques of shaping the breast conus when insetting the DIEP flap to enhance aesthetic outcome have been reported to date. With the aide of three-dimension (3D) photography and 3D-printed mirrored image of the contralateral breast as a guide intraoperatively, we describe our St Andrew's coning technique to create a personalized flap projection.\nWe report a prospective case series of 3 delayed unilateral breast reconstructions where symmetrization procedure to the contralateral breast was not indicated. Using a commercial 3D scanner (VECTRA XR, Canfield Scientific), the breast region was imaged. The mirrored image was 3D-printed in-house using a desktop 3D printer.\nIn all cases, projection of the breast mound was able to be safely achieved, with a demonstrated central volume (or 'cone') able to be highlighted on imaging and a 3D printed breast.

This study develops the experimental validation model and finite element modeling (FEM) to study the head and neck cooling separately, which can induce therapeutic hypothermia focused on the brain. Anatomically accurate geometries based on CT images of the skull and carotid artery are utilized to find the 3D geometry for FEM to analyze the temperature distributions and 3D-printing to build the physical model for experiment. The results show that FEM predicted and experimentally measured temperatures have good agreement, which can be used to predict the temporal and spatial temperature distributions of the tissue and blood during the head and neck cooling process. Effects of boundary condition, perfusion, blood flow rate, and size of cooling area are studied. For head cooling, the cooling penetration depth is greatly depending on the blood perfusion in the brain. In the normal blood flow condition, the neck internal carotid artery temperature is decreased only by about 0.13\u00b0C after 60min of hypothermia. In an ischemic (low blood flow rate) condition, such temperature can be decreased by about 1.0\u00b0C.

The system is based on the additive manufacture of a computer-designed lattice structure or framework, into which carbon fibers are subsequently knitted or incorporated. The 3D-printed lattice structure acts as support and the knitted carbon fibers perform as driving elements for promoting cell colonization of the three-dimensional construct. A human mesenchymal stem cell (h-MSC) conditioned medium (CM) is also used for improving the scaffold's response and promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, and viability. Cell culture results-in which scaffolds become buried in collagen type II-provide relevant information regarding the viability of the composite scaffolds used and the prospective applications of the proposed approach.

This paper presents a low-cost, on-demand electrode approach for future long-term applications. The fully printed module comprises a polymeric substrate with electrodes on a flexible membrane, which establishes skin contact only for short time in case of measurement. The membranes that produce airtight seals for pressure chambers can be pneumatically dilated and pressed onto the skin to ensure good contact, and subsequently retracted. The dilatation depends on the pressure and membrane thickness, which has been tested up to 150 kPa. The electrodes were fabricated in screen and inkjet printing technology, and compared during exemplary electrodermal activity measurement (EDA). The results show less amplitude compared to conventional EDA electrodes but similar behavior.

{"title": "3D printed structures for modeling the Young's modulus of bamboo parenchyma.", "abstract": "Bamboo is a sustainable, lightweight material that is widely used in structural applications. To fully develop micromechanical models for plants, such as bamboo, the mechanical properties of each individual type of tissue are needed. However, separating individual tissues and testing them mechanically is challenging. Here, we report an alternative approach in which micro X-ray computed tomography (\u00b5-CT) is used to image moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens). The acquired images, which correspond to the 3D structure of the parenchyma, are then transformed into physical, albeit larger scale, structures by 3D printing, and their mechanical properties are characterized. The normalized longitudinal Young's moduli of the fabricated structures depend on relative density raised to a power between 2 and 3, suggesting that elastic deformation of the parenchyma cellular structure involves considerable cell wall bending. The mechanical behavior of other biological tissues may also be elucidated using this approach.\nBamboo is a lightweight, sustainable engineering material widely used in structural applications. By combining micro X-ray computed tomography and 3D printing, we have produced bamboo parenchyma mimics and characterized their stiffness.

Sheep (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were subjected to 2 ipsilateral trephine-induced (11-mm diameter) calvarial defects. Either a control or a DIPY scaffold was placed in each defect, and the surgery was repeated on the contralateral side 3 weeks later. Following sacrifice, defects were evaluated through microcomputed tomography and histologic analysis for bone, scaffold, and soft tissue quantification throughout the defect. Parametric and non-parametric methods were used to determine statistical significance based on data distribution.\nNo exuberant or ectopic bone formation was observed, and no histologic evidence of inflammation was noted within the defects. Osteogenesis was higher in DIPY-coated scaffolds compared to controls at 3 weeks (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013) and 6 weeks (p\u00a0=\u00a00.046) in\u00a0vivo. When bone formation was evaluated as a function of defect radius, average bone formation was higher for DIPY relative to control scaffolds at both time points (significant at defect central regions at 3 weeks and at margins at 6 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.046 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.031, respectively).\nDipyridamole significantly improves the calvarial bone regeneration capacity of 3DPBC scaffolds.

{"title": "Parallel Saltational Evolution of Ultrafast Movements in Snapping Shrimp Claws.", "abstract": "How do stunning functional innovations evolve from unspecialized progenitors? This puzzle is particularly acute for ultrafast movements of appendages in arthropods as diverse as shrimps [1], stomatopods [2], insects [3-6], and spiders [7]. For example, the spectacular snapping claws of alpheid shrimps close so fast (\u223c0.5\u00a0ms) that jetted\u00a0water creates a cavitation bubble and an immensely powerful snap upon bubble collapse [1]. Such extreme movements depend on (1) an energy-storage mechanism (e.g., some kind of spring) and (2) a latching mechanism to release stored energy quickly [8]. Clearly, rapid claw closure must have evolved before the ability to snap, but its evolutionary origins are unknown. Unearthing the functional mechanics of transitional stages is therefore essential to understand how such radical novel abilities arise [9-11]. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of shrimp claw form and function by sampling 114 species from 19 families, including two unrelated families within which snapping evolved independently (Alpheidae and Palaemonidae) [12, 13]. Our comparative analyses, using micro-computed tomography (microCT) and confocal imaging, high-speed video, and kinematic experiments with select 3D-printed scale models, revealed a previously unrecognized \"slip joint\" in non-snapping shrimp claws. This slip joint facilitated the parallel evolution of a novel\u00a0energy-storage and cocking mechanism-a torque-reversal joint-an apparent precondition for snapping. Remarkably, these key functional transitions between ancestral (simple pinching) and derived (snapping) claws were achieved by minute differences in joint structure. Therefore, subtle changes in form appear to have facilitated wholly novel functional change in a saltational manner.

{"title": "Fabricating smooth PDMS microfluidic channels from low-resolution 3D printed molds using an omniphobic lubricant-infused coating.", "abstract": "The advent of 3D printing has allowed for rapid bench-top fabrication of molds for casting polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chips, a widely-used polymer in prototyping microfluidic devices. While fabricating PDMS devices from 3D printed molds is fast and cost-effective, creating smooth surface topology is highly dependent on the printer's quality. To produce smooth PDMS channels from these molds, we propose a novel technique in which a lubricant is tethered to the surface of a 3D printed mold, which results in a smooth interface for casting PDMS. Fabricating the omniphobic-lubricant-infused molds (OLIMs) was accomplished by coating the mold with a fluorinated-silane to produce a high affinity for the lubricant, which tethers it to the mold. PDMS devices cast onto OLIMs produced significantly smoother topology and can be further utilized to fabricate smooth-channeled PDMS devices. Using this method, we reduced the surface roughness of PDMS microfluidic channels from 2 to 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm (10-fold decrease), as well as demonstrated proper operation of the fabricated devices with superior optical properties compared to the rough devices. Furthermore, a COMSOL simulation was performed to investigate how the distinct surface topographies compare regarding their volumetric velocity profile and the shear rate produced. Simulation results showed that, near the channel's surface, variations in flow regime and shear stress is significantly reduced for the microfluidic channels cast on OLIM compared to the ones cast on uncoated 3D printed molds.

Here we demonstrate how the resolution of conventional stereolithographic machines can be improved by a direct programming of the laser path and can contribute to bridge the gap between the two above technologies, allowing the direct printing of features between 10 and 100\u00a0\u03bcm, corresponding to a large fraction of microfluidic applications. This strategy allows to achieve resolutions limited only by the physical size of the laser beam, decreasing by a factor at least 2\u00d7 the size of the smallest features printable, and increasing their reproducibility by a factor 5. The approach was applied to produce an open microfluidic device with the reversible seal, integrating periodical patterns using the simple motifs, and validated by the fabrication of a deterministic lateral displacement particles sorting device. The sorting of polystyrene beads (diameter: 20\u00a0\u03bcm and 45\u00a0\u03bcm) was achieved with a specificity >95%, comparable with that achieved with arrays prepared by microlithography.", "journal": "Analytica chimica acta", "date": "2018-01-01", "authors": ["PetraJuskova", "AlexisOllitrault", "MarcoSerra", "Jean-LouisViovy", "LaurentMalaquin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aca.2017.11.062"}

They allow the incorporation of a variety of ophthalmic pharmaceuticals to achieve therapeutic levels of drugs and bioactives at target ocular sites. The integration of sophisticated drug delivery technologies such as nanotechnology-based ones with intelligent and environment responsive systems can extend current treatment duration to provide more clinically relevant time courses (weeks and months instead of hours and days) which will inevitably reduce dose frequency, increase patient compliance and improve clinical outcomes. Novel applications and design of contact lenses and intracanalicular delivery devices along with the move towards integrating gels into various drug delivery devices like intraocular pumps, injections and implants has the potential to reduce comorbidities caused by glaucoma, corneal keratopathy, cataract, diabetic retinopathies and age-related macular degeneration.

It has been proposed that both the mechanical characteristics and cell seeding capacity of TETG scaffolds are integral to graft performance. Our aim was to design a tracheal construct that approximates the biomechanical properties of native sheep trachea and optimizes seeding with bone marrow derived mononuclear cells prior to preclinical evaluation in an ovine model.\nA solution of 8% polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and 3% polyurethane (PU) was prepared at a ratio of either 8:2 or 2:8 and electrospun onto a custom stainless steel mandrel designed to match the dimensional measurements of the juvenile sheep trachea. 3D-printed porous or solid polycarbonate C-shaped rings were embedded within the scaffolds during electrospinning. The scaffolds underwent compression testing in the anterior-posterior and lateral-medial axes and the biomechanical profiles compared to that of a juvenile ovine trachea. The most biomimetic constructs then underwent vacuum seeding with ovine bone marrow derived mononuclear cells. Fluorometric DNA assay was used to quantify scaffold seeding.\nBoth porous and solid rings approximated the biomechanics of the native ovine trachea, but the porous rings were most biomimetic. The load-displacement curve of scaffolds fabricated from a ratio of 2:8 PET:PU most closely mimicked that of native trachea in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes.

The purpose of the present work was the safe, ergonomic, durable, and aesthetically pleasing installation of magnetic field monitoring equipment into a scanner, while keeping the setup compatible with standard operating procedures.\nAn extensive set of steps was required to design a 3D printed solution to install a magnetic field camera into the eight-channel head coil of a 3T MRI scanner. First, the outer surface of the plastic coil housing was recreated into a 3D model, and the installation of the magnetic field sensors around this 3D model was performed in a virtual environment. The 3D printed solution was then assembled and tested for safety, reproducible performance, and image quality.\nThe 3D printed solution holds the probes in stable positions and guides the necessary cables in an organized fashion and away from the volunteer. Assembly is easy and the solution is ergonomic, durable, and safe. We did not find excessive heating in the 3D printed parts, nor in the electronics, that they help to incorporate. The material used interferes minimally with transmit B1+ field.\nThe design met all of the boundary conditions for a durable, safe, cost-effective, attractive, and functional installation.

{"title": "A microfluidic thermometer: Precise temperature measurements in microliter- and nanoliter-scale volumes.", "abstract": "Measuring the temperature of a sample is a fundamental need in many biological and chemical processes. When the volume of the sample is on the microliter or nanoliter scale (e.g., cells, microorganisms, precious samples, or samples in microfluidic devices), accurate measurement of the sample temperature becomes challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a technique for accurately determining the temperature of microliter volumes using a simple 3D-printed microfluidic chip. We accomplish this by first filling \"microfluidic thermometer\" channels on the chip with substances with precisely known freezing/melting points. We then use a thermoelectric cooler to create a stable and linear temperature gradient along these channels within a measurement region on the chip. A custom software tool (available as online Supporting Information) is then used to find the locations of solid-liquid interfaces in the thermometer channels; these locations have known temperatures equal to the freezing/melting points of the substances in the channels. The software then uses the locations of these interfaces to calculate the temperature at any desired point within the measurement region. Using this approach, the temperature of any microliter-scale on-chip sample can be measured with an uncertainty of about a quarter of a degree Celsius. As a proof-of-concept, we use this technique to measure the unknown freezing point of a 50 microliter volume of solution and demonstrate its feasibility on a 400 nanoliter sample. Additionally, this technique can be used to measure the temperature of any on-chip sample, not just near-zero-Celsius freezing points. We demonstrate this by using an oil that solidifies near room temperature (coconut oil) in a microfluidic thermometer to measure on-chip temperatures well above zero Celsius. By providing a low-cost and simple way to accurately measure temperatures in small volumes, this technique should find applications in both research and educational laboratories.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-12-29", "authors": ["Brittney AMcKenzie", "William HGrover"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0189430\n10.1109/TCAPT.2003.815093\n10.1002/adma.200601019\n10.1039/b719550h\n10.1097/00003246-198802000-00011\n10.1016/S0165-5876(02)00129-5\n10.1111/j.1365-2044.1993.tb07127.x\n10.1002/elps.201000587\n10.1097/00003246-200002000-00041\n10.1039/b906198c\n10.1039/b109031n\n10.1002/elps.200800491\n10.1016/S0924-4247(99)00356-8\n10.1063/1.3058587\n10.1016/j.aca.2003.09.019\n10.1038/ncomms1714\n10.1002/adma.201501014\n10.1038/nature12373\n10.1021/acsnano.5b00059\n10.1016/0021-9797(72)90264-0\n10.1016/0001-8686(86)80012-4\n10.1126/science.281.5383.1650\n10.1021/j100794a021\n10.1126/science.270.5241.1480\n10.1016/S0927-7757(96)03829-0\n10.1007/s100510050725\n10.1016/0022-0248(79)90033-2\n10.1038/nmat944\n10.3109/10715769509065280"}

This article aims at reviewing the commonly used tribochemical methods adopted in the analysis of tribocorrosion and putting forward some of the models and environmental factors affecting the tribocorrosive behavior of CoCrMo alloys, a widely-used class of biomaterial for orthopedic implants.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-12-27", "authors": ["Wei QuanToh", "XipengTan", "AyanBhowmik", "ErjiaLiu", "Shu BengTor"], "doi": "10.3390/ma11010030\n10.1088/0022-3727/39/15/S01\n10.1016/j.wear.2014.12.003\n10.1038/nnano.2013.128\n10.1038/4581121a\n10.1177/00220345610400012501\n10.2320/matertrans.MRA2007274\n10.1007/s11661-012-1288-0\n10.1149/1.1838341\n10.1097/00003086-199608001-00027\n10.1002/jbm.10299\n10.1016/j.triboint.2007.11.003\n10.1016/S0043-1648(01)00754-2\n10.1016/S0013-4686(01)00679-X\n10.1016/S0043-1648(03)00556-8\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(19971205)37:3<421::AID-JBM13>3.0.CO;2-E\n10.1016/0010-938X(96)00004-2\n10.1016/S0043-1648(99)00314-2\n10.1016/j.triboint.2009.03.018\n10.1080/14786443209462064\n10.1016/j.bioeng.2007.07.015\n10.1016/j.electacta.2010.04.093\n10.1016/j.triboint.2006.01.016\n10.1016/j.wear.2007.01.114\n10.1039/C2CP42968C\n10.1007/s11249-011-9757-y\n10.2320/matertrans.46.1588\n10.1063/1.1721448\n10.1016/j.wear.2013.04.007\n10.1016/j.wear.2016.11.048\n10.1016/0043-1648(84)90025-5\n10.1016/S0043-1648(03)00561-1\n10.1016/j.wear.2004.12.012\n10.1016/j.wear.2012.11.061\n10.1002/jbm.820130208\n10.1007/s11661-010-0227-1\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2012.03.013\n10.1016/j.actamat.2006.10.005\n10.1016/j.wear.2013.12.010\n10.1016/j.triboint.2017.01.037\n10.1016/S0043-1648(01)00654-8\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.01.023\n10.1016/j.wear.2008.12.110\n10.4047/jap.2014.6.2.138\n10.1016/S0257-8972(02)00853-8\n10.1007/s10047-008-0422-7\n10.1007/s11085-004-7805-9\n10.2320/matertrans.MRA2007220\n10.1016/j.electacta.2011.06.068\n10.1088/0022-3727/39/15/S10\n10.1088/0022-3727/39/15/S11\n10.1016/j.wear.2014.04.016\n10.1007/s11999-012-2563-5\n10.1016/j.triboint.2008.05.005\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.05.002\n10.1007/s10856-010-4224-0\n10.1016/j.triboint.2008.04.009\n10.3390/lubricants3030539\n10.1186/s13018-014-0091-6\n10.1179/175158309X408315\n10.1016/0048-9697(94)90148-1\n10.1016/0048-9697(94)90135-X\n10.1016/j.cjca.2012.10.015\n10.1016/j.arth.2008.07.017\n10.2106/JBJS.J.00125\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.01.028\n10.3109/17453674.2010.519169\n10.1002/jbm.a.10088\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.01.041\n10.1016/j.wear.2010.12.045\n10.1016/j.electacta.2011.08.028\n10.1243/09544119JEIM110\n10.1016/j.matdes.2016.03.114\n10.1007/BF02443329\n10.1002/jbm.b.30132\n10.1016/S1359-6462(03)00396-8\n10.1007/s11661-010-0388-y\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2013.01.021\n10.1016/j.dental.2015.09.003\n10.1007/s11665-014-0958-z\n10.3390/met6110284\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1008643\n10.1016/j.actamat.2015.06.036\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.05.178\n10.1016/j.procir.2014.03.082\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2017.09.022"}

{"title": "Biomechanical properties of 3D-printed bone scaffolds are improved by treatment with CRFP.", "abstract": "One of the major challenges in orthopedics is to develop implants that overcome current postoperative problems such as osteointegration, proper load bearing, and stress shielding. Current implant techniques such as allografts or endoprostheses never reach full bone integration, and the risk of fracture due to stress shielding is a major concern. To overcome this, a novel technique of reverse engineering to create artificial scaffolds was designed and tested. The purpose of the study is to create a new generation of implants that are both biocompatible and biomimetic.\n3D-printed scaffolds based on physiological trabecular bone patterning were printed. MC3T3 cells were cultured on these scaffolds in osteogenic media, with and without the addition of Calcitonin Receptor Fragment Peptide (CRFP) in order to assess bone formation on the surfaces of the scaffolds. Integrity of these cell-seeded bone-coated scaffolds was tested for their mechanical strength.\nThe results show that cellular proliferation and bone matrix formation are both supported by our 3D-printed scaffolds. The mechanical strength of the scaffolds was enhanced by trabecular patterning in the order of 20% for compression strength and 60% for compressive modulus. Furthermore, cell-seeded trabecular scaffolds modulus increased fourfold when treated with CRFP.\nUpon mineralization, the cell-seeded trabecular implants treated with osteo-inductive agents and pretreated with CRFP showed a significant increase in the compressive modulus.

{"title": "3D Powder Printed Bioglass and \u03b2-Tricalcium Phosphate Bone Scaffolds.", "abstract": "The use of both bioglass (BG) and \u03b2 tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) for bone replacement applications has been studied extensively due to the materials' high biocompatibility and ability to resorb when implanted in the body. 3D printing has been explored as a fast and versatile technique for the fabrication of porous bone scaffolds. This project investigates the effects of using different combinations of a composite BG and \u03b2-TCP powder for 3D printing of porous bone scaffolds. Porous 3D powder printed bone scaffolds of BG, \u03b2-TCP, 50/50 BG/\u03b2-TCP and 70/30 BG/\u03b2-TCP compositions were subject to a variety of characterization and biocompatibility tests. The porosity characteristics, surface roughness, mechanical strength, viability for cell proliferation, material cytotoxicity and in vitro bioactivity were assessed. The results show that the scaffolds can support osteoblast-like MG-63 cells growth both on the surface of and within the scaffold material and do not show alarming cytotoxicity; the porosity and surface characteristics of the scaffolds are appropriate. Of the two tested composite materials, the 70/30 BG/\u03b2-TCP scaffold proved to be superior in terms of biocompatibility and mechanical strength. The mechanical strength of the scaffolds makes them unsuitable for load bearing applications.

{"title": "3D Printing of Lotus Root-Like Biomimetic Materials for Cell Delivery and Tissue Regeneration.", "abstract": "Biomimetic materials have drawn more and more attention in recent years. Regeneration of large bone defects is still a major clinical challenge. In addition, vascularization plays an important role in the process of large bone regeneration and microchannel structure can induce endothelial cells to form rudimentary vasculature. In recent years, 3D printing scaffolds are major materials for large bone defect repair. However, these traditional 3D scaffolds have low porosity and nonchannel structure, which impede angiogenesis and osteogenesis. In this study, inspired by the microstructure of natural plant lotus root, biomimetic materials with lotus root-like structures are successfully prepared via a modified 3D printing strategy. Compared with traditional 3D materials, these biomimetic materials can significantly improve in vitro cell attachment and proliferation as well as promote in vivo osteogenesis, indicating potential application for cell delivery and bone regeneration.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2017-12-23", "authors": ["ChunFeng", "WenjieZhang", "CuijunDeng", "GuanglongLi", "JiangChang", "ZhiyuanZhang", "XinquanJiang", "ChengtieWu"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.201700401"}

In this work, we present a low-cost optical module for estimating the filling level of packed magnetic beads within a Lab-on-a-Chip device.

The device is a simple optical microscope module is manufactured by 3D printing. An objective lens directly interrogates the height of packed beads which are efficiently isolated on the finger-actuated chip. Optionally, an inexpensive, battery-powered Light Emitting Diode may project a shadow of the microfluidic chip at approximately 50-fold magnification onto a nearby surface. The reader is calibrated with the filling levels of known concentrations of paramagnetic beads within the finger actuated chip.

As a proof of concept, we present a case of reconstruction of a craniofacial defect with involvement of the supraorbital rim. The following hybrid manufacturing process combines additive manufacturing with silicone molding and an intraoperative, manual fabrication process. A computer-aided design template is 3D printed from thermoplastics by a fused deposition modeling 3D printer and then silicone molded manually. After sterilization of the patient-specific mold, it is used intraoperatively to produce an implant from polymethylmethacrylate. Due to the combination of these 2 straightforward processes, the procedure can be kept very simple, and no advanced equipment is needed, resulting in minimal financial expenses. The whole fabrication of the mold is performed within approximately 2 hours depending on the template's size and volume.

{"title": "Localized Pulsed Electrodeposition Process for Three-Dimensional Printing of Nanotwinned Metallic Nanostructures.", "abstract": "Nanotwinned-metals (nt-metals) offer superior mechanical (high ductility and strength) and electrical (low electromigration) properties compared to their nanocrystalline (nc) counterparts. These properties are advantageous in particular for applications in nanoscale devices. However, fabrication of nt-metals has been limited to films (two-dimensional) or template-based (one-dimensional) geometries, using various chemical and physical processes. In this Letter, we demonstrate the ambient environment localized pulsed electrodeposition process for direct printing of three-dimensional (3D) freestanding nanotwinned-Copper (nt-Cu) nanostructures. 3D nt-Cu structures were additively manufactured using pulsed electrodeposition at the tip of an electrolyte-containing nozzle. Focused ion beam (FIB) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that the printed metal was fully dense, and was mostly devoid of impurities and microstructural defects. FIB and TEM images also revealed nanocrystalline-nanotwinned-microstructure (nc-nt-microstructure), and confirmed the formation of coherent twin boundaries in the 3D-printed Cu. Mechanical properties of the 3D-printed nc-nt-Cu were characterized by direct printing (FIB-less) of micropillars for in situ SEM microcompression experiments. The 3D-printed nc-nt-Cu exhibited a flow stress of over 960 MPa, among the highest ever reported, which is remarkable for a 3D-printed material. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the nc-nt-Cu were compared to those of nc-Cu printed using the same process under direct current (DC) voltage.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2017-12-20", "authors": ["SoheilDaryadel", "AliBehroozfar", "S RezaMorsali", "SalvadorMoreno", "MahmoudBaniasadi", "JuliaBykova", "Rodrigo ABernal", "MajidMinary-Jolandan"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b03930"}

Recent progress in this field has made tough photopolymer resins and cheap LED light engines available. This study presents the influence of photoinitiator selection and post-processing on the thermomechanical properties of various tough photopolymers. The influence of three photoinitiators (Ivocerin, BAPO, and TPO-L) on the double-bond conversion and mechanical properties was investigated by mid infrared spectroscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis and tensile tests. It was found that 1.18 wt % TPO-L would provide the best overall results in terms of double-bond conversion and mechanical properties. A correlation between double-bond conversion, yield strength, and glass transition temperature was found. Elongation at break remained high after post-curing at about 80-100%, and was not influenced by higher photoinitiator concentration. Finally, functional parts with 41 MPa tensile strength, 82% elongation at break, and 112 \u00b0C glass transition temperature were printed on a 405 nm DLP (digital light processing) printer.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-12-20", "authors": ["BernhardSteyrer", "PhilippNeubauer", "RobertLiska", "J\u00fcrgenStampfl"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10121445\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00074\n10.1002/adma.201503132\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1244085\n10.1016/j.matdes.2017.04.049\n10.1039/C5PY01631B\n10.1016/j.msea.2006.10.007\n10.1186/s40494-016-0097-y\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2014.09.001\n10.1039/C4PY00072B\n10.1016/j.dental.2005.06.006\n10.1016/j.jiec.2016.04.017\n10.1177/154405910508400908\n10.1016/S0924-0136(03)00028-1\n10.1023/B:JMSC.0000020010.73768.4a\n10.1108/13552549910267452\n10.1108/13552549910251855\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2004.09.008\n10.1016/j.matdes.2008.05.016"}

We compared the geometric accuracy, forces required to break thin walls of materials and forces required during drilling.\nAll materials had an acceptable global geometric accuracy (from 0.083mm to 0.203mm of global error). Local accuracy was better in polycarbonate (0.09mm) and polyamide (0.15mm) than in Multicolor (0.90mm) and resin (0.86mm). Resin and polyamide thin walls were not broken at 200N. Forces needed to break Multicolor thin walls were 1.6-3.5 times higher than in bone. For polycarbonate, forces applied were 1.6-2.5 times higher. Polycarbonate had a mode of fracture similar to the cadaver bone. Forces applied on materials during drilling followed a normal distribution except for the polyamide which was melted. Energy spent during drilling was respectively 1.6 and 2.6 times higher on bone than on PC and Multicolor.\nPolycarbonate is a good substitute of human cadaver bone for skull base surgery simulation.

In contrast, many invertebrates have not only evolved extremely strong \"hybrid appendages\" that are composed of rigid ends that can grasp, puncture, and anchor into solid substrates, but they also are compliant and resilient, owing to the functionally graded architecture that integrates rigid termini with their flexible and highly extensible soft musculatures. Inspired by the design principles of these natural hybrid appendages, we demonstrate a synthetic hybrid end effector for soft-bodied robots that exhibits excellent piercing abilities. Through the incorporation of functionally graded interfaces, this design strategy minimizes stress concentrations at the junctions adjoining the fully rigid and soft components and optimizes the bending stiffness to effectively penetrate objects without interfacial failure under shear and compressive loading regimes.

However, WPCs made via SLS are too weak to have widespread applications. In order to increase the mechanical properties of WPCs, a novel type of WPCs containing 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 wt % carbon nanotubes (CNT), 14 wt % wood fibers, 86 wt % polyether sulfone (PES) was manufactured via SLS. The experimental results showed that the addition of small amount of CNTs can significantly increase the mechanical properties of the wood/PES composite material. The tensile strength, bending strength, and elasticity modulus were 76.3%, 227.9%, and 128.7% higher with 0.1 wt % CNTs than those without CNTs. The mechanical properties of specimens first increased and then decreased with the addition of CNTs. The SEM results of the specimens' fracture morphology indicate that the preferable bonding interfaces between wood flour grains and PES grains were achieved by adding CNTs to the composites. There are two reasons why the composites possessed superior mechanical properties: CNTs facilitate the laser sintering process of WPCs due to their thermal conductivities, and CNTs directly reinforce WPCs.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2017-12-18", "authors": ["YunheZhang", "JingFang", "JianLi", "YanlingGuo", "QingwenWang"], "doi": "10.3390/polym9120728\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2006.12.002\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.01.043\n10.1016/j.protcy.2016.03.037\n10.1016/j.addma.2016.05.012\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2011.08.013\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.08.088\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2016.04.004\n10.1016/j.optlastec.2016.09.042\n10.1002/pi.2745\n10.1177/0892705712461520\n10.1038/nature04969\n10.1016/j.matdes.2008.08.036\n10.1016/S0007-8506(07)60558-7\n10.1016/j.carbon.2015.09.110\n10.1016/j.msea.2009.12.028\n10.1177/0731684408094062\n10.3390/polym8100370\n10.1002/vnl.20145\n10.1080/15583724.2015.1086368\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.215502\n10.1108/13552540510573365\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2015.01.019\n10.3390/molecules201019041"}

In this study, to enhance bone regeneration, a magnesium phosphate (MgP) ceramic scaffold was incorporated with a novel indene compound, KR-34893. KR-34893 induced the deposition of minerals and expression of osteoblast marker genes in primary human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and a mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell line. Analysis of the mode of action showed that KR-34893 induced the phosphorylation of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and subsequently the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 7, accompanied by SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation. Accordingly, KR-34893 was incorporated into an MgP scaffold prepared by 3D printing at room temperature, followed by cement reaction. KR-34893-incorporated MgP (KR-MgP) induced the expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in\u00a0vitro. In a rat calvaria defect model, KR-MgP scaffolds enhanced bone regeneration and increased bone volume compared with MgP scaffolds, as assessed by micro-computed tomography and histological analyses. In conclusion, we developed a method for producing osteoinductive MgP scaffolds incorporating a bioactive organic compound, without high temperature sintering.

This study explored the potential of 3D printing drug doped HNT constructs. We used a model drug, gentamicin (GS) and polylactic acid (PLA) to fabricate GS releasing disks, beads, and pellets. Gentamicin was released from 3D printed constructs in a sustained manner and had a superior anti-bacterial growth inhibition effect that was dependent on GS doping concentration. While this study focused on a model drug, gentamicin, combination therapy is possible through the fabrication of medical devices containing HNTs doped with a suite of antibiotics or antifungals.

We studied the in vitro biodegradation behavior (up to 4\u202fweeks), mechanical properties and biocompatibility of the developed scaffolds.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), electrochemical tests and \u00b5CT revealed a unique biodegradation mechanism that started with uniform corrosion, followed by localized corrosion, particularly in the center of the scaffolds. Biocompatibility tests performed up to 72\u202fh showed level 0 cytotoxicity (according to ISO 10993-5 and -12), except for one time point (i.e., 24\u202fh).

{"title": "A novel use of 3D printing model demonstrates the effects of deteriorated trabecular bone structure on bone stiffness and strength.", "abstract": "Trabecular bone structure is crucial to normal mechanical behavior of bones. Studies have shown that osteoporosis negatively affects trabecular bone structure, mainly by reducing bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and thus increasing fracture risk. One major limitation in assessing and quantifying the effect of this structural deterioration is that no two trabecular structures are identical. Thus, when we compare a group of healthy bones against a different group of bones that experienced resorption (i.e. decreased BV/TV) we only discover an \"average\" mechanical effect. It is impossible to quantify the mechanical effect of individual structural deterioration for each sample, simply because we never have the same sample in both states (intact and deteriorated structure). 3D printing is a new technology that can assist in overcoming this issue. Here we report a preliminary study that compares a healthy 3D printed trabecular bone model with the same model after bone resorption was simulated. Since the deteriorated structural bone model is derived from the healthy one, it is possible to directly estimate (percentage wise) the decrease of tissue stiffness and strength as a result of bone resorption for this specific structure. Our results demonstrate that a relatively small decrease in BV/TV (about 8%) leads to a dramatic decrease in structural strength (24%) and structural stiffness (17%), (P < 0.01). Structural strength decreased from an average of 9.14 \u00b1 2.85MPa to 6.97 \u00b1 2.44MPa, while structural stiffness decreased from an average of 282.5 \u00b1 63.4N/mm to 233.8 \u00b1 51.2N/mm. This study demonstrates that 3D printing is a novel and valuable tool for quantifying the effect of structural deterioration on the mechanical properties of trabecular bone. In the future, this approach may help us attain better personal fracture risk assessments by CT scanning, 3D printing and mechanically testing individual bone replicas from patients suffering excessive bone resorption.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2017-12-15", "authors": ["Meir MaxBarak", "Margaret ArielleBlack"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.12.010"}
{"title": "Deconvolution of images from 3D printed cells in layers on a chip.", "abstract": "Layer-by-layer cell printing is useful in mimicking layered tissue structures inside the human body and has great potential for being a promising tool in the field of tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug discovery. However, imaging human cells cultured in multiple hydrogel layers in 3D-printed tissue constructs is challenging as the cells are not in a single focal plane. Although confocal microscopy could be a potential solution for this issue, it compromises the throughput which is a key factor in rapidly screening drug efficacy and toxicity in pharmaceutical industries. With epifluorescence microscopy, the throughput can be maintained at a cost of blurred cell images from printed tissue constructs. To rapidly acquire in-focus cell images from bioprinted tissues using an epifluorescence microscope, we created two layers of Hep3B human hepatoma cells by printing green and red fluorescently labeled Hep3B cells encapsulated in two alginate layers in a microwell chip. In-focus fluorescent cell images were obtained in high throughput using an automated epifluorescence microscopy coupled with image analysis algorithms, including three deconvolution methods in combination with three kernel estimation methods, generating a total of nine deconvolution paths.

{"title": "A New 3D Printing Strategy by Harnessing Deformation, Instability, and Fracture of Viscoelastic Inks.", "abstract": "Direct ink writing (DIW) has demonstrated great potential as a multimaterial multifunctional fabrication method in areas as diverse as electronics, structural materials, tissue engineering, and soft robotics. During DIW, viscoelastic inks are extruded out of a 3D printer's nozzle as printed fibers, which are deposited into patterns when the nozzle moves. Hence, the resolution of printed fibers is commonly limited by the nozzle's diameter, and the printed pattern is limited by the motion paths. These limits have severely hampered innovations and applications of DIW 3D printing. Here, a new strategy to exceed the limits of DIW 3D printing by harnessing deformation, instability, and fracture of viscoelastic inks is reported. It is shown that a single nozzle can print fibers with resolution much finer than the nozzle diameter by stretching the extruded ink, and print various thickened or curved patterns with straight nozzle motions by accumulating the ink. A quantitative phase diagram is constructed to rationally select parameters for the new strategy. Further, applications including structures with tunable stiffening, 3D structures with gradient and programmable swelling properties, all printed with a single nozzle are demonstrated. The current work demonstrates that the mechanics of inks plays a critical role in developing 3D printing technology.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2017-12-15", "authors": ["HyunwooYuk", "XuanheZhao"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.201704028"}

Thus, spherical, aspherical and rotationally non-symmetric lenses can be manufactured in an integrated production process. This technique serves as a noteworthy alternative to multistage, labor-intensive, abrasive processes such as grinding, polishing and diamond turning. Here, we evaluate the quality of lenses fabricated by Luxexcel using patented Printoptical\u00a9 technology that is based on an inkjet printing technique by comparing them to lenses made with traditional glass processing technologies (grinding, polishing etc.). The surface geometry and roughness of the lenses were evaluated using white-light and Fizeau interferometers. We have compared peak-to-valley wavefront deviation, root-mean-squared wavefront error, radii of curvature and the arithmetic average of the roughness profile (Ra) of plastic and glass lenses. Additionally, the imaging performance of selected pairs of lenses was tested using 1951 USAF resolution target. The results indicate performance of 3D printed optics that could be manufactured with surface roughness comparable to that of injection molded lenses (Ra < 20 nm). The RMS wavefront error of 3D printed prototypes was at a minimum 18.8 times larger than equivalent glass prototypes for a lens with a 12.7 mm clear aperture, but when measured within 63% of its clear aperture, 3D printed components' RMS wavefront error was comparable to glass lenses.", "journal": "Optical engineering (Redondo Beach, Calif.)", "date": "2017-12-15", "authors": ["JohnGawedzinski", "Michal EPawlowski", "Tomasz STkaczyk"], "doi": "10.1117/1.OE.56.8.084110\n10.1106/011M-CJ25-64QC-F3A6\n10.1117/12.7972052\n10.1115/1.2900701"}

A novel suture-less inflow cannula, which can be implanted without bypass, uses mild myocardial compression to seal the interface, however, this may lead to necrosis of the myocardium. To circumvent this issue, a bilayered scaffold has been developed to promote tissue growth at the interface between cannula and myocardium. The bilayered scaffold consists of a silicone base layer, which mimics the seal, and a melt electrospun polycaprolactone scaffold to serve as a tissue integration layer. Biocompatibility of the bilayered scaffolds was assessed by analyzing cell viability, morphology, and metabolic activity of human foreskin fibroblasts cultured on the scaffolds for up to 14 days. There was no evidence of cytotoxicity and the cells adhered readily to the bilayered scaffolds, revealing a cell morphology characteristic of fibroblasts, in contrast to the low cell adhesion observed on flat silicone sheets. The rate of cell proliferation on the bilayered scaffolds rose over the 14-day period and was significantly greater than cells seeded on the silicone sheets. This study suggests that melt electrospun bilayered scaffolds have the potential to support tissue integration of a suture-less inflow cannula for cardiovascular applications.

{"title": "Concept and Design of a 3D Printed Support to Assist Hand Scanning for the Realization of Customized Orthosis.", "abstract": "In the rehabilitation field, the use of additive manufacturing techniques to realize customized orthoses is increasingly widespread.

In this work, we present the concept and design of a 3D printed support to assist hand scanning of such patients. The device, realized with FDM additive manufacturing techniques in ABS material, allows palmar acquisitions, and its design and test are motivated by the following needs: (1) immobilizing the hand of patients during the palmar scanning to reduce involuntary movements affecting the scanning quality and (2) keeping hands open and in a correct position, especially to contrast the high degree of hypertonicity of spastic subjects. The resulting device can be used indifferently for the right and the left hand; it is provided in four-dimensional sizes and may be also suitable as a palmar support for the acquisition of the dorsal side of the hand.", "journal": "Applied bionics and biomechanics", "date": "2017-12-14", "authors": ["GabrieleBaronio", "PaolaVolonghi", "AlbertoSignoroni"], "doi": "10.1155/2017/8171520\n10.1155/2016/8347478\n10.5566/ias.1339\n10.1080/10255840802178582\n10.1108/RPJ-07-2012-0065\n10.15221/16.061\n10.1243/0954411001535615\n10.1080/17452759.2010.528183\n10.15221/16\n10.1016/j.addma.2016.04.002\n10.1108/13552540610637273\n10.1186/s41205-016-0007-7\n10.1108/RPJ-03-2012-0027\n10.1177/1758998314544802\n10.1108/RPJ-10-2013-0099\n10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.306\n10.1007/s12541-012-0107-2\n10.1016/0020-7489(87)90031-9\n10.4067/S0717-95022010000300015"}

In this article, we proposed surgical strategies using customized 3D puzzle implant preformed with Rapid Prototype (RP) skull model.\nRetrospective review was done in 28 patients diagnosed with combined orbital floor and medial wall fracture. Using preoperative CT scans, original and mirror-imaged RP skull models for each patient were prepared and sterilized. In all patients, porous polyethylene-coated titanium mesh was premolded onto RP skull model in two ways; Customized 3D jigsaw puzzle technique was used in 15 patients with comminuted inferomedial strut, whereas individual 3D implant technique was used in each fracture for 13 patients with intact inferomedial strut. Outcomes including enophthalmos, visual acuity, and presence of diplopia were assessed and orbital volume was measured using OsiriX software preoperatively and postoperatively.\nSatisfactory results were achieved in both groups in terms of clinical improvements. Of 10 patients with preoperative diplopia, 9 improved in 6 months, except one with persistent symptom who underwent extraocular muscle rupture. 18 patients who had moderate to severe enophthalmos preoperatively improved, and one remained with mild degree. Orbital volume ratio, defined as volumetric ratio between affected and control orbit, decreased from 127.6% to 99.79% (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in comminuted group, and that in intact group decreased from 117.03% to 101.3% (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nOur surgical strategies using the jigsaw puzzle and individual reconstruction technique provide accurate restoration of combined orbital floor and medial wall fractures.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2017-12-14", "authors": ["Young ChulKim", "Kyung HyunMin", "Jong WooChoi", "Kyung SKoh", "Tae SukOh", "Woo ShikJeong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2017.11.016"}

Unfortunately, the development of new chemotherapeutics is a long and costly process. New methods are needed to identify promising drug candidates earlier in the drug development process. Most chemotherapies are administered to patients in combinations. Here, an in vitro platform is used to assess the penetration and metabolism of combination chemotherapies in three-dimensional colon cancer cell cultures, or spheroids. Colon carcinoma HCT 116 cells were cultured and grown into three-dimensional cell culture spheroids. These spheroids were then dosed with a common combination chemotherapy, FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan) in a 3D printed fluidic device. This fluidic device allows for the dynamic treatment of spheroids across a semipermeable membrane. Following dosing, the spheroids were harvested for quantitative proteomic profiling to examine the effects of the combination chemotherapy on the colon cancer cells. Spheroids were also imaged to assess the spatial distribution of administered chemotherapeutics and metabolites with MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry. Following treatment, we observed penetration of folinic acid to the core of spheroids and metabolism of the drug in the outer proliferating region of the spheroid. Proteomic changes identified included an enrichment of several cancer-associated pathways. This innovative dosing device, along with the proteomic evaluation with iTRAQ-MS/MS, provides a robust platform that could have a transformative impact on the preclinical evaluation of drug candidates.

However, modern design of structures requires accounting for a great number of criteria derived from multiple disciplines, often of conflicting nature. Such criteria derived from structural engineering, eco-design, bioclimatic and acoustic performance. The resulting vast number of alternatives enhances the need for computer-aided architecture in order to increase the possibility of arriving at a more preferable solution.

There is a need for the fabrication of complex structures from reactive biomaterials as well as heterogeneous structures with controlled material compositions. In particular, during reactive material printing, reactive solutions/suspensions that undergo changes in rheological properties or cytocompatibility are not printable using traditional bioprinting approaches that require all components of bioinks to be mixed before deposition. The objective of this study is to develop and implement an intersecting jets-based inkjet bioprinting approach, which enables voxel-resolution printing-then-mixing for the fabrication of biological structures using reactive materials as well as structures having a compositional gradient. Inkjetting is implemented herein as a versatile technique to simultaneously deposit droplets of disparate materials at controlled locations where active collision, mixing, and coalescence occur. For reactive material printing, neural stem cell (NSC) spheres are fabricated from reactive PuraMatrix hydrogel solution and physiological cell suspension, and cell-laden alginate structures are also printed in air directly from reactive sodium alginate and calcium chloride solutions. For heterogeneous structure printing, collagen sheets with a hydroxyapatite (HAP) content gradient are fabricated to demonstrate the unique online control of material composition throughout a structure. It is demonstrated that the proposed bioprinting approach is feasible for applications that utilize reactive materials or require heterogeneous compositions.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2017-12-11", "authors": ["KyleChristensen", "AshleyCompaan", "WenxuanChai", "GuangbinXia", "YongHuang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00752"}

Stem-cell-based approach combined with injectable hydrogels has been proposed as a promising strategy in periodontal treatments. Stem cells fate closely depends on their extracellular matrix (ECM) characteristics. Hence, it is necessary to engineer an appropriate injectable hydrogel to deliver stem cells into the defect while serving as the ECM during healing. Therefore, stem cell-ECM interaction should be studied for better stem cell transplantation. In this study, we developed a bioprinting-based strategy to study stem cell-ECM interaction and thus screen an appropriate ECM for in vivo repair of alveolar bone defect. Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) were encapsulated in injectable, photocrosslinkable composite hydrogels composed of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDA). PDLSC-laden GelMA/PEGDA hydrogels with varying composition were efficiently fabricated via a 3D bioprinting platform by controlling the volume ratio of GelMA-to-PEGDA. PDLSC behavior and fate were found to be closely related to the engineered ECM composition. The 4/1 GelMA/PEGDA composite hydrogel was selected since the best performance in osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Finally, in vivo study indicated a maximal and robust new bone formation in the defects treated with the PDLSC-laden hydrogel with optimized composition as compared to the hydrogel alone and the saline ones. The developed approach would be useful for studying cell-ECM interaction in 3D and paving the way for regeneration of functional tissue.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2017-12-11", "authors": ["YufeiMa", "YuanJi", "TianyuZhong", "WantingWan", "QingzhenYang", "AngLi", "XiaohuiZhang", "MinLin"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00601"}

We here demonstrated that not only the hierarchical micro-nanostructured surface topography but also their distribution density played critical role on cell cytocompatibility. The microstructured topography feature surface with middle-density distributed titanium microspheres showed significantly enhanced cell responses, which might be attributed to the better cellular interaction due to the cell aggregates. However, the hierarchical micro-nanostructured topography surface, regardless of the distribution density of titanium microspheres, improved the cell-surface interactions because of the enhanced initial protein adsorption, thereby reducing the cell aggregates and consequently their responses. This work, therefore, provides new insights into the fundamental understanding of cell-material interactions and will have a profound impact on further designing micro-nanostructured topography surfaces to control cell responses.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2017-12-11", "authors": ["XiaoxiaoHuang", "LijunShan", "KuiCheng", "WenjianWeng"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00551"}

The model has the capacity to correctly estimate the material performance and to reproduce the bonelike toughening mechanisms, occurring at different length scales in our composites.

However, the feasibility of such approaches is limited in patients with previous osteoporotic fractures as the resultant vertebral deformity renders the end plate geometry incongruous with conventional interbody implants. Current 3-dimensional (3D) printing technology offers a novel solution by fabricating custom-made implants tailored to individual anatomy. We present the results of a patient with osteoporotic lumbar fractures treated by such technology.\nA 74-year-old woman, with previous osteoporotic fractures at L2 and L3 resulting in concave deformity of the end plates, presented with intractable radiculopathy secondary to lateral recess and foraminal stenosis (L2-3 and L3-4). A minimally invasive lateral lumbar interbody fusion at L2-3 and L3-4 was considered favorable, but due to the associated vertebral collapse, off-the-shelf implants were not compatible with patient anatomy. In silico simulation based on preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging was thus conducted to design customized cages to cater for the depressed recipient end plates and vertebral loss. The design was converted to implantable titanium cages through 3D additive manufacturing. At surgery, a tight fit between the implants and the targeted disk space was achieved. Postoperative CT scan confirmed excellent implant-end plate matching and restoration of lost disk space. The patient began to ambulate from postoperative day 1 and at 6-month follow-up resolution of radicular symptoms and CT evidence of interbody fusion were recorded.\n3D-printed custom-made interbody cages can help overcome the difficulties in deformity correction secondary to osteoporotic fractures.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2017-12-11", "authors": ["Timothy LSiu", "Jeffrey MRogers", "KainuLin", "RobertThompson", "MarkOwbridge"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.11.160"}

Additive manufacturing now provides the answer to this limitation, which leads to the novel domain of customized ordered packing and a variety of optimized geometries. In this work, the chromatographic behaviour of ordered configurations of particles was described using computational fluid dynamics methods based on the Lattice Boltzmann Model. The model was first validated by matching van Deemter trends for ordered and random packings shown in previous research. The influence of rotations of the ordered configurations was then considered, indicating that orientational changes with respect to the main flow axis can strongly affect minimum plate height. In particular, it is demonstrated that targeted rotations of ordered packings can reduce axial dispersion while improving transverse dispersion, thus improving chromatographic performance. This principle is clearly shown in a strong linear correlation between tortuosity and plate height, offering an additional parameter to enable a priori control of the performance of ordered packings. Furthermore, rotation of the packing does not change porosity or surface area and has a relatively small effect on permeability. Thus, highly permeable packings with poor dispersion can be improved in terms of chromatographic impedance by simple rotation of the packing orientation. This work further demonstrates the advantages of ordered packings over randomly packed beds, and introduces new perspectives on the development of chromatographic structures with improved performance.", "journal": "Journal of chromatography.

Although more complex to produce and with less predictable properties compared to bulk implants, implants with a highly porous structure can be produced to match the bone stiffness and at the same time favor bone ingrowth and regeneration. This paper presents the results of the mechanical and dimensional characterization of different regular cubic open-cell cellular structures produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) of Ti6Al4V alloy, all with the same nominal elastic modulus of 3GPa that matches that of human trabecular bone. The main objective of this research was to determine which structure has the best fatigue resistance through fully reversed fatigue tests on cellular specimens. The quality of the manufacturing process and the discrepancy between the actual measured cell parameters and the nominal CAD values were assessed through an extensive metrological analysis. The results of the metrological assessment allowed us to discuss the effect of manufacturing defects (porosity, surface roughness and geometrical inaccuracies) on the mechanical properties. Half of the specimens was subjected to a stress relief thermal treatment while the other half to Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP), and we compared the effect of the treatments on porosity and on the mechanical properties. Fatigue strength seems to be highly dependent on the surface irregularities and notches introduced during the manufacturing process. In fully reversed fatigue tests, the high performances of stretching dominated structures compared to bending dominated structures are not found.

{"title": "3D printing of high drug loaded dosage forms using thermoplastic polyurethanes.", "abstract": "It was the aim of this study to develop high drug loaded (>30%, w/w), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-based dosage forms via fused deposition modelling (FDM). Model drugs with different particle size and aqueous solubility were pre-processed in combination with diverse TPU grades via hot melt extrusion (HME) into filaments with a diameter of 1.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009mm. Subsequently, TPU-based filaments which featured acceptable quality attributes (i.e. consistent filament diameter, smooth surface morphology and good mechanical properties) were printed into tablets. The sustained release potential of the 3D printed dosage forms was tested in vitro. Moreover, the impact of printing parameters on the in vitro drug release was investigated. TPU-based filaments could be loaded with 60% (w/w) fine drug powder without observing severe shark skinning or inconsistent filament diameter. During 3D printing experiments, HME filaments based on hard TPU grades were successfully converted into personalized dosage forms containing a high concentration of crystalline drug (up to 60%, w/w). In vitro release kinetics were mainly affected by the matrix composition and tablet infill degree. Therefore, this study clearly demonstrated that TPU-based FDM feedstock material offers a lot of formulation freedom for the development of personalized dosage forms.", "journal": "International journal of pharmaceutics", "date": "2017-12-09", "authors": ["GVerstraete", "ASamaro", "WGrymonpr\u00e9", "VVanhoorne", "BVan Snick", "M NBoone", "THellemans", "LVan Hoorebeke", "J PRemon", "CVervaet"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpharm.2017.12.002"}
{"title": "Horizontal ridge reconstruction of the anterior maxilla using customized allogeneic bone blocks with a minimally invasive technique - a case series.", "abstract": "Different surgical procedures have been proposed to achieve horizontal ridge reconstruction of the anterior maxilla; all these procedures, however, require bone replacement materials to be adapted to the bone defect at the time of implantation, resulting in complex and time-consuming procedures. The purpose of this study was to describe how to use a 3D printed hardcopy model of the maxilla to prepare customized milled bone blocks, to be adapted on the bone defect areas using a minimally invasive subperiosteal tunneling technique.\nCone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of the atrophic maxilla of six patients were acquired and modified into 3D reconstruction models. Data were transferred to a 3D printer and solid models were fabricated using autoclavable nylon polyamide. Before the surgery, freeze-dried cortico-cancellous blocks were manually milled and adapted on the 3D printed hardcopy models of the maxillary bone, in order to obtain customized allogeneic bone blocks.\nIn total, eleven onlay customized allogeneic bone grafts were prepared and implanted in 6 patients, using a minimally invasive subperiosteal tunneling technique. The scaffolds closely matched the shape of the defects: this reduced the operation time and contributed to good healing. The patients did not demonstrate adverse events such as inflammation, dehiscence or flap re-opening during the recovery period; however, one patient experienced scaffold resorption, which was likely caused by uncontrolled motion of the removable provisional prosthesis. Following a 6\u00a0month healing period, CBCT was used to assess graft integration, which was followed by insertion of implants into the augmented areas. Prosthetic restorations were placed 4\u00a0months later.\nThese observations suggest that customized bone allografts can be successfully used for horizontal ridge reconstruction of the anterior maxilla: patients demonstrated reduced morbidity and decreased total surgery time.

The all-optical depth coloring (AODC) camera has some benefits in computation load since it extracts depth information of an object fully optically. The AODC camera represents the depth of the object as a variation of wavelength, and spectroscopy is generally required to measure the wavelength. However, in the AODC camera, the color vector in RGB color space is convertible inversely into the wavelength after projection on the normalized rgb plane because the detected spectrum through the gating part has a narrow bandwidth as a result of the width of the slit in the projection part. In this paper, we propose an inverse conversion algorithm from RGB color to depth without spectroscopy. Experimental results are presented to confirm its feasibility.

However, 3D bioprinting has hit a bottleneck in progress because of the lack of suitable bioinks that are printable, have high shape fidelity, and are mechanically resilient. In this study, we introduce a new family of nanoengineered bioinks consisting of kappa-carrageenan (\u03baCA) and two-dimensional (2D) nanosilicates (nSi). \u03baCA is a biocompatible, linear, sulfated polysaccharide derived from red algae and can undergo thermo-reversible and ionic gelation. The shear-thinning characteristics of \u03baCA were tailored by nanosilicates to develop a printable bioink. By tuning \u03baCA-nanosilicate ratios, the thermo-reversible gelation of the bioink can be controlled to obtain high printability and shape retention characteristics. The unique aspect of the nanoengineered \u03baCA-nSi bioink is its ability to print physiologically-relevant-scale tissue constructs without requiring secondary supports.

Matrix stiffness is a key determinant of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation, suggesting that modulation of alginate bioink mechanical properties represents a promising strategy to spatially regulate MSC fate within bioprinted tissues. In this study, we define a printability window for alginate of differing molecular weight (MW) by systematically varying the ratio of alginate to ionic crosslinker within the bioink. We demonstrate that the MW of such alginate bioinks, as well as the choice of ionic crosslinker, can be tuned to control the mechanical properties (Young's Modulus, Degradation Rate) of 3D printed constructs. These same factors are also shown to influence growth factor release from the bioinks. We next explored if spatially modulating the stiffness of 3D bioprinted hydrogels could be used to direct MSC fate inside printed tissues. Using the same alginate and crosslinker, but varying the crosslinking ratio, it is possible to bioprint constructs with spatially varying mechanical microenvironments.

{"title": "A 3D-Printed Sensor for Monitoring Biosignals in Small Animals.", "abstract": "Although additive manufacturing technologies, also known as 3D printing, were first introduced in the 1980s, they have recently gained remarkable popularity owing to decreased costs. 3D printing has already emerged as a viable technology in many industries; in particular, it is a good replacement for microfabrication technology. Microfabrication technology usually requires expensive clean room equipment and skilled engineers; however, 3D printing can reduce both cost and time dramatically. Although 3D printing technology has started to emerge into microfabrication manufacturing and medical applications, it is typically limited to creating mechanical structures such as hip prosthesis or dental implants. There have been increased interests in wearable devices and the critical part of such wearable devices is the sensing part to detect biosignals noninvasively. In this paper, we have built a 3D-printed sensor that can measure electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram from zebrafish. Despite measuring biosignals noninvasively from zebrafish has been known to be difficult due to that it is an underwater creature, we were able to successfully obtain electrophysiological information using the 3D-printed sensor. This 3D printing technique can accelerate the development of simple noninvasive sensors using affordable equipment and provide an economical solution to physiologists who are unfamiliar with complicated microfabrication techniques.", "journal": "Journal of healthcare engineering", "date": "2017-12-07", "authors": ["Sung-JoonCho", "DonghakByun", "Tai-SeungNam", "Seok-YongChoi", "Byung-GeunLee", "Myeong-KyuKim", "SoheeKim"], "doi": "10.1155/2017/9053764\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.12.011\n10.1021/la010655t\n10.1016/j.bushor.2011.11.003\n10.1136/bjophthalmol-2013-304446\n10.1021/ac403397r\n10.1007/s10856-005-4716-5\n10.1007/s11947-016-1692-3\n10.1108/09556220810843502\n10.1016/s0026-0657(14)70138-9\n10.1016/j.wneu.2013.07.009\n10.1053/j.jfas.2012.01.014\n10.1088/1758-5082/3/1/015004\n10.1055/s-0031-1274758\n10.1002/stc.88\n10.3233/THC-2010-0604\n10.3390/s16101635\n10.1109/MEMB.2010.936554\n10.1023/A:1020200822435\n10.1038/s41598-017-03482-6\n10.1152/jn.00538.2015\n10.1109/ICSENS.2015.7370544\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2011.06.001\n10.1242/dmm.002139\n10.1038/srep25073\n10.1016/j.bios.2015.04.027\n10.1179/147683008X301478\n10.1152/ajpheart.00960.2005"}
{"title": "The Application of 3D Printing in the Formulation of Multilayered Fast Dissolving Oral Films.", "abstract": "Fast-dissolving oral films (FDFs) provide an alternative approach to increase consumer acceptance by advantage of rapid dissolution and administration without water. Usually, FDFs require taste-masking agents. However, inclusion of these excipients could make developing the formulation a challenging task. Hence, this work employed fused-deposition modeling three-dimensional printing to produce single-layered FDFs (SLFDFs), or multilayered FDFs (MLFDFs) films, with taste-masking layers being separated from drug layer. Filaments were prepared containing polyethylene oxide (PEO) with ibuprofen or paracetamol as model drugs at 60\u00b0C. Also, filaments were produced containing polyvinyl alcohol and paracetamol at 130\u00b0C. Furthermore, a filament was prepared containing PEO and strawberry powder for taste-masking layer. FDFs were printed at temperatures of 165\u00b0C (PEO) or 190\u00b0C (polyvinyl alcohol) with plain or mesh designs. High-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy analysis indicated active ingredient stability during film preparation process. SLFDFs had thicknesses as small as 197 \u00b1 21 \u03bcm, and MLFDFs had thicknesses starting from 298 \u00b1 15 \u03bcm. Depending on the formulation and design, mesh SLFDFs presented disintegration time as short as 42 \u00b1 7 s, and this was 48 \u00b1 5 s for mesh MLFDFs. SLFDFs showed drug content uniformity in the range of 106.0%-112.4%. In conclusion, this study provides proof-of-concept for the manufacturing of FDFs by using 3D printing.", "journal": "Journal of pharmaceutical sciences", "date": "2017-12-07", "authors": ["TourajEhtezazi", "MarwanAlgellay", "YamirIslam", "MattRoberts", "Nicola MDempster", "Satyajit DSarker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.xphs.2017.11.019"}

After identifying unsolved practical difficulties in administration of EN using volume syringes, a new device to overcome such technical difficulties was proposed.\nSpecific technologies (CAD, 3D printing) were used in collaboration with the PRODINTEC Foundation (Gij\u00f3n, Asturias). Clarke Modet, a law firm specialized in intellectual property, provided legal advice on formulas for legal protection of the invention.\nThe resulting device is a manual pump for infusion of EN to patients that solves previously identified problems and is highly functional and compact. It would allow for comfortable and safe administration of solutions. Integration of a bottle into the device itself and pump dimensions facilitate transport and patient mobility. According to the described configuration, this invention has many advantages over the previously known procedures, such as a simpler administration within the field of intermittent EN, improving the standard nutritional support technique, which in this case is use of volume syringes. This would facilitate the work of caregivers while promoting patient self-care and autonomy.

In this study, we used collagen type I (COL) or agarose (AG) mixed with sodium alginate (SA) to serve as 3D bioprinting bioinks and incorporated chondrocytes to construct in vitro 3D printed cartilage tissue. Swelling ratio, mechanical properties, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cell viability and cytoskeleton, biochemistry analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed to investigate the function of different bioinks in 3D printing cartilage tissue engineering applications. The results showed that the mechanical strength was improved in both SA/COL and SA/AG groups compared to SA alone. Besides, the addition of COL or AG has little impact on gelling behavior, demonstrating the advantage as bioinks for 3D printing. Among the three scaffolds, SA/COL could distinctly facilitated cell adhesion, accelerated cell proliferation and enhanced the expression of cartilage specific genes such as Acan, Col2al and Sox9 than the other two groups. Lower expression of Col1a1, the fibrocartilage marker, was present in SA/COL group than that in both of SA and SA/AG groups. The results indicated that SA/COL effectively suppressed dedifferentiation of chondrocytes and preserved the phenotype. In summary, 3D bioprinted SA/COL with favorable mechanical strength and biological functionality is promising in cartilage tissue engineering.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

Bacterial cells have been exposed to be important resources that hold huge potential as ecofriendly, cost-effective, evading toxic of dangerous chemicals and the alternative of conventional physiochemical synthesis. The Shewanella oneidensis is an important kind of metal reducing bacterium, known as its special anaerobic respiratory and sulfate reducing capacity.

The use of imidazolium based ionic liquids as soft templating agent for controlling self-assembly and crystal growth direction of metal sulfide nanoparticles has also advanced as an important method. The microscopic techniques showed that the nanoparticles are designed on the nano form and have an excellent spherical morphology, due to the self-assembled mechanism of ionic liquid assistance.

{"title": "Through the Eustachian Tube and Beyond: A New Miniature Robotic Endoscope to See Into The Middle Ear.", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel miniature robotic endoscope that is small enough to pass through the Eustachian tube and provide visualization of the middle ear (ME). The device features a miniature bending tip previously conceived of as a small-scale robotic wrist that has been adapted to carry and aim a small chip-tip camera and fiber optic light sources. The motivation for trans-Eustachian tube ME inspection is to provide a natural-orifice-based route to the ME that does not require cutting or lifting the eardrum, as is currently required. In this paper, we first perform an analysis of the ME anatomy and use a computational design optimization platform to derive the kinematic requirements for endoscopic inspection of the ME through the Eustachian tube. Based on these requirements, we fabricate the proposed device and use it to demonstrate the feasibility of ME inspection in an anthropomorphic model, i.e. a 3D-printed ME phantom generated from patient image data. We show that our prototype provides > 74% visibility coverage of the sinus tympani, a region of the ME crucial for diagnosis, compared to an average of only 6.9% using a straight, non-articulated endoscope through the Eustachian Tube.", "journal": "IEEE robotics and automation letters", "date": "2017-12-05", "authors": ["LorisFichera", "Neal PDillon", "DongqingZhang", "Isuru SGodage", "Michael ASiebold", "Bryan IHartley", "Jack HNoble", "Paul TRussell", "Robert FLabadie", "Robert JWebster"], "doi": "10.1109/LRA.2017.2668468"}

The development of cost-effective desktop stereolithography (SLA) printing systems and the corresponding resins makes this novel technique accessible to dental offices and dental laboratories. The aim of the study was to reveal the response of soft tissue cells to Clear and Dental SG resins used in desktop SLA printing systems at different stages of processing. Cell activity of L929 cells and gingival fibroblasts (GF) in response to the materials was examined in indirect and direct monolayer culture models and a direct spheroid culture model based on MTT, resazurin-based toxicity assays, and live-dead staining. Overall we found that the impact of Clear and Dental SG resins on L929 and GF depends on the processing stage of the materials. Liquid Clear resin induced a stronger reduction of cell activity compared to Dental SG resin. Printing and postcuring reduced the impact on cell activity and viability.

A huge emphasis is placed on the manipulation, shape, weight, and comfort of a prosthesis, to enable its use as an inherent body part. Even with technological advances, customized upper-extremity myoelectric prosthesis remain heavy and expensive. The high cost of upper-extremity prosthesis is an especially steep economic barrier for patients. Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a promising avenue for reducing the cost of prosthesis. We applied 3D-printed pressure-sensored prosthetics to a traumatic transradial amputee, and compared the hand functions with a customized myoelectric prosthesis. The 3D-printed pressure-sensored prosthetics showed low grip strength and decreased dexterity compared to the conventional myoelectric prosthesis.

Notably, recent advances in biomaterials and three-dimensional (3D) printing have enabled the manipulation of two or more biomaterials of distinct, yet complementary, mechanical and/or biological properties to form so-called hybrid scaffolds mimicking native tissues. Among various biomaterials, hydrogels synthesized to incorporate living cells and/or biological molecules have dominated due to their hydrated tissue-like environment. Moreover, dispensing-based bioprinting has evolved to the point that it can now be used to create hybrid scaffolds with complex structures. However, the complexities associated with multi-material bioprinting and synthesis of hydrogels used for hybrid scaffolds pose many challenges for their fabrication. This paper presents a brief review of dispensing-based bioprinting of hybrid scaffolds for TE applications. The focus is on the design and fabrication of hybrid scaffolds, including imaging techniques, potential biomaterials, physical architecture, mechanical properties, cell viability, and the importance of vessel-like channels. The key issues and challenges for dispensing-based bioprinting of hybrid scaffolds are also identified and discussed along with recommendations for future research directions.

{"title": "Magnetic alginate microfibers as scaffolding elements for the fabrication of microvascular-like structures.", "abstract": "Traditional cell-encapsulating scaffolds may elicit adverse host responses and inhomogeneity in cellular distribution. Thus, fabrication techniques for cellular self-assembly with micro-scaffold incorporation have been used recently to generate toroidal cellular modules for the bottom-up construction of vascular-like structures. The micro-scaffolds show advantage in promoting tissue formation. However, owing to the lack of annular cell micro-scaffolds, it remains a challenge to engineer micro-scale toroidal cellular modules (micro-TCMs) to fabricate microvascular-like structures. Here, magnetic alginate microfibers (MAMs) are used as scaffolding elements, where a winding strategy enables them to be formed into micro-rings as annular cell micro-scaffolds. These micro-rings were investigated for NIH/3T3 fibroblast growth as a function of surface chemistry and MAM size. Afterwards, micro-TCMs were successfully fabricated with the formation of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and extracellular matrix layers on the three-dimensional micro-ring surfaces. Simple non-contact magnetic assembly was used to stack the micro-TCMs along a micro-pillar, after which cell fusion rapidly connected the assembled micro-TCMs into a microvascular-like structure. Endothelial cells or drugs encapsulated in the MAMs could be included in the microvascular-like structures as in vitro cellular models for vascular tissue engineering, or as miniaturization platforms for pharmaceutical drug testing in the future.\nMagnetic alginate microfibers functioned as scaffolding elements for guiding cell growth in micro-scale toroidal cellular modules (micro-TCMs) and provided a magnetic functionality to the micro-TCMs for non-contact 3D assembly in external magnetic fields. By using the liquid/air interface, the non-contact spatial manipulation of the micro-TCMs in the liquid environment was performed with a cost-effective motorized electromagnetic needle.

{"title": "Organ Bioprinting: Are We There Yet?", "abstract": "About 15 years ago, bioprinting was coined as one of the ultimate solutions to engineer vascularized tissues, which was impossible to accomplish using the conventional tissue fabrication approaches. With the advances of 3D-printing technology during the past decades, one may expect 3D bioprinting being developed as much as 3D printing. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The printing principles of bioprinting are dramatically different from those applied in industrialized 3D printing, as they have to take the living components into account. While the conventional 3D-printing technologies are actually applied for biological or biomedical applications, true 3D bioprinting involving direct printing of cells and other biological substances for tissue reconstruction is still in its infancy. In this progress report, the current status of bioprinting in academia and industry is subjectively evaluated. The progress made is acknowledged, and the existing bottlenecks in bioprinting are discussed. Recent breakthroughs from a variety of associated fields, including mechanical engineering, robotic engineering, computing engineering, chemistry, material science, cellular biology, molecular biology, system control, and medicine may overcome some of these current bottlenecks. For this to happen, a convergence of these areas into a systemic research area \"3D bioprinting\" is needed to develop bioprinting as a viable approach for creating fully functional organs for standard clinical diagnosis and treatment including transplantation.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2017-12-02", "authors": ["GuifangGao", "YingHuang", "Arndt FSchilling", "KarenHubbell", "XiaofengCui"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201701018"}

{"title": "A fully digital approach to replicate functional and aesthetic parameters in implant-supported full-arch rehabilitation.", "abstract": "The aim of this technical procedure was to use a fully digital technique (FDT) for full-arch implant support rehabilitation. The FDT was used to transfer the provisional restoration parameters to definitive restorations using intraoral scanners.\nThree sets of digital impressions were obtained. Through the first set, standard tessellation language 1 (STL1), provisional restorations screwed to implants and the surrounding gingival tissue was captured. STL2 consisted of intraoral scans of standardized scanbodies screwed to implants to collect 3D positioning data of implants. STL3 included the digital impression of provisional restoration out of the mouth in order to capture the gingival architecture and the peri-implant soft tissue that was not possible to transfer with the previous impressions. STL1, STL2, and STL3 were combined using computer-aided design (CAD) functions into a single file, STL4. Thus, STL4 contained information on the 3D implant positions, soft tissue architectures, occlusal relationships, correct occlusal vertical dimension and aesthetic features. Using STL4, the master models with implant analogues were 3D printed. Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing milled (CAD/CAM-milled) aluminium bars and a resin prototype were produced to test the accuracy and the functional and aesthetic parameters. Titanium frameworks were digitally designed using STL4, milled using CAD/CAM, and finalized with pink resin and resin teeth.\nThe FDT provided an effective fully digital protocol to capture all information for provisional full-arch implant restorations using an intraoral scanner and transfer that information to definitive restorations.", "journal": "Journal of prosthodontic research", "date": "2017-12-02", "authors": ["CarloMonaco", "NicolaRagazzini", "LorenzoScheda", "EdoardoEvangelisti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jpor.2017.10.005"}
{"title": "From Axenic to Mixed Cultures: Technological Advances Accelerating a Paradigm Shift in Microbiology.", "abstract": "Since the onset of microbiology in the late 19th century, scientists have been growing microorganisms almost exclusively as pure cultures, resulting in a limited and biased view of the microbial world. Only a paradigm shift in cultivation techniques - from axenic to mixed cultures - can allow a full comprehension of the (chemical) communication of microorganisms, with profound consequences for natural product discovery, microbial ecology, symbiosis, and pathogenesis, to name a few areas. Three main technical advances during the last decade are fueling the realization of this revolution in microbiology: microfluidics, next-generation 3D-bioprinting, and single-cell metabolomics. These technological advances can be implemented for large-scale, systematic cocultivation studies involving three or more microorganisms.

{"title": "Template Curvature Influences Cell Alignment to Create Improved Human Corneal Tissue Equivalents.", "abstract": "To accurately create corneal stromal equivalents with native-like structure and composition, a new biofunctionalized, curved template is developed that allows the precise orientation of cells and of their extracellular matrix. This template is the first demonstration that curvature alone is sufficient to induce the alignment of human corneal stromal cells, which in turn are able to biofabricate stromal tissue equivalents with cornea-like shape and composition. Specifically, tissues self-released from curved templates show a highly organized nanostructure, comprised of aligned collagen fibrils, significantly higher expression of corneal stroma-characteristic markers keratocan, lumican, decorin, ALDH3, and CHST6 (p = 0.012, 0.033, 0.029, 0.003, and 0.02, respectively), as well as significantly higher elastic modulus (p = 0.0001) compared with their planar counterparts. Moreover, curved tissues are shown to support the growth, stratification, and differentiation of human corneal epithelial cells in vitro, while maintaining their structural integrity and shape without any supporting carriers, scaffolds, or crosslinking agents. Together, these results demonstrate that corneal stromal cells can align and create highly organized, purposeful tissues by the influence of substrate curvature alone, and without the need of additional topographical cues.

The formation and maintenance of cell spheroids in a healthy condition is the critical factor for tissue engineering applications such as the repair of damaged tissues, the development of organ replacement parts and preclinical drug tests. However, culturing spheroids in conventional isolated single wells shows limited yield and reduced maintenance periods due to the lack of proper supplies of nutrition as well as intercellular chemical signaling. Here, we develop novel networked concave microwell arrays for the effective construction of 3D multi-cellular spheroids. The proposed method provides a suitable structure for the diffusion of oxygen, water-soluble nutrients and cytokines for cell-cell interactions between the spheroids in neighboring microwells. We have further demonstrated that hepatocyte spheroid cultured networked concave microwells show enhanced cell viability and albumin secretion compared to the un-networked control group over two weeks. Our results reveal that multi-cellular functionality can be tuned up by networking individual 3D spheroids without supplying additional chemicals or biological supplements.

{"title": "Visualizing endocytic recycling and trafficking in live neurons by subdiffractional tracking of internalized molecules.", "abstract": "Our understanding of endocytic pathway dynamics is restricted by the diffraction limit of light microscopy. Although super-resolution techniques can overcome this issue, highly crowded cellular environments, such as nerve terminals, can also dramatically limit the tracking of multiple endocytic vesicles such as synaptic vesicles (SVs), which in turn restricts the analytical dissection of their discrete diffusional and transport states. We recently introduced a pulse-chase technique for subdiffractional tracking of internalized molecules (sdTIM) that allows the visualization of fluorescently tagged molecules trapped in individual signaling endosomes and SVs in presynapses or axons with 30- to 50-nm localization precision. We originally developed this approach for tracking single molecules of botulinum neurotoxin type A, which undergoes activity-dependent internalization and retrograde transport in autophagosomes. This method was then adapted to localize the signaling endosomes containing cholera toxin subunit-B that undergo retrograde transport in axons and to track SVs in the crowded environment of hippocampal presynapses. We describe (i) the construction of a custom-made microfluidic device that enables control over neuronal orientation; (ii) the 3D printing of a perfusion system for sdTIM experiments performed on glass-bottom dishes; (iii) the dissection, culturing and transfection of hippocampal neurons in microfluidic devices; and (iv) guidance on how to perform the pulse-chase experiments and data analysis. In addition, we describe the use of single-molecule-tracking analytical tools to reveal the average and the heterogeneous single-molecule mobility behaviors.

Inherent to this process is the creation of an evolving polymer network that is exposed to a monomer bath. A combined theoretical and experimental investigation is performed to determine the conditions under which monomer from this bath can diffuse into the propagating polymer network and cause it to swell. First, the growth and swelling processes are decoupled by immersing pre-made polymer networks into monomer baths held at various temperatures. The experimental measurements of the network thickness are found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions obtained from a nonlinear poroelastic model. FPP propagation experiments are then carried out under conditions that lead to swelling. Unexpectedly, for a fixed exposure time, swelling is found to increase with incident light intensity. The experimental data is well described by a novel FPP model accounting for mass transport and the mechanical response of the polymer network, providing key insights into how monomer diffusion affects the conversion profile of the polymer solid and the stresses that are generated during its growth.

{"title": "DIEP Flap Breast Reconstruction in Patients with Breast Ptosis: 2-Stage Reconstruction Using 3-Dimensional Surface Imaging and a Printed Mold.", "abstract": "Autologous breast reconstruction can be performed for breasts with ptosis to a certain extent, but if patients desire to correct ptosis, mastopexy of the contralateral breast is indicated. However, accurate prediction of post-mastopexy breast shape is difficult to make, and symmetrical breast reconstruction requires certain experience. We have previously reported the use of three-dimensional (3D) imaging and printing technologies in deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction. In the present study, these technologies were applied to the reconstruction of breasts with ptosis.\nEight breast cancer patients with ptotic breasts underwent two-stage unilateral DIEP flap breast reconstruction. In the initial surgery, tissue expander (TE) placement and contralateral mastopexy are performed simultaneously. Four to six months later, 3D bilateral breast imaging is performed after confirming that the shape of the contralateral breast (post-mastopexy) is somewhat stabilized, and a 3D-printed breast mold is created based on the mirror image of the shape of the contralateral breast acquired using analytical software. Then, DIEP flap surgery is performed, where the breast mold is used to determine the required flap volume and to shape the breast mound.\nAll flaps were engrafted without any major perioperative complications during both the initial and DIEP flap surgeries. Objective assessment of cosmetic outcome revealed that good breast symmetry was achieved in all cases.\nThe method described here may allow even inexperienced surgeons to achieve reconstruction of symmetrical, non-ptotic breasts with ease and in a short time. While the requirement of two surgeries is a potential disadvantage, our method will be particularly useful in cases involving TEs, i.e., delayed reconstruction or immediate reconstruction involving significant skin resection.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

We compared materials, processes, and costs for 3D printing and molding of patient-specific models for visualization and surgical simulation of congenitally abnormal heart valves. Pediatric atrioventricular valves (mitral, tricuspid, and common atrioventricular valve) were modeled from transthoracic 3D echo images using semi-automated methods implemented as custom modules in 3D Slicer. Valve models were then both 3D printed in soft materials and molded in silicone using 3D printed \"negative\" molds.

{"title": "Internal-external malalignment of the femoral component in kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty increases tibial force imbalance but does not change laxities of the tibiofemoral joint.", "abstract": "The purposes of this study were to quantify the increase in tibial force imbalance (i.e. magnitude of difference between medial and lateral tibial forces) and changes in laxities caused by\u00a0 2\u00b0 and\u00a04\u00b0 of internal-external (I-E) malalignment of the femoral component in kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty. Because I-E malalignment would introduce the greatest changes to the articular surfaces near 90\u00b0 of flexion, the hypotheses were that the tibial force imbalance would be significantly increased near 90\u00b0 flexion and that primarily varus-valgus laxity would be affected near 90\u00b0 flexion.\nKinematically aligned TKA was performed on ten human cadaveric knee specimens using disposable manual instruments without soft tissue release. One 3D-printed reference femoral component, with unmodified geometry, was aligned to restore the native distal and posterior femoral joint lines. Four 3D-printed femoral components, with modified geometry, introduced I-E malalignments of 2\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 from the reference component. Medial and lateral tibial forces were measured from 0\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 flexion using a custom tibial force sensor. Bidirectional laxities in four degrees of freedom were measured from 0\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 flexion using a custom load application system.\nTibial force imbalance increased the greatest at 60\u00b0 flexion where a regression analysis against the degree of I-E malalignment yielded sensitivities (i.e. slopes) of 30\u00a0N/\u00b0 (medial tibial force\u2009>\u2009lateral tibial force) and 10\u00a0N/\u00b0 (lateral tibial force\u2009>\u2009medial tibial force) for internal and external malalignments, respectively. Valgus laxity increased significantly with the 4\u00b0 external component with the greatest increase of 1.5\u00b0 occurring at 90\u00b0 flexion (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nWith the tibial component correctly aligned,\u00a0I-E malalignment of the femoral component\u00a0caused significant\u00a0increases in tibial force imbalance. Minimizing I-E malalignment lowers the increase in the\u00a0tibial force imbalance. By keeping the resection thickness of each posterior femoral condyle to within \u00b1 0.5 mm of the thickness of the respective posterior region of the femoral component, the increase in imbalance can be effectively limited to 38 N. Generally laxities were unaffected within the \u00b1 4\u00ba range tested indicating that instability is not a clinical concern and that manual testing of laxities is not useful to detect I-E malalignment.", "journal": "Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA", "date": "2017-11-29", "authors": ["JeremyRiley", "Joshua DRoth", "Stephen MHowell", "Maury LHull"], "doi": "10.1007/s00167-017-4776-3"}

Additive manufacturing of the industrially relevant alloy Ti-6Al-4V is known to create a multitude of phases and microstructures depending on processing technology and parameters. Current setups are limited by an averaged measurement through the solid and liquid parts. In this work the combination of a micro-focused intense X-ray beam, a fast detector and unidirectional cooling provide the spatial and temporal resolution to separate contributions from solid and liquid phases in limited volumes. Upon rapid heating and cooling, the \u03b2\u2009\u2194\u2009\u03b1' phase transformation is observed repeatedly. At room temperature, single phase \u03b1' is observed. Secondary \u03b2-formation upon formation of \u03b1' is attributed to V partitioning to the \u03b2-phase leading to temporary stabilization.

In this study, we prepared water-dispersible graphene and graphene oxide, which are 2D nanomaterials with high conductivity and potential applications in neural tissue engineering. Moreover, we synthesized a new biodegradable waterborne polyurethane with soft segments that mostly contained poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (2 kDa) and 20 mol% of shorter (1.5 kDa) poly(d,l-lactide) chains. This polyurethane dispersion at a solid content of 25% in a cell culture medium underwent a sol-gel transition near human body temperature with a suitable gel modulus. After this, we mixed graphene or graphene oxide with polyurethane to prepare a graphene-based nanocomposite hydrogel for neural stem cell (NSC) printing. The rheological properties of the graphene-based nanocomposite hydrogel were suitable for the printing and survival of NSCs. Furthermore, the addition of a very low content (25 ppm) of graphene nanomaterials to the hydrogel significantly enhanced the oxygen metabolism (2- to 4-fold increase) as well as the neural differentiation of NSCs.

FTIR spectral analysis was then performed to characterize the possible functionalities of JSC-1 extract, mainly involved in stabilizing and formation of AuNPs. Based on the redox potential of JSC-1 extract, it was further confirmed that the extract provide a strong reducing environment in the reaction medium and causes reduction of gold ions. The resultant AuNPs were then explored to find out their photo-catalytic activity for methylene blue and antibacterial activities against E. coli (18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm) and S. aureus (14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm).

Currently, most studies on scaffolds focus on the two-dimensional (2D) surface structures that are patterned in the micro-/nanoscales with various repeating sizes and shapes to induce the alignment of myoblasts and myotube formation. The 2D patterned surface clearly provides effective analytical results of pattern size and shape of the myoblast alignment and differentiation.

This process finds numerous applications as a direct route toward the fabrication of novel optical and mechanical metamaterials, miniaturized optics, microfluidics, biological scaffolds, and various other intricate 3D parts. As TPL matures, metrology and inspection become a crucial step in the manufacturing process to ensure that the geometric form of the end product meets design specifications. X-ray-based computed tomography (CT) is a nondestructive technique that can provide this inspection capability for the evaluation of complex internal 3D structure. However, polymeric photoresists commonly used for TPL, as well as other forms of stereolithography, poorly attenuate X-rays due to the low atomic number (Z) of their constituent elements and therefore appear relatively transparent during imaging. Here, we present the development of optically clear yet radiopaque photoresists for enhanced contrast under X-ray CT. We have synthesized iodinated acrylate monomers to formulate high-Z photoresist materials that are capable of forming 3D microstructures with sub-150 nm features. In addition, we have developed a formulation protocol to match the refractive index of the photoresists to the immersion medium of the objective lens so as to enable dip-in laser lithography, a direct laser writing technique for producing millimeter-tall structures. Our radiopaque photopolymer resists increase X-ray attenuation by a factor of more than 10 times without sacrificing the sub-150 nm feature resolution or the millimeter-scale part height. Thus, our resists can successfully replace existing photopolymers to generate AM parts that are suitable for inspection via X-ray CT.

This paper presents a novel biofabrication method of implantable carbon electrodes with several advantages including fast prototyping, patient-specific and miniaturization without expensive cleanroom. The method combines stereolithography in additive manufacturing and chemical modification processes to fabricate electrically conductive carbon electrodes. The stereolithography allows the structures to be 3D printed with very fine resolution and desired shapes. The resin is then chemically modified to carbon using pyrolysis to enhance electrochemical performance. The electrochemical characteristics of 3D printing carbon electrodes are assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The specific capacitance of 3D printing carbon electrodes is much higher than the same sized platinum (Pt) electrode. In-vivo electromyography (EMG) recording, 3D printing carbon electrodes exhibit much higher signal-to-noise ratio (40.63\u2009\u00b1\u20097.73) than Pt electrodes (14.26\u2009\u00b1\u20096.83).

Its structure is designed to allocate limited room for each functional module (including an external power module, battery power module, the wireless control and transmission module and some detective sensors), so as to ensure the snake robot works in different environments. In order to control and track the snake robot, a low-cost MEMS-IMU (micro-electro-mechanical systems inertial measurement unit)-based snake robot motion tracking system is developed. Three algorithms (low-pass filter, baseline calibration, and Kalman filter) are used to eliminate noise from IMU's acceleration data, thus minimizing the noise influence to tracking accuracy. Through signal processing, the IMU acceleration data can be effectively used for motion tracking. The result from the video tracking software is employed as a reference for comparison, so as to evaluate the motion tracking algorithm efficiency.

{"title": "Theoretical investigations on microwave Fano resonances in 3D-printable hollow dielectric resonators.", "abstract": "High-index dielectric structures have recently been studied intensively for Mie resonances at optical frequencies. These dielectric structures can enable extreme light manipulation, similar to that which has been achieved with plasmonic nanostructures. In the microwave region, dielectric resonators and metamaterials can be fabricated directly using 3D printing, which is advantageous for fabricating structurally complicated 3D geometries. It is therefore especially suitable for the fabrication of subwavelength structures. Here we report theoretical investigations on microwave Fano resonances in 3D-printable dielectric materials and structures. In particular, we propose and analyse 3D-printable, hollow, dielectric resonators with relatively low refractive indices, which exhibit sharp Fano resonances. We can control the interaction between bright and dark modes in a coupled dielectric particle pair by adjusting the inner-hole size, and thus we can increase the radiative Q factors further. We also find that Fano resonances in these hollow dielectric resonators are very sensitive to an index change in the surrounding medium, which could be useful for long-distance environmental sensing. New possibilities and opportunities are opening up with the rapid development of 3D-printing technologies.

{"title": "Airway morphology and inspiratory flow features in the early stages of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.", "abstract": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is among the leading causes of death worldwide. Inhaled pollutants are the prime risk factor, but the pathogenesis and progression of the diseased is poorly understood. Most studies on the disease onset and trajectory have focused on genetic and molecular biomarkers. Here we investigate the role of the airway anatomy and the consequent respiratory fluid mechanics on the development of COPD.\nWe segmented CT scans from a five-year longitudinal study in three groups of smokers (18 subjects each) having: (i) minimal/mild obstruction at baseline with declining lung function at year five; (ii) minimal/mild obstruction at baseline with stable function, and (iii) normal and stable lung function over the five year period. We reconstructed the bronchial trees up to the 7th generation, and for one subject in each group we performed MRI velocimetry in 3D printed models.\nThe subjects with airflow obstruction at baseline have smaller airway diameters, smaller child-to-parent diameter ratios, larger length-to-diameter ratios, and smaller fractal dimensions. The differences are more significant for subjects that develop severe decline in pulmonary function. The secondary flows that characterize lateral dispersion along the airways are found to be less intense in the subjects with airflow obstruction.\nThese results indicate that morphology of the conducting airways and inspiratory flow features are correlated with the status and progression of COPD already at an early stage of the disease. This suggests that imaging-based biomarkers may allow a pre-symptomatic diagnosis of disease progression.", "journal": "Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)", "date": "2017-11-25", "authors": ["TristanVan de Moortele", "UteGoerke", "Chris HWendt", "FilippoColetti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2017.11.005\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00490.2017"}

{"title": "Tactile perception of the roughness of 3D-printed textures.", "abstract": "Surface roughness is one of the most important qualities in haptic perception. Roughness is a major identifier for judgments of material composition, comfort, and friction and is tied closely to manual dexterity. Some attention has been given to the study of roughness perception in the past, but it has typically focused on noncontrollable natural materials or on a narrow range of artificial materials. The advent of high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) printing technology provides the ability to fabricate arbitrary 3D textures with precise surface geometry to be used in tactile studies. We used parametric modeling and 3D printing to manufacture a set of textured plates with defined element spacing, shape, and arrangement. Using active touch and two-alternative forced-choice protocols, we investigated the contributions of these surface parameters to roughness perception in human subjects. Results indicate that large spatial periods produce higher estimations of roughness (with Weber fraction\u2009=\u20090.19), small texture elements are perceived as rougher than large texture elements of the same wavelength, perceptual differences exist between textures with the same spacing but different arrangements, and roughness equivalencies exist between textures differing along different parameters. We posit that papillary ridges serve as tactile processing units, and neural ensembles encode the spatial profiles of the texture contact area to produce roughness estimates. The stimuli and the manufacturing process may be used in further studies of tactile roughness perception and in related neurophysiological applications. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Surface roughness is an integral quality of texture perception. We manufactured textures using high-resolution 3D printing, which allows precise specification of the surface spatial topography. In human psychophysical experiments we investigated the contributions of specific surface parameters to roughness perception. We found that textures with large spatial periods, small texture elements, and irregular, isotropic arrangements elicit the highest estimations of roughness.

{"title": "Controlling the extrudate swell in melt extrusion additive manufacturing of 3D scaffolds: a designed experiment.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering using three-dimensional porous scaffolds has shown promise for the restoration of normal function in injured and diseased tissues and organs. Rigorous control over scaffold architecture in melt extrusion additive manufacturing is highly restricted mainly due to pronounced variations in the deposited strand diameter upon any variations in process conditions and polymer viscoelasticity. We have designed an I-optimal, split-plot experiment to study the extrudate swell in melt extrusion additive manufacturing and to control the scaffold architecture. The designed experiment was used to generate data to relate three responses (swell, density, and modulus) to a set of controllable factors (plotting needle diameter, temperature, pressure, and the dispensing speed). The fitted regression relationships were used to optimize the three responses simultaneously. The swell response was constrained to be close to 1 while maximizing the modulus and minimizing the density. Constraining the extrudate swell to 1 generates design-driven scaffolds, with strand diameters equal to the plotting needle diameter, and allows a greater control over scaffold pore size. Hence, the modulus of the scaffolds can be fully controlled by adjusting the in-plane distance between the deposited strands. To the extent of the model's validity, we can eliminate the effect of extrudate swell in designing these scaffolds, while targeting a range of porosity and modulus appropriate for bone tissue engineering. The result of this optimization was a predicted modulus of 14\u00a0MPa and a predicted density of 0.29\u00a0g/cm", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials science.

{"title": "Design and manufacturing of patient-specific orthodontic appliances by computer-aided engineering techniques.", "abstract": "Orthodontic treatments are usually performed using fixed brackets or removable oral appliances, which are traditionally made from alginate impressions and wax registrations. Among removable devices, eruption guidance appliances are used for early orthodontic treatments in order to intercept and prevent malocclusion problems. Commercially available eruption guidance appliances, however, are symmetric devices produced using a few standard sizes. For this reason, they are not able to meet all the specific patient's needs since the actual dental anatomies present various geometries and asymmetric conditions. In this article, a computer-aided design-based methodology for the design and manufacturing of a patient-specific eruption guidance appliances is presented. The proposed approach is based on the digitalization of several steps of the overall process: from the digital reconstruction of patients' anatomies to the manufacturing of customized appliances. A finite element model has been developed to evaluate the temporomandibular joint disks stress level caused by using symmetric eruption guidance appliances with different teeth misalignment conditions. The developed model can then be used to guide the design of a patient-specific appliance with the aim at reducing the patient discomfort. At this purpose, two different customization levels are proposed in order to face both arches and single tooth misalignment issues. A low-cost manufacturing process, based on an additive manufacturing technique, is finally presented and discussed.", "journal": "Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

The phantom underwent each step of the radiation therapy process: CT simulation in a straight orientation, plan generation using the treatment planning software, setup to offset marks at the linac, registration and corrected 6DoF table adjustments via hidden target test, delivery of a Winston-Lutz test to the BB, and verification of table positioning via field and laser lights. The registration values, maximum total displacement of the combined Winston-Lutz fields, and a pass or fail criterion of the laser and field lights were recorded. The quality assurance process for each of the three linacs were performed for the first 30 days.\nWithin a 95% confidence interval, the overall uncertainty values for both translation and rotation were below 1.0 mm and 0.5\u00b0 for each linac respectively. When combining the registration values and other uncertainties for all three linacs, the average deviations were within 2.0 mm and 1.0\u00b0 of the designed translation and rotation offsets of the 3D print respectively. For all three linacs, the maximum total deviation for the Winston-Lutz test did not exceed 1.0 mm. Laser and light field verification was within tolerance every day for all three linacs given the latest guidance documentation for table repositioning.\nThe 3D printer is capable of accurately fabricating a quality assurance phantom for 6DoF positioning verification.

Recent trends have seen this technology utilized across a variety of scientific disciplines, including the measurement sciences, but precise fabrication of optical components for high-performance biosensing has not yet been demonstrated. We report here 3D printing of high-quality, custom prisms by stereolithography that enable Kretschmann-configured plasmonic sensing of bacterial toxins. Simple benchtop polishing procedures render a smooth surface that supports propagation of surface plasmon polaritons with a deposited gold layer, which exhibit high bulk refractive index sensitivities and are capable of discriminating trace levels of cholera toxin on a supported lipid membrane interface. Further evidence of the flexibility of this manufacturing technique is demonstrated with printed prisms of varied geometries and in situ monitoring of nanoparticle growth by total internal reflection spectroscopy.

Further, the zebrafish larva is a valuable system for live high-resolution microscopic imaging of dynamic biological phenomena in space and time with cellular resolution. However, the traditional method of agarose encapsulation for live imaging can impede larval development and tissue regrowth. Therefore, this manuscript describes the zWEDGI (zebrafish Wounding and Entrapment Device for Growth and Imaging), which was designed and fabricated as a functionally compartmentalized device to orient larvae for high-resolution microscopy while permitting caudal fin transection within the device and subsequent unrestrained tail development and re-growth. This device allows for wounding and long-term imaging while maintaining viability. Given that the zWEDGI mold is 3D printed, the customizability of its geometries make it easily modified for diverse zebrafish imaging applications. Furthermore, the zWEDGI offers numerous benefits, such as access to the larva during experimentation for wounding or for the application of reagents, paralleled orientation of multiple larvae for streamlined imaging, and reusability of the device.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2017-11-21", "authors": ["KaylaHuemer", "Jayne MSquirrell", "RobertSwader", "KirstenPelkey", "Danny CLeBert", "AnnaHuttenlocher", "Kevin WEliceiri"], "doi": "10.3791/56340"}

To analyze mechanical properties and cytocompatibility, PCL membranes prepared using extrusion-based 3D printing technology were compared in dry and wet conditions and tested in vitro. The proliferation rates and pattern of fibroblasts and preosteoblasts on PCL membranes with different porosities were determined using a cell counting kit-8 assay and scanning electron microscopy. PCL membrane porosity did not affect cell proliferation, but osteogenic differentiation and mechanical properties were increased with lower porosity (30%) on day 14 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Similar results were found in an in vivo calvarial defect model; new bone formation was significantly higher in PCL membranes with lower porosity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

{"title": "Mask-free fabrication of a versatile microwell chip for multidimensional cellular analysis and drug screening.", "abstract": "Cells are frequently studied because they are basic structural, functional, and biological units of living organisms. Extracting features from cellular behaviors can facilitate decision making in medical diagnoses and represents an important aspect in the development of biomedical engineering. Previous studies have just focused on either the individual cell or cell clusters separately, which leads to a great lack of information. Microwell technologies could address the challenges of in vitro cellular studies, from individual cell studies to 3D functional assays, by providing more information from smaller sample volumes and enabling the incorporation of low-cost high-throughput assays in the drug discovery process. To this end, the present study describes an easy-to-use method for fabricating a versatile microwell chip that utilizes a digital micro-mirror device printing system, and the chip can be employed in multidimensional cellular analysis, ranging from the single cell to the 3D spheroid level. The microwell manufacturing process, using a digital mask in place of a conventional physical mask, is based on shadowed light and is full of flexibility. Three different dimensions (single cell (1D), cell monolayer (2D) and cell spheroid (3D)) of one cell type can be formed using a microwell array and the analyses of biological characteristics are achieved separately. Single cells and cell clusters can be controlled via customized geometries of microfabricated selectively adhesive poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) wells. The effects of shape on cellular growth and hybrid tissue layers were investigated by peeling off the microwells. Furthermore, 3D multicellular spheroids were successfully established in a controllable and high-throughput format. Preclinical drug screening was investigated and distinct differences were observed in the tolerance response to drug testing between the 2D and 3D conditions. The study results further demonstrate that the high-density microwell chip is an easy-to-use multidimensional cellular analysis and rapid drug screening technique, and it could be easily adapted for a wide range of biological research applications.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2017-11-21", "authors": ["WenguangYang", "HaiboYu", "GongxinLi", "FananWei", "YuechaoWang", "LianqingLiu"], "doi": "10.1039/c7lc01101f"}

From this model, two types of casts were duplicated, namely conventional dental stone (CDS) using a custom tray impression technique after splinting (N = 5) and polymer cast using additive manufacturing based on the STL file generated. Polymer casts (N = 20; n = 5 per group) were fabricated using 4 different additive manufacturing technologies (multijet printing-MJP1, direct light processing-DLP, stereolithography-SLA, multijet printing-MJP2). CMM was used to measure the correct position of each implant, and distortion was calculated for each system at x-, y-, and z-axes. Measurements were repeated 3 times per specimen in each axis yielding a total of 546 measurements. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, Sheff\u00e9 tests, and Bonferroni correction (\u03b1 = 0.05).\nCompared to CMM, the mean distortion (\u03bcm) ranged from 22.7 to 74.9, 23.4 to 49.1, and 11.0 to 85.8 in the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively.

{"title": "Channelled tablets: An innovative approach to accelerating drug release from 3D printed tablets.", "abstract": "Conventional immediate release dosage forms involve compressing the powder with a disintegrating agent that enables rapid disintegration and dissolution upon oral ingestion. Among 3D printing technologies, the fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing technique has a considerable potential for patient-specific dosage forms. However, the use of FDM 3D printing in tablet manufacturing requires a large portion of polymer, which slows down drug release through erosion and diffusion mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the use of a novel design approach of caplets with perforated channels to accelerate drug release from 3D printed tablets. This strategy has been implemented using a caplet design with perforating channels of increasing width (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 or 1.0mm) and variable length, and alignment (parallel or at right angle to tablet long axis). Hydrochlorothiazide (BCS class IV drug) was chosen as the model drug as enhanced dissolution rate is vital to guarantee oral bioavailability. The inclusion of channels exhibited an increase in the surface area/volume ratio, however, the release pattern was also influenced by the width and the length of the channel. A channel width was\u00a0\u22650.6mm deemed critical to meet the USP criteria of immediate release products. Shorter multiple channels (8.6mm) were more efficient at accelerating drug release than longer channels (18.2mm) despite having comparable surface area/mass ratio. This behaviour may be linked to the reduced flow resistance within the channels and the faster fragmentation during dissolution of these tablets. In conclusion, the width and length of the channel should be carefully considered in addition to surface area/mass when optimizing drug release from 3D printed designs. The incorporation of short channels can be adopted in the designs of dosage forms, implants or stents to enhance the release rate of eluting drug from polymer-rich structures.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2017-11-18", "authors": ["MuznaSadia", "BaselArafat", "WaqarAhmed", "Robert TForbes", "Mohamed AAlhnan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.11.022"}

Different microstructures of suture anchors are systematically designed using orthogonal arrays, and selected based on shape factors associated with mechanical strength. 3D printing is used to fabricate different types of hollow microstructured suture anchors, and optimize their structure for the effective shaping of tissues. To define the structural design for fixing tissues, the maximum force required to pull 3D printed anchors in different directions is examined with tissues. The tissue reshaping function of suture anchors is further simulated ex vivo by using swine ear, nose, and skin, and bovine muscle tendon.

{"title": "Experimental Exploration of Metal Cable as Reinforcement in 3D Printed Concrete.", "abstract": "The Material Deposition Method (MDM) is enjoying increasing attention as an additive method to create concrete mortar structures characterised by a high degree of form-freedom, a lack of geometrical repetition, and automated construction. Several small-scale structures have been realised around the world, or are under preparation. However, the nature of this construction method is unsuitable for conventional reinforcement methods to achieve ductile failure behaviour. Sometimes, this is solved by combining printing with conventional casting and reinforcing techniques. This study, however, explores an alternative strategy, namely to directly entrain a metal cable in the concrete filament during printing to serve as reinforcement. A device is introduced to apply the reinforcement. Several options for online reinforcement media are compared for printability. Considerations specific to the manufacturing process are discussed. Subsequently, pull-out tests on cast and printed specimens provide an initial characterisation of bond behaviour. Bending tests furthermore show the potential of this reinforcement method. The bond stress of cables in printed concrete was comparable to values reported for smooth rebar but lower than that of the same cables in cast concrete. The scatter in experimental results was high. When sufficient bond length is available, ductile failure behaviour for tension parallel to the filament direction can be achieved, even though cable slip occurs.

However, ceramic printing has not yet fully achieved its 3D fabrication capabilities without using polymer binder.

In addition, their differentiation potential was confirmed by examining the expression of pluripotency marker genes and cell surface marker proteins, and differentiation to adipocytes in adipogenic differentiation medium. Our results demonstrate the great potential of the bioprinting method and the resultant hADSC-laden HA/gelatin constructs for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Biopolymers", "date": "2017-11-16", "authors": ["ShinjiSakai", "HiromiOhi", "TomokiHotta", "HidenoriKamei", "MasahitoTaya"], "doi": "10.1002/bip.23080"}

Cell adsorption and fermentation kinetics were similar irrespective of the bead size and lattice structure. The cells bound to 15\u202fmm beads exhibited reduced fermentation time as compared to free cell fermentations; maximum productivity and propionic acid titer of 0.46\u202fg/L\u202fh and 25.8\u202fg/L, respectively, were obtained.

{"title": "Comparison of Fit of Dentures Fabricated by Traditional Techniques Versus CAD/CAM Technology.", "abstract": "To compare the shrinkage of denture bases fabricated by three methods: CAD/CAM, compression molding, and injection molding. The effect of arch form and palate depth was also tested.\nNine titanium casts, representing combinations of tapered, ovoid, and square arch forms and shallow, medium, and deep palate depths, were fabricated using electron beam melting (EBM) technology. For each base fabrication method, three poly(vinyl siloxane) impressions were made from each cast, 27 dentures for each method. Compression-molded dentures were fabricated using Lucitone 199 poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA), and injection molded dentures with Ivobase's Hybrid Pink PMMA. For CAD/CAM, denture bases were designed and milled by Avadent using their Light PMMA. To quantify the space between the denture and the master cast, silicone duplicating material was placed in the intaglio of the dentures, the titanium master cast was seated under pressure, and the silicone was then trimmed and recovered. Three silicone measurements per denture were recorded, for a total of 243 measurements. Each silicone measurement was weighed and adjusted to the surface area of the respective arch, giving an average and standard deviation for each denture.\nComparison of manufacturing methods showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0001). Using a ratio of the means, compression molding had on average 41% to 47% more space than injection molding and CAD/CAM. Comparison of arch/palate forms showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.023), with shallow palate forms having more space with compression molding. The ovoid shallow form showed CAD/CAM and compression molding had more space than injection molding.\nOverall, injection molding and CAD/CAM fabrication methods produced equally well-fitting dentures, with both having a better fit than compression molding. Shallow palates appear to be more affected by shrinkage than medium or deep palates. Shallow ovoid arch forms appear to benefit from the use of injection molding compared to CAD/CAM and compression molding.", "journal": "Journal of prosthodontics : official journal of the American College of Prosthodontists", "date": "2017-11-15", "authors": ["J BryanMcLaughlin", "VanRamos", "Douglas PDickinson"], "doi": "10.1111/jopr.12604"}

Live/dead assays at day 0, 3, 7 and 14 of in vitro culture showed that human chondrocytes were retained and highly viable (\u223c80%) within the 3D deposited hydrogel filaments, thus confirming that the fabricated composites materials represent a valid solution for tissue engineering applications.

The tissue-engineered tendon substitutes have the advantage of increased biosafety and the option to customize their biochemical and biophysical properties to promote tendon regeneration. In this study, we developed a novel centrifugal melt electrospinning (CME) technique, with the goal of optimizing the fabrication parameters to generate fibrous scaffolds for tendon tissue engineering. The effects of CME processing parameters, including rotational speed, voltage, and temperature, on fiber properties (i.e. orientation, mean diameter, and productivity) were systematically investigated. By using this solvent-free and environmentally friendly method, we fabricated both random and aligned poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) fibrous scaffolds with controllable mesh thickness. We also investigated and compared their morphology, surface hydrophilicity, and mechanical properties. We seeded human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (HADMSC) on various PLLA fibrous scaffolds and conditioned the constructs in tenogenic differentiation medium for up to 21 days, to investigate the effects of fiber alignment and scaffold thickness on cell behavior. Aligned fibrous scaffolds induced cell elongation and orientation through a contact guidance phenomenon and promoted HADMSC proliferation and differentiation towards tenocytes. At the early stage, thinner scaffolds were beneficial for HADMSC proliferation, but the scaffold thickness had no significant effects on cell proliferation for longer-term cell culture. We further co-seeded HADMSC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on aligned PLLA fibrous mats and determined how the vascularization affected HADMSC tenogenesis. We found that co-cultured HADMSC-HUVEC expressed more tendon-related markers on the aligned fibrous scaffold. The co-culture systems promoted in vitro HADMSC differentiation towards tenocytes. These aligned fibrous scaffolds fabricated by CME technique could potentially be utilized to repair and regenerate tendon defects and injuries with cell co-culture and controlled vascularization.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-11-15", "authors": ["ShaohuaWu", "HaoPeng", "XiuhongLi", "Philipp NStreubel", "YongLiu", "BinDuan"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa8fb8\n10.1089/ten.tea.2016.0319"}

Polylactic Acid (PLA) was selected as the material for the printer and the fabricated scaffold was coated with gold to enhance the conductivity for DEP manipulation. Simulation from COMSOL confirmed that non-uniform electric fields were successfully generated under a voltage input. The properties of the scaffold were first characterized through a series of experiments. Then, preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded onto the coated scaffold and multiple cellular rings were observed under the microscope. The biocompatibility of the material was also examined and mineralized bone nodules were detected using Alizarin Red S Staining after 28 days of culture. The proposed scaffold design can enable formation of multiple ring patterns via DEP and the properties of the scaffold are suitable for bone tissue culture.

A novel boundary condition method had been implemented for fast computational fluid dynamics simulations and patient-specific three-dimensional printed models had been built for visualizations. Our results suggested that the multiple spatial characteristics (curvature of the culprit vessel multiplied by an angle of the culprit's vessel to the upstream parent branch) could be an index of hemodynamics significance (r\u2009=\u2009-0.673, P-value\u2009=\u20090.033). and reduction of the maximum velocity from stenosis to downstream was found correlated to the FFRCT (r\u2009=\u20090.480, p\u2009=\u20090.160).

Structures with different pore sizes and different drug loadings were prepared containing prednisolone as a model drug. The work showed that it was possible to print drug-free and drug-loaded drug delivery devices of PDMS with the 3D printing technique used in this study. The required UV-curing time to get sufficient crosslinking yield and mechanical strength was minimum three minutes. The microgram drug release from the printed structures was highest for the most drug loaded structures regardless of the porosity of the devices. By altering the surface area/volume ratio it was possible to print structures with differences in the release rate. This study shows that room-temperature semi-solid extrusion printing 3D printing technique in combination with UV-LED crosslinking is an applicable method in the production of prednisolone containing PDMS devices. Both the extrusion 3D printing and the UV-crosslinking was done at room temperature, which make this manufacturing method an interesting alternative for manufacturing controlled release devices containing temperature susceptible drugs.", "journal": "International journal of pharmaceutics", "date": "2017-11-14", "authors": ["JennyHoll\u00e4nder", "RistoHakala", "JaakkoSuominen", "NikoMoritz", "JoukoYliruusi", "NiklasSandler"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpharm.2017.11.016"}

The customised 3D printed model of CV junction region of the patient can be used for studying the anatomy and relationship of vertebral artery to the C1-C2 joint before the actual surgery. Thirteen patients (includes twelve males and one female) of congenital CV junction anomalies having AAD with or without BI (Basilar Invagination) were included in the study. For all thirteen patients, customised 3D models of CV junction were made based on their CT scan data. The rehearsal of surgical procedure on the model was done a day before the actual surgery. Post surgery, twelve out of thirteen patients showed significant clinical and radiological improvement. We did not had any misplaced screws or vertebral artery injury. 3D models can improve decision making and planning of the surgical procedure in the CV junction region.

One of the most used tissue engineering materials is collagen, which is well known to be a natural biomaterial, also frequently used as cell substrate, given its natural abundance and intrinsic biocompatibility. This study aims to evaluate how the macroscopic biomechanical stimuli applied on a construct made of polycaprolactone scaffold embedded in a collagen substrate translate into microscopic stimuli at the cell level. Eight poro-hyperelastic finite element models of 3D printed hybrid scaffolds from the same batch were created, along with an equivalent model of the idealized geometry of that scaffold. When applying an 8% confined compression at the macroscopic level, local fluid flow of up to 20\u00a0[Formula: see text]m/s and octahedral strain levels mostly under 20% were calculated in the collagen substrate. Conversely unconfined compression induced fluid flow of up to 10\u00a0[Formula: see text]m/s and octahedral strain from 10 to 35%. No relevant differences were found amongst the scaffold-specific models. Following the mechanoregulation theory based on Prendergast et al. (J Biomech 30:539-548, 1997. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9290(96)00140-6 ), those results suggest that mainly cartilage or fibrous tissue formation would be expected to occur under unconfined or confined compression, respectively.

{"title": "Biomaterials for articular cartilage tissue engineering: Learning from biology.", "abstract": "Articular cartilage is commonly described as a tissue that is made of up to 80% water, is devoid of blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics, and is populated by only one cell type, the chondrocyte. At first glance, an easy tissue for clinicians to repair and for scientists to reproduce in a laboratory. Yet, chondral and osteochondral defects currently remain an open challenge in orthopedics and tissue engineering of the musculoskeletal system, without considering osteoarthritis. Why do we fail in repairing and regenerating articular cartilage? Behind its simple and homogenous appearance, articular cartilage hides a heterogeneous composition, a high level of organisation and specific biomechanical properties that, taken together, make articular cartilage a unique material that we are not yet able to repair or reproduce with high fidelity. This review highlights the available therapies for cartilage repair and retraces the research on different biomaterials developed for tissue engineering strategies. Their potential to recreate the structure, including composition and organisation, as well as the function of articular cartilage, intended as cell microenvironment and mechanically competent replacement, is described. A perspective of the limitations of the current research is given in the light of the emerging technologies supporting tissue engineering of articular cartilage.\nThe mechanical properties of articular tissue reflect its functionally organised composition and the recreation of its structure challenges the success of in vitro and in vivo reproduction of the native cartilage. Tissue engineering and biomaterials science have revolutionised the way scientists approach the challenge of articular cartilage repair and regeneration by introducing the concept of the interdisciplinary approach.

{"title": "Laser processed calcium phosphate reinforced CoCrMo for load-bearing applications: Processing and wear induced damage evaluation.", "abstract": "To mitigate shortcomings in current biomedical CoCrMo alloy, composites of CoCrMo with calcium phosphate (CaP) were envisioned. CoCrMo alloy was reinforced with CaP to enhance the wear resistance of the alloy. A powder based direct energy additive manufacturing technique of Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS\u2122) was used for processing of CoCrMo alloy with 1% and 3% (by weight) of CaP in the form of hydroxyapaptite. Addition of CaP was found to stabilize the \u03b5 (hcp) phase along with the more common \u03b3 (fcc) phase of the CoCrMo alloy, and the microstructure showed discontinuous chromium carbide phase. The resultant composite showed hardness similar to the base material, however, there was significant increase in the wear resistance of the alloy due to the addition of CaP. During wear testing, a tribo-layer or a tribofilm was found to develop on the surface. This led to the reduction in the leaching of Co and Cr ions during wear testing. The tribofilm was found to be dependent on the wear distance, and made the CoCrMo-CaP composites an in situ self-protecting system. The overall coefficient of friction of the CoCrMo-CaP composite was found to increase but was more stable with the wear distance as compared to the CoCrMo alloy with no CaP addition.\nCo-based alloys, an ideal choice for biomedical load-bearing implants, show low wear rates along with low coefficient of friction (COF) and good resistance to corrosive media. However, significant material loss can occur in vivo due to wear and/or corrosion of CoCrMo over long periods of time. Release of metal ions in the human body over time leads to medical complications such as metallosis, which can often require a revision surgery that can adversely affect the quality of life for the patient.

We therefore aimed to determine the isolated and modulated effects of topological design and material type on the fatigue response of metallic meta-biomaterials fabricated with selective laser melting. Towards that end, we designed and additively manufactured Co-Cr meta-biomaterials with three types of repeating unit cells and three to four porosities per type of repeating unit cell. The AM meta-biomaterials were then mechanically tested to obtain their normalized S-N curves. The obtained S-N curves of Co-Cr meta-biomaterials were compared to those of meta-biomaterials with same topological designs but made from other materials, i.e. Ti-6Al-4V, tantalum, and pure titanium, available from our previous studies. We found the material type to be far more important than the topological design in determining the normalized fatigue strength of our AM metallic meta-biomaterials. This is the opposite of what we have found for the quasi-static mechanical properties of the same meta-biomaterials. The effects of material type, manufacturing imperfections, and topological design were different in the high and low cycle fatigue regions. That is likely because the cyclic response of meta-biomaterials depends not only on the static and fatigue strengths of the bulk material but also on other factors that may include strut roughness, distribution of the micro-pores created inside the struts during the AM process, and plasticity.\nMeta-biomaterials are a special class of metamaterials with unusual or unprecedented combinations of mechanical, physical (e.g. mass transport), and biological properties. Topologically complex and additively manufactured meta-biomaterials have been shown to improve bone regeneration and osseointegration. The mechanical properties of such biomaterials are directly related to their topological design and material type. However, previous studies of such biomaterials have largely neglected the effects of material type, instead focusing on topological design. We show here that neglecting the effects of material type is unjustified. We studied the isolated and combined effects of topological design and material type on the normalized S-N curves of metallic bone-mimicking biomaterials and found them to be more strongly dependent on the material type than topological design.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2017-11-12", "authors": ["S MAhmadi", "RHedayati", "YLi", "KLietaert", "NT\u00fcmer", "AFatemi", "C DRans", "BPouran", "HWeinans", "A AZadpoor"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2017.11.014"}

Here, new hierarchical porous frameworks are 3D printed for sodium storage by employing well-designed GO-contained inks. The resultant frameworks possess continuous filaments, hierarchical multihole gridding. Such distinct properties render these frameworks able to facilitate the fast transportation of both sodium ion and electron.

{"title": "Additive Manufacturing: A Comparative Analysis of Dimensional Accuracy and Skin Texture Reproduction of Auricular Prostheses Replicas.", "abstract": "The use of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and additive manufacturing in maxillofacial prosthetics has been widely acknowledged. Rapid prototyping can be considered for manufacturing of auricular prostheses. Therefore, so-called prostheses replicas can be fabricated by digital means. The objective of this study was to identify a superior additive manufacturing method to fabricate auricular prosthesis replicas (APRs) within a digital workflow.\nAuricles of 23 healthy subjects (mean age of 37.8 years) were measured in vivo with respect to an anthropometrical protocol. Landmarks were volumized with fiducial balls for 3D scanning using a handheld structured light scanner. The 3D CAD dataset was postprocessed, and the same anthropometrical measurements were made in the CAD software with the digital lineal. Each CAD dataset was materialized using fused deposition modeling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS), and stereolithography (SL), constituting 53 APR samples. All distances between the landmarks were measured on the APRs. After the determination of the measurement error within the five data groups (in vivo, CAD, FDM, SLS, and SL), the mean values were compared using matched pairs method. To this, the in vivo and CAD dataset were set as references. Finally, the surface structure of the APRs was qualitatively evaluated with stereomicroscopy and profilometry to ascertain the level of skin detail reproduction.\nThe anthropometrical approach showed drawbacks in measuring the protrusion of the ear's helix. The measurement error within all groups of measurements was calculated between 0.20 and 0.28 mm, implying a high reproducibility. The lowest mean differences of 53 produced APRs were found in FDM (0.43%) followed by SLS (0.54%) and SL (0.59%)--compared to in vivo, and again in FDM (0.20%) followed by SL (0.36%) and SLS (0.39%)--compared to CAD. None of these values exceed the threshold of clinical relevance (1.5%); however, the qualitative evaluation revealed slight shortcomings in skin reproduction for all methods: reproduction of skin details exceeding 0.192 mm in depth was feasible.\nFDM showed the superior dimensional accuracy and best skin surface reproduction.

{"title": "Refreshing Rubbers as Customized Photothermal Conversion Materials through Post-Darkening Modeling Production.", "abstract": "Organic conjugated polymers with low energy bandgaps are emerging as a particular class of near-infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion materials. However, these polymers routinely possess high phase transition temperatures due to the rigid skeleton and strong intermolecular interactions. Conjugated polymers can rarely be thermally processed at low temperature, especially below 100\u2009\u00b0C. This work formulates a concept of post-darkening modeling production (p-DMP) by which the thermoplastic non-conjugated trans-polyisoprene (TPI) is refreshed into a photothermal conversion material with high light use efficiency. Two steps, including the customizable shaping at low temperature and iodine vapor-tailored \"darkening\", ensure the ease of preparing photothermal conversion devices with desirable topologies. A few characterizations, with the combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, provide reasonable explanations for understanding the \"darkening\" process of TPI in iodine atmosphere. In particular, the p-DMP is successfully extended to three-dimension (3D) printing, opening an avenue to fabricate personalized photothermal products, for example, a sunlight-directed physiotherapy device for healthcare of articular tissues.", "journal": "Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2017-11-11", "authors": ["RuitingLi", "ZhenWang", "PengHan", "YonglinHe", "XiaohongZhang", "YapeiWang"], "doi": "10.1002/chem.201704715"}
{"title": "", "abstract": "Several cylindrical specimens and dental implants, presenting diagonal lattice structures with different cell sizes (600, 900 and 1200 \u03bcm) were additively manufactured by selective laser melting process. Then they were implanted for two months in a sheep. After removal, they were studied by Archimedes' method as well as X-ray computed tomography in order to assess the penetration of bone into the lattice. We observed that the additive manufactured parts were geometrically conformed to the theoretical specifications. However, several particles were left adhering to the surface of the lattice, thereby partly or entirely obstructing the cells. Nevertheless, bone penetration was clearly visible. We conclude that the 900 \u03bcm lattice cell size is more favourable to bone penetration than the 1200 \u03bcm lattice cell size, as the bone penetration is 84% for 900 \u03bcm against 54% for 1200 \u03bcm cell structures. The lower bone penetration value for the 1200 \u03bcm lattice cell could possibly be attributed to the short residence time in the sheep.

Current cross-sectional imaging surveillance techniques, largely based on computed tomography angiography, are focused on measurement of maximal aortic diameter, although this approach is limited to fixed anatomic positions and is prone to significant measurement error. Here we present preliminary results showing the feasibility of a novel technique for assessing change in aortic dimensions, termed vascular deformation mapping (VDM). This technique allows quantification of 3-dimensional changes in the aortic wall geometry through nonrigid coregistration of computed tomography angiography images and spatial Jacobian analysis of aortic deformation. Through several illustrative cases we demonstrate that this method can be used to measure changes in the aortic wall geometry among patients with stable and enlarging thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. Furthermore, VDM results yield observations about the presence, distribution, and rate of aortic wall deformation that are not apparent by routine clinical evaluation.

{"title": "Assessment of hydrogels for bioprinting of endothelial cells.", "abstract": "In tissue engineering applications, vascularization can be accomplished by coimplantation of tissue forming cells and endothelial cells (ECs), whereby the latter are able to form functional blood vessels. The use of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technologies has the potential to improve the classical tissue engineering approach because these will allow the generation of scaffolds with high spatial control of endothelial cell allocation. This study focuses on a side by side comparison of popular commercially available bioprinting hydrogels (Matrigel, fibrin, collagen, gelatin, agarose, Pluronic F-127, alginate, and alginate/gelatin) in the context of their physicochemical parameters, their swelling/degradation characteristics, their biological effects on vasculogenesis-related EC parameters and their printability. The aim of this study was to identify the most suitable hydrogel or hydrogel combination for inkjet printing of ECs to build prevascularized tissue constructs. Most tested hydrogels displayed physicochemical characteristics suitable for inkjet printing. However, Pluronic F-127 and the alginate/gelatin blend were rapidly degraded when incubated in cell culture medium. Agarose, Pluronic F-127, alginate and alginate/gelatin hydrogels turned out to be unsuitable for bioprinting of ECs because of their non-adherent properties and/or their incapability to support EC proliferation. Gelatin was able to support EC proliferation and viability but was unable to support endothelial cell sprouting. Our experiments revealed fibrin and collagen to be most suitable for bioprinting of ECs, because these hydrogels showed acceptable swelling/degradation characteristics, supported vasculogenesis-related EC parameters and showed good printability. Moreover, ECs in constructs of preformed spheroids survived the printing process and formed capillary-like cords. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Physicochemical properties, including the dispersion pattern, hydrophobicity, chemical structure, elasticity and thermal characteristics of both chip and films were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the micro-diamond particles were embedded and interconnected within the bulk material of the cast microfluidic chip, whereas in the case of thin films their increased presence at the polymer surface resulted in a reduced hydrophobicity of the composite. The elastic modulus increased from 1.28 for a PDMS control, to 4.42\u2009MPa for the 60\u2009wt% composite, along with a three-fold increase in thermal conductivity, from 0.15 to 0.45\u2009W\u2009m", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-11-10", "authors": ["SidraWaheed", "Joan MCabot", "Niall PMacdonald", "UmmeKalsoom", "SyamakFarajikhah", "Peter CInnis", "Pavel NNesterenko", "Trevor WLewis", "Michael CBreadmore", "BrettPaull"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-15408-3\n10.1016/S0039-9140(01)00594-X\n10.1038/nature13118\n10.1002/elps.200305584\n10.1039/b306158b\n10.1002/cite.200406164\n10.1126/science.280.5366.1046\n10.1021/ac025528w\n10.1002/adma.200802737\n10.1109/EDL.1981.25367\n10.1002/adma.200602515\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2017.02.006\n10.1002/adfm.200701437\n10.1002/adfm.200400189\n10.1039/C4LC00615A\n10.1021/cr068035q\n10.1039/C3LC51331A\n10.1002/adma.200802317\n10.1007/s00396-002-0718-8\n10.1002/elan.201000321\n10.1126/science.288.5463.113\n10.1039/C4TC01037J\n10.1021/nn2024539\n10.7567/JJAP.55.027101\n10.1016/j.matdes.2017.01.051\n10.1039/C6RA05261D\n10.1002/pssb.201451173\n10.1016/j.mseb.2010.11.003\n10.1021/ac025700w\n10.1016/j.molstruc.2010.03.054\n10.1088/0960-1317/24/3/035017\n10.1007/s00216-009-3219-5\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2011.08.061\n10.1039/C4TA07127A\n10.1016/j.chroma.2015.02.069\n10.1007/s10404-014-1542-4\n10.1039/C3LC50956G\n10.1039/b610567j\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2006.03.008\n10.1039/C4AN01476F\n10.1038/srep37010\n10.1021/nn800445z\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2016.03.001"}
{"title": "Investigating cascade impactor performance using a modified 3D printed induction port.", "abstract": "Based on a computer tomographic scan of a human trachea, a modified induction port (mIP), for use with the Next Generation Cascade Impactor, was manufactured using 3D printing technology. Standard United States Pharmacopoeia IP (USPIP) was compared to the mIP and a 3D printed version of the USPIP (USP3DIP) by analyzing different types of commercial salbutamol formulations for inhalation. Increased retention of particles in the mIP was found analyzing a pMDI formulation, leading to a decrease in the FPF from 28.8\u00b12.0% to 14.2\u00b11.2%, which correlates better to in vivo deposition data from literature. Increased deposition was found to be based on geometrical factors only. The impact of surface related effects was investigated by (a) comparing results obtained with the USPIP and USP3DIP (all formulations) and (b) generating another model IP (USP3DSEIP) with a surface area equivalent to the mIP but maintaining the geometry of the USPIP (pMDI only). USPIP, USP3DIP, and USP3DSEIP were found to perform equivalently. The impact of different geometries on airflow velocities in the USPIP and mIP was assessed using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Conclusively, this study shows that replacing the USP IP by the mIP can provide additional information in formulation assessment and in in vitro/in vivo correlation, when applied on pMDI formulations.", "journal": "International journal of pharmaceutics", "date": "2017-11-09", "authors": ["KaiBerkenfeld", "MichaelBernauer", "Jason TMcConville", "AlfLamprecht"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpharm.2017.10.039"}

{"title": "Functional changes through the usage of 3D-printed transitional prostheses in children.", "abstract": "There is limited knowledge on the use of 3\u2009D-printed transitional prostheses, as they relate to changes in function and strength. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify functional and strength changes after usage of 3\u2009D-printed transitional prostheses for multiple weeks for children with upper-limb differences.\nGross manual dexterity was assessed using the Box and Block Test and wrist strength was measured using a dynamometer. This testing was conducted before and after a period of 24\u2009\u00b1\u20092.61 weeks of using a 3\u2009D-printed transitional prosthesis. The 11 children (five girls and six boys; 3-15 years of age) who participated in the study, were fitted with a 3\u2009D-printed transitional partial hand (n\u2009=\u20099) or an arm (n\u2009=\u20092) prosthesis.\nSeparate two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to analyze function and strength data. There was a significant hand by time interaction for function, but not for strength. Conclusion and relevance to the study of disability and rehabilitation: The increase in manual gross dexterity suggests that the Cyborg Beast 2 3\u2009D-printed prosthesis can be used as a transitional device to improve function in children with traumatic or congenital upper-limb differences. Implications for Rehabilitation Children's prosthetic needs are complex due to their small size, rapid growth, and psychosocial development.

{"title": "A 3D Printable and Mechanically Robust Hydrogel Based on Alginate and Graphene Oxide.", "abstract": "Sodium alginate (SA) was used for the first time to noncovalently functionalize amino-graphene oxide (aGO) to produce the SA-functionalized GO, A-aGO. A-aGO was then filled into a double-network (DN) hydrogel consisting of an alginate network (SA) and a polyacrylamide (PAAm) network. Before UV curing, A-aGO was able to provide the SA/PAAm DN hydrogel with a remarkable thixotropic property, which is desirable for 3D printing. Thus, the A-aGO-filled DN hydrogel could be nicely used as an \"ink\" of a 3D printer to print complicated 3D structures with a high stackability and high shape fidelity. After UV curing, the 3D-printed A-aGO filled DN hydrogel showed robust mechanical strength and great toughness. For the function of A-aGO it was considered that A-aGO acted as a secondary but physical cross-linker, not only to give the hydrogel a satisfactory thixotropic property but also to increase the energy dissipation by combining the physical SA network and the chemical PAAm network.

{"title": "Osteoinduction by Foamed and 3D-Printed Calcium Phosphate Scaffolds: Effect of Nanostructure and Pore Architecture.", "abstract": "Some biomaterials are osteoinductive, that is, they are able to trigger the osteogenic process by inducing the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to the osteogenic lineage. Although the underlying mechanism is still unclear, microporosity and specific surface area (SSA) have been identified as critical factors in material-associated osteoinduction. However, only sintered ceramics, which have a limited range of porosities and SSA, have been analyzed so far. In this work, we were able to extend these ranges to the nanoscale, through the foaming and 3D-printing of biomimetic calcium phosphates, thereby obtaining scaffolds with controlled micro- and nanoporosity and with tailored macropore architectures. Calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) scaffolds were evaluated after 6 and 12 weeks in an ectopic-implantation canine model and compared with two sintered ceramics, biphasic calcium phosphate and \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate. Only foams with spherical, concave macropores and not 3D-printed scaffolds with convex, prismatic macropores induced significant ectopic bone formation. Among them, biomimetic nanostructured CDHA produced the highest incidence of ectopic bone and accelerated bone formation when compared with conventional microstructured sintered calcium phosphates with the same macropore architecture. Moreover, they exhibited different bone formation patterns; in CDHA foams, the new ectopic bone progressively replaced the scaffold, whereas in sintered biphasic calcium phosphate scaffolds, bone was deposited on the surface of the material, progressively filling the pore space. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the high reactivity of nanostructured biomimetic CDHA combined with a spherical, concave macroporosity allows the pushing of the osteoinduction potential beyond the limits of microstructured calcium phosphate ceramics.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-11-09", "authors": ["AlbertBarba", "AnnaDiez-Escudero", "YassineMaazouz", "KatrinRappe", "MontserratEspanol", "Edgar BMontufar", "MarBonany", "Joanna MSadowska", "JordiGuillem-Marti", "Caroline\u00d6hman-M\u00e4gi", "CeciliaPersson", "Maria-CristinaManzanares", "JordiFranch", "Maria-PauGinebra"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b14175"}

Despite tremendous progress in engineering complex tissue/organ models in the past decade, approaches that support the required freedom in design, detail and chemistry for fabricating truly 3D constructs have remained limited. Here, we report a stereolithographic high-resolution 3D printing technique utilizing poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA, MW 700) to manufacture diffusion-open and mechanically stable hydrogel constructs as self-contained chips, where confined culture volumes are traversed and surrounded by perfusable vascular-like networks. An optimized resin formulation enables printing of hydrogel chips holding perfusable microchannels with a cross-section as small as 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm, and the printed microchannels can be steadily perfused for at least one week. In addition, the integration of multiple independently perfusable and structurally stable channel systems further allows for easy combination of different bulk material volumes at exact relative spatial positions. We demonstrate this structural and material flexibility by embedding a highly compliant cell-laden gelatin hydrogel within the confines of a 3D printed resilient PEGDA hydrogel chip of intermediate compliance. Overall, our proposed strategy represents an automated, cost-effective and high resolution technique to manufacture complex 3D constructs containing microfluidic perfusion networks for advanced in vitro models.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2017-11-09", "authors": ["RujingZhang", "Niels BLarsen"], "doi": "10.1039/c7lc00926g"}
{"title": "Additively manufactured hierarchical stainless steels with high strength and ductility.", "abstract": "Many traditional approaches for strengthening steels typically come at the expense of useful ductility, a dilemma known as strength-ductility trade-off. New metallurgical processing might offer the possibility of overcoming this. Here we report that austenitic 316L stainless steels additively manufactured via a laser powder-bed-fusion technique exhibit a combination of yield strength and tensile ductility that surpasses that of conventional 316L steels. High strength is attributed to solidification-enabled cellular structures, low-angle grain boundaries, and dislocations formed during manufacturing, while high uniform elongation correlates to a steady and progressive work-hardening mechanism regulated by a hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure, with length scales spanning nearly six orders of magnitude. In addition, solute segregation along cellular walls and low-angle grain boundaries can enhance dislocation pinning and promote twinning.

However, several works have highlighted that ZnO nanostructures may successfully promote the growth, proliferation and differentiation of several cell lines, in combination with the rise of promising antibacterial activities. In particular, osteogenesis and angiogenesis have been effectively demonstrated in numerous cases. Such peculiarities have been observed both for pure nanostructured ZnO scaffolds as well as for three-dimensional ZnO-based hybrid composite scaffolds, fabricated by additive manufacturing technologies.

In the last years, the coating of these devices with bactericidal compounds has emerged as a potential tool to prevent bacterial colonization. Our study describes the modification of 3D-printed reservoirs and silicone-based catheters, mimicking central venous access devices, through different approaches including their coating with the well known biocompatible and bactericidal polymer chitosan, with the anionic polysaccharide alginate; also, plasma treated surfaces were included in the study to promote polymer adhesion. The evaluation of the antimicrobial action of those surface modifications compared to that exerted by a model antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) adsorbed on the surface of the devices was carried out. Surface characterization was developed by different methodologies and the bactericidal effects of the different coatings were assayed in an in\u00a0vitro model of Staphylococcus aureus infection. Our results showed a significant reduction in the reservoir roughness (\u226473%) after coating though no changes were observed for coated catheters which was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, pointing to the importance of the surface device topography for the successful attachment of the coating and for the subsequent development of bactericidal effects. Furthermore, the single presence of chitosan on the reservoirs was enough to fully inhibit bacterial growth exerting the same efficiency as that showed by the model antibiotic. Importantly, chitosan coating showed low cytotoxicity against human keratinocytes, human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells, and murine colon carcinoma cells displaying viability percentages in the range of the control samples (>95%). Chitosan-based coatings are proposed as an effective and promising solution in the prevention of microbial infections associated to medical devices.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2017-11-08", "authors": ["GraciaMendoza", "AnnaRegiel-Futyra", "AlejandraTamayo", "MartaMonzon", "SilviaIrusta", "Miguel Angelde Gregorio", "AgnieszkaKyzio\u0142", "ManuelArruebo"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328217739199"}

Cementless stem fixation is recommended for young and active patients as it eliminates the risk of loss of fixation at the bone-cement and cement-implant interfaces. Cementless fixation, however, suffers from a relatively high early revision rate. In the current research, a novel low-stiffness hip stem was designed, fabricated and tested. The stem design provided the option to inject biodegradable bone cement that could enhance initial stem stability. The stem was made of Ti6Al4V alloy. The proximal portion of the stem was porous, with cubic cells. The stem was fabricated using electron beam melting (EBM) technology and tested in compression and bending. Finite-element analysis was used to evaluate stem performance under a dynamic load representing a stair descending cycle and compare it to the performance of a solid stem with similar geometry. The von Mises stresses and maximum principal strains generated within the bone increased after porous stem insertion compared to solid stem insertion.

{"title": "Positioning error of custom 3D-printed surgical guides for the radius: influence of fitting location and guide design.", "abstract": "Utilization of 3D-printed patient-specific surgical guides is a promising navigation approach for orthopedic surgery. However, navigation errors can arise if the guide is not correctly positioned at the planned bone location, compromising the surgical outcome. Quantitative measurements of guide positioning errors are rarely reported and have never been related to guide design and underlying bone anatomy. In this study, the positioning accuracy of a standard and an extended guide design with lateral extension is evaluated at different fitting locations (distal, mid-shaft and proximal) on the volar side of the radius.\nFour operators placed the surgical guides on 3D-printed radius models obtained from the CT scans of six patients. For each radius model, every operator positioned two guide designs on the three fitting locations. The residual positioning error was quantified with a CT-based image analysis method in terms of the mean target registration error (mTRE), total translation error ([Formula: see text]) and total rotation error ([Formula: see text]) by comparing the actual guide position with the preoperatively planned position. Three generalized linear regression models were constructed to evaluate if the fitting location and the guide design affected mTRE, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text].\nmTRE, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] were significantly higher for mid-shaft guides ([Formula: see text]) compared to distal guides. The guide extension significantly improved the target registration and translational accuracy in all the volar radius locations ([Formula: see text]).

{"title": "Cyclodextrins as versatile building blocks for regenerative medicine.", "abstract": "Cyclodextrins (CDs) are one of the most versatile substances produced by nature, and it is in the aqueous biological environment where the multifaceted potential of CDs can be completely unveiled. CDs form inclusion complexes with a variety of guest molecules, including polymers, producing very diverse biocompatible supramolecular structures. Additionally, CDs themselves can trigger cell differentiation to distinct lineages depending on the substituent groups and also promote salt nucleation. These features together with the affinity-driven regulated release of therapeutic molecules, growth factors and gene vectors explain the rising interest for CDs as building blocks in regenerative medicine. Supramolecular poly(pseudo)rotaxane structures and zipper-like assemblies exhibit outstanding viscoelastic properties, performing as syringeable implants. The sharp shear-responsiveness of the supramolecular assemblies is opening new avenues for the design of bioinks for 3D printing and also of electrospun fibers. CDs can also be transformed into polymerizable monomers to prepare alternative nanostructured materials. The aim of this review is to analyze the role that CDs may play in regenerative medicine through the analysis of the last decade research. Most applications of CD-based scaffolds are focussed on non-healing bone fractures, cartilage reparation and skin recovery, but also on even more challenging demands such as neural grafts.

Structural, chemical, mechanical, and biological characterizations were performed. We successfully fabricated scaffolds of three different pore sizes. However, the pore dimensions were slightly smaller than expected.

Current therapies for meniscus regeneration, including meniscectomies and scaffold implantation, fail to achieve complete functional regeneration of the tissue. This has led to increased interest in cell and gene therapies and tissue engineering approaches to meniscus regeneration. The implantation of a biomimetic implant, incorporating cells, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived proteins, represents a promising approach to functional meniscus regeneration. The objective of this study was to develop a range of ECM-functionalised bioinks suitable for 3D bioprinting of meniscal tissue. To this end, alginate hydrogels were functionalised with ECM derived from the inner and outer regions of the meniscus and loaded with infrapatellar fat pad-derived stem cells. In the absence of exogenously supplied growth factors, inner meniscus ECM promoted chondrogenesis of fat pad-derived stem cells, whereas outer meniscus ECM promoted a more elongated cell morphology and the development of a more fibroblastic phenotype. With exogenous growth factors supplementation, a more fibrogenic phenotype was observed in outer ECM-functionalised hydrogels supplemented with connective tissue growth factor, whereas inner ECM-functionalised hydrogels supplemented with TGF\u03b23 supported the highest levels of Sox-9 and type II collagen gene expression and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) deposition. The final phase of the study demonstrated the printability of these ECM-functionalised hydrogels, demonstrating that their codeposition with polycaprolactone microfibres dramatically improved the mechanical properties of the 3D bioprinted constructs with no noticeable loss in cell viability.

{"title": "Evaluation of PBS Treatment and PEI Coating Effects on Surface Morphology and Cellular Response of 3D-Printed Alginate Scaffolds.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an emerging technology for the fabrication of scaffolds to repair/replace damaged tissue/organs in tissue engineering. This paper presents our study on 3D printed alginate scaffolds treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) coating and their impacts on the surface morphology and cellular response of the printed scaffolds. In our study, sterile alginate was prepared by means of the freeze-drying method and then, used to prepare the hydrogel for 3D printing into calcium chloride, forming 3D scaffolds. Scaffolds were treated with PBS for a time period of two days and seven days, respectively, and PEI coating; then they were seeded with Schwann cells (RSC96) for the examination of cellular response (proliferation and differentiation). In addition, swelling and stiffness (Young's modulus) of the treated scaffolds was evaluated, while their surface morphology was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM images revealed significant changes in scaffold surface morphology due to degradation caused by the PBS treatment over time. Our cell proliferation assessment over seven days showed that a two-day PBS treatment could be more effective than seven-day PBS treatment for improving cell attachment and elongation. While PEI coating of alginate scaffolds seemed to contribute to cell growth, Schwann cells stayed round on the surface of alginate over the period of cell culture. In conclusion, PBS-treatment may offer the potential to induce surface physical cues due to degradation of alginate, which could improve cell attachment post cell-seeding of 3D-printed alginate scaffolds.", "journal": "Journal of functional biomaterials", "date": "2017-11-07", "authors": ["Mar\u00eda AMendoza Garc\u00eda", "MohammadIzadifar", "XiongbiaoChen"], "doi": "10.3390/jfb8040048\n10.1002/ijch.201300086\n10.3390/ijms18071597\n10.1002/biot.201600671\n10.1016/S0169-409X(98)00023-4\n10.1016/S1369-7021(11)70058-X\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00121-6\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.06.034\n10.3390/ijms17121976\n10.1089/ten.tec.2016.0011\n10.1038/srep24474\n10.1089/ten.tec.2017.0222\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2017.0346\n10.1088/1758-5082/5/1/015009\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.1451\n10.1007/s11706-013-0211-y\n10.1016/B978-0-12-801732-6.00005-7\n10.1080/09506608.2016.1252551\n10.1055/s-2002-30186\n10.1016/S0074-7742(09)87011-6\n10.1080/00914037.2016.1201830\n10.1088/1748-6041/10/4/045016\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.04.032\n10.1089/3dp.2014.0006\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.06.003\n10.3390/app7030252\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.07.002\n10.1080/09205063.2015.1016383\n10.1099/jmm.0.069609-0\n10.1016/S1525-0016(02)00053-9\n10.1016/j.reactfunctpolym.2004.01.002\n10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0639\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.06.039\n10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195082937.003.0005\n10.1098/rsif.2005.0065\n10.1007/s00586-008-0745-3\n10.4252/wjsc.v7.i4.728\n10.1155/2014/898930\n10.5339/gcsp.2013.38\n10.1007/978-3-319-19387-8_70"}
{"title": "Large Osseous Defect Reconstruction Using a Custom Three-Dimensional Printed Titanium Truss Implant.", "abstract": "Treatment of large osseous defects remains a difficult surgical challenge. Autografts and allografts have been known to undergo late collapse, because these options are not specifically designed to withstand the high loads of the foot and ankle. The inability to achieve the correct shape for reconstruction further limits their application. Large osseous defects will result during salvage after failed Lapidus bunionectomy, explantation of failed total ankle replacements, and nonunion of Evans calcaneal osteotomy. Each of 3 patients received a 4WEB custom 3-dimensional (3D) titanium truss implant (Patient Specific Custom Implant; 4WEB Medical, Inc., Frisco, TX) for reconstruction. The mean follow-up period was 17.33\u2009\u00b1\u20093.51 months. Significant improvement was seen in pain, with a successful return to activities of daily living. The 12-month postoperative computed tomography findings demonstrated incorporation of the implant to the surrounding cortical and cancellous bone. No signs of delayed complications, such as stress shielding or implant failure, were found. This is the first case series to describe the use of a custom 3D-printed titanium truss implant to successfully contribute to reconstruction in the setting of failed elective foot and ankle surgery.

The inability of human body to regenerate the defected heart valves necessitates the development of the artificial prosthesis to be replaced. Besides, the lack of capacity to grow, repair or remodel of an artificial valves and biological difficulty such as infection or inflammation make the development of tissue engineering heart valve (TEHV) concept. This research presented the use of compound of poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and maghemite nanoparticle (\u03b3-Fe\u2082O\u2083) as the potential biomaterials to develop three-dimensional (3D) aortic heart valve scaffold. Electrospinning was used for fabricating the 3D scaffold. The steepest ascent followed by the response surface methodology was used to optimize the electrospinning parameters involved in terms of elastic modulus. The structural and porosity properties of fabricated scaffold were characterized using FE-SEM and liquid displacement technique, respectively. The 3D scaffold was then seeded with aortic smooth muscle cells (AOSMCs) and biological behavior in terms of cell attachment and proliferation during 34 days of incubation was characterized using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and confocal laser microscopy. Furthermore, the mechanical properties in terms of elastic modulus and stiffness were investigated after cell seeding through macro-indentation test. The analysis indicated the formation of ultrafine quality of nanofibers with diameter distribution of 178 \u00b1 45 nm and 90.72% porosity.

Moreover, it appears to be difficult to fabricate vascular tissue constructs targeting the stiffness of soft tissues such as the liver.

{"title": "Bioengineered Lungs: A Challenge and An Opportunity.", "abstract": "Lung biofabrication is a new tissue engineering and regenerative development aimed at providing organs for potential use in transplantation. Lung biofabrication is based on seeding cells into an acellular organ scaffold and on culturing them in an especial purpose bioreactor. The acellular lung scaffold is obtained by decellularizing a non-transplantable donor lung by means of conventional procedures based on application of physical, enzymatic and detergent agents. To avoid immune recipient's rejection of the transplanted bioengineered lung, autologous bone marrow/adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells, lung progenitor cells or induced pluripotent stem cells are used for biofabricating the bioengineered lung. The bioreactor applies circulatory perfusion and mechanical ventilation with physiological parameters to the lung during biofabrication. These physical stimuli to the organ are translated into the stem cell local microenvironment - e.g. shear stress and cyclic stretch - so that cells sense the physiological conditions in normally functioning mature lungs. After seminal proof of concept in a rodent model was published in 2010, the hypothesis that lungs can be biofabricated is accepted and intense research efforts are being devoted to the topic. The current experimental evidence obtained so far in animal tests and in ex vivo human bioengineered lungs suggests that the date of first clinical tests, although not immediate, is coming.

In this study, we construct a system for generating patient-specific three-dimensional (3D)-printed phantoms for radiotherapy dosimetry. An anthropomorphic head phantom containing the bone and hollow of the paranasal sinus is scanned by computed tomography (CT). Based on surface rendering data, a patient-specific phantom is formed using a fused-deposition-modeling-based 3D printer, with a polylactic acid filament as the printing material. Radiophotoluminescence glass dosimeters can be inserted in the 3D-printed phantom. The phantom shape, CT value, and absorbed doses are compared between the actual and 3D-printed phantoms. The shape difference between the actual and printed phantoms is less than 1 mm except in the bottom surface region. The average CT value of the infill region in the 3D-printed phantom is -6\u202f\u00b1\u202f18\u202fHounsfield units (HU) and that of the vertical shell region is 126\u202f\u00b1\u202f18\u202fHU.

Our purpose was to document the dural venous sinuses (DVS) and their variations identified during routine 3-dimensional (3D) venography created through 3D models for the teaching of complex cerebral anatomy.\n3D models of the DVS networks were printed. Compared with the controls, cases with cortical venous thrombosis have altered venous anatomy, which has not been previously compared.\nGeometrical changes between the neighboring DVS could be easily manipulated and explored from different angles. Modeling helped to conduct the examination in detail with reference to geometrical features of DVS, degree of asymmetry, its extension, location, and presence of hypoplasia/atresia channels. Challenging DVS anatomy was exposed with models of adverse anatomical variations of the DVS network, including highly angulated, asymmetrical view, narrowed lumens, and hypoplasia and atresia structures. It assisted us in comprehending spatial anatomy configuration of life-like models.\nPatient-specific models of DVS geometry could provide an improved understanding of the complex brain anatomy and better navigation in difficult areas and allow surgeons to anticipate anatomical issues that might arise during the operation.

{"title": "Using 3D Printing for Rapid Prototyping of Characterization Tools for Investigating Powder Blend Behavior.", "abstract": "There is an increasing need to provide more detailed insight into the behavior of particulate systems. The current powder characterization tools are developed empirically and in many cases, modification of existing equipment is difficult. More flexible tools are needed to provide understanding of complex powder behavior, such as mixing process and segregation phenomenon. An approach based on the fast prototyping of new powder handling geometries and interfacing solutions for process analytical tools is reported. This study utilized 3D printing for rapid prototyping of customized geometries; overall goal was to assess mixing process of powder blends at small-scale with a combination of spectroscopic and mechanical monitoring. As part of the segregation evaluation studies, the flowability of three different paracetamol/filler-blends at different ratios was investigated, inter alia to define the percolation thresholds. Blends with a paracetamol wt% above the percolation threshold were subsequently investigated in relation to their segregation behavior. Rapid prototyping using 3D printing allowed designing two funnels with tailored flow behavior (funnel flow) of model formulations, which could be monitored with an in-line near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer. Calculating the root mean square (RMS) of the scores of the two first principal components of the NIR spectra visualized spectral variation as a function of process time. In a same setup, mechanical properties (basic flow energy) of the powder blend were monitored during blending.

Functional volumes characterizing the simulated BC lesions were segmented from PET and DW-MRI images. Measured radioactive uptake and ADC values were compared with gold standards. Phantom preparation was straightforward, and the time schedule was compatible with both PET and MRI measurements.

After 3D scanning of the final impression, the impression materials were removed, thus the underneath tray surfaces were able to be scanned, allowing the thickness of the impression materials to be measured. Final impressions obtained by pre-border-molded 3D printed trays were scanned as references, to which the flange extension deviations and morphology deviations of the impressions taken by both 3D printed trays and manually made ones were calculated. The results showed that (1) impressions from 3D printed custom trays had better thickness distribution than that of manually made ones; (2) impression morphology deviations in non-marginal area were neither statistic different between 3D printed trays and manually made trays, nor between trays with and without tissue stops; and (3) final impressions taken by custom trays without pre-border-molding were tended to have insufficient flange extensions.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-11-04", "authors": ["YuchunSun", "HuChen", "HongLi", "KehuiDeng", "TianZhao", "YongWang", "YongshengZhou"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-14005-8\n10.1007/s13191-010-0020-2\n10.1016/j.jdent.2015.05.007\n10.14219/jada.archive.1994.0079\n10.1016/0022-3913(90)90257-D\n10.1016/0022-3913(86)90342-2\n10.1016/0022-3913(79)90013-1\n10.1038/srep19207\n10.1046/j.1365-2842.2002.00820.x\n10.1016/j.prosdent.2004.06.001\n10.1016/0022-3913(74)90003-1\n10.1016/0022-3913(62)90061-6\n10.1016/0022-3913(85)90245-8\n10.1016/0022-3913(83)90228-7\n10.1016/S1059-941X(03)00108-6\n10.1016/S0022-3913(03)00429-3\n10.1016/0022-3913(81)90443-1\n10.1016/0022-3913(74)90169-3\n10.14219/jada.archive.1944.0211\n10.1038/sj.bdj.4813306\n10.1080/026992099299239\n10.1155/2015/352878"}

Around 90% of deaths are caused by metastasis and just 10% by primary tumor. The advancement of treatment approaches is not at the same rhythm of the disease; making cancer a focal target of biomedical research. To enhance the understanding and prompts the therapeutic delivery; concepts of tissue engineering are applied in the development of in vitro models that can bridge between 2D cell culture and animal models, mimicking tissue microenvironment. Tumor spheroid represents highly suitable 3D organoid-like framework elucidating the intra and inter cellular signaling of cancer, like that formed in physiological niche. However, spheroids are of limited value in studying critical biological phenomenon such as tumor-stroma interactions involving extra cellular matrix or immune system. Therefore, a compelling need of tailoring spheroid technologies with physiologically relevant biomaterials or in silico models, is ever emerging. The diagnostic and prognostic role of spheroids rearrangements within biomaterials or microfluidic channel is indicative of patient management; particularly for the decision of targeted therapy. Fragmented information on available in vitro spheroid models and lack of critical analysis on transformation aspects of these strategies; pushes the urge to comprehensively overview the recent technological advancements (e.g. bioprinting, micro-fluidic technologies or use of biomaterials to attain the third dimension) in the shed of translationable cancer research.

The aim of this study was to review the existing literature on different image segmentation methods used in medical additive manufacturing.\nThirty-two publications that reported on the accuracy of bone segmentation based on computed tomography images were identified using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The advantages and disadvantages of the different segmentation methods used in these studies were evaluated and reported accuracies were compared.\nThe spread between the reported accuracies was large (0.04\u00a0mm - 1.9\u00a0mm). Global thresholding was the most commonly used segmentation method with accuracies under 0.6\u00a0mm. The disadvantage of this method is the extensive manual post-processing required. Advanced thresholding methods could improve the accuracy to under 0.38\u00a0mm. However, such methods are currently not included in commercial software packages. Statistical shape model methods resulted in accuracies from 0.25\u00a0mm to 1.9\u00a0mm but are only suitable for anatomical structures with moderate anatomical variations.\nThresholding remains the most widely used segmentation method in medical additive manufacturing.

In this study, we developed a bioactive composite scaffold incorporated with icariin, a unique phytomolecule that can provide structural and mechanical support and facilitate bone regeneration to fill into bone defects after surgical CD in established SAON rabbit model. An innovative low-temperature 3D printing technology was used to fabricate the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)/\u03b2-calcium phosphate/icariin (PLGA/TCP/Icariin, PTI) scaffold. The cytocompatibility of the PTI scaffold was tested in\u00a0vitro, and the osteogenesis properties of PTI scaffolds were assessed in\u00a0vivo in the SAON rabbit models. Our results showed that the fabricated PTI scaffold had a well-designed biomimic structure that was precisely printed to provide increased mechanical support and stable icariin release from the scaffold for bone regeneration. Furthermore, our in\u00a0vivo study indicated that the PTI scaffold could enhanced the mechanical properties of new bone tissues and improved angiogenesis within the implanted region in SAON rabbit model than those of PLGA/TCP (PT) scaffold. The underlying osteoblastic mechanism was investigated using MC3T3-E1 cells in\u00a0vitro and revealed that icariin could facilitate MC3T3-E1 cells ingrowth into the PTI scaffold and regulate osteoblastic differentiation. The PTI scaffold exhibited superior biodegradability, biocompatibility, and osteogenic capability compared with those of PT scaffold.

However, it remains challenging to prepare uniform structural colors that can be directly written from colloidal inks that not only have no coffee-ring effect, but also have ultrasmooth film thickness, which will be important for layer-by-layer stacking. Herein, we synthesize polypyrrole (PPy) black coated silica NPs that have a low coverage (\u223c10.7 wt%) of bumpy PPy nanogranules (10-30 nm in diameter). When the PPy@silica NPs are drop-cast on a substrate, the surface roughness of the PPy@silica NPs effectively suppresses the coffee-ring effect and center aggregation during the drying of the colloidal ink, leading to ultrasmooth surfaces with sub-micron thickness and uniform structural colors with wide viewing angles. The color can be fine-tuned by the size of silica NPs, and the presence of PPy black significantly enhances the color contrast by suppressing incoherent and multiple light scattering. Moreover, we show that the bumpy colloidal ink is very versatile: the ink can be formulated from both low and high surface tension liquids as solvents and applied to a hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrate.

Using tweezers to handle the scaffolds can be slow, can damage the scaffolds, and can cause them to wrinkle or fold. Scaffolds may also acquire a static charge which makes them difficult to put down as they cling to tweezers. An SHD has been designed that enables more efficient, gentle lifting, and placement of delicate scaffolds.

A polymerizable shear-thinning hydrogel ink with tetramethylethylenediamine as catalyst was directly extruded into a shear-thinning hydrogel support bath with ammonium persulfate as initiator in a pattern-wise manner. When the two gels came into contact, the free radicals generated by the catalyst initiated the free-radical polymerization of the hydrogel ink. Unlike photocuring, a catalyst-initiated polymerization is suitable for printing hydrogel composites of varying opacity, since it does not depend upon light penetration through the sample. The hydrogel support bath also exhibited a temperature-responsive behavior in which the gel \"melted\" upon cooling below 16 \u00b0C. Therefore, the printed object was easily removed by cooling the gel to a liquid state. Hydrogel composites with graphene oxide and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were successfully printed.

Yet, the application of chemical screens to adult physiologies has been relatively limited due to additional demands on cost, space, and labor associated with screens in adult animals. In this study, we present a 3D printed system and methods for intermittent drug dosing that enable rapid and cost-effective chemical administration in adult zebrafish. Using prefilled screening plates, the system enables dosing of 96 fish in \u223c3\u2009min, with a 10-fold reduction in drug quantity compared to that used in previous chemical screens in adult zebrafish. We characterize water quality kinetics during immersion in the system and use these kinetics to rationally design intermittent dosing regimens that result in 100% fish survival. As a demonstration of system fidelity, we show the potential to identify two known chemical inhibitors of adult tail fin regeneration, cyclopamine and dorsomorphin.

{"title": "In vitro evaluation of marrow clot enrichment on microstructure decoration, cell delivery and proliferation of porous titanium scaffolds by selective laser melting three-dimensional printing.", "abstract": "Titanium alloy is a clinically approved material for bone substitution. Although three-dimensional printing (3DP) fabrication technique can build up porous Ti scaffolds with the designed shape and microstructure, the biomechanical performance of 3DP Ti scaffolds still need to be improved to increase the reliability of osseointegration capacity. To address this issue, rabbit bone marrow clot (MC) is used to modify 3DP Ti scaffolds by stem cell delivery and microenvironment decoration inside the pores of these scaffolds. Moreover, 3DP Ti scaffolds were built up using selective laser melting, and 3DP MC-Ti scaffolds were constructed through the enrichment of MC with Ti scaffolds in vitro. Results demonstrated that the obtained 3DP Ti scaffolds in current study has an average modulus of elasticity (ME) at 1294.48 MPa with average yield strength of 33.154 MPa. For MC-Ti scaffolds, MC enrichment obstructs the pores of 3DP scaffolds due to the large amount of fibrin and erythrocytes and leads to a decrease in ratio of live cells at 1-week culture. Cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation performance of MC-Ti scaffolds were promoted with porous recanalization in the later 3 weeks. After 2 weeks in vitro culture, fivefold of cell number in MC-Ti scaffolds were observed than bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell-seeded Ti scaffolds. Compared to Ti scaffolds, fourfold of deoxyribonucleic acid content, type I collagen-\u03b11, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase expression in MC-Ti scaffolds were observed after 4 weeks in vitro culture. Results suggested that the combination with MC is a highly efficient method that improves the biological performance of Ti scaffolds. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Advances in additive manufacturing technologies have facilitated the printing of spatially defined cell-laden artificial tissue constructs capable of providing biomimetic spatiotemporal presentation of biological and physical cues to cells in a designed multicomponent structure. Despite significant progress in the field of bioprinting, a key challenge remains in developing and utilizing materials that can adequately recapitulate the complexities of the native extracellular matrix on a nanostructured, chemical level during the printing process. This gives rise to the need for suitable materials - particularly in establishing effective control over cell fate, tissue vascularization and innervation.

{"title": "Three-Dimensional Printed Thermal Regulation Textiles.", "abstract": "Space cooling is a predominant part of energy consumption in people's daily life. Although cooling the whole building is an effective way to provide personal comfort in hot weather, it is energy-consuming and high-cost. Personal cooling technology, being able to provide personal thermal comfort by directing local heat to the thermally regulated environment, has been regarded as one of the most promising technologies for cooling energy and cost savings. Here, we demonstrate a personal thermal regulated textile using thermally conductive and highly aligned boron nitride (BN)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composite (denoted as a-BN/PVA) fibers to improve the thermal transport properties of textiles for personal cooling. The a-BN/PVA composite fibers are fabricated through a fast and scalable three-dimensional (3D) printing method. Uniform dispersion and high alignment of BN nanosheets (BNNSs) can be achieved during the processing of fiber fabrication, leading to a combination of high mechanical strength (355 MPa) and favorable heat dispersion. Due to the improved thermal transport property imparted by the thermally conductive and highly aligned BNNSs, better cooling effect (55% improvement over the commercial cotton fiber) can be realized in the a-BN/PVA textile. The wearable a-BN/PVA textiles containing the 3D-printed a-BN/PVA fibers offer a promising selection for meeting the personal cooling requirement, which can significantly reduce the energy consumption and cost for cooling the whole building.", "journal": "ACS nano", "date": "2017-10-27", "authors": ["TingtingGao", "ZhiYang", "ChaojiChen", "YijuLi", "KunFu", "JiaqiDai", "Emily MHitz", "HuaXie", "BoyangLiu", "JianweiSong", "BaoYang", "LiangbingHu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsnano.7b06295"}

The sensor integrates a flip-bonded complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) with capacitive sensing circuits on a low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) interposer with Au through vias by Au-Au thermo-compression bonding. The CMOS circuit and bonding pads on the sensor backside were electrically connected through Au bumps and the LTCC interposer, and the differential capacitive gap was formed by an Au sealing frame. A diaphragm for sensing 3-axis force was formed in the CMOS substrate. The dimensions of the completed sensor are 2.5 mm in width, 2.5 mm in length, and 0.66 mm in thickness. The fabricated sensor output coded 3-axis capacitive sensing data according to applied 3-axis force by three-dimensional (3D)-printed pins. The measured sensitivity was as high as over 34 Count/mN for normal force and 14 to 15 Count/mN for shear force with small noise, which corresponds to less than 1 mN.

{"title": "Biomimetic Inks Based on Cellulose Nanofibrils and Cross-Linkable Xylans for 3D Printing.", "abstract": "This paper presents a sustainable all-wood-based ink which can be used for 3D printing of constructs for a large variety of applications such as clothes, furniture, electronics, and health care products with a customized design and versatile gel properties. The 3D printing technologies where the material is dispensed in the form of liquids, so called inks, have proven suitable for 3D printing dispersions of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) because of their unique shear thinning properties. In this study, novel inks were developed with a biomimetic approach where the structural properties of cellulose and the cross-linking function of hemicelluloses that are found in the plant cell wall were utilized. The CNF was mixed with xylan, a hemicellulose extracted from spruce, to introduce cross-linking properties which are essential for the final stability of the printed ink. For xylan to be cross-linkable, it was functionalized with tyramine at different degrees. Evaluation of different ink compositions by rheology measurements and 3D printing tests showed that the degree of tyramine substitution and the ratio of CNFs to xylan-tyramine in the prepared inks influenced the printability and cross-linking density. Both two-layered gridded structures and more complex 3D constructs were printed. Similarly to conventional composites, the interactions between the components and their miscibility are important for the stability of the printed and cross-linked ink. Thus, the influence of tyramine on the adsorption of xylan to cellulose was studied with a quartz crystal microbalance to verify that the functionalization had little influence on xylan's adsorption to cellulose. Utilizing xylan-tyramine in the CNF dispersions resulted in all-wood-based inks which after 3D printing can be cross-linked to form freestanding gels while at the same time, the excellent printing properties of CNFs remain intact.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-10-27", "authors": ["KajsaMarkstedt", "AlfredoEscalante", "GuillermoToriz", "PaulGatenholm"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b13400"}
{"title": "Transparent model of temporal bone and vestibulocochlear organ made by 3D printing.", "abstract": "The vestibulocochlear organ is composed of tiny complex structures embedded in the petrous part of the temporal bone. Landmarks on the temporal bone surface provide the only orientation guide for dissection, but these need to be removed during the course of dissection, making it difficult to grasp the underlying three-dimensional structures, especially for beginners during gross anatomy classes. We report herein an attempt to produce a transparent three-dimensional-printed model of the human ear. En\u00a0bloc samples of the temporal bone from donated cadavers were subjected to computed tomography (CT) scanning, and on the basis of the data, the surface temporal bone was reconstructed with transparent resin and the vestibulocochlear organ with white resin to create a 1:1.5 scale model. The carotid canal was stuffed with red cotton, and the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein were filled with blue clay. In the inner ear, the internal acoustic meatus, cochlea, and semicircular canals were well reconstructed in detail with white resin. The three-dimensional relationships of the semicircular canals, spiral turns of the cochlea, and internal acoustic meatus were well recognizable from every direction through the transparent surface resin. The anterior semicircular canal was obvious immediately beneath the arcuate eminence, and the topographical relationships of the vestibulocochlear organ and adjacent great vessels were easily discernible.

An acromion fracture is often part of a more complex scapular trauma that needs stabilisation.\nWe developed a new technique using a three-dimensional (3D) model and a distal clavicle reconstruction plate to treat os acromiale and acromion fractures. Our hypothesis was that such an approach would be a useful addition to the existing techniques. First, a 3D model of the acromion was printed, then an osteosynthesis plate was pre-bent to fit the exact shape and curve of the acromion. We tested this technique and present reports on five patients, three with os acromiales and two with acromial fractures. We followed these patients during their rehabilitation and evaluated them using the Constant-Murley and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores.\nIn every case the fracture or non-union healed. If the surgery was performed before additional damage (such as an impingement syndrome) occurred, we saw that the patient's pain completely disappeared. This new technique also has other advantages because the surgeon can prepare the entire operation in advance, which reduces the duration of surgery. Another advantage of using a 3D model is that it can also be used to inform the patient and the surgical team about the planned operation.\nThis new technique using a preoperative patient-customized plate is a good alternative for use in open reduction and internal fixation, particularly if the patient has no other conditions.", "journal": "Journal of experimental orthopaedics", "date": "2017-10-27", "authors": ["HanneBeli\u00ebn", "HanneBiesmans", "AnnySteenwerckx", "EricBijnens", "CarlDierickx"], "doi": "10.1186/s40634-017-0111-7\n10.1016/j.jse.2005.08.024\n10.1097/BTE.0000000000000004\n10.3109/17453670903025394\n10.1007/s11999-011-2009-5\n10.1016/j.jse.2011.12.011\n10.1016/j.otsr.2012.10.020\n10.1302/0301-620X.85B4.13634\n10.1016/j.ijom.2016.10.004\n10.4103/0973-6042.80461\n10.1097/BTE.0000000000000020\n10.1016/j.injury.2013.03.001\n10.1067/j.cpradiol.2015.07.009\n10.1016/j.surg.2015.12.017\n10.1067/mse.2002.122227\n10.1016/j.jse.2005.09.019\n10.1016/j.jse.2004.01.023\n10.1016/j.jse.2014.09.040\n10.1111/joa.12484\n10.1016/j.cjtee.2016.05.003\n10.1002/ca.22343\n10.1016/j.jsurg.2016.01.003"}

{"title": "Optothermally Reversible Carbon Nanotube-DNA Supramolecular Hybrid Hydrogels.", "abstract": "Supramolecular hydrogels (SMHs) are three-dimensional constructs wherein the majority of the volume is occupied by water. Since the bonding forces between the components of SMHs are noncovalent, SMH properties are often tunable, stimuli-responsive, and reversible, which enables applications including triggered drug release, sensing, and tissue engineering. Meanwhile, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) possess superlative electrical and thermal conductivities, high mechanical strength, and strong optical absorption at near-infrared wavelengths that have the potential to add unique functionality to SMHs. However, SWCNT-based SMHs have thus far not realized the potential of the optical properties of SWCNTs to enable reversible response to near-infrared irradiation. Here, we present a novel SMH architecture comprised solely of DNA and SWCNTs, wherein noncovalent interactions provide structural integrity without compromising the intrinsic properties of SWCNTs. The mechanical properties of these SMHs are readily tuned by varying the relative concentrations of DNA and SWCNTs, which varies the cross-linking density as shown by molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, the SMH gelation transition is fully reversible and can be triggered by a change in temperature or near-infrared irradiation.

These models were processed in a computer aided design (CAD) software to determine the optimal trajectory and size of the CPS. Virtual drill guides were created for each patient, 3D-printed, and used intraoperatively. Locking titanium screw heads were bonded with polymethylmethacrylate cement to stabilize affected vertebral segments.

Biological restoration or repair of the IVD using \"compressive-force-resistant\" and at the same time \"cytocompatible\" materials would be desirable over current purely mechanical solutions, such as spinal fusion or IVD implants. This review provides an overview of recent research on the repair of the inner (nucleus pulposus = NP) and the outer (annulus fibrous = AF) parts of the IVD tissue. Many studies have addressed NP repair using hydrogel-like materials. However, only a few studies have so far focused on AF repair. As the AF possesses an extremely low self-healing capacity and special attention to shear-force resistance is essential, special repair designs are required. In our review, we stated the challenges in IVD repair and highlighted the use of composite materials such as silk biomaterials and fibrin cross-linked reinforced hydrogels. We elaborated on the origin of silk and its many in tissue engineering. Furthermore, techniques such as electrospinning and 3D printing technologies allow the fabrication of versatile and functionalised 3D scaffolds.

{"title": "Toward Self-Growing Soft Robots Inspired by Plant Roots and Based on Additive Manufacturing Technologies.", "abstract": "In this article, we present a novel class of robots that are able to move by growing and building their own structure. In particular, taking inspiration by the growing abilities of plant roots, we designed and developed a plant root-like robot that creates its body through an additive manufacturing process. Each robotic root includes a tubular body, a growing head, and a sensorized tip that commands the robot behaviors. The growing head is a customized three-dimensional (3D) printer-like system that builds the tubular body of the root in the format of circular layers by fusing and depositing a thermoplastic material (i.e., polylactic acid [PLA] filament) at the tip level, thus obtaining movement by growing. A differential deposition of the material can create an asymmetry that results in curvature of the built structure, providing the possibility of root bending to follow or escape from a stimulus or to reach a desired point in space. Taking advantage of these characteristics, the robotic roots are able to move inside a medium by growing their body. In this article, we describe the design of the growing robot together with the modeling of the deposition process and the description of the implemented growing movement strategy. Experiments were performed in air and in an artificial medium to verify the functionalities and to evaluate the robot performance. The results showed that the robotic root, with a diameter of 50\u2009mm, grows with a speed of up to 4\u2009mm/min, overcoming medium pressure of up to 37\u2009kPa (i.e., it is able to lift up to 6\u2009kg) and bending with a minimum radius of 100\u2009mm.", "journal": "Soft robotics", "date": "2017-10-25", "authors": ["AliSadeghi", "AlessioMondini", "BarbaraMazzolai"], "doi": "10.1089/soro.2016.0080"}

The objective of this report is to present novel 3-dimensional-printed polyamide craniosynostosis models that can improve the understanding and treatment complex pathologies.\nThe software InVesalius was used for segmentation of the anatomy image (from 3 patients between 6 and 9 months old). Afterward, the file was transferred to a 3-dimensional printing system and, with the use of an infrared laser, slices of powder PA 2200 were consecutively added to build a polyamide model of cranial bone.\nThe 3 craniosynostosis models allowed fronto-orbital advancement, Pi procedure, and posterior distraction in the operating room environment. All aspects of the craniofacial anatomy could be shown on the models, as well as the most common craniosynostosis pathologic variations (sphenoid wing elevation, shallow orbits, jugular foramen stenosis). Another advantage of our model is its low cost, about 100 U.S. dollars or even less when several models are produced.\nSimulation is becoming an essential part of medical education for surgical training and for improving surgical safety with adequate planning. This new polyamide craniosynostosis model allowed the surgeons to have realistic tactile feedback on manipulating a child's bone and permitted execution of the main procedures for anatomic correction.

{"title": "A novel 3D-printed mechanical actuator using centrifugal force for magnetic resonance elastography.", "abstract": "Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a technique for the quantification of tissue stiffness during MR examinations. It requires consistent methods for mechanical shear wave induction to the region of interest in the human body to reliably quantify elastic properties of soft tissues. This work proposes a novel 3D-printed mechanical actuator using the principle of centrifugal force for wave induction. The driver consists of a 3D-printed turbine vibrator powered by compressed air (located inside the scanner room) and an active driver controlling the pressure of inflowing air (placed outside the scanner room). The generated force of the proposed actuator increases for higher actuation frequencies as opposed to conventionally used air cushions. There, the displacement amplitude decreases with increasing actuation frequency resulting in a smaller signal-to-noise ratio. An initial phantom study is presented which demonstrates the feasibility of the actuator for MRE. The wave-actuation frequency was regulated in a range between 15 Hz and 60 Hz for force measurements and proved sufficiently stable (\u00b1 0.3 Hz) for any given nominal frequency. The generated forces depend on the weight of the eccentric unbalance within the turbine and ranged between 0.67 N to 2.70 N (for 15 Hz) and 3.09 N to 7.77 N (for 60 Hz). Therefore, the generated force of the presented actuator increases with rotational speed of the turbine and offers an elegant solution for sufficiently large wave actuation at higher frequencies. In future work, we will investigate an optimal ratio of the weight of unbalance to the size of turbine for appropriately large but tolerable wave actuation for a given nominal frequency.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

We examined the feasibility of using visible light from a commercial beam projector to pattern the EY-GelMA bioink. We measured the absorbance of bioink to characterize its sensitivity to visible light and performed bioprinting to test its ability to promote cell adhesion. It is found that the EY-GelMA bioink has an absorption peak at roughly 522 nm, and that it can be successfully crosslinked by visible light from the commercial projector. We performed the bioprinting experiments and visualized the cell morphology using nuclei/F-actin staining. Experimental results show that most of the cells attached to the EY-GelMA bioink after five days' culturing. Ultimately, the EY-GelMA bioink can support both visible light crosslinking and cell adhesion, offering great potential in bioprinting and tissue engineering.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Design, implementation and performance validation of UOMPro artificial hand: Towards affordable hand prostheses.", "abstract": "In this paper, an anthropometric, active artificial prosthetic hand named UOMPro (University of Moratuwa Prosthetic) is proposed. The UOMPro hand is realized during research on developing affordable hand prostheses for use by people mainly in developing countries where purchasing high cost state-of-the-art commercial hand prostheses may be beyond their capacity. The proposed hand is developed with an affordable cost (<; 850 USD) and it consists of 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) including flexion/extension motions of five fingers and abduction/adduction motion of the thumb finger. Under actuated fingers are fabricated using a combination of 3D printed parts and CNC machined aluminum which addresses drawbacks in fully 3D printed hands. All components of the electronic control circuit which are responsible for low-level controlling of the hand are placed inside the hand where a simple serial communication interface is provided to link with high-level control methods. The implemented low-level controller can communicate with either a high-level controller that sends individual fingers position commands or a high-level controller which sends hand grip pattern commands. A set of experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the overall system and results are presented with potential future directions.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

In this paper a new 3D printed soft hand exoskeleton, HEXOES (Hand Exoskeleton with Embedded Synergies), is introduced and mechanically characterized. Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal/interphalangeal (PIP/IP) joints had measured maximum flexion angles of 53.7 \u00b1 16.9\u00b0 and 39.9 \u00b1 13.4\u00b0, respectively; and maximum MCP and PIP angular velocities of 94.5 \u00b1 41.9 degrees/s and 74.6 \u00b1 67.3 degrees/s, respectively. These estimates indicate that the mechanical design has range of motion and angular velocity characteristics that meet the requirements for synergy-based control.

{"title": "LEMRG: Decision Rule Generation Algorithm for Mining MicroRNA Expression Data.", "abstract": "Recently, research on mining microRNA (or miRNA) expression data has received a lot of attention, mainly because of its role in gene regulation. However, such type of data - usually saved in the form of microarrays - are very specific, because they contain only a small number of cases (often less than 100) compared with large number of attributes (equal to several hundreds or even tens of thousand). The small number of cases available during the learning process can cause instability of the newly created classifiers. Secondly, the huge number of attributes imposes the necessity of selecting only a few dominant attributes strongly correlated with the decision. Thus, an application of fundamental machine learning approaches of mining microarray data and its further classification is problematic or even could just fail.Thus, the main goal of our research is to develop the generalized algorithm of mining microarray data (including miRNA data sets), mainly to improve stability and, consequently, accuracy of classification for the newly created learning classifiers. The main concept of the novel approach is based on iteratively inducing many subsequent decision rule sets - called decision rule generations - instead of inducing only a single decision rule set, as it is done routinely. The decision rules have been chosen as the baseline classifiers of the newly developed LEMRG (Learning from Examples Module based on Rule Generations) algorithm mainly because the decision rule-based knowledge representation is easier for humans to comprehend, rather than other learning models. In our research we used a miRNA expression level learning data set describing 11 types of human cancers, while the testing data set contained poorly differentiated cases of only four types of cancers. As expected, our new classifiers - saved in the form of so-called cumulative decision rule sets - had better stability and accuracy of classification than single decision rule sets induced in the traditional manner. Furthermore, the LEMRG was compared with other machine learning models. It was proven that only 3 out of all 16 tested classifiers enabled so effective classification as our newly developed approach. Thus, using our cumulative set of decision rules, all cases of cancer from two selected concepts - colon and ovary - were correctly classified. Furthermore, we showed the role of these selected miRNAs as the potential biomarkers for diagnosis of tumors.A preliminary result of our research on decision rule generations was initially presented at the first International Conference of Digital Medicine and Medical 3D Printing (17-19.06.2016, Nanjing, China).", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2017-10-24", "authors": ["\u0141ukaszPi\u0105tek", "Jerzy WGrzyma\u0142a-Busse"], "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-6041-0_7"}
{"title": "Systematic review of 3D printing in spinal surgery: the current state of play.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional printing (3DP), also known as \"Additive Manufacturing\", is a rapidly growing industry, particularly in the area of spinal surgery. Given the complex anatomy of the spine and delicate nature of surrounding structures, 3DP has the potential to aid surgical planning and procedural accuracy. We perform a systematic review of current literature on the applications of 3DP in spinal surgery. Six electronic databases were searched for original published studies reporting cases or outcomes for 3DP surgical models, guides or implants for spinal surgery. The findings of these studies were synthesized and summarized. These searches returned a combined 2,411 articles. Of these, 54 were included in this review. 3DP is currently used for surgical planning, intra-operative surgical guides, customised prostheses as well as \"Off-the-Shelf\" implants. The technology has the potential for enhanced implant properties, as well as decreased surgical time and better patient outcomes. The majority of the data thus far is from low-quality studies with inherent biases linked with the excitement of a new field. As the body of literature continues to expand, larger scale studies to evaluate advantages and disadvantages, and longer-term follow up will enhance our knowledge of the effect 3DP has in spinal surgery.

{"title": "Modelling and Manufacturing of a 3D Printed Trachea for Cricothyroidotomy Simulation.", "abstract": "Cricothyroidotomy is a life-saving medical procedure that allows for tracheal intubation. Most current cricothyroidotomy simulation models are either expensive or not anatomically accurate and provide the learner with an unrealistic simulation experience. The goal of this project is to improve current simulation techniques by utilizing rapid prototyping using 3D printing technology and expert opinions to develop inexpensive and anatomically accurate trachea simulators. In doing so, emergency cricothyroidotomy simulation can be made accessible, accurate, cost-effective and reproducible. Three-dimensional modelling software was used in conjunction with a desktop three-dimensional (3D) printer to design and manufacture an anatomically accurate model of the cartilage within the trachea (thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, and the tracheal rings). The initial design was based on dimensions found in studies of tracheal anatomical configuration. This ensured that the landmarking necessary for emergency cricothyroidotomies was designed appropriately. Several revisions of the original model were made based on informal opinion from medical professionals to establish appropriate anatomical accuracy of the model for use in rural/remote cricothyroidotomy simulation. Using an entry-level desktop 3D printer, a low cost tracheal model was successfully designed that can be printed in less than three hours for only $1.70 Canadian dollars (CAD). Due to its anatomical accuracy, flexibility and durability, this model is great for use in emergency medicine simulation training. Additionally, the model can be assembled in conjunction with a membrane to simulate tracheal ligaments. Skin has been simulated as well to enhance the realism of the model. The result is an accurate simulation that will provide users with an anatomically correct model to practice important skills used in emergency airway surgery, specifically landmarking, incision and intubation.

Silicon probes are advanced electrodes for large-scale electrophysiological recording of neuronal activity, but the procedures for their chronic implantation are still underdeveloped. The activity of hippocampal place cells is known to correlate with an animal's position in the environment, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. To investigate place cells, here we describe a set of techniques which range from the fabrication of devices for chronic silicon probe implants to the monitoring of place field activity in a cue-enriched treadmill apparatus.

A first surgery is performed to fix the hat on the skull of a mouse. Small landmarks are fabricated and attached to the belt of a treadmill. The mouse is trained to run head-fixed on the treadmill. A second surgery is performed to implant the silicon probe in the hippocampus, following which broadband electrophysiological signals are recorded. Finally, the silicon probe is recovered and cleaned for reuse.

Novel low-density lattice internal structure gastro-floating tablets of dipyridamole were developed to prolong the gastric residence time in order to improve drug release rate and consequently, improve bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Excipients commonly employed in the pharmaceutical study could be efficiently applied in the room temperature 3D extrusion-based printing process. The tablets were designed with three kinds of infill percentage and prepared by hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K4M) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC E15) as hydrophilic matrices and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC PH101) as extrusion molding agent. In vitro evaluation of the 3D printed gastro-floating tablets was performed by determining mechanical properties, content uniformity, and weight variation. Furthermore, re-floating ability, floating duration time, and drug release behavior were also evaluated.

{"title": "UV-Assisted 3D Bioprinting of Nanoreinforced Hybrid Cardiac Patch for Myocardial Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Biofabrication of cell supportive cardiac patches that can be directly implanted on myocardial infarct is a potential solution for myocardial infarction repair. Ideally, cardiac patches should be able to mimic myocardium extracellular matrix for rapid integration with the host tissue, raising the need to develop cardiac constructs with complex features. In particular, cardiac patches should be electrically conductive, mechanically robust and elastic, biologically active and prevascularized. In this study, we aim to biofabricate a nanoreinforced hybrid cardiac patch laden with human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) with improved electrical, mechanical, and biological behavior. A safe ultraviolet (UV) exposure time with insignificant effect on cell viability was identified for methacrylated collagen (MeCol) micropatterning. The effects of carboxyl functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on MeCol and alginate matrix morphology, mechanical properties, electrical behavior, and cellular response were investigated at different CNT mass ratios. A UV-integrated 3D-bioprinting technique was implemented to create hybrid hydrogel constructs consisting of CNT-incorporated alginate framework and cell-laden MeCol. The compressive modulus, impedance, and swelling degree of hybrid constructs were assessed over 20 days of incubation in culture medium at 37\u00b0C for different CNT mass ratios. The HCAEC viability, proliferation, and differentiation in the context of the bioprinted hybrid constructs were assessed over 10 days in vitro. The functionalized CNTs provided a highly interconnected nanofibrous meshwork that significantly improved viscoelastic behavior and electrical conductivity of photo-cross-linked MeCol. Alginate-coated CNTs provided a nanofilamentous network with fiber size of \u223c25-500\u2009nm, improving not only electrical and mechanical properties but also HCAEC attachment and elongation compared to pristine alginate. The CNT-reinforced 3D-printed hybrid constructs presented significantly higher stiffness and electrical conductivity particularly in the physiologically relevant frequency range (\u223c5\u2009Hz). The CNT-reinforced hybrid implants maintained a significantly higher swelling degree over 20 days of culturing compared to CNT-free hybrid constructs. For a selected CNT mass ratio, HCAECs presented significant cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation (lumen-like formation) over 10 days of incubation in vitro.

{"title": "A low-cost bioprosthetic semilunar valve for research, disease modelling and surgical training applications.", "abstract": "This paper provides detailed instructions for constructing low-cost bioprosthetic semilunar valves for animal research and clinical training. This work fills an important gap between existing simulator training valves and clinical valves by providing fully functioning designs that can be employed in ex vivo and in vivo experiments and can also be modified to model valvular disease.\nValves are constructed in 4 steps consisting of creating a metal frame, covering it with fabric and attaching a suture ring and leaflets. Computer-aided design files are provided for making the frame from wire or by metal 3D printing. The covering fabric and suturing ring are made from materials readily available in a surgical lab, while the leaflets are made from pericardium. The entire fabrication process is described in figures and in a video. To demonstrate disease modelling, design modifications are described for producing paravalvular leaks, and these valves were evaluated in porcine ex vivo (n\u2009=\u20093) and in vivo (n\u2009=\u20096) experiments.\nPorcine ex vivo and acute in vivo experiments demonstrate that the valves can replicate the performance of clinical valves for research and training purposes. Surgical implantation is similar, and echocardiograms are comparable to clinical valves. Furthermore, valve leaflet function was satisfactory during acute in vivo tests with little central regurgitation, while the paravalvular leak modifications consistently produced leaks in the desired locations.\nThe detailed design procedure presented here, which includes a tutorial video and computer-aided design files, should be of substantial benefit to researchers developing valve disease models and to clinicians developing realistic valve training systems.", "journal": "Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery", "date": "2017-10-20", "authors": ["BenoitRosa", "ZurabMachaidze", "BoramiShin", "SunilManjila", "David WBrown", "Christopher WBaird", "John EMayer", "Pierre EDupont"], "doi": "10.1093/icvts/ivx189"}

A complex and complication prone procedure such as percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with a steep learning curve may create an unsafe environment for hands-on resident training. In this study, we validate a high fidelity, inanimate PCNL model within a full-immersion simulation environment.\nAnatomically correct models of the human pelvicaliceal system, kidney, and relevant adjacent structures were created using polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels and three-dimensional-printed injection molds. All steps of a PCNL were simulated including percutaneous renal access, nephroscopy, and lithotripsy. Five experts (>100 caseload) and 10 novices (<20 caseload) from both urology (full procedure) and interventional radiology (access only) departments completed the simulation. Face and content validity were calculated using model ratings for similarity to the real procedure and usefulness as a training tool. Differences in performance among groups with various levels of experience using clinically relevant procedural metrics were used to calculate construct validity.\nThe model was determined to have an excellent face and content validity with an average score of 4.5/5.0 and 4.6/5.0, respectively. There were significant differences between novice and expert operative metrics including mean fluoroscopy time, the number of percutaneous access attempts, and number of times the needle was repositioned. Experts achieved better stone clearance with fewer procedural complications.\nWe demonstrated the face, content, and construct validity of an inanimate, full task trainer for PCNL. Construct validity between experts and novices was demonstrated using incorporated procedural metrics, which permitted the accurate assessment of performance.

Here, the effect of the orientation of the extruded filament on the fluidic behavior is investigated in fused deposition modeling (FDM) printed fluidic devices. Devices were printed with filament orientations at 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 to the direction of the flow. The extent of mixing was observed when pumping yellow and blue solutions into the inlets of a Y-shaped device, and measuring the extent of mixing of two colored solutions under different angles and at flow rates of 25, 50, and 100 \u03bcL/min. Fluidic devices printed with filament extruded at 60\u00b0 to the flow showed the highest mixing efficiency, but results obtained at 30\u00b0 suggested more complex fluid movement, as the measured degree of mixing decreased along the fluidic channel at higher flow rates. To explore this, a device with -37\u00b0 filament orientation on the top surface was designed to align with the direction of the first fluid input channel and +37\u00b0 on the bottom surface of the channel to align with the direction of the second fluidic input. Results indicated a rotational movement of the fluids down the microchannel, which were confirmed by computational fluid dynamics. These results demonstrate the impact of the filament extrusion direction on fluidic behavior in microfluidic devices made by FDM printing.

Therefore, we provide a step-by-step guide for constructing a speckle-free and high-contrast laser illumination setup using a rotating ground glass diffuser driven by a stepper motor. The setup is easy to build, cheap, and allows a significant light throughput of 48%, which is 40% higher in comparison to a single lens collector commonly used in reported setups. This is achieved by using only one objective to collect the scattered light from the ground glass diffuser. We validate our setup in terms of image quality, speckle contrast, motor-induced vibrations, and light throughput. To highlight the latter, we record Brownian motion of micro-particles using a 100\u00d7 oil immersion objective and a high-speed camera operating at 2000 Hz with a laser output power of only 22 mW. Moreover, by reducing the objective magnification to 50\u00d7, sampling rates up to 10,000 Hz are realized.

In recent years, research workplaces are focused on developing scaffold by bio-fabrication techniques to achieve fast, precise and cheap automatic manufacturing of these structures. Most promising techniques seem to be Rapid prototyping due to its high level of precision and controlling.

In this article we tested printing of clinically applicable scaffolds with use of commercially available devices and materials. Research presented in this article is in general focused on \"scaffolding\" on a field of bone tissue replacement.\nCommercially available 3D printer and Polylactic acid were used to create originally designed and possibly suitable scaffold structures for bone tissue engineering. We tested printing of scaffolds with different geometrical structures. Based on the osteosarcoma cells proliferation experiment and mechanical testing of designed scaffold samples, it will be stated that it is likely not necessary to keep the recommended porosity of the scaffold for bone tissue replacement at about 90%, and it will also be clarified why this fact eliminates mechanical properties issue. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the size of an individual pore could be double the size of the recommended range between 0.2-0.35\u00a0mm without affecting the cell proliferation.\nRapid prototyping technique based on Fused deposition modelling was used for the fabrication of designed scaffold structures.

We designed circularly arrayed microwells to allow the even distribution of cells introduced at the center of a rotating platform and to provide identical hypergravity conditions at each well by the centrifugal forces generated. Compared with conventional well plate-based spheroid formation, the CMS formation method significantly promotes sphericity and consistency in both size and shape with high production yields. In addition to mono-culture spheroids, we successfully generated co-culture spheroids in concentric, Janus, and sandwich shapes using human adipose-derived stem cells and human lung fibroblasts, demonstrating the versatility of our CMS formation method.

Hydroxyapatite and \u03b1-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b1-TCP) biphasic calcium powders were printed using phosphoric acid binder, which generated monetite and hydroxyapatite scaffolds. Upon sintering, evolution of \u03b2-TCP was observed along with an increase in flexural strength and modulus but no effect on fracture toughness was observed. Furthermore, scaffold porosity increased with sintering. Additionally, two techniques of PCL composite formation were employed: postprint precipitation and 3D print codeposition to further augment scaffold mechanical properties. While both techniques significantly improved flexural strength, flexural modulus, and fracture toughness under most conditions explored, precipitation yielded more substantial increases in these properties, which is attributed to better continuity of the PCL phase. However, precipitation also compromised surface porosity due to PCL passivation of the calcium phosphate surface, which may subsequently hinder scaffold integration and bone regeneration. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The application of allylated gelatin (GelAGE) as a thiol-ene clickable bioink for distinct biofabrication applications is reported. Curing of this system occurs via dimerization and yields a network with flexible properties that offer a wider biofabrication window than (meth-)acryloyl chemistry, and without additional nondegradable components. An in-depth analysis of GelAGE synthesis is conducted, and standard UV-initiation is further compared with a recently described visible-light-initiator system for GelAGE hydrogel formation. It is demonstrated that GelAGE may serve as a platform bioink for several biofabrication technologies by fabricating constructs with high shape fidelity via lithography-based (digital light processing) 3D printing and extrusion-based 3D bioprinting, the latter supporting long-term viability postprinting of encapsulated chondrocytes.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2017-10-19", "authors": ["SarahBertlein", "GabriellaBrown", "Khoon SLim", "TomaszJungst", "ThomasBoeck", "TorstenBlunk", "JoergTessmar", "Gary JHooper", "Tim B FWoodfield", "JuergenGroll"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.201703404"}
{"title": "Self-coacervation of modular squid beak proteins - a comparative study.", "abstract": "The beak of the Humboldt squid is a biocomposite material made solely of organic components - chitin and proteins - which exhibits 200-fold stiffness and hardness gradients from the soft base to the exceptionally hard tip (rostrum). The outstanding mechanical properties of the squid beak are achieved via controlled hydration and impregnation of the chitin-based scaffold by protein coacervates. Molecular-based understanding of these proteins is essential to mimic the natural beak material. Here, we present detailed studies of two histidine-rich beak proteins (HBP-1 and -2) that play central roles during beak bio-fabrication. We show that both proteins have the ability to self-coacervate, which is governed intrinsically by the sequence modularity of their C-terminus and extrinsically by pH and ionic strength. We demonstrate that HBPs possess dynamic structures in solution and achieve maximum folding in the coacervate state, and propose that their self-coacervation is driven by hydrophobic interactions following charge neutralization through salt-screening. Finally, we show that subtle differences in the modular repeats of HBPs result in significant changes in the rheological response of the coacervates. This knowledge may be exploited to design self-coacervating polypeptides for a wide range of engineering and biomedical applications, for example bio-inspired composite materials, smart hydrogels and adhesives, and biomedical implants.", "journal": "Soft matter", "date": "2017-10-19", "authors": ["HaoCai", "BartoszGabryelczyk", "Malathy S SManimekalai", "GerhardGr\u00fcber", "StefanSalentinig", "AliMiserez"], "doi": "10.1039/c7sm01352c"}
{"title": "Application of 3D printing rapid prototyping-assisted percutaneous fixation in the treatment of intertrochanteric fracture.", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the application of 3D printing (3DP) rapid prototyping (RP) technique-assisted percutaneous fixation in the treatment of femoral intertrochanteric fracture (ITF) using proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA). A total of 39 patients with unstable ITF were included in the current study. Patients were divided into two groups: 19 patients were examined using computed tomography scanning and underwent PFNA with SDP-RP whereas the other 20 patients underwent conventional PFNA treatment. Anatomical data were converted from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format to the stereolithography format using M3D software. The 3DP-RP model was established using the fused deposition modeling technique and the length and diameter of the main screw blade was measured during the simulation. The postoperative femoral neck-shaft angle (NSA), surgery duration, intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, and the duration of hospital stay were recorded and compared with the corresponding values in conventional surgery. No significant differences were observed in mean PFNA size between the implants used and the preoperative planning estimates. It was demonstrated that the 3DP-RP assisted procedure resulted in more effective reduction of the NSA. Furthermore, patients undergoing 3DP-RP experienced a significant reduction in duration of surgery (P<0.01), as well as reductions in intraoperative (P=0.02) and postoperative (P=0.03) blood loss, compared with conventional surgery. At 6 months post-surgery, no cases of hip varus/vague deformities or implant failure were observed in patients that underwent either the 3DP-RP-assisted or conventional procedure. The results of the present study suggest that the 3DP-RP technique is able to create an accurate model of the ITF, which facilitates surgical planning and fracture reduction, thus improving the efficiency of PFNA surgery for ITFs.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2017-10-19", "authors": ["Sheng-NaiZheng", "Qing-QiangYao", "Feng-YongMao", "Peng-FeiZheng", "Shu-ChangTian", "Jia-YiLi", "Yi-FanYu", "ShuaiLiu", "JinZhou", "JunHu", "YanXu", "KaiTang", "YueLou", "Li-MingWang"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2017.4991\n10.2106/JBJS.D.01796\n10.4103/0019-5413.73656\n10.1136/bmj.38643.663843.55\n10.1016/j.otsr.2012.12.019\n10.1186/s13018-016-0344-7\n10.1016/j.injury.2008.10.014\n10.1016/j.injury.2008.02.005\n10.5301/HIP.2011.8657\n10.1177/147323001003800408\n10.1007/s00264-009-0776-3\n10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011679\n10.11622/smedj.2013152\n10.1016/j.injury.2016.08.027\n10.5371/hp.2015.27.1.30\n10.1007/s11548-016-1382-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0145879\n10.1016/j.injury.2015.03.018\n10.1007/s11999-012-2268-9\n10.1016/j.injury.2006.08.050\n10.1186/s13018-014-0112-5\n10.2106/00004623-199507000-00012\n10.1007/s00198-011-1601-6\n10.1007/s00264-013-2146-4\n10.1016/j.injury.2011.10.030\n10.1007/s00198-015-3058-5"}

However, their hydrophobicity and the lack of specific cell recognition sites confined their practical application. In this study, to improve the cell seeding efficiency and osteoinductivity, an injectable thermo-sensitive chitosan hydrogel (CSG) was incorporated into a 3D-printed poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffold to form a hybrid scaffold. To demonstrate the feasibility of this hybrid system for BTE application, rabbit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) were encapsulated in CSG. Pure PCL scaffolds were used as controls. Cell proliferation and viability were investigated. Osteogenic gene expressions of BMMSCs in various scaffolds were determined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Growth factor releasing profile and mechanical tests were performed. CCK-8 assay confirmed greater cell retention and proliferation in chitosan and hybrid groups. Confocal microscopy showed even distribution of cells in the hybrid system. After 2-week osteogenic culture in vitro, BMMSCs in hybrid and chitosan scaffolds showed stronger osteogenesis and bone-matrix formation.

{"title": "Generating liquid nanojets from copper by dual laser irradiation for ultra-high resolution printing.", "abstract": "When the energy of a short laser pulse is localized in a fluid material, a flow motion is induced that can lead to the generation of free-surface jets. This nozzle-free jetting process is exploited to print conductive materials, typically metal nanoparticle inks, but this approach remains limited to the transfer of low viscosity fluids with a minimum feature size of few micrometers. We introduce a dual-laser method to achieve reproducible high-aspect-ratio jets from thin solid films. A first laser irradiation induces the melting of copper thin films and a second synchronized short pulse irradiation initiates the jetting process. Using time-resolved microscopy, we investigate the influence of the film thickness on the flow motion mechanisms and the ejection dynamics. For a wide range of laser fluences, we present observations similar to those obtained when the jets are generated by a single laser pulse from liquid donor films. The use of a solid film allows reducing the film thickness and then the volume of transferred material. Finally, we analyze these results in the perspective of using this double pulse LIFT technique for additive manufacturing of nano-micro-structures.

Cartridges with and without a sheath gas manifold and an electrostatic lens are compared with respect to analytical performance and operational flexibility. The sensitivity and limit of detection are improved in the cartridge with an electrostatic lens and sheath gas manifold compared to the cartridge without (15% and over 6.5\u00d7 smaller, respectively). The use of these focusing elements also improved the average spray stability. Furthermore, the range of potentials required for PSI was lower, and the distance to the MS orifice over which spray could be obtained was larger. Importantly, both setups allowed quantification of a model drug in the ng/mL range with single-stage MS, after correction for spray instability.

We performed gait analyses for eight unimpaired individuals. Each individual walked at slow and very slow speeds with a 3D printed AFO with no resistance (free hinge condition) and four levels of ankle dorsiflexion stiffness: 0.25Nm/\u00b0, 1Nm/\u00b0, 2Nm/\u00b0, and 3.7Nm/\u00b0. Motion capture, ultrasound, and musculoskeletal modeling were used to quantify MG and AT lengths with each AFO condition. Increasing AFO stiffness increased peak AFO dorsiflexion moment with decreased peak knee extension and peak ankle dorsiflexion angles. Overall musculotendon length and peak AT length decreased, while peak MG length increased with increasing AFO stiffness. Peak MG activity, length, and velocity significantly decreased with slower walking speed.

COX-2 (cyclooxygenase 2) is involved in drug resistance and poor prognosis of many neoplastic diseases or cancers. However, investigations identifying new modulators of COX-2 pathway and searching for new chemicals targeting these valid resistant biomarkers are still greatly needed.\nHCT15, HCT-116, HT-29, COLO205, FHC, IMCE, SW480 cell lines were used to detect the expression of YAP and COX-2. Site-directed mutagenesis, luciferase reporter analysis and ChIP assay were used to test whether YAP activated COX-2 transcription through interaction with TEAD binding sites in the promoter of COX-2. Cell line models exhibiting overexpression or knockdown of some genes were generated using transfection agents. Coimmunoprecipitation was used to detect protein mutual interaction. mRNA and protein levels were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot respectively.\nHere, we reported that both YAP and COX-2 were overexpressed in colorectal cancer cells. YAP increased COX-2 expression at the level of transcription requiring intact TEAD binding sites in the COX-2 promoter. YAP conferred drug resistance through COX-2 and its related effectors such as MCL, MDR, Survivin. GCCSysm-4 (G-4), a YAP and COX-2 inhibitor, effectively inhibited both YAP and COX-2 activation, induced apoptosis and decreased viability in Taxol-resistant cells.

The bioprinter consists of three subassemblies: a base unit, a gantry, and a shuttle component. The platform utilizes four stepper motors to position along three axes and a fifth stepper motor actuating a pump. The shuttle and gantry are each driven along their respective horizontal axes via separate single stepper motor, while two coupled stepper motors are used to control location along the vertical axis. The current shuttle configuration allows for a 5 mL syringe to be extruded within a work envelope of 180\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009160\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009120\u2009mm (X, Y, Z). The shuttle can easily be reconfigured to accommodate larger volume syringes. An attachment for a laser pen is located such that printing material may be light-activated pre-extrusion. Positional fidelity was established with calipers possessing a resolution to the nearest hundredth millimeter. The motors associated with the X and Y axes were calibrated to approximately 0.02\u2009mm per motor impulse. The Z axis has a theoretical step distance of \u223c51\u2009nm, generating 0.04% error over a 10\u2009mm travel distance. The A axis, or pump motor, has an impulse distance of 0.001\u2009mm. The volume extruded by a single impulse is dictated by the diameter of the syringe used. With a 5\u2009mL syringe possessing an inner diameter of 12.35\u2009mm, the pump pushes as little as 0.119\u2009", "journal": "Journal of medical devices", "date": "2017-10-17", "authors": ["ColtonMcElheny", "DanielHayes", "RamDevireddy"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4037259\n10.1111/ajt.12581\n10.1126/science.8493529\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.12.084\n10.1089/ten.teb.2008.0193\n10.1089/ten.teb.2010.0612\n10.1186/s41205-016-0005-9\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.11.007\n10.2492/inflammregen.28.36\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.10.016\n10.1002/biot.200600081\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.050\n10.1002/ar.a.10059\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.056\n10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.02.011\n10.1002/ar.a.10057\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.1658\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.055\n10.1161/hc0102.101442\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2010.12.008\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.07.004\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1002/biot.200900004\n10.1089/ten.tec.2009.0423\n10.1002/jbm.b.31831\n10.1080/07853890701881788"}

{"title": "The application of 3D-printed transparent facemask for facial scar management and its biomechanical rationale.", "abstract": "Deep facial burns leave conspicuous scar to the patients and affect their quality of life. Transparent facemask has been adopted for the prevention and treatment of facial hypertrophic scars for decades. Recently, with the advancement of 3D printing, the transparent facemask could facilitate the fitting of the facial contour. However, the effectiveness of the device and its biomechanical characteristics on pressure management of hypertrophic scar would need more objective evaluation.\nA biomechanical model of the transparent 3D-printed facemask was established through finite element analysis. Ten patients with extensive deep facial burns within 6 months were recruited for clinical study using 3D-printed facemask designed according to biomechanical model, and the interface pressure was measured on each patient. The patients in the treatment group (n=5) was provided with the 3D-printed transparent face mask soon after initial scar assessment, while the delayed treatment group (n=5) began the treatment one month after the initial scar assessment. The scar assessment was performed one month post intervention for both groups.\nThe biomechanical modeling showed that the 3D, computer-generated facemask resulted in unbalanced pressure if design modifications were not incorporated to address these issues. The interface pressure between the facemask and patient's face was optimized through individualized design adjustments and the addition of silicone lining. After optimization of pressure through additional lining, the mean thickness and hardness of the scars of all 10 patients were decreased significantly after 1-month of intervention. In the delayed treatment group, the mean thickness of the scars was increased within the month without intervention, but it was also decreased after intervention.\nFacemask design and the silicone lining are important to ensure adequate compression pressure of 3D-printed transparent facemask. The intervention using the 3D-printed facemask appeared to show its efficacy to control the thickness and hardness of the facial hypertrophic scars.", "journal": "Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries", "date": "2017-10-17", "authors": ["YatingWei", "YanWang", "MingZhang", "GangYan", "ShixueWu", "WenjunLiu", "GangJi", "Cecilia W PLi-Tsang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.burns.2017.08.006"}

Cellular and extracellular composition of human plaques is maneuvered by local inflammation that leads to alterations in the original vascular microenvironment and to the recruitment of an invading fibrous layer (fibroatharoma). In the present study we introduce a bioengineered three-dimensional model of human fibroatheroma (ps-plaque) assembled with a tailored hanging-drop protocol. Using vi-SNE based multidimensional flow cytometry data analysis we compared the myeloid cell-populations in ps-plaques to those in plaques isolated from human carotid arteries. We observed that plasmacytoid and activated dendritic cells are the main myeloid components of human carotid plaques and that both cell types are present in the biofabricated model. We found that low-density lipoproteins affect cell viability and contribute to population polarization in ps-plaques.

{"title": "Three-dimensional evaluation of marginal and internal fit of 3D-printed interim restorations fabricated on different finish line designs.", "abstract": "PurposeTo evaluate the influence of fabrication method and finish line design on marginal and internal fit of full-coverage interim restorations. MethodsFour typodont models of maxillary central-incisor were prepared for full-coverage restorations. Four groups were defined; knife-edge (KE), chamfer (C), rounded-shoulder (RS), rounded-shoulder with bevel (RSB). All preparations were digitally scanned. A total of 80 restorations were fabricated; 20 per group (SLA/3D-printed n=10, milled n=10). All restorations were positioned on the master die and scanned using micro-computed tomography. The mean gaps were measured digitally (ImageJ). The results were compared using MANOVA (\u03b1=.05). ResultsInternal and marginal gaps were significantly influenced by fabrication method (P=.000) and finish-line design (P=.000). 3D-Printed restorations showed statistically significant lower mean gap compared to milled restorations at all points (P=.000). The mean internal gap for 3D-printed restorations were 66, 149, 130, 95\u03bcm and for milled restorations were 89, 177, 185, 154\u03bcm for KE, C, RS, RSB respectively. The mean absolute marginal discrepancy in 3D-printed restorations were (30, 41, 30, 28\u03bcm) and in milled restorations were (56, 54, 52, 38\u03bcm) for KE, C, RS, RSB respectively. ConclusionsThe fabrication methods showed more of an influence on the fit compared to the effect of the finish-line design in both milled and printed restorations. SLA-printed interim restorations exhibit lower marginal and internal gap than milled restorations. Nonetheless, for both techniques, all values were within the reported values for CAD/CAM restorations.

{"title": "iPSC-Derived Vascular Cell Spheroids as Building Blocks for Scaffold-Free Biofabrication.", "abstract": "Recently a protocol is established to obtain large quantities of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived endothelial progenitors, called endothelial colony forming cells (ECFC), and of candidate smooth-muscle forming cells (SMFC). Here, the suitability for assembling in spheroids, and in larger 3D cell constructs is tested. iPSC-derived ECFC and SMFC are labeled with tdTomato and eGFP, respectively. Spheroids are formed in ultra-low adhesive wells, and their dynamic proprieties are studied by time-lapse microscopy, or by confocal microscopy. Spheroids are also tested for fusion ability either in the wells, or assembled on the Regenova 3D bioprinter which laces them in stainless steel micro-needles (the \"Kenzan\" method). It is found that both ECFC and SMFC formed spheroids in about 24\u2009h. Fluorescence monitoring indicated a continuous compaction of ECFC spheroids, but stabilization in those prepared from SMFC. In mixed spheroids, the cell distribution changed continuously, with ECFC relocating to the core, and showing pre-vascular organization. All spheroids have the ability of in-well fusion, but only those containing SMFC are robust enough to sustain assembling in tubular structures. In these constructs a layered distribution of alpha smooth muscle actin-positive cells and extracellular matrix deposition is found. In conclusion, iPSC-derived vascular cell spheroids represent a promising new cellular material for scaffold-free biofabrication.", "journal": "Biotechnology journal", "date": "2017-10-17", "authors": ["LeniMoldovan", "AprilBarnard", "Chang-HyunGil", "YangLin", "Maria BGrant", "Mervin CYoder", "NutanPrasain", "Nicanor IMoldovan"], "doi": "10.1002/biot.201700444"}

In this respect, a previously proposed capsular device able to control the release performance based on its design and composition, which could extemporaneously be filled, was improved to include multiple separate compartments so that differing active ingredients or formulations may be conveyed. The compartments, which may differ in thickness and composition, resulted from assembly of two hollow halves through a joint also acting as a partition. The systems were manufactured by fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing, which holds special potential for product personalization, and injection molding (IM) that would enable production on a larger scale. Through combination of compartments having wall thickness of 600 or 1200\u03bcm, composed of promptly soluble, swellable/erodible or enteric soluble polymers, devices showing two-pulse release patterns, consistent with the nature of the starting materials, were obtained.

In this study, a self-designed wet-spinning device appended with a rotary receiving pool was used to continuously produce shear-patterned hydrogel microfibers with aligned submicron topography. The process that the flow-induced shear force reshapes the surface of hydrogel fiber into aligned submicron topography was systematically analysed. Afterwards, the effect of fiber topography on cellular longitudinal spread and elongation was investigated by culturing rat neuron-like PC12 cells and human osteosarcoma MG63 cells with the spun hydrogel microfibers, respectively. The results suggested that the stronger shear flow force would lead to more distinct aligned submicron topography on fiber surface, which could induce cell orientation along with fiber axis and therefore form the cell-matrix dual-alignment. Finally, a multi-hierarchical tissue-like structure constructed by dual-oriented cell-matrix assemblies was fabricated based on this wet-spinning method.

{"title": "A simple and efficient feeder-free culture system to up-scale iPSCs on polymeric material surface for use in 3D bioprinting.", "abstract": "The 3D bioprinting and cell/tissue printing techniques open new possibilities for future applications. To facilitate the 3D bioprinting process, a large amount of living cells are required. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent a promising cell source for bioprinting. However, the maintenance and expansion of undifferentiated iPSCs are expensive and time consuming. Therefore, in this study a culture method to obtain a sufficient amount of healthy and undifferentiated iPSCs in a short-term period was established. The iPSCs could be passaged for twice on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) dish with the conditional medium and could adapt to the feeder-free environment. Feeder-free dishes were further prepared from chitosan, chitosan-hyaluronan, silk fibroin, and polyurethane (PU1 and PU2) two-dimensional substrates. The iPSCs cultured on the chitosan substrates showed a higher proliferation rate without losing the stemness feature. Among the different materials, PU2 could be prepared as a thermoresponsive hydrogel, which was a potential ink for 3D bioprinting. The iPSCs cultured on PU2 substrates well survived when further embedded in PU2 hydrogel. Moreover, PU2 hydrogel printed with iPSCs remained structural integrity. The use of PU2 hydrogel to embed iPSCs reduced the injury to iPSCs by shear stress. These results indicate that iPSCs could be expanded on chitosan or PU2 membranes without the feeder layer and then printed in PU2 hydrogel. The combination of these steps could offer a new possibility for future applications of iPSC-based 3D bioprinting in tissue engineering.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "4D Biofabrication Using Shape-Morphing Hydrogels.", "abstract": "Despite the tremendous potential of bioprinting techniques toward the fabrication of highly complex biological structures and the flourishing progress in 3D bioprinting, the most critical challenge of the current approaches is the printing of hollow tubular structures. In this work, an advanced 4D biofabrication approach, based on printing of shape-morphing biopolymer hydrogels, is developed for the fabrication of hollow self-folding tubes with unprecedented control over their diameters and architectures at high resolution. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by employing two different biopolymers (alginate and hyaluronic acid) and mouse bone marrow stromal cells. Harnessing the printing and postprinting parameters allows attaining average internal tube diameters as low as 20 \u00b5m, which is not yet achievable by other existing bioprinting/biofabrication approaches and is comparable to the diameters of the smallest blood vessels. The proposed 4D biofabrication process does not pose any negative effect on the viability of the printed cells, and the self-folded hydrogel-based tubes support cell survival for at least 7 d without any decrease in cell viability. Consequently, the presented 4D biofabrication strategy allows the production of dynamically reconfigurable architectures with tunable functionality and responsiveness, governed by the selection of suitable materials and cells.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2017-10-13", "authors": ["AlinaKirillova", "RidgeMaxson", "GeorgiStoychev", "Cheryl TGomillion", "LeonidIonov"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.201703443"}
{"title": "Additive manufactured push-fit implant fixation with screw-strength pull out.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing offers exciting new possibilities for improving long-term metallic implant fixation in bone through enabling open porous structures for bony ingrowth. The aim of this research was to investigate how the technology could also improve initial fixation, a precursor to successful long-term fixation. A new barbed fixation mechanism, relying on flexible struts was proposed and manufactured as a push-fit peg. The technology was optimized using a synthetic bone model and compared with conventional press-fit peg controls tested over a range of interference fits. Optimum designs, achieving maximum pull-out force, were subsequently tested in a cadaveric femoral condyle model. The barbed fixation surface provided more than double the pull-out force for less than a third of the insertion force compared to the best performing conventional press-fit peg (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Indeed, it provided screw-strength pull out from a push-fit device (1,124\u2009\u00b1\u2009146\u2009N). This step change in implant fixation potential offers new capabilities for low profile, minimally invasive implant design, while providing new options to simplify surgery, allowing for one-piece push-fit components with high levels of initial stability. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

For their biologically relevant applications, conductive biomaterials capable of intimate cellular interactions are highly desired. However, conventional methods to incorporate biomolecules into conductive polymers do not offer fine and easy control over the surface density of the biomolecules and/or their stability. We present a novel method to electrochemically immobilize cell-adhesive Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) ligands on PPy electrode surfaces with a simple control over the peptide surface density by varying the electrodeposition time. Synthesized pyrrole-GGGRGDS conjugates were electrochemically incorporated onto the surfaces of PPy-coated electrodes. The electrochemical impedances of the RGD-grafted PPy electrodes were not significantly different from the unmodified PPy films. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the RGD motif on the surface of the modified electrodes. In vitro studies with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) showed higher adhesion and faster proliferation of hMSCs on the PPy with a higher RGD density. This facile electrochemical modification of electrode surfaces allowed for a good control over the peptide surface density and cellular interactions and will benefit the fabrication of cell-interactive scaffolds or bio-electrodes.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-10-12", "authors": ["Lindy KJang", "SeminKim", "JiwonSeo", "JaeYoung Lee"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa92a2"}

However, several parameters influence the applicability bioprinting and there is scarce data in the literature characterising HAMC. We assessed eight concentrations of HAMC for printability, swelling and stability over time, rheological and structural behaviour, and viability of mesenchymal stem cells. We show that HAMC blends behave as viscous solutions at 4\u00b0C and have faster gelation times at higher temperatures, typically gelling upon reaching 37\u00b0C. We found the storage, loss and compressive moduli to be dependent on HAMC concentration and incubation time at 37\u00b0C, and show the compressive modulus to be strain-rate dependent. Swelling and stability was influenced by time, more so than pH environment. We demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell viability was above 75% in bioprinted structures and cells remain viable for at least one week after 3D bioprinting. The mechanical properties of HAMC are highly tuneable and we show that higher concentrations of HAMC are particularly suited to cell-encapsulated 3D bioprinting applications that require scaffold structure and delivery of cells.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2017-10-11", "authors": ["NicholasLaw", "BrandonDoney", "HayleyGlover", "YahuaQin", "Zachary MAman", "Timothy BSercombe", "Lawrence JLiew", "Rodney JDilley", "Barry JDoyle"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.09.031"}
{"title": "Case report of asthma associated with 3D printing.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing is being increasingly used in manufacturing and by small business entrepreneurs and home hobbyists. Exposure to airborne emissions during 3D printing raises the issue of whether there may be adverse health effects associated with these emissions.\nWe present a case of a worker who developed asthma while using 3D printers, which illustrates that respiratory problems may be associated with 3D printer emissions.\nThe patient was a 28-year-old self-employed businessman with a past history of asthma in childhood, which had resolved completely by the age of eight. He started using 10 fused deposition modelling 3D printers with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene filaments in a small work area of approximately 3000 cubic feet. Ten days later, he began to experience recurrent chest tightness, shortness of breath and coughing at work. After 3 months, his work environment was modified by reducing the number of printers, changing to polylactic acid filaments and using an air purifier with an high-efficiency particulate air filter and organic cartridge. His symptoms improved gradually, although he still needed periodic treatment with a salbutamol inhaler. While still symptomatic, a methacholine challenge indicated a provocation concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) of 4 mg/ml, consistent with mild asthma. Eventually, his symptoms resolved completely and a second methacholine challenge after symptom resolution was normal (PC20 > 16 mg/ml).\nThis case indicates that workers may develop respiratory problems, including asthma when using 3D printers.

Rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (ISO) are first line combination drugs for treatment of tuberculosis (TB) that negatively interact with each other upon simultaneous release in acidic environment. The dcDUs were designed in silico by computer aided design (CAD) and fabricated in two steps; first three-dimensional (3D) printing of the outer structure, followed by hot-melt extrusion (HME) of the drug-containing filaments. The structure of the fabricated dcDUs was visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The 3D printed compartmentalized shells were loaded with filaments containing active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and selectively sealed to modulate drug dissolution. The drug release profile of the dcDUs was characterized by pH-transfer dissolution in vitro and pharmacokinetics studies in rats, and resulted in modified release of the APIs from the dcDUs as compared to the free filaments. Furthermore, the selective physical sealing of the compartments resulted in an effective retardation of the in vitro API release.

Ambient air was used as a carrier gas in the gas chromatographic system. The flow rate was fixed to 10 sccm. It was generated through a mini-pump connected in series with a mass flow controller. The metal oxide gas sensor is discussed with its limitation in ambient air. The results show the chromatogram obtained from metal oxide gas sensor has low stability, drifts, and has uncertain peaks, while the chromatogram from the electrochemical sensor is stable and precise. Furthermore, ethylene gas measurements at higher ppb concentration and at lower ppb concentration were demonstrated with the electrochemical ethylene gas sensor. The system separates ethylene gas and humidity. The chromatograms obtained from the system are stable, and the results are 1.2% repeatable in five similar measurements.

{"title": "Bone matrix production in hydroxyapatite-modified hydrogels suitable for bone bioprinting.", "abstract": "Though bioprinting is a forward-looking approach in bone tissue engineering, the development of bioinks which are on the one hand processable with the chosen printing technique, and on the other hand possess the relevant mechanical as well as osteoconductive features remains a challenge. In the present study, polymer solutions based on methacrylated gelatin and methacrylated hyaluronic acid modified with hydroxyapatite (HAp) particles (5 wt%) were prepared. Encapsulation of primary human adipose-derived stem cells in the HAp-containing gels and culture for 28 d resulted in a storage moduli significantly increased to 126%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6% compared to the value on day 1 by the sole influence of the HAp. Additional use of osteogenic media components resulted in an increase of storage module up to 199%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027.8%. Similarly, the loss moduli was increased to 370%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0122.1% under the influence of osteogenic media components and HAp. Those changes in rheological material characteristics indicate a distinct change in elastic and viscous hydrogel properties, and are attributed to extensive matrix production in the hydrogels by the encapsulated cells, what could also be proven by staining of bone matrix components like collagen I, fibronectin, alkaline phosphatase and osteopontin. When using the cell-laden polymer solutions as bioinks to build up relevant geometries, the ink showed excellent printability and the printed grid structure's integrity remained intact over a culture time of 28 d. Again, an intense matrix formation as well as upregulation of osteogenic markers by the encapsulated cells could be shown. In conclusion, we demonstrated that our HAp-containing bioinks and hydrogels on basis of methacrylated gelatin and hyaluronic acid are on the one hand highly suitable for the build-up of relevant three-dimensional geometries with microextrusion bioprinting, and on the other hand exhibit a significant positive effect on bone matrix development and remodeling in the hydrogels, as indicated by rheological measurements and staining of bone components.

Critical developments are required in the supporting areas of measurement and in process inspection to achieve this. CM247LC is a nickel superalloy that is of interest for use in aerospace and civil power plants. However, it is difficult to process via selective laser melting (SLM) as it suffers from cracking during rapid cooling and solidification. This limits the viability of CM247LC parts created using SLM. To quantify part integrity, spatially resolved acoustic spectroscopy (SRAS) has been identified as a viable non-destructive evaluation technique. In this study, a combination of optical microscopy and SRAS was used to identify and classify the surface defects present in SLM-produced parts. By analysing the datasets and scan trajectories, it is possible to correlate morphological information with process parameters. Image processing was used to quantify porosity and cracking for bulk density measurement. Analysis of surface acoustic wave data showed that an error in manufacture in the form of an overscan occurred.

By printing sacrificial patterns on the substrate using the 3D printing approach and subsequently covering them with PDMS prepolymer, PDMS slices with modular structures were obtained, each with specific functions. By combining different PDMS slices with specific modular structures and other functional components, such as membranes and scaffolds, the conceptual design was efficiently converted into complete integrated microfluidic chips.

The success of tissue engineering or cell interactions mainly depends on the fabrication of well-defined microstructures, which ought to be biocompatible for cell proliferation. Femtosecond-laser-based 3D printing is one of the solution candidates that can be used to manufacture 3D tissue scaffolds through computer-aided design (CAD) which can be efficiently engineered to mimic the microenvironment of tissues. UV-based lithography has also been used for constructing the cellular scaffolds but the toxicity of UV light to the cells has prevented its application to the direct patterning of the cells in the scaffold. Although the mask-based lithography has provided a high resolution, it has only enabled 2D patterning not arbitrary 3D printing with design flexibility. Femtosecond-laser-based 3D printing is trending in the area of tissue engineering and cell biology applications due to the formation of well-defined micro- and submicrometer structures via visible and near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser pulses, followed by the fabrication of cell scaffold microstructures with a high precision. Laser direct writing and multiphoton polymerization are being used for fabricating the cell scaffolds, The implication of spatial light modulators in the interference lithography to generate the digital hologram will be the future prospective of mask-based lithography. Polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEG-DA), ormocomp, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETTA) have been fabricated through TPP to generate the cell scaffolds, whereas SU-8 was used to fabricate the microrobots for targeted drug delivery.

The results of metagenomic analysis revealed that the microbial community on the bio-carriers experienced a continuous succession in its structure and dominant species along with the operational time. The formed coupling biofilm created suitable micro multi-habitats for the co-existence of these microorganisms, including nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, which were beneficial to the removing of organic pollutants and converting nutrients.

This study used patient-specific 3D-printed molds derived from computed tomography and cryogel scaffold fabrication as a proof of concept for the creation of site-specific implants for bone reconstruction. Cryogel scaffolds are unique tissue-engineered constructs formed at sub-zero temperatures. When thawed, the resulting structure is macroporous, sponge-like, and mechanically durable. Due to these unique properties, cryogels have excellent potential for the treatment of patient-specific bone defects; however, there is little literature on their use in cleft-craniofacial defects. While 3D-printing technology currently lacks the spatial resolution to print the microstructure necessary for bone regeneration, it can be used to create site-specific molds. Thus, it is ideal to integrate these techniques for the fabrication of scaffolds with patient-specific geometry. Overall, all cryogels possessed appropriate geometry to allow for cell infiltration after 28 days. Additionally, suitable mechanical durability was demonstrated where, despite mold geometry, all cryogels could be compressed without exhibiting crack propagation. Such a patient-specific scaffold would be ideal in pediatric cleft-craniofacial defects, as these are complex 3D defects and children have less donor bone availability.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2017-10-06", "authors": ["Katherine RHixon", "Alexa MMelvin", "Alexander YLin", "Andrew FHall", "Scott ASell"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328217734824"}

The viability of Si nanowires (NWs) as the active material for \u03c5-NWFETs in HNN is explored through modeling and demonstrated by fabricating the first device. Using \u03c5-NWFETs to realize HNNs is an interesting approach as by printing NWs on large area flexible substrates it will be possible to develop a bendable tactile skin with distributed neural elements (for local data processing, as in biological skin) in the backplane. The modeling and simulation of \u03c5-NWFET based devices show that the overlapping areas between individual gates and the floating gate determines the initial synaptic weights of the neural network - thus validating the working of \u03c5-NWFETs as the building block for HNN. The simulation has been further extended to \u03c5-NWFET based circuits and neuronal computation system and this has been validated by interfacing it with a transparent tactile skin prototype (comprising of 6 \u00d7 6 ITO based capacitive tactile sensors array) integrated on the palm of a 3D printed robotic hand.

Conventional printing methods deposit conductive materials \"on\" or \"inside\" a rubber substrate. The conductors made by such printing methods cannot be used as device electrodes because of the large surface topology, poor stretchability, or weak adhesion between the substrate and the conducting material. Here, a method is presented by which conductive materials are printed in the way of being surface-embedded in the rubber substrate; hence, the conductors can be widely used as device electrodes and circuits. The printing process involves a direct printing of a metal precursor solution in a block-copolymer rubber substrate and chemical reduction of the precursor into metal nanoparticles. The electrical conductivity and sensitivity to the mechanical deformation can be controlled by adjusting the number of printing operations. The fabrication of highly sensitive vibration sensors is thus presented, which can detect weak pulses and sound waves. In addition, this work takes advantage of the viscoelasticity of the composite conductor to fabricate highly conductive stretchable circuits for complicated 3D structures.

{"title": "3D Printed Pericardium Hydrogels To Promote Wound Healing in Vascular Applications.", "abstract": "Vascular grafts that can support total replacement and maintenance by the body of the injured vessel would improve outcomes of major surgical reconstructions. Building scaffolds using components of the native vessel can encourage biological recognition by native cells as well as mimic mechanical characteristics of the native vessel. Evidence is emerging that incorporating predetermined building-blocks into a tissue engineering scaffold may oversimplify the environment and ignore critical structures and binding sites essential to development at the implant. We propose the development of a 3D-printable and degradable hybrid scaffold by combining polyethylene glycol (PEG)acrylate and homogenized pericardium matrix (HPM) to achieve appropriate biological environment as well as structural support. It was hypothesized that incorporation of HPM into PEG hydrogels would affect modulus of the scaffold and that the modulus and biological component would reduce the inflammatory signals produced from arriving macrophages and nearby endothelial cells. HPM was found to provide a number of tissue specific structural proteins including collagen, fibronectin, and glycosaminoglycans. HPM and PEGacrylate formed a hybrid hydrogel with significantly distinct modulus depending on concentration of either component, which resulted in scaffolds with stiffness between 0.5 and 20 kPa. The formed hybrid hydrogel was confirmed through a reduction in primary amines post-cross-linking. Using these hybrid scaffolds, rat bone marrow derived macrophages developed an M2 phenotype in response to low amounts (0.03%, w/v) of HPM in culture but responded with inflammatory phenotypes to high concentrations (0.3%, w/v). When cultured together with endothelial cells, both M1 and M2 macrophages were detected, along with a combination of both inflammatory and healing cytokines. However, the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 was significantly (p < 0.05) lower with hybrid hydrogels compared to single component PEG or HPM hydrogels. This reduction in inflammatory cytokines could impact the healing environment that persists at the implantation site. Finally, using this developed hybrid hydrogel, models of neonatal vasculature were manufactured using digital light projection (DLP) 3D printing. The structural control achieved with this novel biomaterial suggests a promising new tool in vascular graft development and research, with potential for complex structures for use in congenital heart defect reconstruction.", "journal": "Biomacromolecules", "date": "2017-10-05", "authors": ["Laura GBracaglia", "MichaelMessina", "ShiraWinston", "Che-YingKuo", "MaxLerman", "John PFisher"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.biomac.7b01165"}

{"title": "Assessing bioink shape fidelity to aid material development in 3D bioprinting.", "abstract": "During extrusion-based bioprinting, the deposited bioink filaments are subjected to deformations, such as collapse of overhanging filaments, which compromises the ability to stack several layers of bioink, and fusion between adjacent filaments, which compromises the resolution and maintenance of a desired pore structure. When developing new bioinks, approaches to assess their shape fidelity after printing would be beneficial to evaluate the degree of deformation of the deposited filament and to estimate how similar the final printed construct would be to the design. However, shape fidelity has been prevalently assessed qualitatively through visual inspection after printing, hampering the direct comparison of the printability of different bioinks. In this technical note, we propose a quantitative evaluation for shape fidelity of bioinks based on testing the filament collapse on overhanging structures and the filament fusion of parallel printed strands. Both tests were applied on a hydrogel platform based on poloxamer 407 and poly(ethylene glycol) blends, providing a library of hydrogels with different yield stresses. The presented approach is an easy way to assess bioink shape fidelity, applicable to any filament-based bioprinting system and able to quantitatively evaluate this aspect of printability, based on the degree of deformation of the printed filament. In addition, we built a simple theoretical model that relates filament collapse with bioink yield stress. The results of both shape fidelity tests underline the role of yield stress as one of the parameters influencing the printability of a bioink. The presented quantitative evaluation will allow for reproducible comparisons between different bioink platforms.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-10-05", "authors": ["ARibeiro", "M MBlokzijl", "RLevato", "C WVisser", "MCastilho", "W EHennink", "TVermonden", "JMalda"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa90e2"}

Ultimately, advances in three-dimensional bioprinting technology would contribute to the design of new devices and medical tools with thermal stimuli response needs, fabricated with PNIPAAm hydrogels.", "journal": "Gels (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-10-04", "authors": ["SoniaLanzalaco", "ElaineArmelin"], "doi": "10.3390/gels3040036\n10.1021/acsami.5b07913\n10.1021/la703597a\n10.1021/am503200p\n10.1016/j.addr.2006.09.020\n10.1039/C2CS35191A\n10.1038/nmat2614\n10.1002/anie.201402641\n10.1039/b611405a\n10.1063/1.472252\n10.1039/c3cs60058k\n10.3390/gels1020135\n10.1039/C4TC00271G\n10.1039/C6TA01846G\n10.1016/0079-6700(92)90023-R\n10.1002/adem.200700355\n10.1039/c3cs35499g\n10.1002/adma.200601019\n10.1021/ma102786q\n10.1021/ja303841f\n10.1021/ja507626y\n10.1039/C5TB02735G\n10.1002/adfm.201100871\n10.1021/bm2013982\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.04.028\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.08.033\n10.1080/10601326808051910\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.06.008\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.01.004\n10.1021/ja809475a\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.08.058\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.04.055\n10.1021/ja9019935\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/30/305101\n10.1002/adma.200904075\n10.1021/cm903357q\n10.1039/c1sm05109a\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.10.040\n10.1021/nn300303q\n10.1002/adfm.201201020\n10.1021/cm401115b\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.067\n10.1021/bm4018963\n10.1002/adma.201405166\n10.1002/marc.201500079\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.09.033\n10.1021/am508161q\n10.1155/2016/5356371\n10.1021/acsami.5b09822\n10.1039/C6TB03385G\n10.3390/polym9040119\n10.1016/j.msec.2017.08.047\n10.1021/ma971005s\n10.1021/ja063990i\n10.1016/j.ajps.2014.08.010\n10.3390/gels3010004\n10.1016/S0032-3861(98)00872-6\n10.1021/jp0124903\n10.1016/j.vibspec.2008.10.003\n10.1016/S0032-3861(97)01024-0\n10.1021/acs.biomac.7b00934\n10.1021/ja003889s\n10.1021/ma801982e\n10.1021/ma102695n\n10.1039/c2sm06883d\n10.1021/ma00210a048\n10.1021/ma00004a022\n10.1021/ma000527w\n10.3390/ijms10093722\n10.1021/ma5000927\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.05.075\n10.1002/app.40733\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.050\n10.1021/mz200121k\n10.1039/C6RA03045A\n10.1002/jbm.a.34380\n10.1021/bm5010004\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.07.043\n10.1038/42218\n10.1039/C1CS15203C\n10.1007/s10047-004-0265-9\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.01.051\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2007.05.009\n10.1021/acsami.5b02975\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2007.01.006\n10.1021/ja00125a035\n10.1021/cr940534g\n10.1021/ma00109a056\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2006.11.002\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.08.001\n10.1021/ma3001719\n10.1021/bk-2012-1100.ch01\n10.1002/marc.201100349\n10.1021/bm100318z\n10.1021/ma9804951\n10.1039/c0jm00338g\n10.1166/jnn.2013.7532\n10.1039/C5TB00468C\n10.1002/pola.23607\n10.1021/acsami.6b01374\n10.1021/acsami.6b04932\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.04.073\n10.3390/ma6041285\n10.1016/j.carres.2009.11.014\n10.1002/pi.2929\n10.1007/s11705-013-1355-0\n10.1208/s12249-012-9838-8\n10.1007/s11095-011-0380-2\n10.1021/am507142f\n10.1039/C6NR04948F\n10.1021/ma9013803\n10.1002/marc.201000333\n10.1021/nn3053457\n10.1007/s11426-013-5051-1\n10.1088/1748-6041/11/2/022002\n10.1016/j.ejpb.2014.07.005\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.100\n10.1088/1748-6041/11/3/035006\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.07.007\n10.1021/jp105556e\n10.1039/C7SM00206H\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.03.004\n10.18063/IJB.2015.01.005\n10.1115/1.4028512\n10.1039/C3NR06497B\n10.1039/C4NR04471A\n10.18063/IJB.2016.01.003\n10.1186/s13036-015-0001-4\n10.1016/j.polymer.2003.12.012\n10.1021/ma400535r"}
{"title": "3D Printed Molds Encompassing Carbon Composite Electrodes To Conduct Multisite Monitoring in the Entire Colon.", "abstract": "The activity of the colon is regulated by chemical signaling, of which serotonin (5-HT) is a key transmitter. Monitoring of mucosal 5-HT overflow has been achieved to date using microelectrodes on a small segment of colonic tissue; however, little is known if such measurements are reflective with regards to 5-HT signaling from the entire colon. This study focused on developing an electrochemical array device that could be utilized to conduct multisite measurements of 5-HT overflow from the entire colon. A 3D printed mold was fabricated that could house 6 multiwall carbon nanotube composite electrodes and provide a fixed distance between the electrodes and the tissue along the entire length of the colon. The electrodes were assessed for sensitivity, stability, and crosstalk before conducting in vitro measurements using colons obtained from 6- and 24-month old mice. As composite electrodes can have a high degree of variability, normalization factors were required between electrodes for a given array. The device had the sensitivity and stability required for 5-HT measurements from intestinal tissue. Regio-specific changes in 5-HT overflow were observed with age, where increases in 5-HT overflow were observed in the distal colon due to an impairment/loss in the serotonin transporter (SERT). Our strategy can be utilized to develop arrays of varying sizes and geometries, which can offer practical solutions for large-scale tissue measurements.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2017-10-04", "authors": ["NiravPatel", "AidanFagan-Murphy", "DerekCovill", "Bhavik AnilPatel"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.7b03148"}
{"title": "Antimicrobial Peptides in Biomedical Device Manufacturing.", "abstract": "Over the past decades the use of medical devices, such as catheters, artificial heart valves, prosthetic joints, and other implants, has grown significantly. Despite continuous improvements in device design, surgical procedures, and wound care, biomaterial-associated infections (BAI) are still a major problem in modern medicine. Conventional antibiotic treatment often fails due to the low levels of antibiotic at the site of infection. The presence of biofilms on the biomaterial and/or the multidrug-resistant phenotype of the bacteria further impair the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Removal of the biomaterial is then the last option to control the infection. Clearly, there is a pressing need for alternative strategies to prevent and treat BAI. Synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered promising candidates as they are active against a broad spectrum of (antibiotic-resistant) planktonic bacteria and biofilms. Moreover, bacteria are less likely to develop resistance to these rapidly-acting peptides. In this review we highlight the four main strategies, three of which applying AMPs, in biomedical device manufacturing to prevent BAI. The first involves modification of the physicochemical characteristics of the surface of implants. Immobilization of AMPs on surfaces of medical devices with a variety of chemical techniques is essential in the second strategy. The main disadvantage of these two strategies relates to the limited antibacterial effect in the tissue surrounding the implant. This limitation is addressed by the third strategy that releases AMPs from a coating in a controlled fashion. Lastly, AMPs can be integrated in the design and manufacturing of additively manufactured/3D-printed implants, owing to the physicochemical characteristics of the implant material and the versatile manufacturing technologies compatible with antimicrobials incorporation. These novel technologies utilizing AMPs will contribute to development of novel and safe antimicrobial medical devices, reducing complications and associated costs of device infection.", "journal": "Frontiers in chemistry", "date": "2017-10-04", "authors": ["MartijnRiool", "Annade Breij", "Jan WDrijfhout", "Peter HNibbering", "Sebastian A JZaat"], "doi": "10.3389/fchem.2017.00063\n10.1007/s10856-013-5131-y\n10.1016/j.injury.2016.12.011\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.11.012\n10.1097/00003246-199903000-00028\n10.1128/AAC.01254-08\n10.1002/biof.1225\n10.1002/adma.201001215\n10.1086/315369\n10.1086/315344\n10.1128/IAI.68.12.6924-6931.2000\n10.1371/journal.pone.0178943\n10.1086/595011\n10.1002/jbm.a.31528\n10.1128/IAI.00849-09\n10.1016/j.archoralbio.2009.03.004\n10.1080/00365540500277292\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3004528\n10.1042/bst0300194\n10.3390/ijms140918488\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.063\n10.1371/journal.pone.0111579\n10.1007/s10856-017-5885-8\n10.1021/acsami.6b16779\n10.1007/s11999-015-4301-2\n10.1136/pmj.76.898.479\n10.1021/mz5001465\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.11.005\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.028\n10.1126/science.284.5418.1318\n10.1056/NEJMra035415\n10.2106/00004623-200704000-00014\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.12.003\n10.1002/jbmr.3055\n10.1021/acsami.6b15859\n10.1080/08927014.2015.1021340\n10.1080/08927014.2015.1129533\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.03.027\n10.1166/jbn.2013.1553\n10.1128/mBio.02340-14\n10.1515/bmc-2015-0035\n10.1016/j.msec.2016.11.035\n10.1038/nrmicro.2017.42\n10.1038/nbt.2572\n10.1007/s00402-011-1321-6\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.02.013\n10.1021/bm2009697\n10.1038/nature18442\n10.1021/bm501528x\n10.2174/1568026616666160713143331\n10.1126/science.3629258\n10.1111/wrr.12211\n10.1073/pnas.91.21.9765\n10.1038/nbt1267\n10.1126/science.aaf4268\n10.4049/jimmunol.1402689\n10.4049/jimmunol.1303408\n10.1016/j.chembiol.2008.11.006\n10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02747.x\n10.1021/acsami.7b03127\n10.22203/eCM.v030a16\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2016.06.054\n10.1002/jor.20193\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.08.035\n10.1002/jbm.b.32701\n10.1021/acsami.7b06899\n10.1016/j.peptides.2013.06.001\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.007\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2010.09.036\n10.1074/jbc.275.27.20374\n10.1128/AAC.02934-15\n10.1074/jbc.M111.248641\n10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.162\n10.1002/jbm.b.33079\n10.2147/IJN.S128775\n10.1002/jbm.a.35511\n10.1021/acsami.5b11949\n10.1016/S8756-3282(03)00050-4\n10.1002/jbm.a.33251\n10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03570.x\n10.1002/psc.2708\n10.1016/j.it.2014.07.004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0145143\n10.1016/j.injury.2015.09.028\n10.1002/jor.20808\n10.1128/AAC.06335-11\n10.1128/AAC.44.7.1803-1808.2000\n10.1038/jid.2011.387\n10.1016/j.actbio.2009.05.010\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.07.005\n10.1093/jac/dkn395\n10.1016/j.peptides.2005.09.016\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.11.034\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.05.089\n10.1021/acs.biomac.6b01721\n10.1099/0022-1317-50-7-582\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2010.08.012\n10.1016/j.jhin.2005.06.030\n10.1038/nrmicro2182\n10.1128/IAI.00318-08\n10.3109/07388551.2011.594423\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.01.035\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.051\n10.1086/533452\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.08.012\n10.1002/adfm.201606623\n10.22203/eCM.v033a11\n10.7326/0003-4819-143-8-200510180-00007\n10.1128/AAC.48.8.3112-3118.2004\n10.1097/00005792-200211000-00007\n10.1128/AAC.50.1.55-61.2006\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.113.301851\n10.1038/srep16336\n10.2741/s453\n10.1021/acsami.6b03454\n10.1097/00003086-198711000-00005\n10.1007/s00249-011-0682-7\n10.1016/j.fct.2015.08.013\n10.1128/AAC.02859-14\n10.1093/infdis/116.3.257\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.07.029\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.020\n10.1007/s10856-015-5389-3\n10.1007/s12010-013-0461-2\n10.1086/656047\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.030\n10.1039/C5NR00767D\n10.1016/j.joms.2014.01.007\n10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.02.001\n10.1021/acsami.5b03697\n10.3390/ijms17111892\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.11.047\n10.1007/s11837-015-1350-7\n10.2217/fmb.10.89\n10.1038/415389a\n10.1371/journal.pone.0067649\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.03.008\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.05.020\n10.1016/j.berh.2006.08.003\n10.1007/s00281-011-0275-7\n10.1056/NEJMra040181\n10.1093/infdis/146.4.487"}

The effects of the large in-built dislocation density, surface roughness and build atmosphere on mechanical and damage properties are discussed using steels.

Five groups of 15 inlays were obtained through conventional impression and manual wax pattern (group CICW); conventional impression, laboratory scanning of the stone die, CAD-CAM milled wax blanks (group CIDW) or 3D printed wax patterns (group CI3DW); and scanning of the master preparation with intraoral scanner and CAD-CAM milled (group DSDW) or 3D printed wax patterns (group DS3DW). The same design was used to produce the wax patterns in the last 4 groups. The replica technique was used to measure marginal and internal adaptation by using stereomicroscopy. Mixed-model ANOVA was used to assess differences according to the groups and discrepancy location (\u03b1=.05).\nGroup DSDW showed the smallest marginal discrepancy (24.3 \u03bcm) compared with those of groups CICW (45.1 \u03bcm), CIDW (33.7 \u03bcm), CI3DW (39.8 \u03bcm), and DS3DW (39.7 \u03bcm) (P<.001).

The internal discrepancy was significantly larger than the marginal discrepancy within all groups (P<.001).\nLithium disilicate glass-ceramic inlays produced from digital scans and subtractive milling of wax patterns resulted in better marginal and internal fit accuracy than either conventional impression/fabrication or additive 3D manufacturing.

At present, no sensitive portable devices are available for the rapid monitoring of such contamination. Here, we propose a cell-based mobile platform that exploits a newly developed bioluminescent yeast-estrogen screen (nanoYES) and a low-cost compact camera as light detector. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were genetically engineered with a yeast codon-optimized variant of NanoLuc luciferase (yNLucP) under the regulation of human estrogen receptor \u03b1 activation. Ready-to-use 3D-printed cartridges with immobilized cells were prepared by optimizing a new procedure that enables to produce alginate slices with good reproducibility. A portable device was obtained exploiting a compact camera and wireless connectivity enabling a rapid and quantitative evaluation (1-h incubation at room temperature) of total estrogenic activity in small sample volumes (50\u00a0\u03bcL) with a LOD of 0.08\u00a0nM for 17\u03b2-estradiol. The developed portable analytical platform was applied for the evaluation of water samples spiked with different chemicals known to have estrogen-like activity. Thanks to the high sensitivity of the newly developed yeast biosensor and the possibility to wireless connect the camera with any smartphone model, the developed configuration is more versatile than previously reported smartphone-based devices, and could find application for on-site analysis of endocrine disruptors.

Our results showed that the cluster size of focal adhesions increased as the stiffness of the micropillar arrays increased, but it was insensitive to the elastic modulus of the protein micropillars that is one of the intrinsic material properties.

We provide a refined method for building scalable pore-network models (\"proxies\") using stereolithography 3D printing that can be used in repeated flow experiments (e.g., core flooding, permeametry, porosimetry). Typically, this workflow involves two steps, model design and 3D printing. In this study, we explore how the addition of post-processing and validation can reduce uncertainty in the 3D-printed proxy accuracy (difference of proxy geometry from the digital model). Post-processing is a multi-step cleaning of porous proxies involving pressurized ethanol flushing and oven drying. Proxies are validated by: (1) helium porosimetry and (2) digital measurements of porosity from thin-section images of 3D-printed proxies. 3D printer resolution was determined by measuring the smallest open channel in 3D-printed \"gap test\" wafers. This resolution (400\u00a0\u00b5m) was insufficient to build porosity of Fontainebleau sandstone (\u223c13%) from computed tomography data at the sample's natural scale, so proxies were printed at 15-, 23-, and 30-fold magnifications to validate the workflow. Helium porosities of the 3D-printed proxies differed from digital calculations by up to 7% points. Results improved after pressurized flushing with ethanol (e.g., porosity difference reduced to \u223c1% point), though uncertainties remain regarding the nature of sub-micron \"artifact\" pores imparted by the 3D printing process.

Additive manufacturing or 3D printing consists of a wide range of techniques classified in many categories but only three of them are mostly used in the 3D printing of medicines: printing-based inkjet systems, nozzle-based deposition systems, and laser-based writing systems.

{"title": "3D Bioprinting and In Vitro Cardiovascular Tissue Modeling.", "abstract": "Numerous microfabrication approaches have been developed to recapitulate morphologically and functionally organized tissue microarchitectures in vitro; however, the technical and operational limitations remain to be overcome. 3D printing technology facilitates the building of a construct containing biomaterials and cells in desired organizations and shapes that have physiologically relevant geometry, complexity, and micro-environmental cues. The selection of biomaterials for 3D printing is considered one of the most critical factors to achieve tissue function. It has been reported that some printable biomaterials, having extracellular matrix-like intrinsic microenvironment factors, were capable of regulating stem cell fate and phenotype. In particular, this technology can control the spatial positions of cells, and provide topological, chemical, and complex cues, allowing neovascularization and maturation in the engineered cardiovascular tissues. This review will delineate the state-of-the-art 3D bioprinting techniques in the field of cardiovascular tissue engineering and their applications in translational medicine. In addition, this review will describe 3D printing-based pre-vascularization technologies correlated with implementing blood perfusion throughout the engineered tissue equivalent. The described engineering method may offer a unique approach that results in the physiological mimicry of human cardiovascular tissues to aid in drug development and therapeutic approaches.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-09-28", "authors": ["JinahJang"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering4030071\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000485\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3005503\n10.1038/nature06800\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176826\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303614\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.086074\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000034046.87607.1C\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000043246.74879.CD\n10.1161/01.RES.0000147315.71699.51\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61590-0\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60195-0\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2016.01.003\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00092-5\n10.1038/nm1391\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.734103\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.07.041\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.10.026\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.1038/nature13233\n10.1038/nprot.2016.153\n10.1038/ncomms10312\n10.1093/cvr/cvx125\n10.1016/j.celrep.2016.10.026\n10.1038/nbt.3745\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.02.013\n10.1038/nature09005\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.01.009\n10.1038/nrd1108\n10.15252/emmm.201606260\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0314\n10.1038/428138a\n10.1038/nprot.2009.155\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aah5505\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.08.068\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.10.026\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.043\n10.1088/1758-5082/6/2/024103\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0584\n10.1073/pnas.0507681102\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.12.011\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1016/j.drudis.2012.10.003\n10.1016/j.copbio.2012.01.011\n10.1002/adma.201302042\n10.1007/s10439-016-1607-5\n10.1039/C5TB00637F\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.83\n10.1177/0883911507079451\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.09.023\n10.1089/ten.tec.2011.0060\n10.1089/ten.a.2007.0004\n10.1002/adma.201501234\n10.1088/1758-5082/4/3/035005\n10.1002/jbm.a.34420\n10.1073/pnas.1521342113\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045009\n10.1002/term.1682\n10.1088/1758-5090/8/3/035013\n10.1016/j.msec.2015.06.002\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2243912\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.003\n10.1126/science.1144212\n10.1039/b807560c\n10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015008\n10.1063/1.4968845\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.04.050\n10.1088/1758-5082/2/3/032001\n10.1002/bit.20585\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00129\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.026\n10.1371/journal.pone.0038147\n10.1073/pnas.0906504107\n10.1016/j.bpj.2009.08.038\n10.1002/bit.22268\n10.1016/j.msec.2009.02.016\n10.1007/s00418-015-1398-z\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.12.005\n10.1038/nm.3545\n10.1038/nature22330\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.04.019\n10.1126/sciadv.1600502\n10.1038/ncomms4935\n10.1002/adhm.201600483\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs349\n10.1021/nl204064s\n10.1021/nn4002193\n10.1002/adfm.201401300\n10.1021/acsnano.5b01179\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1161/CIRCEP.111.973420\n10.1371/journal.pone.0027417\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.04.005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014998\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0352\n10.1186/scrt348\n10.1161/hh0202.103644\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs203\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237206\n10.1021/acs.biomac.6b01908\n10.1089/ten.tec.2016.0362\n10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/014102\n10.1007/s13770-014-4047-z\n10.1007/s13770-016-9080-7\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2004.03.004\n10.1038/nrd4539\n10.1039/C6LC00450D\n10.1039/C4LC00030G\n10.1073/pnas.1524510113\n10.1038/nmat3357\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.07.006\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.034\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.03.064\n10.1007/s13770-016-9095-0\n10.1007/s13770-013-0391-7\n10.1038/nmat4570\n10.1088/1758-5082/4/2/022001\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.05.083\n10.1002/adma.201004625\n10.1115/1.4024398\n10.1002/adfm.201700798\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.031\n10.1073/pnas.1217796110\n10.1021/nl4007744\n10.1007/s13770-014-0099-3\n10.1038/nmat4782"}

{"title": "3D Printing of Organs-On-Chips.", "abstract": "Organ-on-a-chip engineering aims to create artificial living organs that mimic the complex and physiological responses of real organs, in order to test drugs by precisely manipulating the cells and their microenvironments. To achieve this, the artificial organs should to be microfabricated with an extracellular matrix (ECM) and various types of cells, and should recapitulate morphogenesis, cell differentiation, and functions according to the native organ. A promising strategy is 3D printing, which precisely controls the spatial distribution and layer-by-layer assembly of cells, ECMs, and other biomaterials. Owing to this unique advantage, integration of 3D printing into organ-on-a-chip engineering can facilitate the creation of micro-organs with heterogeneity, a desired 3D cellular arrangement, tissue-specific functions, or even cyclic movement within a microfluidic device. Moreover, fully 3D-printed organs-on-chips more easily incorporate other mechanical and electrical components with the chips, and can be commercialized via automated massive production.

{"title": "Polysaccharide Fabrication Platforms and Biocompatibility Assessment as Candidate Wound Dressing Materials.", "abstract": "Wound dressings are critical for wound care because they provide a physical barrier between the injury site and outside environment, preventing further damage or infection. Wound dressings also manage and even encourage the wound healing process for proper recovery. Polysaccharide biopolymers are slowly becoming popular as modern wound dressings materials because they are naturally derived, highly abundant, inexpensive, absorbent, non-toxic and non-immunogenic. Polysaccharide biopolymers have also been processed into biomimetic platforms that offer a bioactive component in wound dressings that aid the healing process. This review primarily focuses on the fabrication and biocompatibility assessment of polysaccharide materials. Specifically, fabrication platforms such as electrospun fibers and hydrogels, their fabrication considerations and popular polysaccharides such as chitosan, alginate, and hyaluronic acid among emerging options such as arabinoxylan are discussed. A survey of biocompatibility and bioactive molecule release studies, leveraging polysaccharide's naturally derived properties, is highlighted in the text, while challenges and future directions for wound dressing development using emerging fabrication techniques such as 3D bioprinting are outlined in the conclusion.

The control group received routine surgery, and the simulation models of the intracranial aneurysm in trial group was printed using a 3D printer using the imaging data from 3D-CTA. Using the simulation model, the surgery was designed and planned before operation (including surgical approaches and placement of clips) and simulation surgery was also conducted. The coincidence rates between preoperative and intraoperative findings of the intracranial aneurysms on 3D-CTA were compared. CT scan was performed at 1 and 3 days after the operation to detect potential cerebral infarction or bleeding associated with the operation; CTA was performed both at the same time and at 3-6 months after the operation to detect stenosis, occlusion and aneurysm clipping. The patients were followed up for 3-6 months to assess the outcomes using Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).\nThe preoperative 3D-CTA findings were basically consistent with the intraoperative findings in all the 60 patients. Nine patients in the control group and 2 patients in the trial group had short-term adverse operation events; 11 patients in control group and 4 patients in trial group had long-term adverse events; 18 patients in control group and 25 patients in trial group had good neurologic function.

{"title": "Patient-specific bolus for range shifter air gap reduction in intensity-modulated proton therapy of head-and-neck cancer studied with Monte Carlo based plan optimization.", "abstract": "Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) of superficial lesions requires pre-absorbing range shifter (RS) to deliver the more shallow spots. RS air gap minimization is important to avoid spot size degradation, but remains challenging in complex geometries such as in head-and-neck cancer (HNC). In this study, clinical endpoints were investigated for patient-specific bolus and for conventional RS solutions, making use of a Monte Carlo (MC) dose engine for IMPT optimization.\nFor 5 oropharyngeal cancer patients, IMPT spot maps were generated using beamlets calculated with MC. The plans were optimized for three different RS configurations: 3D printed on-skin bolus, snout- and nozzle-mounted RS. Organ-at-risk (OAR) doses and late toxicity probabilities were compared between all configuration-specific optimized plans.\nThe use of bolus reduced the mean dose to all OARs compared to snout and nozzle-mounted RS.

{"title": "Monaural Sound Localization Based on Reflective Structure and Homomorphic Deconvolution.", "abstract": "The asymmetric structure around the receiver provides a particular time delay for the specific incoming propagation. This paper designs a monaural sound localization system based on the reflective structure around the microphone. The reflective plates are placed to present the direction-wise time delay, which is naturally processed by convolutional operation with a sound source. The received signal is separated for estimating the dominant time delay by using homomorphic deconvolution, which utilizes the real cepstrum and inverse cepstrum sequentially to derive the propagation response's autocorrelation. Once the localization system accurately estimates the information, the time delay model computes the corresponding reflection for localization. Because of the structure limitation, two stages of the localization process perform the estimation procedure as range and angle. The software toolchain from propagation physics and algorithm simulation realizes the optimal 3D-printed structure. The acoustic experiments in the anechoic chamber denote that 79.0% of the study range data from the isotropic signal is properly detected by the response value, and 87.5% of the specific direction data from the study range signal is properly estimated by the response time.

Here, we report microwave-assisted protein digestion in a plate well, which allows for facile sampling as well as rapid protein digestion based on the combination of highly stable enzyme immobilization and 3D printing technologies. Trypsin (TR) was immobilized on polystyrene-based nanofibers via an enzyme coating (EC) approach. The EC with stabilized TR activity was assembled with the 3D-printed structure in the plate well (EC/3D), which provides two separated compartments for the solution sampling and the TR-catalyzed protein digestion, respectively. EC/3D can effectively prevent the interference of sampling by accommodating EC in the separated compartment from the sampling hole in the middle. EC/3D in the plate well maintained its protein digestion performance under shaking over 160 days. Microwave irradiation enabled the digestion of bovine serum albumin within 10 min, generating the MALDI-TOF MS results of 75.0% sequence coverage and 61 identified peptides.

{"title": "CAD/CAM for scalable nanomanufacturing: A network-based system for hybrid 3D printing.", "abstract": "Micro- and nano-structuring have been highlighted over several decades in both science and engineering fields. In addition to continuous efforts in fabrication techniques, investigations in scalable nanomanufacturing have been pursued to achieve reduced feature size, fewer constraints in terms of materials and dimensional complexity, as well as improved process throughput. In this study, based on recent micro-/nanoscale fabrication processes, characteristics and key requirements for computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems for scalable nanomanufacturing were investigated. Requirements include a process knowledge database, standardized processing, active communication, adaptive interpolation, a consistent coordinate system, and management of peripheral devices. For scalable nanomanufacturing, it is important to consider the flexibility and expandability of each process, because hybrid and bridging processes represent effective ways to expand process capabilities. As an example, we describe a novel CAD/CAM system for hybrid three-dimensional (3D) printing at the nanoscale. This novel hybrid process was developed by bridging aerodynamically focused nanoparticle printing, focused ion beam milling, micromachining, and spin-coating processes. The system developed can print a full 3D structure using various inorganic materials, with a minimum process scale of 50\u2009nm. The most obvious difference versus CAD/CAM at 'conventional' scales is that our system was developed based on a network to promote communication between users and process operators. With the network-based system, it is also possible to narrow the gap among different processes/resources. We anticipate that this approach can contribute to the development of CAD/CAM for scalable nanomanufacturing and a wide range of hybrid processes.", "journal": "Microsystems & nanoengineering", "date": "2017-09-25", "authors": ["Hae-SungYoon", "Hyun-TaekLee", "Ki-HwanJang", "Chung-SooKim", "HyunseoPark", "Dae-WookKim", "KunwooLee", "SangkeeMin", "Sung-HoonAhn"], "doi": "10.1038/micronano.2017.72"}

We have recently reported that 3D printing emissions (3DPE) are complex mixtures, with a large ultrafine particulate matter component. Additionally, we and others have reported that inhalation of xenobiotic particles in this size range is associated with an array of cardiovascular dysfunctions. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 3DPE aerosols via nose-only exposure for ~3h. Twenty-four hours later, intravital microscopy was performed to assess microvascular function in the spinotrapezius muscle. Endothelium-dependent and -independent arteriolar dilation were stimulated by local microiontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). At the time of experiments, animals exposed to 3DPE inhalation presented with a mean arterial pressure of 125\u00b14mmHg, and this was significantly higher than that for the sham-control group (94\u00b13mmHg). Consistent with this pressor response in the 3DPE group, was an elevation of ~12% in resting arteriolar tone. Endothelium-dependent arteriolar dilation was significantly impaired after 3DPE inhalation across all iontophoretic ejection currents (0-27\u00b115%, compared to sham-control: 15-120\u00b121%). Endothelium-independent dilation was not affected by 3DPE inhalation. These alterations in peripheral microvascular resistance and reactivity are consistent with elevations in arterial pressure that follow 3DPE inhalation.

{"title": "Effects of Processing Parameters on Surface Roughness of Additive Manufactured Ti-6Al-4V via Electron Beam Melting.", "abstract": "As one of the powder bed fusion additive manufacturing technologies, electron beam melting (EBM) is gaining more and more attention due to its near-net-shape production capacity with low residual stress and good mechanical properties. These characteristics also allow EBM built parts to be used as produced without post-processing. However, the as-built rough surface introduces a detrimental influence on the mechanical properties of metallic alloys. Thereafter, understanding the effects of processing parameters on the part's surface roughness, in turn, becomes critical. This paper has focused on varying the processing parameters of two types of contouring scanning strategies namely, multispot and non-multispot, in EBM. The results suggest that the beam current and speed function are the most significant processing parameters for non-multispot contouring scanning strategy. While for multispot contouring scanning strategy, the number of spots, spot time, and spot overlap have greater effects than focus offset and beam current. The improved surface roughness has been obtained in both contouring scanning strategies. Furthermore, non-multispot contouring scanning strategy gives a lower surface roughness value and poorer geometrical accuracy than the multispot counterpart under the optimized conditions.

{"title": "Predictive Simulation of Process Windows for Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing: Influence of the Powder Bulk Density.", "abstract": "The resulting properties of parts fabricated by powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes are determined by their porosity, local composition, and microstructure. The objective of this work is to examine the influence of the stochastic powder bed on the process window for dense parts by means of numerical simulation. The investigations demonstrate the unique capability of simulating macroscopic domains in the range of millimeters with a mesoscopic approach, which resolves the powder bed and the hydrodynamics of the melt pool. A simulated process window reveals the influence of the stochastic powder layer. The numerical results are verified with an experimental process window for selective electron beam-melted Ti-6Al-4V. Furthermore, the influence of the powder bulk density is investigated numerically. The simulations predict an increase in porosity and surface roughness for samples produced with lower powder bulk densities. Due to its higher probability for unfavorable powder arrangements, the process stability is also decreased.

Hence, we developed a high flow rate, surfactant-free, wash-less method to synthesize MJP by integration of DMMF with hybrid magnetic fields. The effects of the flow rate, flow rate ratio, and hybrid magnetic field on the magnetic component of the Janus droplets and the MJP were investigated. It was found that the magnetization, particle size, and phase distribution inside MJP could be readily tuned by the flow rates and the magnetic field.

{"title": "New concept of 3D printed bone clip (polylactic acid/hydroxyapatite/silk composite) for internal fixation of bone fractures.", "abstract": "Open reduction with internal fixation is commonly used for the treatment of bone fractures. However, postoperative infection associated with internal fixation devices (intramedullary nails, plates, and screws) remains a significant complication, and it is technically difficult to fix multiple fragmented bony fractures using internal fixation devices. In addition, drilling in the bone to install devices can lead to secondary fracture, bone necrosis associated with postoperative infection. In this study, we developed bone clip type internal fixation device using three- dimensional (3D) printing technology. Standard 3D model of the bone clip was generated based on computed tomography (CT) scan of the femur in the rat. Polylacticacid (PLA), hydroxyapatite (HA), and silk were used for bone clip material. The purpose of this study was to characterize 3D printed PLA, PLA/HA, and PLA/HA/Silk composite bone clip and evaluate the feasibility of these bone clips as an internal fixation device. Based on the results, PLA/HA/Silk composite bone clip showed similar mechanical property, and superior biocompatibility compared to other types of the bone clip. PLA/HA/Silk composite bone clip demonstrated excellent alignment of the bony segments across the femur fracture site with well-positioned bone clip in an animal study. Our 3D printed bone clips have several advantages: (1) relatively noninvasive (drilling in the bone is not necessary), (2) patient-specific design (3) mechanically stable device, and (4) it provides high biocompatibility. Therefore, we suggest that our 3D printed PLA/HA/Silk composite bone clip is a possible internal fixation device.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials science.

{"title": "Three-Dimensional Bioprinting and Its Potential in the Field of Articular Cartilage Regeneration.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting techniques can be used for the fabrication of personalized, regenerative constructs for tissue repair. The current article provides insight into the potential and opportunities of 3D bioprinting for the fabrication of cartilage regenerative constructs. Although 3D printing is already used in the orthopedic clinic, the shift toward 3D bioprinting has not yet occurred. We believe that this shift will provide an important step forward in the field of cartilage regeneration. Three-dimensional bioprinting techniques allow incorporation of cells and biological cues during the manufacturing process, to generate biologically active implants. The outer shape of the construct can be personalized based on clinical images of the patient's defect. Additionally, by printing with multiple bio-inks, osteochondral or zonally organized constructs can be generated. Relevant mechanical properties can be obtained by hybrid printing with thermoplastic polymers and hydrogels, as well as by the incorporation of electrospun meshes in hydrogels. Finally, bioprinting techniques contribute to the automation of the implant production process, reducing the infection risk. To prompt the shift from nonliving implants toward living 3D bioprinted cartilage constructs in the clinic, some challenges need to be addressed. The bio-inks and required cartilage construct architecture need to be further optimized. The bio-ink and printing process need to meet the sterility requirements for implantation. Finally, standards are essential to ensure a reproducible quality of the 3D printed constructs.

The nanopatterned surface that resembled the concave-convex structure of the luminal surface of native blood vessels enhanced cell attachment, proliferation, migration and differentiation. The decellularized scaffold had the mechanical property similar to that of the targeted blood vessels, which could withstand in vivo dynamic blood pressure.

{"title": "3D printing of high-strength aluminium alloys.", "abstract": "Metal-based additive manufacturing, or three-dimensional (3D) printing, is a potentially disruptive technology across multiple industries, including the aerospace, biomedical and automotive industries. Building up metal components layer by layer increases design freedom and manufacturing flexibility, thereby enabling complex geometries, increased product customization and shorter time to market, while eliminating traditional economy-of-scale constraints. However, currently only a few alloys, the most relevant being AlSi10Mg, TiAl6V4, CoCr and Inconel 718, can be reliably printed; the vast majority of the more than 5,500 alloys in use today cannot be additively manufactured because the melting and solidification dynamics during the printing process lead to intolerable microstructures with large columnar grains and periodic cracks. Here we demonstrate that these issues can be resolved by introducing nanoparticles of nucleants that control solidification during additive manufacturing. We selected the nucleants on the basis of crystallographic information and assembled them onto 7075 and 6061 series aluminium alloy powders. After functionalization with the nucleants, we found that these high-strength aluminium alloys, which were previously incompatible with additive manufacturing, could be processed successfully using selective laser melting. Crack-free, equiaxed (that is, with grains roughly equal in length, width and height), fine-grained microstructures were achieved, resulting in material strengths comparable to that of wrought material. Our approach to metal-based additive manufacturing is applicable to a wide range of alloys and can be implemented using a range of additive machines. It thus provides a foundation for broad industrial applicability, including where electron-beam melting or directed-energy-deposition techniques are used instead of selective laser melting, and will enable additive manufacturing of other alloy systems, such as non-weldable nickel superalloys and intermetallics. Furthermore, this technology could be used in conventional processing such as in joining, casting and injection moulding, in which solidification cracking and hot tearing are also common issues.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2017-09-22", "authors": ["John HMartin", "Brennan DYahata", "Jacob MHundley", "Justin AMayer", "Tobias ASchaedler", "Tresa MPollock"], "doi": "10.1038/nature23894"}

{"title": "Proposal to assess printability of bioinks for extrusion-based bioprinting and evaluation of rheological properties governing bioprintability.", "abstract": "The development and formulation of printable inks for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting has been a major challenge in the field of biofabrication. Inks, often polymer solutions with the addition of crosslinking to form hydrogels, must not only display adequate mechanical properties for the chosen application but also show high biocompatibility as well as printability. Here we describe a reproducible two-step method for the assessment of the printability of inks for bioprinting, focussing firstly on screening ink formulations to assess fibre formation and the ability to form 3D constructs before presenting a method for the rheological evaluation of inks to characterise the yield point, shear thinning and recovery behaviour. In conjunction, a mathematical model was formulated to provide a theoretical understanding of the pressure-driven, shear thinning extrusion of inks through needles in a bioprinter. The assessment methods were trialled with a commercially available cr\u00e8me, poloxamer 407, alginate-based inks and an alginate-gelatine composite material. Yield stress was investigated by applying a stress ramp to a number of inks, which demonstrated the necessity of high yield for printable materials. The shear thinning behaviour of the inks was then characterised by quantifying the degree of shear thinning and using the mathematical model to predict the window of printer operating parameters in which the materials could be printed. Furthermore, the model predicted high shear conditions and high residence times for cells at the walls of the needle and effects on cytocompatibility at different printing conditions. Finally, the ability of the materials to recover to their original viscosity after extrusion was examined using rotational recovery rheological measurements. Taken together, these assessment techniques revealed significant insights into the requirements for printable inks and shear conditions present during the extrusion process and allow the rapid and reproducible characterisation of a wide variety of inks for bioprinting.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-09-21", "authors": ["NaomiPaxton", "WilliSmolan", "ThomasB\u00f6ck", "FerryMelchels", "J\u00fcrgenGroll", "TomaszJungst"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa8dd8"}

The ECM-scaffold composites were then decellularized using the freeze-drying method. Scaffolds without ECM deposition were used as controls. The composites and controls were implanted into critical-sized bone defects created in the distal femurs of New Zealand rabbits. Twelve weeks after the surgery, both microcomputed tomography and histologic results indicated that the 7-day-cell-modified ECM-scaffold composites induced bone regeneration with significantly larger volume, trabecular thickness and connectivity than the controls. However, the 14- and 21-day-cell-modified ECM-scaffold composites triggered sustained inflammation response even at 12 weeks after the surgery and showed less bone ingrowth and integration than their 7-day-cell-modified counterparts. In conclusion, these results highlight the viable gene transfer techniques for manipulating cells in a constructed microenvironment of ECM for bone regeneration. However, the unresolved inflammation relating to the duration of ECM modification needs to be considered.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-09-21", "authors": ["JunxuanMa", "WeiGuo", "ManmanGao", "BaodingHuang", "QihuaQi", "ZeminLing", "YanChen", "HaoHu", "HailianZhou", "FeiYu", "KeChen", "GeoffRichards", "JianjingLin", "ZhiyuZhou", "DemingXiao", "XuenongZou"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa8dd1"}

{"title": "Application of three-dimensional printing for colon targeted drug delivery systems.", "abstract": "Orally administered solid dosage forms currently dominate over all other dosage forms and routes of administrations. However, human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) poses a number of obstacles to delivery of the drugs to the site of interest and absorption in the GIT. Pharmaceutical scientists worldwide have been interested in colon drug delivery for several decades, not only for the delivery of the drugs for the treatment of colonic diseases such as ulcerative colitis and colon cancer but also for delivery of therapeutic proteins and peptides for systemic absorption. Despite extensive research in the area of colon targeted drug delivery, we have not been able to come up with an effective way of delivering drugs to the colon. The current tablets designed for colon drug release depend on either pH-dependent or time-delayed release formulations. During ulcerative colitis the gastric transit time and colon pH-levels is constantly changing depending on whether the patient is having a relapse or under remission. Hence, the current drug delivery system to the colon is based on one-size-fits-all. Fails to effectively deliver the drugs locally to the colon for colonic diseases and delivery of therapeutic proteins and peptides for systemic absorption from the colon. Hence, to overcome the current issues associated with colon drug delivery, we need to provide the patients with personalized tablets which are specifically designed to match the individual's gastric transit time depending on the disease state. Three-dimensional (3D) printing (3DP) technology is getting cheaper by the day and bespoke manufacturing of 3D-printed tablets could provide the solutions in the form of personalized colon drug delivery system.

{"title": "Mechanical characterization of structurally porous biomaterials built via additive manufacturing: experiments, predictive models, and design maps for load-bearing bone replacement implants.", "abstract": "Porous biomaterials can be additively manufactured with micro-architecture tailored to satisfy the stringent mechano-biological requirements imposed by bone replacement implants. In a previous investigation, we introduced structurally porous biomaterials, featuring strength five times stronger than commercially available porous materials, and confirmed their bone ingrowth capability in an in vivo canine model. While encouraging, the manufactured biomaterials showed geometric mismatches between their internal porous architecture and that of its as-designed counterpart, as well as discrepancies between predicted and tested mechanical properties, issues not fully elucidated. In this work, we propose a systematic approach integrating computed tomography, mechanical testing, and statistical analysis of geometric imperfections to generate statistical based numerical models of high-strength additively manufactured porous biomaterials. The method is used to develop morphology and mechanical maps that illustrate the role played by pore size, porosity, strut thickness, and topology on the relations governing their elastic modulus and compressive yield strength. Overall, there are mismatches between the mechanical properties of ideal-geometry models and as-manufactured porous biomaterials with average errors of 49% and 41% respectively for compressive elastic modulus and yield strength. The proposed methodology gives more accurate predictions for the compressive stiffness and the compressive strength properties with a reduction of the average error to 11% and 7.6%. The implications of the results and the methodology here introduced are discussed in the relevant biomechanical and clinical context, with insight that highlights promises and limitations of additively manufactured porous biomaterials for load-bearing bone replacement implants.\nIn this work, we perform mechanical characterization of load-bearing porous biomaterials for bone replacement over their entire design space. Results capture the shift in geometry and mechanical properties between as-designed and as-manufactured biomaterials induced by additive manufacturing. Characterization of this shift is crucial to ensure appropriate manufacturing of bone replacement implants that enable biological fixation through bone ingrowth as well as mechanical property harmonization with the native bone tissue. In addition, we propose a method to include manufacturing imperfections in the numerical models that can reduce the discrepancy between predicted and tested properties.

{"title": "Custom-Designed Glassy Carbon Tips for Atomic Force Microscopy.", "abstract": "Glassy carbon is a graphenic form of elemental carbon obtained from pyrolysis of carbon-rich precursor polymers that can be patterned using various lithographic techniques. It is electrically and thermally conductive, mechanically strong, light, corrosion resistant and easy to functionalize. These properties render it very suitable for Carbon-microelectromechanical systems (Carbon-MEMS) and nanoelectromechanical systems (Carbon-NEMS) applications. Here we report on the fabrication and characterization of fully operational, microfabricated glassy carbon nano-tips for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). These tips are 3D-printed on to micro-machined silicon cantilevers by Two-Photon Polymerization (2PP) of acrylate-based photopolymers (commercially known as IP-series resists), followed by their carbonization employing controlled pyrolysis, which shrinks the patterned structure by \u226598% in volume. Tip performance and robustness during contact and dynamic AFM modes are validated by morphology and wear tests. The design and pyrolysis process optimization performed for this work indicate which parameters require special attention when IP-series polymers are used for the fabrication of Carbon-MEMS and NEMS. Microstructural characterization of the resulting material confirms that it features a frozen percolated network of graphene sheets accompanied by disordered carbon and voids, similar to typical glassy carbons.

{"title": "3D printed multiplexed electrospinning sources for large-scale production of aligned nanofiber mats with small diameter spread.", "abstract": "We report the design, fabrication, and characterization of novel, low-cost, and modular miniaturized nanofiber electrospinning sources for the scalable production of non-woven aligned nanofiber mats with low diameter variation. The devices are monolithic arrays of electrospinning emitters made via stereolithography; the emitters are arranged so each element has an independent line of sight to a rotating collector surface. Linear and zigzag emitter packing were evaluated using a PEO solution with the aim of maximizing the throughput of nanofibers with the smallest diameter and narrowest distribution. Current versus flowrate characterization of the devices showed that for a given flowrate a zigzag array produces more current per emitter than a linear array of the same emitter pitch and array size. In addition, the data demonstrate that larger and denser arrays have a net gain in flow rate per unit of active length. Visual inspection of the devices suggests uniform operation in devices with as many as 17 emitters with 300 \u03bcm inner diameter and 1.5 mm emitter gap. Well-aligned nanofiber mats were collected on a rotating drum and characterized; the 17-emitter device produced the same narrow nanofiber distribution (\u223c81 nm average diameter, \u223c17 nm standard deviation) for all tested flow rates, which is strikingly different to the performance shown by 1-emitter sources where the average fiber diameter significantly increased and the statistics notably widened when the flowrate increases. Therefore, the data demonstrate that massively multiplexing the emitters is a viable approach to greatly increase the throughput of non-woven aligned nanofiber mats without sacrificing the statistics of the nanofibers generated.

{"title": "Multimaterial 3D Printing of Graphene-Based Electrodes for Electrochemical Energy Storage Using Thermoresponsive Inks.", "abstract": "The current lifestyles, increasing population, and limited resources result in energy research being at the forefront of worldwide grand challenges, increasing the demand for sustainable and more efficient energy devices. In this context, additive manufacturing brings the possibility of making electrodes and electrical energy storage devices in any desired three-dimensional (3D) shape and dimensions, while preserving the multifunctional properties of the active materials in terms of surface area and conductivity. This paves the way to optimized and more efficient designs for energy devices. Here, we describe how three-dimensional (3D) printing will allow the fabrication of bespoke devices, with complex geometries, tailored to fit specific requirements and applications, by designing water-based thermoresponsive inks to 3D-print different materials in one step, for example, printing the active material precursor (reduced chemically modified graphene (rCMG)) and the current collector (copper) for supercapacitors or anodes for lithium-ion batteries. The formulation of thermoresponsive inks using Pluronic F127 provides an aqueous-based, robust, flexible, and easily upscalable approach. The devices are designed to provide low resistance interface, enhanced electrical properties, mechanical performance, packing of rCMG, and low active material density while facilitating the postprocessing of the multicomponent 3D-printed structures. The electrode materials are selected to match postprocessing conditions. The reduction of the active material (rCMG) and sintering of the current collector (Cu) take place simultaneously.

Scanning electron microscopy revealed homogenous covering of sample surface with regularly spread cells on PLA as well as on titanium.\nThe manufacturing of PLA discs from polylactic acid using FDM was successful. The in vitro investigation with human fetal osteoblasts showed no cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, FDM does not seem to alter biocompatibility of PLA. Nonetheless osteoblasts showed reduced growth on PLA compared to the polystyrene control within the cell experiments. This could be attributed to surface roughness and possible release of residual monomers. Those influences could be investigated in further studies and thus lead to improvement in the additive manufacturing process.

Calcium phosphates cements, such as those based on \u03b1-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b1-TCP), have recognized properties of osteoinductivity, osteoconductivity and resorbability and can be used to 3D print scaffolds to support and induce tissue formation and be replaced by natural bone. At present, however, the mechanical properties found for 3D printed bone scaffolds are only satisfactory for non-load bearing applications. This study varied the post-processing conditions of the 3D powder printing process of \u03b1-TCP cement scaffolds by either immersing the parts into binder, Ringer's solution or phosphoric acid, or by sintering in temperatures ranging from 800 to 1500\u2009\u00b0C. The porosity, composition (phase changes), morphology, shrinkage and compressive strength were evaluated. The mechanical strength of the post-processed 3D printed scaffolds increased compared to the green parts and was in the range of the trabecular bone. Although the mechanical properties achieved are still low, the high porosity presented by the scaffolds can potentially result in greater bone ingrowth. The phases present in the scaffolds after the post-processing treatments were calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite, brushite, monetite, and unreacted \u03b1-TCP. Due to their chemical composition, the 3D printed scaffolds are expected to be resorbable, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

In this study, the authors utilized a structured light scanner and fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer to produce highly accurate animal skeletal models. First, various components of the bovine skeleton, including the femur, the fifth rib, and the sixth cervical (C6) vertebra were used to produce digital models. These were then used to produce 1:1 scale physical models with the FDM printer. The anatomical features of the digital models and three-dimensional (3D) printed models were then compared with those of the original skeletal specimens. The results of this study demonstrated that both digital and physical scale models of animal skeletal components could be rapidly produced using 3D printing technology. In terms of accuracy between models and original specimens, the standard deviations of the femur and the fifth rib measurements were 0.0351 and 0.0572, respectively. All of the features except the nutrient foramina on the original bone specimens could be identified in the digital and 3D printed models. Moreover, the 3D printed models could serve as a viable alternative to original bone specimens when used in anatomy education, as determined from student surveys.

The assembly of cell-laden hydrogel building blocks aims to generate complex biological constructs by manipulating microscale units.

In this work, the impact of cryopreservation on the viability and functionality of cells encapsulated in alginate matrices is presented comparing different cryoprotective agents (CPAs). Human osteosarcoma MG63 cells were encapsulated in sodium alginate fiber constructs with wetspinning method and exposed to different formulations of cryopreservation media, containing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol, and trehalose. The cell-laden fibers were subsequently slow-cooled down to -80\u00b0C and stored in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, viability and death pathway of encapsulated cells were investigated, and metabolic activity and proliferative capacity of cells released from the alginate matrix were evaluated. The viability of MG63 cells encapsulated in alginate matrix ranged from 71%\u2009\u00b1\u20094% to 85%\u2009\u00b1\u20092%, depending on the cryoprotective media formulation with no protracted harmful effects from the CPAs. On the other side, cells cryopreserved in encapsulated conditions and released from the hydrogel showed larger metabolic activity and proliferative capacity in tissue culture plate compared to cells cryopreserved in suspension, in particular when DMSO and glycerol were used as CPAs.

Because clinical measurement of vessel size is typically dependent on the radiologist's subjective interpretation of the vessel borders, it is often prone to high inter- and intra-user variability. Automatic methods of vessel sizing have been developed for two-dimensional images but a fully three-dimensional (3D) method suitable for vessel sizing from volumetric X-ray computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging has heretofore not been demonstrated and validated robustly.\nIn this paper, we refined and objectively validated Gatortail, a method that creates a mathematical geometric 3D model of each branch in a vascular tree, simulates the appearance of the virtual vascular tree in a 3D CT image, and uses the similarity of the simulated image to a patient's CT scan to drive the optimization of the model parameters, including vessel size, to match that of the patient. The method was validated with a 2-dimensional virtual tree structure under deformation, and with a realistic 3D-printed vascular phantom in which the diameter of 64 branches were manually measured 3 times each. The phantom was then scanned on a conventional clinical CT imaging system and the images processed with the in-house software to automatically segment and mathematically model the vascular tree, label each branch, and perform the Gatortail optimization of branch size and trajectory. Previously proposed methods of vessel sizing using matched Gaussian filters and tubularity metrics were also tested. The Gatortail method was then demonstrated on the pulmonary arterial tree segmented from a human volunteer's CT scan.\nThe standard deviation of the difference between the manually measured and Gatortail-based radii in the 3D physical phantom was 0.074\u00a0mm (0.087 in-plane pixel units for image voxels of dimension 0.85\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.85\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.0\u00a0mm) over the 64 branches, representing vessel diameters ranging from 1.2 to 7\u00a0mm.

{"title": "High-Purity Semiconducting Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes: A Key Enabling Material in Emerging Electronics.", "abstract": "Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (sc-SWCNTs) are emerging as a promising material for high-performance, high-density devices as well as low-cost, large-area macroelectronics produced via additive manufacturing methods such as roll-to-roll printing. Proof-of-concept demonstrations have indicated the potential of sc-SWCNTs for digital electronics, radiofrequency circuits, radiation hard memory, improved sensors, and flexible, stretchable, conformable electronics. Advances toward commercial applications bring numerous opportunities in SWCNT materials development and characterization as well as fabrication processes and printing technologies. Commercialization in electronics will require large quantities of sc-SWCNTs, and the challenge for materials science is the development of scalable synthesis, purification, and enrichment methods. While a few synthesis routes have shown promising results in making near-monochiral SWCNTs, gram quantities are available only for small-diameter sc-SWCNTs, which underperform in transistors. Most synthesis routes yield mixtures of SWCNTs, typically 30% metallic and 70% semiconducting, necessitating the extraction of sc-SWCNTs from their metallic counterparts in high purity using scalable postsynthetic methods. Numerous routes to obtain high-purity sc-SWCNTs from raw soot have been developed, including density-gradient ultracentrifugation, chromatography, aqueous two-phase extraction, and selective DNA or polymer wrapping. By these methods (termed sorting or enrichment), >99% sc-SWCNT content can be achieved. Currently, all of these approaches have drawbacks and limitations with respect to electronics applications, such as excessive dilution, expensive consumables, and high ionic impurity content. Excess amount of dispersant is a common challenge that hinders direct inclusion of sc-SWCNTs into electronic devices. At present, conjugated polymer extraction may represent the most practical route to sc-SWCNTs. By the use of polymers with a \u03c0-conjugated backbone, sc-SWCNTs with >99.9% purity can be dispersed in organic solvents via a simple sonication and centrifugation process. With 1000 times less excipient and the flexibility to accommodate a broad range of solvents via diverse polymer constructs, inks are readily deployable in solution-based fabrication processes such as aerosol spray, inkjet, and gravure. Further gains in sc-SWCNT purity, among other attributes, are possible with a better understanding of the structure-property relationships that govern conjugated polymer extraction. This Account covers three interlinked topics in SWCNT electronics: metrology, enrichment, and SWCNT transistors fabricated via solution processes. First, we describe how spectroscopic techniques such as optical absorption, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy are applied for sc-SWCNT purity assessment. Stringent requirements for sc-SWCNTs in electronics are pushing the techniques to new levels while serving as an important driver toward the development of quantitative metrology. Next, we highlight recent progress in understanding the sc-SWCNT enrichment process using conjugated polymers, with special consideration given to the effect of doping on the mechanism. Finally, developments in sc-SWCNT-based electronics are described, with emphasis on the performance of transistors utilizing random networks of sc-SWCNTs as the semiconducting channel material. Challenges and advances associated with using polymer-based dielectrics in the unique context of sc-SWCNT transistors are presented. Such transistor packages have enabled the realization of fully printed transistors as well as transparent and even stretchable transistors as a result of the unique and excellent electrical and mechanical properties of sc-SWCNTs.", "journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "date": "2017-09-14", "authors": ["JacquesLefebvre", "JianfuDing", "ZhaoLi", "PaulFinnie", "GregoryLopinski", "Patrick R LMalenfant"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00234"}

Human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were encapsulated within our bioactive hydrogels, and the effects of culture conditions on in vitro vascularization were determined. We further generated composite constructs by forming 3D printed polycaprolactone/hydroxyapatite scaffolds coated with cell-laden hydrogels and determined how the co-culture affected vascularization and osteogenesis. It was demonstrated that 3D co-cultured ADMSC-HUVEC generated capillary-like networks within the porous 3D printed scaffold. The co-culture systems promoted in vitro vascularization, but had no significant effects on osteogenesis. The prevascularized constructs were subcutaneously implanted into nude mice to evaluate the in vivo vascularization capacity and the functionality of engineered vessels. The hydrogel systems facilitated microvessel and lumen formation and promoted anastomosis of vascular networks of human origin with host murine vasculature.

However, its poor accuracy and homogeneity has limited its indication and hampered its popularization for a long time. Intriguingly, scholars based in China introduced computed tomography (CT)-guided technology to improve the accuracy and homogeneity of RIS implantation and broadened the indications. Then, they creatively designed and introduced three-dimensional printing coplanar template (3D-PCT) and 3D printing noncoplanar template (3D-PNCT) into the practice of RIS implantation. Use of such templates makes RIS implantation more precise and efficacious and aids preoperative planning, real-time dose optimization, and postoperative planning. However, studies on the standard workflow for 3D-PT-assisted CT-guided RIS implantation have not been published. Therefore, the China Northern Radioactive Seeds Brachytherapy Group organized multidisciplinary experts to formulate the guideline for this emerging treatment modality. This guideline aims at standardizing 3D-PT-assisted CT-guided RIS implantation procedures and criteria for selecting treatment candidates and assessing outcomes and for preventing and managing postoperative complications.", "journal": "Journal of cancer research and therapeutics", "date": "2017-09-14", "authors": ["JunjieWang", "FujunZhang", "JinheGuo", "ShudeChai", "GuangjunZheng", "KaixianZhang", "AnyanLiao", "PingJiang", "YuliangJiang", "ZheJi"], "doi": "10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_412_17"}

By using CT data and 3D surgical planning software, a virtual model of the fractured pelvis was created. During this process the fracture was virtually reduced. Based on the reduced fracture model, patient-specific titanium plates including polyamide drilling guides were designed, 3D printed and milled for intra-operative use. One of the advantages of this procedure is that the personalised plates could be tailored to both the shape of the pelvis and the type of fracture. The optimal screw directions and sizes were predetermined in the 3D model. The virtual plan was translated towards the surgical procedure by using the surgical guides and patient-specific osteosynthesis. Besides the description of the newly developed multi-disciplinary workflow, a clinical case example is presented to demonstrate that this technique is feasible and promising for the operative treatment of complex acetabular fractures.", "journal": "Injury", "date": "2017-09-14", "authors": ["B JMerema", "JKraeima", "KTen Duis", "K WWendt", "RWarta", "EVos", "R HSchepers", "M J HWitjes", "F F AIJpma"], "doi": "10.1016/j.injury.2017.08.059"}
{"title": "Can the recovery of lower limb fractures be achieved by use of 3D printing mirror model?", "abstract": "The mirror imaging 3D printing model can be used a as a reference for anatomical reduction in unilateral lower limb fractures. However, the premise of using mirror technology is that the bilateral lower limb bones are similar enough. Because one side had a fracture, it was impossible to compare this directly to the other side. Usually, surgeons think that the bilateral bones are symmetrical and use mirror technology without judging their symmetry.\nIn patients with a unilateral lower limb bone fracture, we measured the long axis and short axis of the three selected transverse sections of the bilateral long bone for comparison to judge the symmetry of the bilateral long bones on CT images. Then, we printed a life-size normal mirror image of the long bone that is similar to the affected side. The model was used as a reference for the anatomical reduction of fractures and preoperative practice.\nSeventy-eight patients with lower limb bone fracture were included in this study. 24 groups of data were generated according to the same level and same axis. There were significant differences between the short axis of the left and right femoral condyle 5cm from the intercondylar keel (p=0.011), and the short axis of the distal tibia 15cm from the ankle dome (p=0.026). There was no significant difference between the left and right sides in the other 22 groups. Of all of the patients in our research, 3 patients decided to forego the surgical treatment and the operation was performed on the model instead, and the lengths of 2 patients showed deviation in actual operations, preventing anatomical reduction. The remaining 73 patients used the pre-bended plates and screws from preoperative practice in the actual operations, and postoperative X-ray examinations showed that the length of the deviation was within the permissible range.\nThe \"Comparison of long axis and short axis of three equidistant transverse sections\" method makes it easy to judge the symmetry of the bilateral long bones, and prevents the blindness of preoperative planning using the contralateral mirror model directly.", "journal": "Injury", "date": "2017-09-14", "authors": ["WenxiZhang", "YuepingJi", "XinmingWang", "JieLiu", "DongLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.injury.2017.09.003"}

Asymmetrically porous scaffolds, which successfully prevented tracheal stenosis in a partial trachea defect model, designed with a tubular shape by electrospinning and reinforced by 3D-printing to reconstruct 2-cm circumferential tracheal defect.

{"title": "Graphene Oxide: An All-in-One Processing Additive for 3D Printing.", "abstract": "Many 3D printing technologies are based on the development of inks and pastes to build objects through droplet or filament deposition (the latter also known as continuous extrusion, robocasting, or direct ink writing). Controlling and tuning rheological behavior is key for successful manufacturing using these techniques. Different formulations have been proposed, but the search continues for approaches that are clean, flexible, robust and that can be adapted to a wide range of materials. Here, we show how graphene oxide (GO) enables the formulation of water-based pastes to print a wide variety of materials (polymers, ceramics, and steel) using robocasting. This work combines flow and oscillatory rheology to provide further insights into the rheological behavior of suspensions combining GO with other materials. Graphene oxide can be used to manipulate the viscoelastic response, enabling the formulation of pastes with excellent printing behavior that combine shear thinning flow and a fast recovery of their elastic properties. These inks do not contain other additives, only GO and the material of interest. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the 3D printing of additive-free graphene oxide structures as well as polymers, ceramics, and steel. Due to its amphiphilic nature and 2D structure, graphene oxide plays multiple roles, behaving as a dispersant, viscosifier, and binder. It stabilizes suspensions of different powders, modifies the flow and viscoelasticity of materials with different chemistries, particle sizes and shapes, and binds the particles together, providing green strength for manual handling.

However, the application of this technology to posttraumatic deformities of the metacarpals and phalangeal bones has not yet been investigated. Our goal was to evaluate the feasibility of the surgical application to the latter and to evaluate the extent and precision of correction.\nWe present results of 6 patients (8 osteotomies) treated with phalangeal or metacarpal corrective osteotomy. Deformities were located in the third ray in 1, fourth ray in 3, and fifth ray in 4 cases. Six malunited metacarpal bones (1 intra-articular) and 2 deformed proximal phalanges were treated. Computer-based 3D preoperative planning using the contralateral hand as a template allowed the production of 3D-printed patient-specific guides that were used intraoperatively for navigation. The precision of the reduction was assessed using pre- and postoperative computed tomography by comparing the postoperative bone model with the preoperatively simulated osteotomy. Range of motion and grip strength were documented pre- and postoperatively.\nThe mean follow-up time was 6 months (range: 5-11 months).

Computed tomography (CT) imaging has been combined with 3D printing to fabricate anatomically scaled patient-specific scaffolds for bone regeneration. However, anatomically scaled scaffolds typically lack sufficient resolution to recapitulate the <100 micrometer-scale trabecular architecture essential for investigating the cellular response to the morphometric properties of bone. In this study, it is hypothesized that the architecture of trabecular bone regulates osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. To test this hypothesis, human bone-templated 3D constructs are fabricated via a new micro-CT/3D inkjet printing process. It is shown that this process reproducibly fabricates bone-templated constructs that recapitulate the anatomic site-specific morphometric properties of trabecular bone. A significant correlation is observed between the structure model index (a morphometric parameter related to surface curvature) and the degree of mineralization of human mesenchymal stem cells, with more concave surfaces promoting more extensive osteoblast differentiation and mineralization compared to predominately convex surfaces.

Further, the straightforward production of high fidelity and biofunctional protein architectures was enabled through the printing of aqueous fibroin/immunoglobulin solutions.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2017-09-11", "authors": ["Matthew BDickerson", "Patrick BDennis", "Vincent PTondiglia", "Lloyd JNadeau", "Kristi MSingh", "Lawrence FDrummy", "Benjamin PPartlow", "Dean PBrown", "Fiorenzo GOmenetto", "David LKaplan", "Rajesh RNaik"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00338"}
{"title": "3D Printed Stem-Cell-Laden, Microchanneled Hydrogel Patch for the Enhanced Release of Cell-Secreting Factors and Treatment of Myocardial Infarctions.", "abstract": "Over the past several years, biomaterials loaded with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have increasingly been used to reduce the myocardial fate of postinfarction collagen deposition and scar tissue formation. Despite successful gains, therapeutic efficacy has remained limited because of restricted transport of cell-secreting factors at the site of implantation. We hypothesized that an MSC-laden hydrogel patch with multiple microchannels would retain transplanted cells on target tissue and support transport of cell-secreting factors into tissue. By doing so, the gel patch will improve the therapeutic potential of the cells and minimize the degradation of myocardial tissue postinfarction. To examine this hypothesis, a stereolithographic apparatus (SLA) was used to introduce microchannels of controlled diameters (e.g., 500 and 1000 \u03bcm) during in situ cross-linking reaction of poly(ethylene glycol)dimethacrylate solution suspended with cells. Placement of the MSC-laden, microchanneled gel patch on the occluded left coronary artery in a murine model showed significant improvement in the ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and stroke volume, compared with gel patches without MSCs and MSC-laden gel patches without microchannels. In particular, the microchannels significantly reduced the number of cells required to recover cardiac function, while minimizing cardiac remodeling. In sum, the microchanneled gel patch would provide a means to prevent abnormal fibrosis resulting from acute ischemic injury.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2017-09-11", "authors": ["Molly RMelhem", "JooyeonPark", "LukeKnapp", "LarissaReinkensmeyer", "CarolineCvetkovic", "JordanFlewellyn", "Min KyungLee", "Tor WolfJensen", "RashidBashir", "HyunjoonKong", "Lawrence BSchook"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00176"}

{"title": "The Development of Skull Prosthesis Through Active Contour Model.", "abstract": "Skull defects result in brain infection and inadequate brain protection and pose a general danger to patient health. To avoid these situations and prevent re-injury, a prosthesis must be constructed and grafted onto the deficient region. With the development of rapid customization through additive manufacturing and 3D printing technology, skull prostheses can be fabricated accurately and efficiently prior to cranioplasty. However, an unfitted skull prosthesis made with a metal implant can cause repeated infection, potentially necessitating secondary surgery. This paper presents a method of creating suitably geometric graphics of skull defects to be applied in skull repair through active contour models. These models can be adjusted in each computed tomography slice according to the graphic features, and the curves representing the skull defect can be modeled. The generated graphics can adequately mimic the natural curvature of the complete skull. This method will enable clinical surgeons to rapidly implant customized prostheses, which is of particular importance in emergency surgery.

Of the many types of 3DP available, stereolithographic (SLA) printing offers the unique advantage of being able to fabricate objects by cross-linking resins to form networked polymer matrices. Because water can be entrapped in these matrices, it is possible in principle to fabricate pre-wetted, drug-loaded hydrogels and devices. Here, SLA printing was used to prepare ibuprofen-loaded hydrogels of cross-linked polyethylene glycol diacrylate. Hydrogels containing up to 30% w/w water, and 10% w/w ibuprofen, were successfully printed. Dissolution profiles showed that drug release rates were dependent on water content, with higher water content hydrogels releasing drug faster.

{"title": "Femoral stem incorporating a diamond cubic lattice structure: Design, manufacture and testing.", "abstract": "The current total hip prostheses with dense femoral stems are considerably stiffer than the host bones, which leads to such long-term complications as aseptic loosening, and eventually, the need for a revision. Consequently, the lifetime of the implantation does not match the lifetime expectation of young patients.\nA femoral stem design featuring a porous structure is proposed to lower its stiffness and allow bone tissue ingrowth. The porous structure is based on a diamond cubic lattice in which the pore size and the strut thickness are selected to meet the biomechanical requirements of the strength and the bone ingrowth. A porous stem and its fully dense counterpart are produced by laser powder-bed fusion using Ti-6Al-4V alloy. To evaluate the stiffness reduction, static testing based on the ISO standard 7206-4 is performed. The experimental results recorded by digital image correlation are analyzed and compared to the numerical model.\nThe numerical and experimental force-displacement characteristics of the porous stem show a 31% lower stiffness as compared to that of its dense counterpart. Moreover, the correlation analysis of the total displacement and equivalent strain fields allows the preliminary validation of the numerical model of the porous stem.

{"title": "Development of a patient-specific atrial phantom model for planning and training of inter-atrial interventions.", "abstract": "Several authors have presented cardiac phantoms to mimic the particularities of the heart, making it suitable for medical training and surgical planning. Although the initial models were mainly focused on the ventricles, personalized phantoms of the atria were recently presented. However, such models are typically rigid, the atrial wall is not realistic and they are not compatible with ultrasound (US), being sub-optimal for planning/training of several interventions.\nIn this work, we propose a strategy to construct a patient-specific atrial model. Specifically, the target anatomy is generated using a computed tomography (CT) dataset and then constructed using a mold-cast approach. An accurate representation of the inter-atrial wall (IAS) was ensured during the model generation, allowing its application for IAS interventions. Two phantoms were constructed using different flexible materials (silicone and polyvinyl alcohol cryogel, PVA-C), which were then compared to assess their appropriateness for US acquisition and for the generation of complex anatomies.\nTwo experiments were set up to validate the proposed methodology. First, the accuracy of the manufacturing approach was assessed through the comparison between a post-production CT and the virtual references. The results proved that the silicone-based model was more accurate than the PVA-C-based one, with an error of 1.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.79, 1.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.94, 1.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77\u00a0mm for the left (LA) and right atria (RA) and IAS, respectively. Second, an US acquisition of each model was performed and the obtained images quantitatively and qualitatively assessed. Both models showed a similar performance in terms of visual evaluation, with an easy detection of the LA, RA, and the IAS. Furthermore, a moderate accuracy was obtained between the atrial surfaces extracted from the US and the ideal reference, and again a superior performance of the silicone-based model against the PVA-C phantom was observed.\nThe proposed strategy proved to be accurate and feasible for the correct generation of complex personalized atrial models.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2017-09-10", "authors": ["PedroMorais", "Jo\u00e3o Manuel R STavares", "SandroQueir\u00f3s", "FernandoVeloso", "JanD'hooge", "Jo\u00e3o LVila\u00e7a"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.12559"}

We developed a new method that combines three-dimensional (3D) printing, assembling, and casting to produce anatomic models of high fidelity for surgical planning. The related anatomic features of the conjoined twins were captured by computed tomography (CT), classified as five organ groups, and reconstructed as five computer models. Among these organ groups, the skeleton was produced by fused deposition modeling (FDM) using acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene. For the other four organ groups, shell molds were prepared by FDM and cast with silica gel to simulate soft tissues, with contrast enhancement pigments added to simulate different CT and visual contrasts.

Surgical navigation is an indispensable tool in making this single-step procedure possible. In this technical note, we describe a new technique for this procedure to ensure a precise resection and optimal fit of the implant in a patient with an intraosseous meningioma.\nWe generated a 3-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's skull based on a computed tomography scan and created a digital \"resection line\" object using 3D Studio Max 2016 software. Based on this object, the patient-specific implant was generated and printed with a 3D printer. Before surgery, the digital object was transferred to the neuronavigation system to enable a navigated resection of the lesion to ensure maximum precision. During surgery, the craniotomy was performed, and the custom-made implant was fitted in a single step.\nThe planned resection was achieved, and the implant could be fitted without need for further adjustments to the resection border.\nWe provide a simple technique to digitally define a planned resection site and create a custom-made implant using specialized software and 3D printing to enable single-step resection of a skull lesion and cranial reconstruction, thereby reducing surgical time and costs and ensuring a good cosmetic result.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2017-09-10", "authors": ["Charlotte-EliseBroeckx", "Thomas J JMaal", "Rinaldo DVreeken", "Ruud R MBos", "MarkTer Laan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.08.177"}

{"title": "Research on High Layer Thickness Fabricated of 316L by Selective Laser Melting.", "abstract": "Selective laser melting (SLM) is a potential additive manufacturing (AM) technology. However, the application of SLM was confined due to low efficiency. To improve efficiency, SLM fabrication with a high layer thickness and fine powder was systematically researched, and the void areas and hollow powders can be reduced by using fine powder. Single-track experiments were used to narrow down process parameter windows. Multi-layer fabrication relative density can be reached 99.99% at the exposure time-point distance-hatch space of 120 \u03bcs-40 \u03bcm-240 \u03bcm. Also, the building rate can be up to 12 mm\u00b3/s, which is about 3-10 times higher than the previous studies. Three typical defects were found by studying deeply, including the un-melted defect between the molten pools, the micro-pore defect within the molten pool, and the irregular distribution of the splashing phenomenon. Moreover, the microstructure is mostly equiaxed crystals and a small amount of columnar crystals. The averages of ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation are 625 MPa, 525 MPa, and 39.9%, respectively. As exposure time increased from 80 \u03bcs to 200 \u03bcs, the grain size is gradually grown up from 0.98 \u03bcm to 2.23 \u03bcm, the grain aspect ratio is close to 1, and the tensile properties are shown as a downward trend.

Traditionally, surgeons mentally rehearse the operation and anticipate problems based on data available from \"radiography\" like MRI and CT. 3D printed bio-models and tools, or \"3Dgraphy\" can simplify this mental exercise and provide a realistic and user-friendly portrayal of this radiographic data.\nFive surgeons participated in this multicenter study. 3D printed biomodels were obtained for 50 surgical cases that included periarticular trauma (24), pelvic trauma (11), complex primary (7), and revision arthroplasty (8). CT scan data was used to generate computer models which were then 3D printed in real size. These models were used to understand pathoanatomy and conduct simulated surgery as a part of preoperative planning. The models were sterilized and were used for intraoperative referencing. Following each case, the operating surgeon was asked to fill out a structured questionnaire to report on the perceived benefits of these tools.\nAll surgeons reported that the biomodels provided additional information to conventional imaging that enhanced their knowledge of the complex pathoanatomy. It was useful in preoperative planning, rehearsing the operation, surgical simulation, intraoperative referencing, surgical navigation, preoperative implant selection, and inventory management.

Rheological characterization of various gelatin/alginate/\u03b2-TCP formulations led to an optimized paste as a printable bioink at room temperature.\nThe in vitro release kinetics of the loaded VEGF revealed that the designed scaffolds fulfill the bioavailability of VEGF required for vascularization in the early stages of tissue regeneration. The results were confirmed by two times increment of proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) seeded on the scaffolds after 10 days.

{"title": "Towards assessing cortical bone porosity using low-frequency quantitative acoustics: A phantom-based study.", "abstract": "Cortical porosity is a key characteristic governing the structural properties and mechanical behaviour of bone, and its quantification is therefore critical for understanding and monitoring the development of various bone pathologies such as osteoporosis. Axial transmission quantitative acoustics has shown to be a promising technique for assessing bone health in a fast, non-invasive, and radiation-free manner. One major hurdle in bringing this approach to clinical application is the entanglement of the effects of individual characteristics (e.g. geometry, porosity, anisotropy etc.) on the measured wave propagation. In order to address this entanglement problem, we therefore propose a systematic bottom-up approach, in which only one bone property is varied, before addressing interaction effects. This work therefore investigated the sensitivity of low-frequency quantitative acoustics to changes in porosity as well as individual pore characteristics using specifically designed cortical bone phantoms.\n14 bone phantoms were designed with varying pore size, axial-, and radial pore number, resulting in porosities (bone volume fraction) between 0% and 15%, similar to porosity values found in human cortical bone. All phantoms were manufactured using laser sintering, measured using axial-transmission acoustics and analysed using a full-wave approach. Experimental results were compared to theoretical predictions based on a modified Timoshenko theory.\nA clear dependence of phase velocity on frequency and porosity produced by increasing pore size or radial pore number was demonstrated, with the velocity decreasing by between 2-5 m/s per percent of additional porosity, which corresponds to -0.5% to -1.0% of wave speed. While the change in phase velocity due to axial pore number was consistent with the results due to pore size and radial pore number, the relative uncertainties for the estimates were too high to draw any conclusions for this parameter.\nThis work has shown the capability of low-frequency quantitative acoustics to reflect changes in porosity and individual pore characteristics and demonstrated that additive manufacturing is an appropriate method that allows the influence of individual bone properties on the wave propagation to be systematically assessed. The results of this work opens perspectives for the efficient development of a multi-frequency, multi-mode approach to screen, diagnose, and monitor bone pathologies in individuals.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-09-08", "authors": ["FlorianVogl", "BenjaminBernet", "DanieleBolognesi", "William RTaylor"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0182617\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60320-0\n10.1001/jama.285.6.785\n10.2165/11598590-000000000-00000\n10.1007/s198-002-8332-0\n10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.1.89\n10.1359/jbmr.1999.14.4.624\n10.1016/j.bone.2011.08.002\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.08.017\n10.1007/s00198-012-2022-x\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2008.12.008\n10.1016/j.ultras.2008.10.003\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2006.07.038\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2005.02.001\n10.3349/ymj.2008.49.3.436\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2005.05.002\n10.1121/1.2756758\n10.1121/1.2769619\n10.1109/TUFFC.2008.790\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2006.02.1402\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2004.08.017\n10.1038/srep43628\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.3062\n10.1088/0031-9155/61/13/4746\n10.1038/201373a0\n10.1359/JBMR.040124\n10.1016/j.bone.2013.01.015\n10.1371/journal.pone.0152417\n10.1108/13552540810907929\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1963.tb14615.x\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.10.011"}

{"title": "Transcriptomic analysis of gingival mesenchymal stem cells cultured on 3D bioprinted scaffold: A promising strategy for neuroregeneration.", "abstract": "The combined approach of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and scaffolds has been proposed as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, even if MSCs can promote neuronal regeneration, replacing lost neurons or secreting neurotrophic factors, many limitations still exist for their application in regenerative medicine, including the low survival and differentiation rate. The scaffolds, by mimicking the endogenous microenvironment, have shown to promote cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. In this work, gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs), isolated from healthy donors, were expanded in vitro, by culturing them adherent in plastic dishes (CTR-GMSCs) or on a poly(lactic acid) scaffold (SC-GMSCs). In order to evaluate the survival and the neurogenic differentiation potential, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis between CTR-GMSCs and SC-GMSCs by next generation sequencing. We found that SC-GMSCs showed an increased expression of neurogenic and prosurvival genes. In particular, genes involved in neurotrophin signaling and PI3K/Akt pathways were upregulated. On the contrary, proapoptotic and negative regulator of neuronal growth genes were downregulated. Moreover, nestin and GAP-43 protein levels increased in SC-GMSCs, confirming the neurogenic commitment of these cells. In conclusion, the scaffold, providing a trophic support for MSCs, may promote GMSCs differentiation toward a neuronal phenotype and survival. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Towards Individualized Tracheobronchial Stents: Technical, Practical and Legal Considerations.", "abstract": "Stent placement has been established as a standard procedure for treating airway obstructions. Other indications are localized malacias and fistulas. Though many different stents with various diameters and lengths are available, the shapes are hardly ever ideal because of the distorted anatomy in patients with diseased airways. There are technical and legal limitations for customizing purchased airway stents. Individually tailored stents would be preferable. New techniques of additive manufacturing such as 3D printing make it possible to produce optimized stents for a particular patient. Using CT data and bronchoscopic images, stents can be constructed that match a particular anatomical situation and apply the optimized expansion force. We give an overview of the currently available manufacturing techniques for polymeric stents and report about our own experience. Direct on-site printing of polyurethane stents in a hospital and printing individual extrusion molds for silicone stents in a certified cleanroom are both feasible. Furthermore, there are promising attempts of combining mechanically customized stents with surface modifications, drug-eluting features, biodegradability, and time-dependent adaptation (4D printing). Truly optimized airway stents with the potential of solving the well-known stent problems such as granulation tissue formation, remodeling, mucostasis, and infections are in reach.

A weakness with this approach arises when melting overhanging features, which have no prior melted material directly beneath them. This is due to the lower thermal conductivity of the powder relative to solid material, which as a result leads to an accumulation of heat and thus distortion. The Electron Beam Melting (EBM) process alleviates this to some extent as the powder must first be sintered (by the beam itself) before it is melted, which results in the added benefit of increasing the thermal conductivity. This study thus sought to investigate to what extent the thermal conductivity of local regions in a titanium Ti-6Al-4V powder bed could be varied by imparting more energy from the beam. Thermal diffusivity and density measurements were taken of the resulting sintered samples, which ranged from being loosely to very well consolidated.

{"title": "Three-dimensional hard and soft tissue imaging of the human cochlea by scanning laser optical tomography (SLOT).", "abstract": "The present study focuses on the application of scanning laser optical tomography (SLOT) for visualization of anatomical structures inside the human cochlea ex vivo. SLOT is a laser-based highly efficient microscopy technique which allows for tomographic imaging of the internal structure of transparent specimens. Thus, in the field of otology this technique is best convenient for an ex vivo study of the inner ear anatomy. For this purpose, the preparation before imaging comprises decalcification, dehydration as well as optical clearing of the cochlea samples in toto. Here, we demonstrate results of SLOT imaging visualizing hard and soft tissue structures with an optical resolution of down to 15 \u03bcm using extinction and autofluorescence as contrast mechanisms. Furthermore, the internal structure can be analyzed nondestructively and quantitatively in detail by sectioning of the three-dimensional datasets. The method of X-ray Micro Computed Tomography (\u03bcCT) has been previously applied to explanted cochlea and is solely based on absorption contrast. An advantage of SLOT is that it uses visible light for image formation and thus provides a variety of contrast mechanisms known from other light microscopy techniques, such as fluorescence or scattering. We show that SLOT data is consistent with \u03bcCT anatomical data and provides additional information by using fluorescence. We demonstrate that SLOT is applicable for cochlea with metallic cochlear implants (CI) that would lead to significant artifacts in \u03bcCT imaging. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the capability of SLOT for resolution visualization of cleared human cochleae ex vivo using multiple contrast mechanisms and lays the foundation for a broad variety of additional studies.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-09-06", "authors": ["NadineTinne", "Georgios CAntonopoulos", "SalehMohebbi", "Jos\u00e9Andrade", "LenaNolte", "HeikoMeyer", "AlexanderHeisterkamp", "OmidMajdani", "TammoRipken"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0184069\n10.1016/j.heares.2008.05.009\n10.1016/j.anorl.2010.10.008\n10.1111/j.1365-2273.2007.01319.x\n10.1155/2014/485783\n10.1080/00016480500437377\n10.1016/j.brainres.2003.10.071\n10.2144/000113087\n10.1364/OE.19.005419\n10.1371/journal.pone.0041236\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00026.2012\n10.1364/BOE.2.002982\n10.1006/jsbi.1996.0013\n10.1016/j.mri.2012.05.001\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033916\n10.1371/journal.pone.0175431"}
{"title": "In Vivo-Like Culture Conditions in a Bioreactor Facilitate Improved Tissue Quality in Corneal Storage.", "abstract": "The cornea is the most-transplanted tissue worldwide. However, the availability and quality of grafts are limited due to the current methods of corneal storage. In this study, a dynamic bioreactor system is employed to enable the control of intraocular pressure and the culture at the air-liquid interface. Thereby, in vivo-like storage conditions are achieved. Different media combinations for endothelium and epithelium are tested in standard and dynamic conditions to enhance the viability of the tissue. In contrast to culture conditions used in eye banks, the combination of the bioreactor and biochrom medium 1 allows to preserve the corneal endothelium and the epithelium. Assessment of transparency, swelling, and the trans-epithelial-electrical-resistance (TEER) strengthens the impact of the in vivo-like tissue culture. For example, compared to corneas stored under static conditions, significantly lower optical densities and significantly higher TEER values were measured (p-value <0.05). Furthermore, healing of epithelial defects is enabled in the bioreactor, characterized by re-epithelialization and initiated stromal regeneration. Based on the obtained results, an easy-to-use 3D-printed bioreactor composed of only two parts was derived to translate the technology from the laboratory to the eye banks. This optimized bioreactor facilitates noninvasive microscopic monitoring. The improved storage conditions ameliorate the quality of corneal grafts and the storage time in the eye banks to increase availability and reduce re-grafting.", "journal": "Biotechnology journal", "date": "2017-09-06", "authors": ["RichardSchmid", "Ioana-SandraTarau", "AngelaRossi", "StefanLeonhardt", "ThomasSchwarz", "SebastianSchuerlein", "ChristianLotz", "JanHansmann"], "doi": "10.1002/biot.201700344"}
{"title": "Nanolattices: An Emerging Class of Mechanical Metamaterials.", "abstract": "In 1903, Alexander Graham Bell developed a design principle to generate lightweight, mechanically robust lattice structures based on triangular cells; this has since found broad application in lightweight design. Over one hundred years later, the same principle is being used in the fabrication of nanolattice materials, namely lattice structures composed of nanoscale constituents. Taking advantage of the size-dependent properties typical of nanoparticles, nanowires, and thin films, nanolattices redefine the limits of the accessible material-property space throughout different disciplines. Herein, the exceptional mechanical performance of nanolattices, including their ultrahigh strength, damage tolerance, and stiffness, are reviewed, and their potential for multifunctional applications beyond mechanics is examined. The efficient integration of architecture and size-affected properties is key to further develop nanolattices. The introduction of a hierarchical architecture is an effective tool in enhancing mechanical properties, and the eventual goal of nanolattice design may be to replicate the intricate hierarchies and functionalities observed in biological materials. Additive manufacturing and self-assembly techniques enable lattice design at the nanoscale; the scaling-up of nanolattice fabrication is currently the major challenge to their widespread use in technological applications.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2017-09-06", "authors": ["JensBauer", "Lucas RMeza", "Tobias ASchaedler", "RuthSchwaiger", "XiaoyuZheng", "LorenzoValdevit"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.201701850"}

Activated cancer associated fibroblasts are a key component of the tumor stroma that interact with cancer cells and support their growth and survival. Models that recapitulate the interaction of cancer cells and activated fibroblasts are important tools for studying the stromal biology and for development of antitumor agents. Here, a method is described for the rapid generation of robust 3-dimensional (3D) spheroid co-culture of pancreatic cancer cells and activated pancreatic fibroblasts that can be used for subsequent biological studies. Additionally, described is the use of 3D spheroids in carrying out functional metabolic assays to probe cellular bioenergetics pathways using an extracellular flux analyzer paired with a spheroid microplate. Pancreatic cancer cells (Patu8902) and activated pancreatic fibroblast cells (PS1) were co-cultured and magnetized using a biocompatible nanoparticle assembly. Magnetized cells were rapidly bioprinted using magnetic drives in a 96 well format, in growth media to generate spheroids with a diameter ranging between 400-600 \u00b5m within 5-7 days of culture. Functional metabolic assays using Patu8902-PS1 spheroids were then carried out using the extracellular flux technology to probe cellular energetic pathways. The method herein is simple, allows consistent generation of cancer cell-fibroblast spheroid co-cultures and can be potentially adapted to other cancer cell types upon optimization of the current described methodology.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2017-09-06", "authors": ["PawanNoel", "RubenMu\u00f1oz", "George WRogers", "AndrewNeilson", "Daniel DVon Hoff", "HaiyongHan"], "doi": "10.3791/56081"}

Central to the printing quality of complex three-dimensional structures fabricated by the support bath-enabled fabrication approach is the formation of a continuous filament with well-defined geometry. The objective of this research is to study the printability of hydrogel precursor solutions in a Laponite nanoclay yield-stress bath during extrusion printing where the printed hydrogel precursor solutions remain liquid. The printability herein is mainly evaluated based on the morphology and dimensions of printed liquid filaments. Seven filament types are observed during extrusion in the nanoclay bath: three types of well-defined filaments (swelling, equivalent diameter, and stretched) and four types of irregular filaments (rough surface, over-deposited, compressed, and discontinuous). When the alginate concentration increases, the diameter of filaments made of alginate-gelatin blends decreases. The nanoclay concentration significantly affects the morphology of deposited filaments: low concentration Laponite bath (such as 0.5% (w/v)) may lead to the formation of irregular filaments such as rough surface and over-deposited filaments while high concentration bath (such as 8.0% (w/v)) may result in the formation of compressed filaments. Operating conditions affect the filament diameter and morphology similar to those as observed during conventional extrusion printing.

{"title": "Comparison of conventional reconstruction plate versus direct metal laser sintering plate: an in vitro mechanical characteristics study.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) technology has helped to achieve several advances in the medical field, particularly as far as fabrication of implants is concerned. But the application of direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) bone plate is quite limited due to the indeterminate mechanical property. The purposes of this study were to characterize the biomechanical properties of the polished DMLS reconstruction plate and to compare these with the properties of commonly applied implants and to find whether the mechanical performance of DMLS plate meets the requirements for clinical application.\nIn this study, we fabricated two groups of plates by DMLS and computer numerical control (CNC) techniques. After that, we polished all samples and investigated their roughness, components, hardness, static bending, and torsional performance. Moreover, cyclic bending tests and fractographic analysis were conducted. Statistical comparisons of the group by means of monotonic test data were made, and a qualitative comparison was performed to assess failures in fatigue.\nWe found no differences in surface roughness or components after polishing, but the DMLS plate hardness is 7.42% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) greater than that of the CNC plates. Compared with the CNC plates, the DMLS plate static bending and torsional performance were significantly greater.

{"title": "Control of cell growth on 3D-printed cell culture platforms for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Biocompatible tissue growth has excellent prospects for tissue engineering. These tissues are built over scaffolds, which can influence aspects such as cell adhesion, proliferation rate, morphology, and differentiation. However, the ideal 3D biological structure has not been developed yet. Here, we applied the electro-hydrodynamic jet (E-jet) 3D printing technology using poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid, PLGA) solution to print varied culture platforms for engineered tissue structures. The effects of different parameters (electrical voltage, plotting speed, and needle sizes) on the outcome were investigated. We compared the biological compatibility of the 3D printed culture platforms with that of random fibers. Finally, we used the 3D-printed PLGA platforms to culture fibroblasts, the main cellular components of loose connective tissue. The results show that the E-jet printed platforms could guide and improve cell growth. These highly aligned fibers were able to support cellular alignment and proliferation. Cell angle was consistent with the direction of the fibers, and cells cultured on these fibers showed a much faster migration, potentially enhancing wound healing performance. Thus, the potential of this technology for 3D biological printing is large. This process can be used to grow biological scaffolds for the engineering of tissues. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Covalent Binding of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 and Transforming Growth Factor-\u03b23 to 3D Plotted Scaffolds for Osteochondral Tissue Regeneration.", "abstract": "Engineering the osteochondral tissue presents some challenges mainly relying in its function of transition from the subchondral bone to articular cartilage and the gradual variation in several biological, mechanical, and structural features. A possible solution for osteochondral regeneration might be the design and fabrication of scaffolds presenting a gradient able to mimic this transition. Covalent binding of biological factors proved to enhance cell adhesion and differentiation in two-dimensional culture substrates. Here, we used polymer brushes as selective linkers of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and transforming growth factor-\u03b23 (TGF-\u03b23) on the surface of 3D scaffolds fabricated via additive manufacturing (AM) and subsequent controlled radical polymerization. These growth factors (GFs) are known to stimulate the differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) toward the osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages, respectively. BMP-2 and TGF-\u03b23 were covalently bound both homogeneously within a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based brush-functionalized scaffolds, and following a gradient composition by varying their concentration along the axial section of the 3D constructs. Following an approach previously developed by our group and proved to be successful to generate fibronectin gradients, opposite brush-supported gradients of BMP-2 and TGF-\u03b23 were finally generated and subsequently tested to differentiate cells in a gradient fashion. The brush-supported GFs significantly influenced hMSCs osteochondral differentiation when the scaffolds were homogenously modified, yet no effect was observed in the gradient scaffolds. Therefore, this technique seems promising to maintain the biological activity of growth factors covalently linked to 3D scaffolds, but needs to be further optimized in case biological gradients are desired.", "journal": "Biotechnology journal", "date": "2017-09-03", "authors": ["AndreaDi Luca", "MichelKlein-Gunnewiek", "Julius GVancso", "Clemens Avan Blitterswijk", "Edmondo MBenetti", "LorenzoMoroni"], "doi": "10.1002/biot.201700072"}

{"title": "The control of stem cell morphology and differentiation using three-dimensional printed scaffold architecture.", "abstract": "In this work, we investigated the interactions of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) with three-dimensional (3D) printed scaffolds displaying different scaffold architectures. Pressure-assisted microsyringe system was used to fabricate scaffolds with square (SQR), hexagonal (HEX), and octagonal (OCT) architectures defined by various degrees of curvatures. OCT represents the highest degree of curvature followed by HEX, and SQR is composed of linear struts without curvature. Scaffolds were fabricated from poly(L-lactic acid) and poly(tyrosol carbonate). We found that hMSCs attached and spread by taking the shape of the individual struts, exhibiting high aspect ratios (ARs) and mean cell area when cultured on OCT scaffolds as compared with those cultured on HEX and SQR scaffolds. In contrast, cells appeared bulkier with low AR on SQR scaffolds. These significant changes in cell morphology directly correlate with the stem cell lineage commitment, such that 80 \u00b1 1% of the hMSCs grown on OCT scaffolds differentiated into osteogenic lineage, compared with 70 \u00b1 4% and 62 \u00b1 2% of those grown on HEX and SQR scaffolds, respectively.

However, they have been limited in size and complexity because of the small size of most commercially available 3D printers as well as material warping concerns. We aimed to overcome these limitations by developing and testing an effective 3D printing workflow to fabricate a large patient-specific radiotherapy phantom with minimal warping errors. In doing so, we produced a full-scale phantom of a real postmastectomy patient.\nWe converted a patient's clinical CT DICOM data into a 3D model and then sliced the model into eleven 2.5-cm-thick sagittal slices. The slices were printed with a readily available thermoplastic material representing all body tissues at 100% infill, but with air cavities left open. Each slice was printed on an inexpensive and commercially available 3D printer. Once the printing was completed, the slices were placed together for imaging and verification. The original patient CT scan and the assembled phantom CT scan were registered together to assess overall accuracy.\nThe materials for the completed phantom cost $524. The printed phantom agreed well with both its design and the actual patient. Individual slices differed from their designs by approximately 2%. Registered CT images of the assembled phantom and original patient showed excellent agreement.\nThree-dimensional printing the patient-specific phantom in sagittal slices allowed a large phantom to be fabricated with high accuracy.

The delicate changes in annulus shape and papillary muscle position throughout the cardiac cycle have significant impact on the stress distribution in the leaflets and chords, thus preservation of anatomically accurate positioning is critical. The aim of this study was to develop an in vitro method and apparatus for obtaining high-resolution 3D MRI images of porcine mitral valves in both the diastolic and systolic configurations with physiologically appropriate annular shape, papillary muscle positions and orientations, specific to the heart from which the valve was harvested. Positioning and mounting was achieved through novel, customized mounting hardware consisting of papillary muscle and annulus holders with geometries determined via pre-mortem ultrasonic intra-valve measurements. A semi-automatic process was developed and employed to tailor Computer Aided Design models of the holders used to mount the valve. All valve mounting hardware was 3D printed using a stereolithographic printer, and the material of all fasteners used were brass for MRI compatibility. The mounted valves were placed within a clear acrylic case, capable of holding a zero-pressure and pressurized liquid bath of a MRI-compatible fluid. Obtaining images from the valve submerged in liquid fluid mimics the natural environment surrounding the valve, avoiding artefacts due to tissue surface tension mismatch and gravitational impact on tissue shape when not neutrally buoyant. Fluid pressure was supplied by reservoirs held at differing elevations and monitored and controlled to within \u00b11mmHg to ensure that the valves remained steady.

This implant is constructed by 3D-printing technology to match the tumor cavity and release an oncolytic virus-inspired DNA nanocomplex to kill glioblastoma cells through apoptosis induction. Meanwhile, a 3D-engineered subcutaneous glioblastoma xenograft is built to mimic the resection tumor cavity in mice.

A rapid prototyping 3D model was created to better understand the anatomy, counsel the family about the problem and the surgical procedure, as well as guide surgical technique. The intricate detail and size match of the model with the patient's anatomy offered unparalleled, hands-on experience with the patient's anatomy pre-operatively and improved surgical precision.\nOur experience with rapid prototyping confirmed its ability to enhance orthopedic care by improving the surgeon's ability to understand complex anatomy.

{"title": "Printable Fluorescent Hydrogels Based on Self-Assembling Peptides.", "abstract": "Fluorescent hydrogels (FH) have a variety of potential applications in the field of soft electronics. However, fabrication of mechanically stable and printable fluorescent hydrogels remains challenging. Here, we report a kind of fluorescent hydrogel based on the co-assembly of peptide motif and transition metal ions. The metal ions are captured in the hydrogel network at specific positions through covalently linked ligands on the peptide hydrogelators. This efficiently prevents the aggregation and self-quenching of organometallic chromophores. In addition, the formation of metal-ligand complexes introduces additional interactions to stabilize the hydrogel network, making the FH even more stable after the incorporation of metal ions. The FH is optically transparent but highly fluorescent. By using three different metal ions, the white light fluorescent supramolecular hydrogel has been achieved. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the printability of the hydrogels to various patterns. We anticipate that with the improved fluorescent performance and stability, this kind of FH can find broad applications in extrusion-based 3D printing for the construction of soft electronics.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-08-31", "authors": ["YifanXia", "BinXue", "MengQin", "YiCao", "YingLi", "WeiWang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-10162-y\n10.1021/ic0259181\n10.1002/adma.200400684\n10.1002/adma.201404967\n10.1038/nature08003\n10.1126/science.267.5202.1332\n10.1002/1521-4095(200012)12:23<1737::AID-ADMA1737>3.0.CO;2-N\n10.1038/nature01390\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/33/332001\n10.1016/j.ccr.2013.10.023\n10.1088/0022-3727/41/13/133001\n10.1007/BF00027146\n10.1007/BF00048599\n10.1021/cr050136l\n10.1038/35090539\n10.1002/adma.200601230\n10.1039/C4CC07634F\n10.1039/C4CC01763C\n10.1039/C4TC00048J\n10.1039/c3cc44875d\n10.1039/c3cc43371d\n10.1021/ja903947b\n10.1002/adma.200802932\n10.1002/adma.201204407\n10.1021/ja9084435\n10.1002/adma.200700542\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.08.013\n10.1002/chem.200900620\n10.1021/jacs.6b06903\n10.1021/la8027226\n10.1021/jp3073188\n10.1039/b915765b\n10.1038/ncomms7165\n10.1016/j.bmc.2013.03.012\n10.1002/anie.201101945\n10.1039/C0SC00343C\n10.1038/nbt874\n10.1016/S1748-0132(08)70041-0\n10.1073/pnas.072089599\n10.1039/C0JM02869J\n10.1002/adfm.201505188\n10.1039/C6RA15291K\n10.1002/adma.201400240\n10.1039/C5SC02234G\n10.1021/jp401353e\n10.1351/pac199264091239\n10.1021/ja106807u\n10.1039/C2JM13826C\n10.1021/acsami.6b00018\n10.1002/chem.201201940\n10.1039/c2jm35012b\n10.1021/ja206029a\n10.1002/chem.201103827\n10.1002/ange.201007277\n10.1021/ja102299b\n10.1016/S1369-7021(03)00530-3\n10.1021/la026526+\n10.1039/b609047h\n10.1016/S0142-9612(01)00099-0\n10.1016/S1381-5148(99)00031-0\n10.1021/nl015697g\n10.1073/pnas.142309999\n10.1073/pnas.97.12.6728\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002364\n10.1002/adma.200802700\n10.1021/acsami.6b04338\n10.1063/1.4898189\n10.1126/science.aac5082"}

{"title": "Influence of Processing Conditions on the Mechanical Behavior and Morphology of Injection Molded Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) 85:15.", "abstract": "Two groups of PLGA specimens with different geometries (notched and unnotched) were injection molded under two melting temperatures and flow rates. The mechanical properties, morphology at the fracture surface, and residual stresses were evaluated for both processing conditions. The morphology of the fractured surfaces for both specimens showed brittle and smooth fracture features for the majority of the specimens. Fracture images of the notched specimens suggest that the surface failure mechanisms are different from the core failure.

{"title": "Use of a 3D Skull Model to Improve Accuracy in Cranioplasty for Autologous Flap Resorption in a 3-Year-Old Child.", "abstract": "Cranioplasty is considered a simple reconstructive procedure, usually performed in a single stage. In some clinical conditions, such as in children with multifocal flap osteolysis, it could represent a surgical challenge. In these patients, the partially resorbed autologous flap should be removed and replaced with a precustomed prosthesis which should perfectly match the expected bone defect. We describe the technique used for a navigated cranioplasty in a 3-year-old child with multifocal autologous flap osteolysis. We decided to perform a cranioplasty using a custom-made hydroxyapatite porous ceramic flap. The prosthesis was produced with an epoxy resin 3D skull model of the patient, which included a removable flap corresponding to the planned cranioplasty. Preoperatively, a CT scan of the 3D skull model was performed without the removable flap. The CT scan images of the 3D skull model were merged with the preoperative 3D CT scan of the patient and navigated during the cranioplasty to define with precision the cranioplasty margins. After removal of the autologous resorbed flap, the hydroxyapatite prosthesis matched perfectly with the skull defect. The anatomical result was excellent. Thus, the implementation of cranioplasty with image merge navigation of a 3D skull model may improve cranioplasty accuracy, allowing precise anatomic reconstruction in complex skull defect cases.", "journal": "Pediatric neurosurgery", "date": "2017-08-30", "authors": ["RodolfoMaduri", "EdoardoViaroli", "MarcLevivier", "Roy TDaniel", "MahmoudMesserer"], "doi": "10.1159/000479329"}

The dimensional accuracy was assessed using the digital-subtraction technique. The mechanical properties were evaluated using biaxial flexure strength test. Three different build angles were adopted to print the specimens for the mechanical test; 0\u00b0(Vertical), 45\u00b0 (Oblique) and 90\u00b0(Horizontal) angles. The surface topography, crystallographic phase structure and surface roughness were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM), X-ray diffractometer and confocal microscopy respectively.\nThe printed implant was dimensionally accurate with a root mean square (RMSE) value of 0.1mm. The Weibull analysis revealed a statistically significant higher characteristic strength (1006.6MPa) of 0\u00b0 printed specimens compared to the other two groups and no significant difference between 45\u00b0 (892.2MPa) and 90\u00b0 (866.7MPa) build angles.

Also, new possibilities to create a specific stray field around the magnet are triggered. The current work presents a method to 3D print polymer-bonded magnets with a variable magnetic compound fraction distribution. This means the saturation magnetization can be adjusted during the printing process to obtain a required external field of the manufactured magnets.

The magnetic filaments are compounded, extruded, and characterized for the printing process. To deduce the quality of the manufactured magnets with a variable magnetic compound fraction, an inverse stray field framework is developed. The effectiveness of the printing process and the simulation method is shown. It can also be used to manufacture magnets that produce a predefined stray field in a given region.

A modular device integrating analyte oxidation, disk-based SPE and analyte complexation has been fabricated using stereolithographic 3D printing. The 3D printed device is directly connected to flow-based analytical instrumentation, replacing typical flow networks based on discrete elements. As proof of concept, the 3D printed device was implemented in a multisyringe flow injection analysis (MSFIA) system, and applied to the fully automated speciation, SPE and spectrophotometric quantification of Fe in water samples. The obtained limit of detection for total Fe determination was 7ng, with a dynamic linear range from 22ng to 2400ng Fe (3mL sample). An intra-day RSD of 4% (n = 12) and an inter-day RSD of 4.3% (n = 5, 3mL sample, different day with a different disk), were obtained. Incorporation of integrated 3D printed devices with automated flow-based techniques showed improved sensitivity (85% increase on the measured peak height for the determination of total Fe) in comparison with analogous flow manifolds built from conventional tubing and connectors.

The working principle of the presented system is based on the integration of small capillaries that are capable of detecting fatigue cracks. Four-point bending fatigue tests have been performed on Ti-6Al-4V specimens with integrated capillaries and compared to the reference specimenswithout capillaries. Specimens were produced by conventional subtractive manufacturing of wrought material and AM, using the laser based Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process. In this study, we investigated the effect of the presence of the capillary on the fatigue strength and fatigue initiation location. Finite element (FEM) simulations were performed to validate the experimental test results. The presence of a drilled capillary in the specimens did not alter the fatigue initiation location. However, the laser based DED production process introduced roughness on the capillary surface that altered the fatigue initiation location to the capillary surface.

The hippocampal sparing and coverage of these plans were investigated through Monte Carlo dose calculation (SmART-Plan Xrad 225cx planning system). Treatment delivery was implemented through a novel process where hippocampal block shapes were computer generated from an MRI rat atlas which was registered to on-board cone beam CT of the rat in treatment position. The blocks were 3D printed with a tungsten-doped filament at lateral resolution of 80\u00a0\u03bcm. Precision immobilization was achieved utilizing a 3D-printed support system which enabled angled positioning of the rat head in supine position and bite block to improve coverage of the central diencephalon. Treatment delivery was verified on rodent-morphic Presage\nAll simulated plans spared the hippocampus while delivering high dose to the brain (22.5-26.2\u00a0Gy mean dose to brain at mean hippocampal dose of 7\u00a0Gy). No significant improvement in hippocampal sparing was observed by adding beams beyond four fields. Dosimetric sparing of hippocampal region of the four-field plan was verified with the Presage\nA novel approach for conformal microradiation therapy using 3D-printing technology was developed, implemented, and validated. A workflow was developed to generate accurate 3D-printed blocks from registered high-resolution rat MRI atlas structures. Although hippocampus was spared with this technique, whole-brain target coverage was suboptimal, indicating that non-coplanar beams and IMRT capability may be required to meet stringent dose criteria associated with current human RTOG trials.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2017-08-25", "authors": ["Suk WYoon", "Christina KCramer", "Devin AMiles", "Michael HReinsvold", "Kyeung MJoo", "David GKirsch", "MarkOldham"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.12533"}
{"title": "A 3D printed microfluidic perfusion device for multicellular spheroid cultures.", "abstract": "The advent of 3D printing technologies promises to make microfluidic organ-on-chip technologies more accessible for the biological research community. To date, hydrogel-encapsulated cells have been successfully incorporated into 3D printed microfluidic devices. However, there is currently no 3D printed microfluidic device that can support multicellular spheroid culture, which facilitates extensive cell-cell contacts important for recapitulating many multicellular functional biological structures. Here, we report a first instance of fabricating a 3D printed microfluidic cell culture device capable of directly immobilizing and maintaining the viability and functionality of 3D multicellular spheroids. We evaluated the feasibility of two common 3D printing technologies i.e. stereolithography (SLA) and PolyJet printing, and found that SLA could prototype a device comprising of cell immobilizing micro-structures that were housed within a microfluidic network with higher fidelity. We have also implemented a pump-free perfusion system, relying on gravity-driven flow to perform medium perfusion in order to reduce the complexity and footprint of the device setup, thereby improving its adaptability into a standard biological laboratory. Finally, we demonstrated the biological performance of the 3D printed device by performing pump-free perfusion cultures of patient-derived parental and metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma tumor and liver cell (HepG2) spheroids with good cell viability and functionality. This paper presents a proof-of-concept in simplifying and integrating the prototyping and operation of a microfluidic spheroid culture device, which will facilitate its applications in various drug efficacy, metabolism and toxicity studies.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-08-25", "authors": ["Louis Jun YeOng", "AnikIslam", "RamanujDasGupta", "Narayanan GopalakkrishnaIyer", "Hwa LiangLeo", "Yi-ChinToh"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa8858"}

As a model protein we used an amyloid fibril-forming protein. Laser treatment induced a foaming of the sample surface exhibiting an interconnected fibrous mesh with a high degree of control and precision. The surface foaming was well characterized by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, laser induced fluorescence and contact angle measurements. The laser irradiated areas of the protein films acquired new morphological and physicochemical properties that could be exploited to fulfill unmet challenges in the tissue engineering field. In this context we subsequently evaluated the response of NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell line on the processed film. Our results show a strong and statistically significant preference for adhesion and proliferation of cells on the irradiated areas compared to the non-irradiated ones.

However, up to now process control for plant cell suspension cultures is challenging. A positive impact of cell immobilization, such as encapsulation in hydrogel beads, on secondary metabolites production has been reported for several plant species. The aim of this work was to develop a method for bioprinting of plant cells in order to allow fabrication of free-formed three-dimensional matrices with defined internal pore architecture for in depth characterization of immobilization conditions, cell agglomeration and interactions. By using extrusion-based 3D plotting of a basil cell-laden hydrogel blend consisting of alginate, agarose and methylcellulose (alg/aga/mc), we could demonstrate that bioprinting is applicable to plant cells. The majority of the cells survived plotting and crosslinking and the embedded cells showed high viability and metabolic activity during the investigated cultivation period of 20 d. Beside its compatibility with the plant cells, the novel alg/aga/mc blend allowed fabrication of defined 3D constructs with open macropores both in vertical and horizontal direction which were stable under culture conditions for several weeks.

Three CT reconstruction techniques were applied on each acquisition. The first technique was filtered backprojection (FBP), the second technique was FBP with iterative filtering (adaptive iteration dose reduction in 3 dimensions (AIDR 3D)) and the third technique was model-based iterative reconstruction (Forward projected model-based Iterative Reconstruction SoluTion (FIRST)). Image quality of the CT data was quantified in terms of SSIM. The SSIM index was used for image quality comparison between the dose levels and different reconstruction techniques. The SSIM index gives a value between 0 and 1, with 0 as the lowest image quality and 1 as an excellent image quality.\nThe lowest SSIM index was observed for FBP at all dose levels. The reconstruction technique with the highest SSIM depends on the dose level. For tube currents higher than 80 mA, AIDR 3D showed the highest SSIM index, and for tube currents lower or equal to 80 mA FIRST showed the highest SSIM index.\nSSIM index is a robust quantity and is correlated to the image quality as perceived by the humans. Advanced CT reconstruction techniques provide better image quality in all conditions compared to FBP.

However, conventional biofabrication technologies are usually less productive in fabricating microscale three-dimensional (3D) constructs because of the strident requirements in processing precision and complexity. Here we present an optical \u00b5-printing technology to rapidly fabricate 3D microscaffold arrays for 3D cell culture and cell-scaffold interaction studies on a single chip. Arrays of 3D cubic microscaffolds with cubical sizes matching the single-cell size were fabricated to facilitate cell spreading on suspended microbeams so as to expose both apical and basal cell membranes. We further showed that the increasing of the cubical size of the microscaffolds led to enhanced spreading of the seeded human mesenchymal stem cells and activation of mechanosensing signaling, thereby promoting osteogenesis. Moreover, we demonstrated that the spatially selective modification of the surfaces of suspended beams with a bioactive coating (gelatin methacrylate) via an in-situ printing process allowed tailorable cell adhesion and spreading on the 3D microscaffolds.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-08-23", "authors": ["XiaOuyang", "KunyuZhang", "JushuaiWu", "Dexter Siu-HongWong", "QianFeng", "LimingBian", "A PingZhang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-08598-3\n10.1038/nmat2013\n10.1073/pnas.0813200106\n10.1038/nmat3058\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.21.012704.131525\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0368\n10.1021/nl803548b\n10.1073/pnas.0903269107\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.07.035\n10.1021/la200487w\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b01619\n10.1126/science.1064829\n10.1038/nrm1858\n10.1038/ncb2062\n10.1039/b704449f\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00088\n10.1088/1758-5082/5/1/015001\n10.1007/s10439-014-1207-1\n10.1039/C5LC90069G\n10.1088/1758-5082/5/3/035007\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.10.005\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045011\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1038/nbt.3413\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.012\n10.1002/adma.201506215\n10.1002/adma.200600647\n10.1039/C4NR06500J\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.05.032\n10.1002/adma.201604342\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.050\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.04.024\n10.1002/adma.201202024\n10.1002/bit.24957\n10.1073/pnas.1524510113\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.01.042\n10.1016/S0021-9290(03)00287-2\n10.1364/OE.23.029708\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.03.064\n10.1002/jbm.b.33223\n10.1002/adfm.201401390\n10.1038/nature10137\n10.1038/nmat4725\n10.1101/gad.1903310"}

Larger tissue substitutes, however, require a vascularized network to ensure nutrition supply. Therefore, tailored bioinks combining 3D printability and cell-induced vascularization are needed. We hypothesize that tailored hydrogel blends made of agarose-type I collagen and agarose-fibrinogen are 3D printable and will allow the formation of capillary-like structures by human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human dermal fibroblasts. Samples were casted, incubated for 14 days, and analyzed by immunohistology and two-photon laser scanning microscopy. The 3D printability of the hydrogel blends was examined using a drop-on-demand printing system. The rheological behavior was also investigated. Substantial capillary network formation was observed in agarose-type I collagen hydrogel blends with concentrations of 0.2% or 0.5% collagen and 0.5% agarose. Furthermore, storage moduli of agarose-collagen blends were significantly increased compared to those of the corresponding single components (448 Pa for 0.5% agarose, 148 Pa for 0.5% collagen, and 1551 Pa for 0.5% agarose-0.5% collagen).

There are many sensitivities in measuring this effect. A comparison between numerical simulations, experiments and theory is urgently required to observe whether the effect is significant. In this study, the beneficial effect of a small finger spread in swimming is confirmed using three different but complementary methods. For the first time numerical simulations and laboratory experiments are conducted on the exact same 3D model of the hand with attached forearm. The virtual version of the hand with forearm was implemented in a numerical code by means of an immersed boundary method and the 3D printed physical version was studied in a wind tunnel experiment. An enhancement of the drag coefficient of 2% and 5% compared to the case with closed fingers was found for the numerical simulation and experiment, respectively. A 5% and 8% favorable effect on the (dimensionless) force moment at an optimal finger spreading of 10\u00b0 was found, which indicates that the difference is more outspoken in the force moment.

{"title": "Printing nature: Unraveling the role of nacre's mineral bridges.", "abstract": "Creating materials with strength and toughness has been a long-sought goal. Conventional engineering materials often face a trade-off between strength and toughness, prompting researchers seeking to overcome these limitations to explore more sophisticated materials, such as composites. This paradigm shift in material design is spurred by nature, which exhibits a plethora of heterogeneous materials that offer outstanding material properties, and many natural materials are widely regarded as examples of high-performing hybrid materials. A classic example is nacre, also known as mother-of-pearl, which boasts a combination of high stiffness, strength, and fracture toughness. Various microstructural features contribute to the toughness of nacre, including mineral bridges (MBs), nano-asperities, and waviness of the constituent platelets. Recent research in biomimicry suggests that MBs contribute to the high strength and toughness observed in nacre and nacre-inspired materials. However, previous work in this area did not allow for complete control over the length scale of the bridges and had limitations on the volume fraction of mineral content. In this work, we present a systematic investigation elucidating the effects of structural parameters, such as volume fraction of mineral phase and density of MBs, on the mechanical response of nacre-inspired additive manufactured composites. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to tune the composite properties by tuning sizes and content of structural features (e.g. MBs and mineral content) in a heterogeneous material.

{"title": "Multi-tissue interactions in an integrated three-tissue organ-on-a-chip platform.", "abstract": "Many drugs have progressed through preclinical and clinical trials and have been available - for years in some cases - before being recalled by the FDA for unanticipated toxicity in humans. One reason for such poor translation from drug candidate to successful use is a lack of model systems that accurately recapitulate normal tissue function of human organs and their response to drug compounds. Moreover, tissues in the body do not exist in isolation, but reside in a highly integrated and dynamically interactive environment, in which actions in one tissue can affect other downstream tissues. Few engineered model systems, including the growing variety of organoid and organ-on-a-chip platforms, have so far reflected the interactive nature of the human body. To address this challenge, we have developed an assortment of bioengineered tissue organoids and tissue constructs that are integrated in a closed circulatory perfusion system, facilitating inter-organ responses. We describe a three-tissue organ-on-a-chip system, comprised of liver, heart, and lung, and highlight examples of inter-organ responses to drug administration. We observe drug responses that depend on inter-tissue interaction, illustrating the value of multiple tissue integration for in vitro study of both the efficacy of and side effects associated with candidate drugs.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-08-20", "authors": ["AleksanderSkardal", "Sean VMurphy", "MaheshDevarasetty", "IvyMead", "Hyun-WookKang", "Young-JoonSeol", "YuShrike Zhang", "Su-RyonShin", "LiangZhao", "JulioAleman", "Adam RHall", "Thomas DShupe", "AndreKleensang", "Mehmet RDokmeci", "SangJin Lee", "John DJackson", "James JYoo", "ThomasHartung", "AliKhademhosseini", "ShaySoker", "Colin EBishop", "AnthonyAtala"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-08879-x\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0124\n10.1039/C5AN00524H\n10.1177/1535370214529397\n10.1177/1087057104265040\n10.1016/j.talanta.2014.06.020\n10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01723.x\n10.1002/biot.201100290\n10.1186/scrt377\n10.1517/17460441.2014.886562\n10.1146/annurev-pathol-012414-040418\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/3/031001\n10.1039/C6LC00450D\n10.1039/C6LC00598E\n10.1039/C6IB00039H\n10.1002/smll.201503208\n10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68438-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62354-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60542-0\n10.1016/j.ejpb.2006.01.014\n10.1039/b704961g\n10.1089/adt.2011.442\n10.1517/17460441.2015.1032241\n10.1038/srep20030\n10.1039/C5LC00392J\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1007/s10439-014-1207-1\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.04.045\n10.1002/adma.201001436\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.03.034\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.07.030\n10.1016/j.addr.2013.12.003\n10.1146/annurev.matsci.28.1.153\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010715-103644\n10.1186/scrt375\n10.1039/C5LC00666J\n10.1161/01.RES.84.1.21\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000139856.20505.57\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.06.024\n10.14503/THIJ-14-4254\n10.1002/1097-0142(19870501)59:9<1582::AID-CNCR2820590909>3.0.CO;2-#\n10.1073/pnas.1612906114"}

The current technology for detection is mainly based on large equipment such as readers and imaging systems, which require intensive and time-consuming procedures. A miniaturised bioluminescence sensing system, which would allow sensitive and continuous monitoring of ATP, with an integrated and low-cost disposable microfluidic chamber for handling of biological samples, is highly desirable. Here, we report the design, fabrication and testing of 3D printed microfluidics chips coupled with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for high sensitive real-time ATP detection. The 3D microfluidic chip reduces reactant consumption and facilitates solution delivery close to the SiPM to increase the detection efficiency. Our system detects ATP with a limit of detection (LoD) of 8nM and an analytical dynamic range between 15nM and 1\u00b5M, showing a stability error of 3%, and a reproducibility error below of 20%. We demonstrate the dynamic monitoring of ATP in a continuous-flow system exhibiting a fast response time, ~4s, and a full recovery to the baseline level within 17s.

This is particularly true for structures that interact with light via the collective motion of their conduction electrons (i.e., plasmonic materials), where the observation of exotic optical effects, such as negative refraction and electromagnetically induced transparency, require the coupling of modes that are only present in systems with nontrivial broken symmetries. Lithography has been the predominant fabrication technique for constructing plasmonic metamaterials, as it can be used to form patterns of arbitrary complexity, including those with broken symmetry. Here, we show that low-symmetry, one-dimensional plasmonic structures that would be challenging to make using traditional lithographic techniques can be assembled using DNA as a programmable surface ligand. We investigate the optical properties that arise as a result of systematic symmetry breaking and demonstrate the appearance of \u03c0-type coupled modes formed from both dipole and quadrupole nanoparticle sources.

However, both approaches face many limitations. On one hand, implants may suffer from poor osseointegration, and their rejection results in repeated surgery, patient's suffering, and extensive expenses. On the other hand, there are severe systemic adverse effects of toxic chemotherapeutics which are administrated systemically. In this paper, in order to address these two problems, we present a new type of localized drug-releasing titanium implants with enhanced implants' biointegration and drug release capabilities that could provide a high concentration of anticancer drugs locally to treat bone cancers. The implants are fabricated by 3D printing of Ti alloy followed by an anodization process featuring unique micro- (particles) and nanosurface (tubular arrays) topography. We successfully demonstrate their enhanced bone osseointegration and drug loading capabilities using two types of anticancer drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL).

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the influence of various factors (e.g. bioink concentration, viscosity, and extent of crosslinking) on cell printing and established a new 3D cell printing system equipped with heating modules for the precise stacking of decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM)-based 3D cell-laden constructs. Because the pH-adjusted bioink isolated from native tissue is safely gelled at 37\u2009\u00b0C, our heating system facilitated the precise stacking of dECM bioinks by enabling simultaneous gelation during printing. We observed greater printability compared with that of a non-heating system. These results were confirmed by mechanical testing and 3D construct stacking analyses.

A promising approach is in situ tissue engineering, whereby an acellular scaffold is implanted and provides stimulatory cues to guide the in situ remodeling into a functional blood vessel. An ideal scaffold should have sufficient binding sites for biomolecule immobilization and a mechanical property similar to native tissue. Here we developed a novel method to blend low molecular weight (LMW) elastic polymer during electrospinning process to increase conjugation sites and to improve the mechanical property of vascular grafts. LMW elastic polymer improved the elasticity of the scaffolds, and significantly increased the amount of heparin conjugated to the micro/nanofibrous scaffolds, which in turn increased the loading capacity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and prolonged the release of VEGF. Vascular grafts were implanted into the carotid artery of rats to evaluate the in vivo performance. VEGF treatment significantly enhanced endothelium formation and the overall patency of vascular grafts. Heparin coating also increased cell infiltration into the electrospun grafts, thus increasing the production of collagen and elastin within the graft wall.

However, most detection methods lack cost-effectiveness and field portability, which are essential features for achieving diagnosis in a timely manner. To address this, 3D-printed oblate spheroid sample chambers were fabricated to measure green light scattering of gold nanoparticles using an optical caustic focus to detect antibodies. Scattering signals of 20-200 nm gold nanoparticles using a green laser were compared to green light emitting diode (LED) light source signals and to Mie theory. The change in signal from 60 to 120 nm decreased in the order of Mie Theory > optical caustic scattering > 90\u00b0 scattering. These results suggested that conjugating 60 nm gold nanoparticles and using an optical caustic system to detect plasmonic light scattering, would result in a sensitive test for detecting human antibodies in serum. Therefore, we studied the light scattering response of conjugated gold nanoparticles exposed to different concentrations of anti-protein E antibody, and a feasibility study of 10 human serum samples using dot blot and a handheld optical caustic-based sensor device.

{"title": "[Precision of three-dimensional printed brackets].", "abstract": "This study was based on digital orthodontic diagnosis work flow for indirect bonding transfer tray model design and three-dimensional (3D) printing, and the aim of this paper was to inspect the dimensional accuracyof 3D printed brackets, which is the foundation of the follow up work and hoped that will illuminate the clinical application of the digital orthodontics work flow.\nThe samples which consisted of 14 cases of patients with malocclusion from Department of Orthodontics Peking University were selected, including 8 cases with tooth extraction and 6 cases without tooth extraction. All the 14 patients were taken intra-oral scan (Trios 3Shape, Denmark) and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT, NewTom 3G volumetric scanner, Aperio Service,Italy)shooting after periodontal treatment. STL data and DICOM data were obtained from intraoral scans and CBCT images.Data segmentation, registration, fusion, automatic tooth arrangement, virtual positioning of orthodontic appliance and conversion the coordinates of malocclusion model were all done with self-programming software. The data of 3D printing model with brackets on it were output finally and printed out with EDEN260V (Objet Geometries, Israel) to make indirect bonding transfer tray. Digital vernier caliper was used to measure the length and width of upper and lower left brackets and buccal tubes on those 3D models after removal of surrounding supporting material by ultrasonic vibration and water-spray. Intra-examiner reliability was assessed by using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), and one-sample T test was used to compare the measurements with the standard dimensional data of the brackets.\nThere were significant differences which range in 0.04-0.17 mm between the 13 items out of the 19 measurement items. Except for the length of the lower left premolars'brackets, mean values of the other items were greater than the test value.\nAlthough the measurement results in the width of brackets and the width and length of the buccal tubes obtained experimentally were slightly larger than the test value,this may not reduce the accuracy of indirect bonding procedure in clinic necessarily. Whether the differences which range in 0.04-0.17 mm would actually affect the retention and positioning of brackets needs to be confirmed by further studies.", "journal": "Beijing da xue xue bao.

The electronic and control design of a low-cost prosthetic hand, the Touch Hand II, is discussed. This paper shows that sensorless techniques can be used to reduce design complexities, costs, and provide easier access to the electronics. A closing and opening finite state machine (COFSM) was developed to handle the actuated digit joint control state and a supervisory switching control scheme, used for speed and grip strength control. Three torque and speed settings were created to be preset for specific grasps. The hand was able to replicate ten frequently used grasps and grip some common objects.

The anatomically scalable transfemoral prosthetic knee is 3D printed out of a carbon-fiber and nylon composite that has a gear-mesh coupling with a hard-stop weight-actuated locking mechanism aided by a cross-linked four-bar spring mechanism. This design can be scaled using anatomical dimensions of a human femur and tibia to have a unique fit for each user. The transfemoral amputee who was tested is high functioning and walked on the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) at a self-selected pace. The motion capture and force data that was collected showed that there were distinct differences in the gait dynamics. The data was used to perform the Combined Gait Asymmetry Metric (CGAM), where the scores revealed that the overall asymmetry of the gait on the Ossur Total Knee was more asymmetric than the anatomically scalable transfemoral prosthetic knee. The anatomically scalable transfemoral prosthetic knee had higher peak knee flexion that caused a large step time asymmetry. This made walking on the anatomically scalable transfemoral prosthetic knee more strenuous due to the compensatory movements in adapting to the different dynamics. This can be overcome by tuning the cross-linked spring mechanism to emulate the dynamics of the subject better. The subject stated that the knee would be good for daily use and has the potential to be adapted as a running knee.", "journal": "IEEE ...

{"title": "3D-Printed pHEMA Materials for Topographical and Biochemical Modulation of Dorsal Root Ganglion Cell Response.", "abstract": "Understanding and controlling the interactions occurring between cells and engineered materials are central challenges toward progress in the development of biomedical devices. In this work, we describe materials for direct ink writing (DIW), an extrusion-based type of 3D printing, that embed a custom synthetic protein (RGD-PDL) within the microfilaments of 3D-hydrogel scaffolds to modify these interactions and differentially direct tissue-level organization of complex cell populations in vitro. The RGD-PDL is synthesized by modifying poly-d-lysine (PDL) to varying extents with peptides containing the integrin-binding motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). Compositional gradients of the RGD-PDL presented by both patterned and thin-film poly(2-hydroxyethyl) methacrylate (pHEMA) substrates allow the patterning of cell-growth compliance in a grayscale form. The surface chemistry-dependent guidance of cell growth on the RGD-PDL-modified pHEMA materials is demonstrated using a model NIH-3T3 fibroblast cell line. The formation of a more complex cellular system-organotypic primary murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-in culture is also achieved on these scaffolds, where distinctive forms of cell growth and migration guidance are seen depending on their RGD-PDL content and topography.

{"title": "A microfluidic platform for modeling metastatic cancer cell matrix invasion.", "abstract": "Invasion of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in the colonization of metastatic tumors. The invasion process is thought to be driven by both chemokine signaling and interactions between invading cancer cells and physical components of the metastatic niche, including endothelial cells that line capillary walls and serve as a barrier to both diffusion and invasion of the underlying tissue. Transwell chambers, a tool for generating artificial chemokine gradients to induce cell migration, have facilitated recent work to investigate the chemokine contributions to matrix invasion. These chambers, however, are poorly designed for imaging, which limits their use in investigating the physical cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions driving matrix invasion. Microfluidic devices offer a promising model in which the invasion process can be imaged. Many current designs, however, have limited surface areas and possess intricate geometries that preclude the use of standard staining protocols to visualize cells and matrix proteins. In this work, we present a novel microfluidic platform for imaging cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions driving metastatic cancer cell matrix invasion. Our model is applied to investigate how endothelial cell-secreted matrix proteins and the physical endothelial monolayer itself interact with invading metastatic breast cancer cells to facilitate invasion of an underlying type I collagen gel. The results show that matrix invasion of metastatic breast cancer cells is significantly enhanced in the presence of live endothelial cells. Probing this interaction further, our platform revealed that, while the fibronectin-rich matrix deposited by endothelial cells was not sufficient to drive invasion alone, metastatic breast cancer cells were able to exploit components of energetically inactivated endothelial cells to gain entry into the underlying matrix. These findings reveal novel cell-cell interactions driving a key step in the colonization of metastatic tumors and have important implications for designing drugs targeted at preventing cancer metastasis.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-08-17", "authors": ["LauraBlaha", "ChentianZhang", "MarioCabodi", "Joyce YWong"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa869d\n10.1002/0471739499\n10.1155/2012/676731\n10.1152/ajpheart.00042.2016"}

The focal complex (FC) and focal adhesion (FA) have been substantially investigated in conventional planar culture systems using fibroblasts as an in vitro model. However, the formation of more mature types of cell-matrix adhesion in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), including fibrillar adhesion (FBA) and 3D matrix adhesion (3DMA), have not been fully elucidated. Here we investigate the niche factor(s) that influence(s) the maturation of FBA and 3DMA by using multiphoton fabrication-based micropatterning. First, the bovine serum albumin (BSA)-made protein micropatterns were functionalized by incorporating various concentrations of fibronectin (FN) in fabrication solution. The amount of cross-linked FN is positively correlated with the initial concentration of FN in the reaction liquid, as verified by immunofluorescence staining. On the other hand, the anisotropic FN-functionalized micropatterns were fabricated by varying the length (i.e., in-plane stiffness) and height (i.e., bending stiffness) of micropatterns, respectively. Finally, hMSCs were cultured on these micropatterns for 2 h and 1 day to determine the formation of FBA and 3DMA, respectively, using immunofluorescence staining. Results demonstrated that FN-functionalized micropatterns with high anisotropy in x-y dimension benefit FBA maturation. Furthermore, niche factors such as higher bending and in-plane stiffness and the presence of abundant fibronectin have a positive effect on the maturation of FN-based cell-matrix adhesion.

Such assessments are necessary to conduct before implementation of the scaffolds for tissue healing in vivo. The scaffold extracellular matrix must provide the biochemical and mechanical cues necessary to promote cellular attachment, migration and proliferation before differentiation and new tissue deposition can occur. In this study, an in vitro evaluation was conducted to assess the ability of scaffolds three-dimensional (3D) printed with a previously developed alginate-polyvinyl alcohol-hydroxyapatite formulation to promote proliferation of encapsulated MC3T3 cells. A systematic investigation was conducted to increase cell proliferation, and it was determined that the concentration and duration of the calcium bath have a less effect on proliferation than the composition of the formulation itself. Collagen gel was incorporated into the formulation to provide cells with adhesion sites necessary to sufficiently attach to the matrix. Enhanced proliferation was achieved within scaffolds of increased collagen content and sufficient crosslinking. This highlighted the importance of the synergistic effect created as a result of sufficient ligand density coupled with appropriate scaffold mechanical rigidity to provide a suitable environment for proliferation. Thus, these 3D printed tri-polymer scaffolds have the ability to support cell proliferation and have potential to promote cell differentiation and new bone tissue deposition. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

As a result, there is real promise that strategies to regenerate rather than replace damaged or diseased bones and joints will one day reach the clinic however, a number of major challenges must still be addressed before this becomes a reality. These include vascularization in the context of large bone defect repair, engineering complex gradients for bone-soft tissue interface regeneration and recapitulating the stratified zonal architecture present in many adult tissues such as articular cartilage. Tissue engineered constructs typically lack such spatial complexity in cell types and tissue organization, which may explain their relatively limited success to date. This has led to increased interest in bioprinting technologies in the field of musculoskeletal tissue engineering. The additive, layer by layer nature of such biofabrication strategies makes it possible to generate zonal distributions of cells, matrix and bioactive cues in 3D.

A cell-laden blend of alginate with silk fibroin is utilized to achieve rapid gelation by calcium alginate formation during printing; it is followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalyzed covalent cross-linking of the fibroin protein at tyrosine residues after printing. This two-step gelation process successfully enables 3D bioprinting of well-defined cell-laden silk fibroin constructs suitable for long-term culture. The constructs remain intact after calcium chelation to liquefy the alginate component, demonstrating the formation of silk fibroin hydrogel.

Producing cardiac tissues directly from pluripotent stem cells rather than assembling tissues using pre-differentiated cells can eliminate multiple cell-handling steps that otherwise limit the potential for process automation and production scale-up. Here we asked whether our process for forming 3D developing human engineered cardiac tissues using poly(ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen hydrogels can be extended to widely used and printable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels. We demonstrate that low-density GelMA hydrogels can be formed rapidly using visible light (<1 min) and successfully employed to encapsulate human induced pluripotent stem cells while maintaining high cell viability. Resulting constructs had an initial stiffness of approximately 220 Pa, supported tissue growth and dynamic remodeling, and facilitated high-efficiency cardiac differentiation (>70%) to produce spontaneously contracting GelMA human engineered cardiac tissues (GEhECTs). GEhECTs initiated spontaneous contractions on day 8 of differentiation, with synchronicity, frequency, and velocity of contraction increasing over time, and displayed developmentally appropriate temporal changes in cardiac gene expression. GEhECT-dissociated cardiomyocytes displayed well-defined and aligned sarcomeres spaced at 1.85 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcm and responded appropriately to drug treatments, including the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and antagonist propranolol, as well as to outside pacing up to 3.0 Hz.

Native tissue derived ECM is typically grounded into powders that can be further processed into hybrid composites in the form of hydrogels, foams, nanofibers, and 3D-printed complex constructs.

Two experimental cases were performed for comparison to evaluate this novel route's effect. In the first case, SS316 layer was directly deposited on Ti6Al4V substrate by laser 3D printing, but the sample cracked in the printing process. Then fracture morphology, phase identification, and micro-hardness were analyzed. In the second case, a multi-metallic structure was fabricated via laser 3D printing following the transition route. Microstructure characterization and composition distribution were analyzed via scanning electron microscope(SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry(EDS). x-ray diffraction(XRD) tests demonstrated the intermetallics were effectively avoided following the transition route.

Inaccuracies are due to errors that occur during the imaging, segmentation, postprocessing, and 3D printing steps. Radiologists' understanding of the factors that influence 3D printed model accuracy and the metrics used to measure this accuracy is key in directing appropriate practices and establishing reference standards and validation procedures. The authors review the various factors in each step of the 3D model printing process that contribute to model inaccuracy, including the intrinsic limitations of each printing technology. In addition, common sources of model inaccuracy are illustrated. Metrics involving comparisons of model dimensions and morphology that have been developed to quantify differences between 3D models also are described and illustrated. These metrics can be used to define the accuracy of a model, as compared with the reference standard, and to measure the variability of models created by different observers or using different workflows. The accuracies reported for specific indications of 3D printing are summarized, and potential guidelines for quality assurance and workflow assessment are discussed.

{"title": "The Ultrasonic Directional Tidal Breathing Pattern Sensor: Equitable Design Realization Based on Phase Information.", "abstract": "Pulmonary ailments are conventionally diagnosed by spirometry. The complex forceful breathing maneuver as well as the extreme cost of spirometry renders it unsuitable in many situations. This work is aimed to facilitate an emerging direction of tidal breathing-based pulmonary evaluation by designing a novel, equitable, precise and portable device for acquisition and analysis of directional tidal breathing patterns, in real time. The proposed system primarily uses an in-house designed blow pipe, 40-kHz air-coupled ultrasound transreceivers, and a radio frequency (RF) phase-gain integrated circuit (IC). Moreover, in order to achieve high sensitivity in a cost-effective design philosophy, we have exploited the phase measurement technique, instead of selecting the contemporary time-of-flight (TOF) measurement; since application of the TOF principle in tidal breathing assessments requires sub-micro to nanosecond time resolution. This approach, which depends on accurate phase measurement, contributed to enhanced sensitivity using a simple electronics design. The developed system has been calibrated using a standard 3-L calibration syringe. The parameters of this system are validated against a standard spirometer, with maximum percentage error below 16%. Further, the extracted respiratory parameters related to tidal breathing have been found to be comparable with relevant prior works. The error in detecting respiration rate only is 3.9% compared to manual evaluation. These encouraging insights reveal the definite potential of our tidal breathing pattern (TBP) prototype for measuring tidal breathing parameters in order to extend the reach of affordable healthcare in rural regions and developing areas.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-12", "authors": ["ArijitSinharay", "RajRakshit", "AnweshaKhasnobish", "TapasChakravarty", "DebGhosh", "ArpanPal"], "doi": "10.3390/s17081853\n10.1097/00063198-199903000-00003\n10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61303-9\n10.1016/S0012-3692(15)31481-1\n10.4187/respcare.01640\n10.3390/s16071008\n10.1183/09031936.05.00035205\n10.1007/s10877-013-9497-7\n10.1164/ajrccm.153.4.8616550\n10.1136/thx.36.2.135\n10.1034/j.1399-3003.2000.16f26.x\n10.1183/09031936.96.09061306\n10.1002/ppul.21272\n10.1006/cbmr.1998.1493\n10.1164/ajrccm.150.5.7952563\n10.1183/09031936.03.00024703\n10.1542/neo.5-5-e186\n10.1109/JBHI.2015.2445783\n10.1109/TBME.2015.2466633\n10.1007/s10439-014-1073-x\n10.1542/peds.2011-0271\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00028.2002\n10.1109/TBME.2010.2051668\n10.3390/s90402574\n10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2365776\n10.3390/s16081305\n10.3390/s150510705\n10.1111/j.1600-0668.2009.00623.x\n10.3390/s130303501\n10.1016/S0034-5687(00)00154-7\n10.1051/epjconf/20134501025\n10.1109/JBHI.2016.2532876\n10.1371/journal.pone.0059970"}

For fast and flexible manufacturing and marking of MPS, a concept for a universal micromachining platform has been developed which provides the following latest key technologies: laser micro cutting of polymer foils, laser micro- and sub-micro-structuring of polymer foils, 3D printing of polymer components as well as optical inspection and online process control. The combination of different laser sources, processing optics, inspection systems, and print heads on multiple axes allows the change and exactly positioning to the workpiece during the process. Therewith, the realization of MPS including 3D printed components as well as direct laser interference patterned surfaces for well-defined cell adhesion and product protection is possible. Additional basic technologies for the generation of periodical line-like structures at polycarbonate foils using special Direct Laser Interference Patterning (DLIP) optics as well as for the 3D printing of fluid-tight cell culture reservoirs made of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene directly onto polycarbonate microfluidics were established.

{"title": "Computationally designed lattices with tuned properties for tissue engineering using 3D printing.", "abstract": "Tissue scaffolds provide structural support while facilitating tissue growth, but are challenging to design due to diverse property trade-offs. Here, a computational approach was developed for modeling scaffolds with lattice structures of eight different topologies and assessing properties relevant to bone tissue engineering applications. Evaluated properties include porosity, pore size, surface-volume ratio, elastic modulus, shear modulus, and permeability. Lattice topologies were generated by patterning beam-based unit cells, with design parameters for beam diameter and unit cell length. Finite element simulations were conducted for each topology and quantified how elastic modulus and shear modulus scale with porosity, and how permeability scales with porosity cubed over surface-volume ratio squared. Lattices were compared with controlled properties related to porosity and pore size. Relative comparisons suggest that lattice topology leads to specializations in achievable properties. For instance, Cube topologies tend to have high elastic and low shear moduli while Octet topologies have high shear moduli and surface-volume ratios but low permeability. The developed method was utilized to analyze property trade-offs as beam diameter was altered for a given topology, and used to prototype a 3D printed lattice embedded in an interbody cage for spinal fusion treatments.

{"title": "GelMA-collagen blends enable drop-on-demand 3D printablility and promote angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Effective vascularization is crucial for three-dimensional (3D) printed hydrogel-cell constructs to efficiently supply cells with oxygen and nutrients. Till date, several hydrogel blends have been developed that allow the in vitro formation of a capillary-like network within the gels but comparatively less effort has been made to improve the suitability of the materials for a 3D bioprinting process. Therefore, we hypothesize that tailored hydrogel blends of photo-crosslinkable gelatin and type I collagen exhibit favorable 3D drop-on-demand printing characteristics in terms of rheological and mechanical properties and that further capillary-like network formation can be induced by co-culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human mesenchymal stem cells within the proposed blends. Gelatin was methacrylated (GelMA) at a high degree of functionalization, mixed with cells, type I collagen, and the photoinitiator Irgacure 2959 and then subsequently crosslinked with UV light. After 14 d of incubation, cells were immunofluorescently labeled (CD31) and displayed using two-photon laser scanning microscopy. Hydrogels were rheologically characterized and dispensable droplet volumes were measured using a custom built 3D drop-on-demand bioprinter. The cell viability remained high in controllable crosslinking conditions both in 2D and 3D. In general, higher UV light exposure and increased Irgacure concentration were associated with lower cell viabilities. Distinctive capillary-like structures were formed in 3D printable GelMA-collagen hydrogels. The characteristic crosslinking time for GelMA in the range of minutes was not altered when GelMA was blended with type I collagen. Moreover, the addition of collagen led to enhanced cell spreading, a shear thinning behavior of the hydrogel solution and increased the storage modulus of the crosslinked gel. We therefore conclude that GelMA-collagen hydrogels exhibit favorable biological as well as rheological properties which are suitable for the manufacturing of pre-vascularized tissue replacement by 3D bioprinting.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-08-11", "authors": ["HenrikeStratesteffen", "MariusK\u00f6pf", "FranziskaKreimendahl", "AndreasBlaeser", "StefanJockenhoevel", "HorstFischer"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa857c"}
{"title": "Fixation of Hydrogel Constructs for Cartilage Repair in the Equine Model: A Challenging Issue.", "abstract": "To report on the experiences with the use of commercial and autologous fibrin glue (AFG) and of an alternative method based on a 3D-printed polycaprolactone (PCL) anchor for the fixation of hydrogel-based scaffolds in an equine model for cartilage repair.\nIn a first study, three different hydrogel-based materials were orthotopically implanted in nine horses for 1-4 weeks in 6\u2009mm diameter full-thickness cartilage defects in the medial femoral trochlear ridge and fixated with commercially available fibrin glue (CFG). One defect was filled with CFG only as a control. In a second study, CFG and AFG were compared in an ectopic equine model. The third study compared the efficacy of AFG and a 3D-printed PCL-based osteal anchor for fixation of PCL-reinforced hydrogels in three horses for 2 weeks, with a 4-week follow-up to evaluate integration of bone with the PCL anchor. Short-term scaffold integration and cell infiltration were evaluated by microcomputed tomography and histology as outcome parameters.\nThe first study showed signs of subchondral bone resorption in all defects, including the controls filled with CFG only, with significant infiltration of neutrophils. Ectopically, CFG induced clear inflammation with strong neutrophil accumulation; AFG was less reactive, showing fibroblast infiltration only. In the third study the fixation potential for PCL-reinforced hydrogels of AFG was inferior to the PCL anchor. PCL reinforcement had disappeared from two defects and showed signs of dislodging in the remaining four. All six constructs fixated with the PCL anchor were still in place after 2 weeks. At 4 weeks, the PCL anchor showed good integration and signs of new bone formation.\nThe use of AFG should be preferred to xenogeneic products in the horse, but AFG is subject to individual variations and laborious to make. The PCL anchor provides the best fixation; however, this technique involves the whole osteochondral unit, which entails a different conceptual approach to cartilage repair.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Herein, we show that rod-like cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)-based NP-surfactants, termed CNC-surfactants, are formed rapidly at the liquid/liquid interface, assemble into a monolayer, and, when jammed, offer a robust assembly with exceptional mechanical properties. Plateau-Rayleigh (PR) instabilities of a free-falling jet of an aqueous medium containing the CNCs into a toluene solution of amine end-functionalized polystyrene are completely suppressed, allowing the jetting of aqueous tubules that are stabilized when the CNC-surfactants are jammed at the interface.

{"title": "Microtissues Enhance Smooth Muscle Differentiation and Cell Viability of hADSCs for Three Dimensional Bioprinting.", "abstract": "Smooth muscle differentiated human adipose derived stem cells (hADSCs) provide a crucial stem cell source for urinary tissue engineering, but the induction of hADSCs for smooth muscle differentiation still has several issues to overcome, including a relatively long induction time and equipment dependence, which limits access to abundant stem cells within a short period of time for further application. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting holds great promise in regenerative medicine due to its controllable construction of a designed 3D structure. When evenly mixed with bioink, stem cells can be spatially distributed within a bioprinted 3D structure, thus avoiding drawbacks such as, stem cell detachment in a conventional cell-scaffold strategy. Notwithstanding the advantages mentioned above, cell viability is often compromised during 3D bioprinting, which is often due to pressure during the bioprinting process. The objective of our study was to improve the efficiency of hADSC smooth muscle differentiation and cell viability of a 3D bioprinted structure. Here, we employed the hanging-drop method to generate hADSC microtissues in a smooth muscle inductive medium containing human transforming growth factor \u03b21 and bioprinted the induced microtissues onto a 3D structure. After 3 days of smooth muscle induction, the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and smoothelin was higher in microtissues than in their counterpart monolayer cultured hADSCs, as confirmed by immunofluorescence and western blotting analysis. The semi-quantitative assay showed that the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) was 0.218 \u00b1 0.077 in MTs and 0.082 \u00b1 0.007 in Controls; smoothelin expression was 0.319 \u00b1 0.02 in MTs and 0.178 \u00b1 0.06 in Controls. Induced MTs maintained their phenotype after the bioprinting process. Live/dead and cell count kit 8 assays showed that cell viability and cell proliferation in the 3D structure printed with microtissues were higher at all time points compared to the conventional single-cell bioprinting strategy (mean cell viability was 88.16 \u00b1 3.98 vs. 61.76 \u00b1 15% for microtissues and single-cells, respectively).

{"title": "3D printed personalized titanium plates improve clinical outcome in microwave ablation of bone tumors around the knee.", "abstract": "Microwave ablation has been widely accepted in treating bone tumor. However, its procedure is time-consuming and usually results in postoperative fractures. To solve this problem, we designed and fabricated titanium plates customized to the patients' bone structures. The personalized titanium plates were then used for fixation after the removal of tumorous tissue. Specifically, 3D models of tumor-bearing bone segments were constructed by using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The 3D models were used to design the personalized titanium plates. The plate model was transferred into a numerical control machine for manufacturing the personalized titanium plates by 3D printing. The plates were then surgically implanted for reconstruction assistance following microwave-induced hyperthermia to remove the bone tumor. Implementation parameters and knee functions were then evaluated. No postoperative fractures, implant failures or loosening problems occurred; mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 27.17 from the latest follow-up. Mean maximum flexion of affected knees was 114.08\u00b0. The results of knee gait analysis were comparable with normal population data.

{"title": "From Stochastic Foam to Designed Structure: Balancing Cost and Performance of Cellular Metals.", "abstract": "Over the past two decades, a large number of metallic foams have been developed. In recent years research on this multi-functional material class has further intensified. However, despite their unique properties only a limited number of large-scale applications have emerged. One important reason for this sluggish uptake is their high cost. Many cellular metals require expensive raw materials, complex manufacturing procedures, or a combination thereof. Some attempts have been made to decrease costs by introducing novel foams based on cheaper components and new manufacturing procedures. However, this has often yielded materials with unreliable properties that inhibit utilization of their full potential. The resulting balance between cost and performance of cellular metals is probed in this editorial, which attempts to consider cost not in absolute figures, but in relation to performance. To approach such a distinction, an alternative classification of cellular metals is suggested which centers on structural aspects and the effort of realizing them.

Staff participants also completed a 1-month focus group, and staff and family members were administered a 3D printing review checklist at 1-month.\nThe integrated qualitative and quantitative data strongly suggested that PWMLs enjoyed using the 3D objects, were engaged while doing so and appeared to value the objects due to their personalized nature. The use of 3D printed objects also appeared to encourage family involvement as well as family and staff interactions with PWMLs.

{"title": "Clinical effects of 3-D printing-assisted personalized reconstructive surgery for blowout orbital fractures.", "abstract": "One of the key challenges during orbital fracture reconstructive surgery, due to the complex anatomy of the orbit, is shaping and trimming the precise contour of the implants. The objectives of this study were to describe and evaluate the use of a three-dimensional (3-D) printing technique for personalized reconstructive surgery for repairing orbital fractures.\nA total of 29 cases which had 3-D technique-assisted surgical reconstruction, and 27 cases which had traditional surgery, were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative CT images were measured using MIMICS software, and the contour of the fracture zone and the Medpor-titanium implant were analyzed and compared. The surgical duration was also compared between the two groups.\nThere were statistically significant differences in the maximum width, depth and area between fracture zone and implant between the two groups, with the absolute value in the 3-D group markedly lower as compared to the control group. In addition, the difference in the medial-inferior wall angle between the surgical eye and healthy eye was also statistically significant between the groups. The average surgical duration in the 3-D group was substantially shorter than in the control group. Additionally, the postoperative clinical evaluation in the 3-D group was superior to that of the control group.\nThe 3-D printing technique is of great value for predicting the precise fracture zone before, and during, personalized surgery, and can help surgeons achieve accurate anatomical reconstruction for repairs of blowout orbital fractures. Moreover, the simulated bone template produced by 3-D printing models allows for \"true-to-original\" orbital reconstruction, which can shorten the surgical duration and improve the accuracy and safety of the operation.", "journal": "Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie", "date": "2017-08-09", "authors": ["BinFan", "HanChen", "Ying-JianSun", "Bei-FenWang", "LinChe", "Shu-YanLiu", "Guang-YuLi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00417-017-3766-y"}

Due to the limited variety of printable materials, most studies on printed supercapacitors focus on printing the electrode materials but rarely the full-packaged cell. This work presents for the first time the printing of a fully packaged single-wall carbon nanotube-based supercapacitor with direct ink writing (DIW) technology. Enabled by the developed ink formula, DIW setup, and cell architecture, the whole printing process is mask free, transfer free, and alignment free with precise and repeatable control on the spatial distribution of all constituent materials. Studies on cell design show that a wider electrode pattern and narrower gap distance between electrodes lead to higher specific capacitance.

{"title": "Customized, degradable, functionally graded scaffold for potential treatment of early stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head.", "abstract": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a debilitating disease that results in progressive collapse of the femoral head and subsequent degenerative arthritis. Few treatments provide both sufficient mechanical support and biological cues for regeneration of bone and vascularity when the femoral head is still round and therefore salvageable. We designed and 3D printed a functionally graded scaffold (FGS) made of polycaprolactone (PCL) and \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) with spatially controlled porosity, degradation, and mechanical strength properties to reconstruct necrotic bone tissue in the femoral head. The FGS was designed to have low porosity segments (15% in proximal and distal segments) and a high porosity segment (60% in middle segment) according to the desired mechanical and osteoconductive properties at each specific site after implantation into the femoral head. The FGS was inserted into a bone tunnel drilled in rabbit femoral neck and head, and at 8 weeks after implantation, the tissue formation as well as scaffold degradation was analyzed. Micro-CT analysis demonstrated that the FGS-filled group had a significantly higher bone ingrowth ratio compared to the empty-tunnel group, and the difference was higher at the distal low porosity segments. The in vivo degradation rate of the scaffold was higher in the proximal and distal segments than in the middle segment. Histological analysis of both non-decalcified and calcified samples clearly indicated new bone ingrowth and bone marrow-containing bone formation across the FGS. A 3D printed PCL-\u03b2-TCP FGS appears to be a promising customized resorbable load-bearing implant for treatment of early stage ONFH. \u00a9 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

{"title": "The bio in the ink: cartilage regeneration with bioprintable hydrogels and articular cartilage-derived progenitor cells.", "abstract": "Cell-laden hydrogels are the primary building blocks for bioprinting, and, also termed bioinks, are the foundations for creating structures that can potentially recapitulate the architecture of articular cartilage. To be functional, hydrogel constructs need to unlock the regenerative capacity of encapsulated cells. The recent identification of multipotent articular cartilage-resident chondroprogenitor cells (ACPCs), which share important traits with adult stem cells, represents a new opportunity for cartilage regeneration. However, little is known about the suitability of ACPCs for tissue engineering, especially in combination with biomaterials. This study aimed to investigate the potential of ACPCs in hydrogels for cartilage regeneration and biofabrication, and to evaluate their ability for zone-specific matrix production. Gelatin methacryloyl (gelMA)-based hydrogels were used to culture ACPCs, bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and chondrocytes, and as bioinks for printing. Our data shows ACPCs outperformed chondrocytes in terms of neo-cartilage production and unlike MSCs, ACPCs had the lowest gene expression levels of hypertrophy marker collagen type X, and the highest expression of PRG4, a key factor in joint lubrication. Co-cultures of the cell types in multi-compartment hydrogels allowed generating constructs with a layered distribution of collagens and glycosaminoglycans. By combining ACPC- and MSC-laden bioinks, a bioprinted model of articular cartilage was generated, consisting of defined superficial and deep regions, each with distinct cellular and extracellular matrix composition. Taken together, these results provide important information for the use of ACPC-laden hydrogels in regenerative medicine, and pave the way to the biofabrication of 3D constructs with multiple cell types for cartilage regeneration or in vitro tissue models.\nDespite its limited ability to repair, articular cartilage harbors an endogenous population of progenitor cells (ACPCs), that to date, received limited attention in biomaterials and tissue engineering applications. Harnessing the potential of these cells in 3D hydrogels can open new avenues for biomaterial-based regenerative therapies, especially with advanced biofabrication technologies (e.g. bioprinting). This study highlights the potential of ACPCs to generate neo-cartilage in a gelatin-based hydrogel and bioink. The ACPC-laden hydrogel is a suitable substrate for chondrogenesis and data shows it has a bias in directing cells towards a superficial zone phenotype. For the first time, ACPC-hydrogels are evaluated both as alternative for and in combination with chondrocytes and MSCs, using co-cultures and bioprinting for cartilage regeneration in vitro.

{"title": "Nanomedicine and advanced technologies for burns: Preventing infection and facilitating wound healing.", "abstract": "According to the latest report from the World Health Organization, an estimated 265,000 deaths still occur every year as a direct result of burn injuries. A widespread range of these deaths induced by burn wound happens in low- and middle-income countries, where survivors face a lifetime of morbidity. Most of the deaths occur due to infections when a high percentage of the external regions of the body area is affected. Microbial nutrient availability, skin barrier disruption, and vascular supply destruction in burn injuries as well as systemic immunosuppression are important parameters that cause burns to be susceptible to infections. Topical antimicrobials and dressings are generally employed to inhibit burn infections followed by a burn wound therapy, because systemic antibiotics have problems in reaching the infected site, coupled with increasing microbial drug resistance. Nanotechnology has provided a range of molecular designed nanostructures (NS) that can be used in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications in burns. These NSs can be divided into organic and non-organic (such as polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) and silver NPs, respectively), and many have been designed to display multifunctional activity. The present review covers the physiology of skin, burn classification, burn wound pathogenesis, animal models of burn wound infection, and various topical therapeutic approaches designed to combat infection and stimulate healing. These include biological based approaches (e.g. immune-based antimicrobial molecules, therapeutic microorganisms, antimicrobial agents, etc.), antimicrobial photo- and ultrasound-therapy, as well as nanotechnology-based wound healing approaches as a revolutionizing area. Thus, we focus on organic and non-organic NSs designed to deliver growth factors to burned skin, and scaffolds, dressings, etc. for exogenous stem cells to aid skin regeneration. Eventually, recent breakthroughs and technologies with substantial potentials in tissue regeneration and skin wound therapy (that are as the basis of burn wound therapies) are briefly taken into consideration including 3D-printing, cell-imprinted substrates, nano-architectured surfaces, and novel gene-editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas.", "journal": "Advanced drug delivery reviews", "date": "2017-08-08", "authors": ["Mirza AliMofazzal Jahromi", "ParhamSahandi Zangabad", "Seyed MasoudMoosavi Basri", "KeyvanSahandi Zangabad", "AmenehGhamarypour", "Amir RAref", "MahdiKarimi", "Michael RHamblin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.addr.2017.08.001"}
{"title": "Cytocompatibility testing of hydrogels toward bioprinting of mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a very attractive cell source for tissue engineering applications aiming at the generation of artificial bone substitutes. The use of three-dimensional bioprinting technologies has the potential to improve the classical tissue engineering approach because bioprinting will allow the generation of hydrogel scaffolds with high spatial control of MSC allocation within the bioprinted construct. In this study, we have performed direct comparisons between commercially available hydrogels in the context of their cytocompatibility toward MSCs and their physicochemical parameters with the aim to identify the most suitable hydrogel for drop-on-demand (DoD) printing of MSCs. In this context, we examined matrigel, fibrin, collagen, gelatin, and gelatin/alginate at various hydrogel concentrations. Matrigel, fibrin, collagen, and gelatin were able to support cell viability, but the latter showed a limited potential to promote MSC proliferation. We concentrated our study on fibrin and collagen hydrogels and investigated the effect of hydroxyapatite (HA) inclusion. The inclusion of HA enhanced proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and prevented degradation of fibrin in vitro. According to viscosity and storage moduli measurements, HA-blends displayed physicochemical characteristics suitable for DoD printing. In bioprinting experiments, we confirmed that fibrin and collagen and their respective HA-blends represent excellent hydrogels for DoD-based printing as evidenced by high survival rates of printed MSCs. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, efficient delivery systems and design of stable dosage forms are required for inhalation therapy, as well as cost-effective methods for manufacturing of the final product. In this study, a 3D-printed micromixer was used for preparation of siRNA-dendrimer nanocomplexes, which were subsequently processed into microparticle-based dry powders for inhalation using spray drying. By applying the disposable micromixer, nanocomplexes were prepared of an average hydrodynamic diameter comparable to that of nanocomplexes prepared by manual mixing, but with narrower size distribution and low batch-to-batch variation. The nanocomplexes were processed into nanoembedded microparticles using different saccharide excipients. Data showed that siRNA integrity and bioactivity are retained after processing, and nanocomplexes could be reconstituted from the dry powders. The amorphous saccharide excipients trehalose and inulin provided better stabilization than crystalline mannitol, and they enabled full reconstitution of the nanocomplexes. In particular, a binary mixture of trehalose and inulin showed optimal stabilization, and enhanced cellular uptake and gene silencing efficiency. This study demonstrates that inexpensive and scalable micromixers can be used to optimize the production of siRNA-dendrimer nanocomplexes, and they can be applied in combination with spray drying for the engineering of dry powder formulations suitable for delivery of siRNA to the therapeutic target site.", "journal": "European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V", "date": "2017-08-07", "authors": ["MonicaAgnoletti", "AdamBohr", "KaushikThanki", "FengWan", "XianghuiZeng", "Johan PeterBoetker", "MingshiYang", "CamillaFoged"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejpb.2017.08.001"}

{"title": "Three-dimensionally printed polyetherketoneketone scaffolds with mesenchymal stem cells for the reconstruction of critical-sized mandibular defects.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing offers a tailored approach to tissue engineering by providing anatomically precise scaffolds onto which stem cells and growth factors can be supplied. Polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), an ideal candidate biomaterial, is limited by a poor implant-bone interface but can be functionalized with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) to promote integration. This in vivo study examined the interaction of a three-dimensional printed PEKK/ADSC implant within the critical-sized mandibular defect in a rabbit model.\nTrapezoidal porous scaffolds with dimensions of 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009cm were printed using selective laser sintering. ADSCs were seeded on the scaffolds that were then implanted in marginal defects created in New Zealand rabbits. Rabbits were euthanized at 10- and 20-week intervals. Microcomputed tomography was used to characterize bone ingrowth and was correlated with histological analysis. Stress testing was performed on the scaffolds before and after implantation.\nAll scaffolds were well integrated into adjacent bone. Bone-to-tissue volume increased from 30.34% (\u2009\u00b1\u200912.46) to 61.27% (\u2009\u00b1\u20098.24), and trabecular thickness increased from 0.178\u2009mm (\u2009\u00b1\u20090.069) to 0.331\u2009mm (\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0306) in the 10- and 20-week groups, respectively, compared to no bone regrowth on the control side (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Histology confirmed integration at the bone-implant interface. Biomechanical testing revealed a compressive resistance 15 times that of bone alone (P\u2009<\u20090.05) CONCLUSION: 3D-printed PEKK scaffolds combined with ADSCs present a promising solution to improve the bone-implant interface and increase the resistance to forces of mastication after mandibular reconstruction.\nNA.

Here, using contrast enhanced micro-computed tomography, we present, in attitudinally appropriate fashion, the first 3-dimensional representations of the cardiac conduction system within the intact human heart. We show that cardiomyocyte orientation can be extracted from these datasets at spatial resolutions approaching the single cell. These data show that commonly accepted anatomical representations are oversimplified. We have incorporated the high-resolution anatomical data into mathematical simulations of cardiac electrical depolarisation. The data presented should have multidisciplinary impact. Since the rate of depolarisation is dictated by cardiac microstructure, and the precise orientation of the cardiomyocytes, our data should improve the fidelity of mathematical models. By showing the precise 3-dimensional relationships between the cardiac conduction system and surrounding structures, we provide new insights relevant to valvar replacement surgery and ablation therapies.

However, a pure scaffold is limited by its biological properties. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been shown to have the potential to improve the osteogenic effect. In this study, we improved the biological properties of scaffolds by coating 3D-printed polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with freeze-dried and traditionally prepared PRP, and we evaluated these scaffolds through in vitro and in vivo experiments. In vitro, we evaluated the interaction between dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and the scaffolds by measuring cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and osteogenic differentiation. The results showed that freeze-dried PRP significantly enhanced ALP activity and the mRNA expression levels of osteogenic genes (ALP, RUNX2 (runt-related gene-2), OCN (osteocalcin), OPN (osteopontin)) of DPSCs (", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["JundaLi", "MeilinChen", "XiaoyingWei", "YishanHao", "JinmingWang"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10070831\n10.1243/09544119JEIM770\n10.22203/eCM.v005a03\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.145\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.09.041\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00121-6\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.02.029\n10.1002/jbm.a.32414\n10.1002/jbm.a.31396\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.03.005\n10.1007/s11095-010-0320-6\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.10.028\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.01.071\n10.1002/mabi.201300203\n10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0280\n10.1007/s10529-012-0900-0\n10.1055/s-2004-833479\n10.1302/0301-620X.91B8.22546\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000138251.07040.51\n10.1177/0885328214551373\n10.1002/jbm.a.31142\n10.4103/0972-124X.170811\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.01.006\n10.1002/adma.200900241\n10.1016/j.joms.2003.12.003\n10.1902/jop.2008.070518\n10.1371/journal.pone.0071602\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.03.065\n10.11607/prd.1861\n10.3109/09537104.2011.645923\n10.1038/srep38814\n10.1016/j.joen.2012.08.004\n10.1016/j.joen.2009.11.018\n10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0177\n10.1111/j.1600-0722.2009.00709.x\n10.1051/sicotj/2016004\n10.22203/eCM.v018a07\n10.1155/2014/217078\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.08.015\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.10.012\n10.1163/156856209X410292\n10.1088/1758-5090/8/2/025003\n10.1016/j.ijporl.2014.04.004\n10.1089/ten.tea.2016.0418\n10.1002/mabi.201600250\n10.1111/cpr.12001\n10.1002/jbm.a.35107\n10.1080/09205063.2013.846633\n10.1039/C5NR03425F\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0663\n10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00164.x\n10.1007/s00266-015-0580-y\n10.1016/j.archoralbio.2016.10.006"}

{"title": "Effect of Molten Pool Size on Microstructure and Tensile Properties of Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V Alloy.", "abstract": "Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) technique is a cost-competitive and efficient technology to produce large structure components in industry domains. Mechanical properties are mainly dominated by the microstructure of the components, which is deeply affected by the molten pool size. In this work, to investigate the effect of the molten pool size on microstructure and mechanical properties of the components, a series of Ti-6Al-4V alloy blocks with different width of molten pool (WMP) ranging from 7 mm to 22 mm were deposited by adjusting the wire feed speed (WFS) from 100 cm/min to 500 cm/min. It is interesting to find that the macrostructure changes from columnar grains to equiaxial grains, and then returns to large columnar grains with the increase of WMP, which is mainly caused by the different cooling rates and thermal gradients. Nonetheless, the tensile properties of the components have a tendency to decline with the increase of WMP.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["QianruWu", "JipingLu", "ChangmengLiu", "HongliFan", "XuezhiShi", "JieFu", "ShuyuanMa"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10070749\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2004.01.058\n10.1016/j.matdes.2009.11.032\n10.1007/s00170-014-5808-5\n10.1016/j.msea.2016.12.065\n10.1007/s11661-015-2912-6\n10.1007/s11661-012-1444-6\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2017.05.004\n10.1007/s11665-013-0658-0\n10.3390/ma9100823\n10.1016/j.matdes.2011.12.016\n10.1016/j.cad.2011.01.006\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.06.084\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.04.080\n10.1007/BF02667333\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2011.06.023\n10.1016/S0168-874X(03)00069-6\n10.1007/s11837-001-0068-x\n10.1016/S0924-0136(02)00865-8\n10.3390/app7030227\n10.1007/s11661-010-0255-x\n10.1016/S0921-5093(97)00778-8\n10.1002/3527602119"}

Green filaments with a continuously gradient core/shell structure were successfully produced by extruding a bilayered feedrod comprised of a CaP/camphene mixture lower part and a pure camphene upper part. The extruded filaments were then deposited in a controlled manner to construct triangular prisms, followed by the assembly process for the production of CaP scaffolds with a gradient core/shell structure. In addition, a gradient microporous structure was created by heat-treating the green body at 43 \u00b0C to induce the overgrowth of camphene dendrites in the CaP/camphene walls. The produced CaP scaffold showed a highly macroporous structure within its inner core, where the size of macrochannels increased gradually with an increase in the distance from the outer shell, while relatively larger micropores were created in the outer shell.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["Min-KyungAhn", "Young-WookMoon", "Woo-YoulMaeng", "Young-HagKoh", "Hyoun-EeKim"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10070719\n10.1177/0885328211406459\n10.1016/j.cossms.2003.09.012\n10.3390/jfb1010022\n10.1111/j.1744-7402.2005.02020.x\n10.1038/nmat4089\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.06.028\n10.1016/j.actamat.2006.11.003\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2009.12.018\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2007.11.006\n10.1016/j.matlet.2009.04.013\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.04.033\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.11.035\n10.3390/ma3010026\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00290-8\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00191-6\n10.1007/s10856-007-3126-2\n10.1016/j.actbio.2007.05.008\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.11.009\n10.3390/ma10040367\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.09.008\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.09.039\n10.1002/adem.201400097\n10.1016/j.msea.2014.12.036\n10.1016/j.msea.2015.06.088\n10.1016/j.actamat.2016.04.029\n10.1016/j.actamat.2016.12.052\n10.1016/j.msec.2011.06.004\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.06.030\n10.1007/s10856-011-4236-4\n10.1016/j.matlet.2012.01.019\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2013.06.001\n10.1111/jace.12634\n10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.08.017\n10.1371/journal.pone.0034117\n10.1016/j.matdes.2008.03.024\n10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015006\n10.1111/jace.14033\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.013\n10.1111/jace.12003"}
{"title": "Additive Manufacturing Processes: Selective Laser Melting, Electron Beam Melting and Binder Jetting-Selection Guidelines.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing or rapid prototyping, is gaining increasing attention due to its ability to produce parts with added functionality and increased complexities in geometrical design, on top of the fact that it is theoretically possible to produce any shape without limitations. However, most of the research on additive manufacturing techniques are focused on the development of materials/process parameters/products design with different additive manufacturing processes such as selective laser melting, electron beam melting, or binder jetting. However, we do not have any guidelines that discuss the selection of the most suitable additive manufacturing process, depending on the material to be processed, the complexity of the parts to be produced, or the design considerations.

The subsequent fractographic investigation revealed the presence of tungsten particles on the fracture surface. Hence, its detection and impact on tensile properties of AM Ti-6Al-4V were investigated. X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) scanning indicated that these inclusions were evenly distributed throughout the samples, however the inclusions area was shown to be larger in the load-bearing plane for the vertical specimens.

The particle size distribution, the flowability and the morphology of the powder feedstock were investigated and appeared to be in line with observations from other studies. X-ray CT scanning of the powder however made the high density particles visible, where various techniques, commonly used in the certification of powder feedstock, failed to detect the contaminant.

{"title": "Calcium Silicate/Chitosan-Coated Electrospun Poly (Lactic Acid) Fibers for Bone Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Electrospinning technology allows fabrication of nano- or microfibrous fibers with inorganic and organic matrix and it is widely applied in bone tissue engineering as it allows precise control over the shapes and structures of the fibers. Natural bone has an ordered composition of organic fibers with dispersion of inorganic apatite among them. In this study, poly (lactic acid) (PLA) mats were fabricated with electrospinning and coated with chitosan (CH)/calcium silicate (CS) mixer. The microstructure, chemical component, and contact angle of CS/CH-PLA composites were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In vitro, various CS/CH-coated PLA mats increased the formation of hydroxyapatite on the specimens' surface when soaked in cell cultured medium. During culture, several biological characteristics of the human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured on CS/CH-PLA groups were promoted as compared to those on pure PLA mat.

Furthermore, with comparison to PLA mats without CS/CH, CS10 and CS15 mats markedly enhanced the proliferation of hMSCs and their osteogenesis properties, which was characterized by osteogenic-related gene expression.

The results show that the interface between the two dissimilar materials exhibits good metallurgical bonding. Through the tensile test, all the fractures occurred in the as-deposited IN718 section rather than the interface or the substrate, implying that the as-deposited interlayer bond strength is weaker than the interfacial bond strength. From the fractography using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse X-ray spectrometry (EDS), three major factors affecting the tensile fracture failure of the as-deposited part are (i) metallurgical defects such as incompletely melted powder particles, lack-of-fusion porosity, and micropores; (ii) elemental segregation and Laves phase, and (iii) oxide formation.

{"title": "Manufacturing Feasibility and Forming Properties of Cu-4Sn in Selective Laser Melting.", "abstract": "Copper alloys, combined with selective laser melting (SLM) technology, have attracted increasing attention in aerospace engineering, automobile, and medical fields. However, there are some difficulties in SLM forming owing to low laser absorption and excellent thermal conductivity. It is, therefore, necessary to explore a copper alloy in SLM. In this research, manufacturing feasibility and forming properties of Cu-4Sn in SLM were investigated through a systematic experimental approach. Single-track experiments were used to narrow down processing parameter windows. A Greco-Latin square design with orthogonal parameter arrays was employed to control forming qualities of specimens. Analysis of variance was applied to establish statistical relationships, which described the effects of different processing parameters (i.e., laser power, scanning speed, and hatch space) on relative density (RD) and Vickers hardness of specimens. It was found that Cu-4Sn specimens were successfully manufactured by SLM for the first time and both its RD and Vickers hardness were mainly determined by the laser power. The maximum value of RD exceeded 93% theoretical density and the maximum value of Vickers hardness reached 118 HV 0.3/5.

{"title": "Process Parameter Optimization of Extrusion-Based 3D Metal Printing Utilizing PW-LDPE-SA Binder System.", "abstract": "Recently, with a broadening range of available materials and alteration of feeding processes, several extrusion-based 3D printing processes for metal materials have been developed. An emerging process is applicable for the fabrication of metal parts into electronics and composites. In this paper, some critical parameters of extrusion-based 3D printing processes were optimized by a series of experiments with a melting extrusion printer. The raw materials were copper powder and a thermoplastic organic binder system and the system included paraffin wax, low density polyethylene, and stearic acid (PW-LDPE-SA). The homogeneity and rheological behaviour of the raw materials, the strength of the green samples, and the hardness of the sintered samples were investigated. Moreover, the printing and sintering parameters were optimized with an orthogonal design method. The influence factors in regard to the ultimate tensile strength of the green samples can be described as follows: infill degree > raster angle > layer thickness. As for the sintering process, the major factor on hardness is sintering temperature, followed by holding time and heating rate. The highest hardness of the sintered samples was very close to the average hardness of commercially pure copper material.

{"title": "Investigation of Quasi-Static Indentation Response of Inkjet Printed Sandwich Structures under Various Indenter Geometries.", "abstract": "The objective of this investigation was to determine the quasi-static indentation response and failure mode in three-dimensional (3D) printed trapezoidal core structures, and to characterize the energy absorbed by the structures. In this work, the trapezoidal sandwich structure was designed in the following two ways. Firstly, the trapezoidal core along with its facesheet was 3D printed as a single element comprising a single material for both core and facesheet (type A); Secondly, the trapezoidal core along with facesheet was 3D printed, but with variation in facesheet materials (type B). Quasi-static indentation was carried out using three different indenters, namely standard hemispherical, conical, and flat indenters. Acoustic emission (AE) technique was used to capture brittle cracking in the specimens during indentation. The major failure modes were found to be brittle failure and quasi-brittle fractures. The measured indentation energy was at a maximum when using a conical indenter at 9.40 J and 9.66 J and was at a minimum when using a hemispherical indenter at 6.87 J and 8.82 J for type A and type B series specimens respectively. The observed maximum indenter displacements at failure were the effect of material variations and composite configurations in the facesheet.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["VishweshDikshit", "Arun PrasanthNagalingam", "Yee LingYap", "Swee LeongSing", "Wai YeeYeong", "JunWei"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10030290\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.10.008\n10.1016/j.mechmat.2015.08.002\n10.1016/j.eml.2016.11.009\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2015.08.013\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.09.046\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2017.01.005\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.11.060\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.12.028\n10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2008.08.005\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2013.02.010\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2011.05.006\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2014.10.042\n10.1016/S1359-835X(98)00182-1\n10.1016/j.matdes.2015.03.004\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.04.005\n10.1016/j.tws.2014.10.002\n10.1016/S0263-8223(99)00109-9\n10.1016/j.matdes.2015.09.070\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2014.11.021\n10.1016/j.msea.2015.12.048\n10.1177/1099636206056888\n10.1016/j.proeng.2014.11.137\n10.3390/ma9110893\n10.1002/adhm.201600435\n10.1002/jor.23075\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1211849\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1211925\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1111519\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1060350\n10.1088/1757-899X/139/1/012017\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1242915\n10.1145/2601097.2601168\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.07.099\n10.1002/mrd.22489\n10.1038/nmeth.2089"}

{"title": "Effect of Energy Input on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Titanium Aluminide Alloy Fabricated by the Additive Manufacturing Process of Electron Beam Melting.", "abstract": "Titanium aluminides qualify adequately for advanced aero-engine applications in place of conventional nickel based superalloys. The combination of high temperature properties and lower density gives an edge to the titanium aluminide alloys. Nevertheless, challenges remain on how to process these essentially intermetallic alloys in to an actual product. Electron Beam Melting (EBM), an Additive Manufacturing Method, can build complex shaped solid parts from a given feedstock powder, thus overcoming the shortcomings of the conventional processing techniques such as machining and forging. The amount of energy supplied by the electron beam has considerable influence on the final build quality in the EBM process. Energy input is decided by the beam voltage, beam scan speed, beam current, and track offset distance. In the current work, beam current and track offset were varied to reflect three levels of energy input. Microstructural and mechanical properties were evaluated for these samples. The microstructure gradually coarsened from top to bottom along the build direction. Whereas higher energy favored lath microstructure, lower energy tended toward equiaxed grains. Computed tomography analysis revealed a greater amount of porosity in low energy samples. In addition, the lack of bonding defects led to premature failure in the tension test of low energy samples. Increase in energy to a medium level largely cancelled out the porosity, thereby increasing the strength. However, this trend did not continue with the high energy samples. Electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction investigations were carried out to understand this non-linear behavior of the strength in the three samples. Overall, the results of this work suggest that the input energy should be considered primarily whenever any new alloy system has to be processed through the EBM route.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["AshfaqMohammad", "Abdulrahman MAlahmari", "Muneer KhanMohammed", "Ravi KottanRenganayagalu", "KhajaMoiduddin"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10020211\n10.1016/S0966-9795(00)00073-X\n10.1016/j.wear.2012.12.035\n10.1016/j.intermet.2010.11.022\n10.1016/j.msea.2013.02.064\n10.1155/2007/34737\n10.1016/j.actamat.2009.11.032\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.706-709.488\n10.4236/msa.2012.35038\n10.1016/j.actamat.2014.05.037\n10.1016/j.addma.2014.08.002\n10.1051/matecconf/20141408001\n10.1016/j.matchar.2008.07.006\n10.1179/0032589915Z.000000000244\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2006.11.024\n10.1016/0956-7151(92)90411-7\n10.12989/amr.2012.1.1.051\n10.1016/j.addma.2014.12.002\n10.1016/j.matchar.2013.07.012\n10.1016/0167-577X(95)00291-X\n10.1016/j.intermet.2014.01.004\n10.1016/j.intermet.2010.11.017\n10.1007/s11661-016-3429-3\n10.1016/S1359-6454(03)00392-6"}
{"title": "Polyvinylpyrrolidone-Based Bio-Ink Improves Cell Viability and Homogeneity during Drop-On-Demand Printing.", "abstract": "Drop-on-demand (DOD) bioprinting has attracted huge attention for numerous biological applications due to its precise control over material volume and deposition pattern in a contactless printing approach. 3D bioprinting is still an emerging field and more work is required to improve the viability and homogeneity of printed cells during the printing process. Here, a general purpose bio-ink was developed using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) macromolecules. Different PVP-based bio-inks (0%-3% w/v) were prepared and evaluated for their printability; the short-term and long-term viability of the printed cells were first investigated. The Z value of a bio-ink determines its printability; it is the inverse of the Ohnesorge number (Oh), which is the ratio between the Reynolds number and a square root of the Weber number, and is independent of the bio-ink velocity. The viability of printed cells is dependent on the Z values of the bio-inks; the results indicated that the cells can be printed without any significant impairment using a bio-ink with a threshold Z value of \u22649.30 (2% and 2.5% w/v). Next, the cell output was evaluated over a period of 30 min. The results indicated that PVP molecules mitigate the cell adhesion and sedimentation during the printing process; the 2.5% w/v PVP bio-ink demonstrated the most consistent cell output over a period of 30 min. Hence, PVP macromolecules can play a critical role in improving the cell viability and homogeneity during the bioprinting process.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["Wei LongNg", "Wai YeeYeong", "May WinNaing"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10020190\n10.1016/S0962-8924(02)02354-1\n10.1038/nature05063\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.04.006\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.055\n10.1557/mrs.2011.272\n10.18063/IJB.12017.18001.18001\n10.18063/IJB.2015.01.003\n10.18063/IJB.2016.01.009\n10.1080/17452759.2014.979557\n10.3390/ma9090756\n10.1038/srep39140\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.10.026\n10.1002/adhm.201600483\n10.1002/adhm.201600435\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.12.009\n10.1089/ten.tec.2013.0335\n10.1088/1758-5082/5/1/015013\n10.1039/C6BM00861E\n10.1002/biot.200600081\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.1658\n10.18063/IJB.2016.01.001\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.09.035\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1242915\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1229802\n10.1089/ten.a.2007.0004\n10.1002/biot.200900004\n10.1002/adhm.201500677\n10.1002/btpr.1586\n10.1088/1758-5082/4/1/011001\n10.1002/term.162\n10.1002/bit.24562\n10.1021/la900059m\n10.1002/aic.690430903\n10.1038/srep11304\n10.1021/la501430x\n10.1002/adma.201302042\n10.1002/adhm.201600636\n10.1007/s10404-015-1624-y\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b04218\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2014.10.004"}

{"title": "3D Printing of Cytocompatible Water-Based Light-Cured Polyurethane with Hyaluronic Acid for Cartilage Tissue Engineering Applications.", "abstract": "Diseases in articular cartilages have affected millions of people globally. Although the biochemical and cellular composition of articular cartilages is relatively simple, there is a limitation in the self-repair ability of the cartilage. Therefore, developing strategies for cartilage repair is very important. Here, we report on a new liquid resin preparation process of water-based polyurethane based photosensitive materials with hyaluronic acid with application of the materials for 3D printed customized cartilage scaffolds.

The manufactured three-dimensional object is cleaned and converted into a dense ceramic part by thermal debinding of the polymer network and subsequent sintering. The debinding is the most critical and time-consuming step, and often the source of cracks. In this study, photocurable alumina suspensions have been developed, and the influence of resin composition on defect formation has been investigated. The suspensions were characterized in terms of rheology and curing behaviour, and cross-sections of sintered specimens manufactured by SL were evaluated by SEM. It was found that the addition of a non-reactive component to the photocurable resin reduced polymerization shrinkage and altered the thermal decomposition of the polymer matrix, which led to a reduction in both delamination and intra-laminar cracks.

This process is gaining interest worldwide, thanks to the possibility of obtaining a freeform fabrication coupled with high mechanical properties related to a very fine microstructure. However, SLM is very complex, from a physical point of view, due to the interaction between a concentrated laser source and metallic powders, and to the extremely rapid melting and the subsequent fast solidification. The effects of the main process variables on the properties of the final parts are analyzed in this review: from the starting powder properties, such as shape and powder size distribution, to the main process parameters, such as laser power and speed, layer thickness, and scanning strategy.

{"title": "Anisotropy of Photopolymer Parts Made by Digital Light Processing.", "abstract": "Digital light processing (DLP) is an accurate additive manufacturing (AM) technology suitable for producing micro-parts by photopolymerization. As most AM technologies, anisotropy of parts made by DLP is a key issue to deal with, taking into account that several operational factors modify this characteristic. Design for this technology and photopolymers becomes a challenge because the manufacturing process and post-processing strongly influence the mechanical properties of the part. This paper shows experimental work to demonstrate the particular behavior of parts made using DLP. Being different to any other AM technology, rules for design need to be adapted. Influence of build direction and post-curing process on final mechanical properties and anisotropy are reported and justified based on experimental data and theoretical simulation of bi-material parts formed by fully-cured resin and partially-cured resin. Three photopolymers were tested under different working conditions, concluding that post-curing can, in some cases, correct the anisotropy, mainly depending on the nature of photopolymer.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["MarioMonz\u00f3n", "ZaidaOrtega", "AlbaHern\u00e1ndez", "Rub\u00e9nPaz", "FernandoOrtega"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10010064\n10.1039/C6LC00565A\n10.1007/s10043-016-0212-z\n10.1002/adma.201505109\n10.1108/13552540810862073\n10.1016/S1007-0214(09)70075-6\n10.1108/13552540210441166\n10.1142/S0217979203019241\n10.1243/09544054JEM537\n10.1108/13552541111124743\n10.1108/RPJ-06-2012-0052\n10.1108/13552541111138397\n10.1016/S1644-9665(12)60135-6\n10.1177/0954405413518515\n10.1108/13552541211250373\n10.1007/s00170-009-2066-z\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2000.tb01177.x\n10.1557/jmr.2014.200\n10.1007/s00170-014-6334-1\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2011.10.002\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.01.016\n10.1021/acsami.6b09768\n10.1021/acsami.5b12578\n10.1038/ncomms9641\n10.1002/adma.201501737\n10.1023/B:JMSC.0000020010.73768.4a"}

As compared to pure PCL scaffolds without an Mg-CS powder, the hydrophilic properties and degradation rate are also improved.

Increased focal adhesion kinase and promoted cell adhesion behavior were observed after an increase in Mg-CS content.

{"title": "Exploiting Process-Related Advantages of Selective Laser Melting for the Production of High-Manganese Steel.", "abstract": "Metal additive manufacturing has strongly gained scientific and industrial importance during the last decades due to the geometrical flexibility and increased reliability of parts, as well as reduced equipment costs. Within the field of metal additive manufacturing methods, selective laser melting (SLM) is an eligible technique for the production of fully dense bulk material with complex geometry. In the current study, we addressed the application of SLM for processing a high-manganese TRansformation-/TWinning-Induced Plasticity (TRIP/TWIP) steel. The solidification behavior was analyzed by careful characterization of the as-built microstructure and element distribution using optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the deformation behavior was studied using uniaxial tensile testing and SEM. Comparison with conventionally produced TRIP/TWIP steel revealed that elemental segregation, which is normally very pronounced in high-manganese steels and requires energy-intensive post processing, is reduced due to the high cooling rates during SLM. Also, the very fast cooling promoted \u03b5- and \u03b1'-martensite formation prior to deformation. The superior strength and pronounced anisotropy of the SLM-produced material was correlated with the microstructure based on the process-specific characteristics.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["ChristianHaase", "JanB\u00fcltmann", "JanHof", "StephanZiegler", "SebastianBremen", "ChristianHinke", "AlexanderSchwedt", "UlrichPrahl", "WolfgangBleck"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10010056\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070115-031606\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.150\n10.1016/j.cirp.2016.05.004\n10.1016/j.actamat.2016.07.019\n10.1080/09506608.2015.1116649\n10.1007/s11665-014-0958-z\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070115-032024\n10.1016/j.matchar.2013.08.010\n10.1007/s11661-015-2932-2\n10.1016/j.msea.2004.01.059\n10.2355/isijinternational.29.868\n10.1051/jp4:1997560\n10.1016/j.cossms.2011.04.002\n10.1007/s11661-013-1935-0\n10.1016/j.actamat.2014.07.068\n10.1016/j.actamat.2016.01.056\n10.1016/j.actamat.2016.10.006\n10.1007/s11661-011-0993-4\n10.1016/S0304-3991(96)00104-0\n10.1016/j.actamat.2012.11.052\n10.1088/0022-3727/48/3/035303\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070115-031816\n10.1016/j.addma.2014.09.001\n10.1016/j.addma.2014.12.002\n10.1016/j.optlastec.2013.09.017\n10.1016/j.msea.2006.11.112\n10.2320/matertrans1989.34.489\n10.1007/s11661-000-0271-3\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.753.213\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.638-642.3134\n10.1016/j.msea.2014.12.069\n10.1002/srin.201000267\n10.1016/j.msea.2015.09.096\n10.1016/j.actamat.2015.08.057\n10.1007/s11663-013-9875-z\n10.1016/j.msea.2014.10.003\n10.1007/s11661-012-1543-4\n10.1016/S1359-6454(03)00117-4\n10.1016/j.msea.2004.05.038"}
{"title": "Additively Manufactured Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering and the Prediction of their Mechanical Behavior: A Review.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM), nowadays commonly known as 3D printing, is a revolutionary materials processing technology, particularly suitable for the production of low-volume parts with high shape complexities and often with multiple functions. As such, it holds great promise for the fabrication of patient-specific implants. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in implementing AM in the bio-fabrication field. This paper presents an overview on the state-of-the-art AM technology for bone tissue engineering (BTE) scaffolds, with a particular focus on the AM scaffolds made of metallic biomaterials. It starts with a brief description of architecture design strategies to meet the biological and mechanical property requirements of scaffolds. Then, it summarizes the working principles, advantages and limitations of each of AM methods suitable for creating porous structures and manufacturing scaffolds from powdered materials. It elaborates on the finite-element (FE) analysis applied to predict the mechanical behavior of AM scaffolds, as well as the effect of the architectural design of porous structure on its mechanical properties.

{"title": "A Novel Design of Autonomously Healed Concrete: Towards a Vascular Healing Network.", "abstract": "Concrete is prone to crack formation in the tensile zone, which is why steel reinforcement is introduced in these zones. However, small cracks could still arise, which give liquids and gasses access to the reinforcement causing it to corrode. Self-healing concrete repairs and seals these small (300 \u00b5m) cracks, preventing the development of corrosion. In this study, a vascular system, carrying the healing agent, is developed. It consists of tubes connected to a 3D printed distribution piece. This distribution piece has four outlets that are connected to the tubes and has one inlet, which is accessible from outside. Several materials were considered for the tubes, i.e., polymethylmethacrylate, starch, inorganic phosphate cement and alumina.

{"title": "Customized a Ti6Al4V Bone Plate for Complex Pelvic Fracture by Selective Laser Melting.", "abstract": "In pelvic fracture operations, bone plate shaping is challenging and the operation time is long. To address this issue, a customized bone plate was designed and produced using selective laser melting (SLM) technology. The key steps of this study included designing the customized bone plate, metal 3D printing, vacuum heat treatment, surface post-processing, operation rehearsal, and clinical application and evaluation. The joint surface of the bone plate was placed upwards with respect to the build platform to keep it away from the support and to improve the quality of the joint surface. Heat conduction was enhanced by adding a cone-type support beneath the bone plate to prevent low-quality fabrication due to poor heat conductivity of the Ti-6Al-4V powder. The residual stress was eliminated by exposing the SLM-fabricated titanium-alloy bone plate to a vacuum heat treatment. Results indicated that the bone plate has a hardness of HV1 360-HV1 390, an ultimate tensile strength of 1000-1100 MPa, yield strength of 900-950 MPa, and an elongation of 8%-10%. Pre-operative experiments and operation rehearsal were performed using the customized bone plate and the ABC-made pelvic model. Finally, the customized bone plate was clinically applied. The intraoperative C-arm and postoperative X-ray imaging results indicated that the customized bone plate matched well to the damaged pelvis. The customized bone plate fixed the broken bone and guides pelvis restoration while reducing operation time to about two hours. The customized bone plate eliminated the need for preoperative titanium plate pre-bending, thereby greatly reducing surgical wounds and operation time.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["DiWang", "YimengWang", "ShibiaoWu", "HuiLin", "YongqiangYang", "ShicaiFan", "ChengGu", "JianhuaWang", "ChanghuiSong"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10010035\n10.3171/2008.9.SPI08229\n10.1016/j.jss.2015.06.051\n10.1016/j.surg.2015.12.017\n10.1002/rcs.390\n10.1097/00007632-200102150-00012\n10.1007/s11837-015-1295-x\n10.1002/jor.23075\n10.1016/j.cirp.2012.05.005\n10.1302/0301-620X.87B7.16017\n10.1097/00003086-199408000-00003\n10.1007/s00402-004-0694-1\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1142215\n10.1080/17452759.2015.1026045\n10.1016/j.actamat.2014.01.018\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.11.141\n10.1002/jbm.b.32764\n10.1016/j.actamat.2012.04.006"}

{"title": "Recent development and biomedical applications of self-healing hydrogels.", "abstract": "Hydrogels are of special importance, owing to their high-water content and various applications in biomedical and bio-engineering research. Self-healing properties is a common phenomenon in living organisms. Their endowed property of being able to self-repair after physical/chemical/mechanical damage to fully or partially its original properties demonstrates their prospective therapeutic applications. Due to complicated preparation and selection of suitable materials, the application of many host-guest supramolecular polymeric hydrogels are so limited. Thus, the design and construction of self-repairing material are highly desirable for effectively increase in the lifetime of a functional material. However, recent advances in the field of materials science and bioengineering and nanotechnology have led to the design of biologically relevant self-healing hydrogels for therapeutic applications. This review focuses on the recent development of self-healing hydrogels for biomedical application.\nThe strategies of making self-healing hydrogels and their healing mechanisms are discussed. The significance of self-healing hydrogel for biomedical application is also highlighted in areas such as 3D/4D printing, cell/drug delivery, as well as soft actuators.\nMaterials that have the ability to self-repair damage and regain the desired mechanical properties, have been found to be excellent candidate materials for a range of biomedical uses especially if their unique characteristics are similar to that of soft-tissues. Self-healing hydrogels have been synthesized and shown to exhibit similar characteristics as human tissues, however, significant improvement is required in the fabrication process from inexpensive and nontoxic/non-hazardous materials and techniques, and, in addition, further fine-tuning of the self-healing properties are needed for specific biomedical uses.", "journal": "Expert opinion on drug delivery", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["YinanWang", "Christian KAdokoh", "RavinNarain"], "doi": "10.1080/17425247.2017.1360865"}

Here, we present thermally stable GelMA hydrogels at room temperature while maintaining the mechanical and biological properties comparable to porcine GelMA. The novel GelMA hydrogels were synthesized from fish skin and cold soluble gelatin. We systematically characterized the properties of the GelMA hydrogels from different sources. The properties include the degree of methacrylation, compressive Young's modulus, mass swelling ratio, viscosity, and cell adhesion and proliferation in 2D and 3D microenvironments. It has been found that the cold soluble GelMA was comparable to the porcine skin GelMA but could offer low viscosity and thermal stability at room temperature. We performed a droplet generation experiment to demonstrate the benefit of using the cold soluble GelMA for biofabrication. The cold soluble GelMA showed a more reliable and stable droplet fabrication process.

It gives an overview about the objects' computer-aided design (CAD) followed by its manufacturing process and basic studies on the used printing material in terms of biocompatibility and manageability. Using the stereolithographic (SLA) 3D-printing technology, a customizable shake flask lid was developed, which was successfully used to perform a bacterial fed-batch shake flask cultivation. The lid provides Luer connectors and tube adapters, allowing both sampling and feeding without interrupting the process. In addition, the digital blueprint the lid is based on, is designed for a modular use and can be modified to fit specific needs. All connectors can be changed and substituted in this CAD software-based file. Hence, the lid can be used for other applications, as well. The used printing material was tested for biocompatibility and showed no toxic effects neither on mammalian, nor on bacteria cells.

{"title": "Isothermal Point Mutation Detection: Toward a First-Pass Screening Strategy for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis.", "abstract": "Point mutations in DNA are useful biomarkers that can provide critical classification of disease for accurate diagnosis and to inform clinical decisions. Conventional approaches to detect point mutations are usually based on technologies such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or DNA sequencing, which are typically slow and require expensive lab-based equipment. While rapid isothermal strategies such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) have been proposed, they tend to suffer from poor specificity in discriminating point mutations. Herein, we describe a novel strategy that enabled exquisite point mutation discrimination with isothermal DNA amplification, using mismatched primers in conjunction with a two-round enrichment process. As a proof of concept, the method was applied to the rapid and specific identification of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis using RPA under specific conditions. The assay requires just picogram levels of genomic DNA input, is sensitive and specific enough to detect 10% point mutation loading, and can discriminate between closely related mutant variants within 30 min. The assay was subsequently adapted onto a low-cost 3D-printed isothermal device with real-time analysis capabilities to demonstrate a potential point-of-care application. Finally, the generic applicability of the strategy was shown by detecting three other clinically important cancer-associated point mutations. We believe that our assay shows potential in a broad range of healthcare screening processes for detecting and categorizing disease phenotypes at the point of care, thus reducing unnecessary therapy and cost in these contexts.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2017-08-03", "authors": ["Benjamin Y CNg", "Eugene J HWee", "KyraWoods", "WillAnderson", "FiachAntaw", "Hennes Z HTsang", "Nicholas PWest", "MattTrau"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.7b01685"}

A radiologist outlined the tumor edges on consecutive images, creating a three-dimensional (3D) view of its location. Using 3D printing, a bra-like plastic form (the Breast Cancer Locator [BCL]) was fabricated, with features that allowed a surgeon to (1) mark the edges of the tumor on the breast surface; (2) inject blue dye into the breast 1\u00a0cm from the tumor edges; and (3) place a wire in the tumor at the time of surgery.\nNineteen patients with palpable cancers underwent partial mastectomy after placement of surgical cues using patient-specific BCLs.

{"title": "Bone regeneration by means of a three-dimensional printed scaffold in a rat cranial defect.", "abstract": "Recently, computer-designed three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques have emerged as an active research area with almost unlimited possibilities. In this study, we used a computer-designed 3D scaffold to drive new bone formation in a bone defect. Poly-L-lactide (PLLA) and bioactive \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) were simply mixed to prepare ink. PLLA\u00a0+\u00a0TCP showed good printability from the micronozzle and solidification within few seconds, indicating that it was indeed printable ink for layer-by-layer printing. In the images, TCP on the surface of (and/or inside) PLLA in the printed PLLA\u00a0+\u00a0TCP scaffold looked dispersed. MG-63 cells (human osteoblastoma) adhered to and proliferated well on the printed PLLA\u00a0+\u00a0TCP scaffold. To assess new bone formation in vivo, the printed PLLA\u00a0+\u00a0TCP scaffold was implanted into a full-thickness cranial bone defect in rats. The new bone formation was monitored by microcomputed tomography and histological analysis of the in vivo PLLA\u00a0+\u00a0TCP scaffold with or without MG-63 cells. The bone defect was gradually spontaneously replaced with new bone tissues when we used both bioactive TCP and MG-63 cells in the PLLA scaffold. Bone formation driven by the PLLA\u00a0+\u00a0TCP30 scaffold with MG-63 cells was significantly greater than that in other experimental groups. Furthermore, the PLLA\u00a0+\u00a0TCP scaffold gradually degraded and matched well the extent of the gradual new bone formation on microcomputed tomography.

In the structural engineering field, the kagome structure has been known to have an excellent relative strength. In this study, to enhance the mechanical properties of a synthetic polymer scaffold used for tissue engineering, we applied the 3D kagome structure to a porous scaffold for bone regeneration. Prior to fabricating the biocompatible-polymer scaffold, the ideal kagome structure, which was manufactured by a 3D printer of the digital light processing type, was compared with a grid-structure, which was used as the control group, using a compressive experiment. A polycaprolactone (PCL) kagome-structure scaffold was successfully fabricated by additive manufacturing using a 3D printer with a precision extruding deposition head. To assess the physical characteristics of the fabricated PCL-kagome-structure scaffold, we analyzed its porosity, pore size, morphological structure, surface roughness, compressive stiffness, and mechanical bending properties. The results showed that, the mechanical properties of proposed kagome-structure scaffold were superior to those of a grid-structure scaffold. Moreover, Sarcoma osteogenic (Saos-2) cells were used to evaluate the characteristics of in vitro cell proliferation. We carried out cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and DNA contents assays. Consequently, the cell proliferation of the kagome-structure scaffold was increased; this could be because the surface roughness of the kagome-structure scaffold enhances initial cell attachment.", "journal": "Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)", "date": "2017-08-02", "authors": ["Se-HwanLee", "Yong SangCho", "Myoung WhaHong", "Bu-KyuLee", "YongdooPark", "Sang-HyugPark", "Young YulKim", "Young-SamCho"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-605X/aa8357"}
{"title": "3D Printing Polymers with Supramolecular Functionality for Biological Applications.", "abstract": "Supramolecular chemistry continues to experience widespread growth, as fine-tuned chemical structures lead to well-defined bulk materials. Previous literature described the roles of hydrogen bonding, ionic aggregation, guest/host interactions, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking to tune mechanical, viscoelastic, and processing performance. The versatility of reversible interactions enables the more facile manufacturing of molded parts with tailored hierarchical structures such as tissue engineered scaffolds for biological applications. Recently, supramolecular polymers and additive manufacturing processes merged to provide parts with control of the molecular, macromolecular, and feature length scales. Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, generates customizable constructs desirable for many applications, and the introduction of supramolecular interactions will potentially increase production speed, offer a tunable surface structure for controlling cell/scaffold interactions, and impart desired mechanical properties through reinforcing interlayer adhesion and introducing gradients or self-assembled structures. This review details the synthesis and characterization of supramolecular polymers suitable for additive manufacture and biomedical applications as well as the use of supramolecular polymers in additive manufacturing for drug delivery and complex tissue scaffold formation. The effect of supramolecular assembly and its dynamic behavior offers potential for controlling the anisotropy of the printed objects with exquisite geometrical control.

{"title": "Feasibility of 3D printed air slab diode caps for small field dosimetry.", "abstract": "Commercial diode detectors used for small field dosimetry introduce a field-size-dependent over-response relative to an ideal, water-equivalent dosimeter due to high density components in the body of the detector. An air gap above the detector introduces a field-size-dependent under-response, and can be used to offset the field-size-dependent detector over-response. Other groups have reported experimental validation of caps containing air gaps for use with several types of diodes in small fields. This paper examines two designs for 3D printed diode air caps for the stereotactic field diode (SFD)-a cap containing a sealed air cavity, and a cap with an air cavity at the face of the SFD. Monte Carlo simulations of both designs were performed to determine dimensions for an air cavity to introduce the desired dosimetric correction. Various parameter changes were also simulated to estimate the dosimetric uncertainties introduced by 3D printing. Cap layer dimensions, cap density changes due to 3D printing, and unwanted air gaps were considered. For the sealed design the optimal air gap size for water-equivalent cap material was 0.6 mm, which increased to 1.0 mm when acrylonitrile butadiene styrene in the cap was simulated. The unsealed design had less variation, a 0.4 mm air gap is optimal in both situations. Unwanted air pockets in the bore of the cap and density changes introduced by the 3D printing process can potentially introduce significant dosimetric effects. These effects may be limited by using fine print resolutions and minimising the volume of cap material.", "journal": "Australasian physical & engineering sciences in medicine", "date": "2017-08-02", "authors": ["BenjaminPerrett", "PaulCharles", "TimMarkwell", "TanyaKairn", "ScottCrowe"], "doi": "10.1007/s13246-017-0570-2"}

Overcoming these challenges requires the integration of knowledge and technologies from multiple fields including cell biology, biomaterial science, engineering, physics and medicine. Here, engineering-derived iPSC approaches are reviewed according to three aspects of iPSC studies: preparation, expansion, differentiation and applications. Engineering strategies, such as 3D systems establishment, cell-matrix mechanics and the regulation of biophysical and biochemical cues, together with engineering techniques, such as 3D scaffolds, cell microspheres and bioreactors, have been applied to iPSC studies and have generated insightful results and even mini-organs such as retinas, livers and intestines. Specific results are given to demonstrate how these approaches impact iPSC behavior, and related mechanisms are discussed.

Freeze-drying (or lyophilization) is a technique used to generate scaffolds in planar 3D geometries. Here we report the development of a new biofabrication process to form a collagen-based scaffold into a large, complex geometry which has a large height to width ratio, and a controlled porous microarchitecture. This biofabrication process is validated through the successful development of a heart valve shaped scaffold, fabricated from a collagen-glycosaminoglycan co-polymer. Notably, despite the significant challenges in using freeze-drying to create such a structure, the resultant scaffold has a uniform, homogenous pore architecture throughout. This is achieved through optimization of the freeze-drying mold and the freezing parameters. We believe this to be the first demonstration of using freeze-drying to create a large, complex scaffold geometry with a controlled, porous architecture for natural biomaterials.

As such, the relationship between the post-build microstructure and the corrosion resistance is not well understood. Stainless steel alloy 17-4PH is an industrially-relevant alloy for applications requiring high-strength and good corrosion resistance. A series of potentiodynamic scans conducted in a deaerated 0.5 mol/L NaCl solution evaluated the influence of these microstructural differences on the pitting behavior of SS17-4. The pitting potentials were found to be higher in the samples of additively-processed material than in samples of the alloy in wrought form. This indicates that the additively-processed material is more resistant to localized corrosion and pitting in this environment than the wrought alloy.

The paper concludes with a brief discussion on the practical aspects of DfAM and the potential of combining AM with subtractive and formative manufacturing processes in so-called hybrid manufacturing processes.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2017-08-02", "authors": ["Amir AZadpoor"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms18081607\n10.1007/s10439-016-1719-y\n10.1007/s11548-010-0476-x\n10.1302/0301-620X.94B11.29350\n10.1016/j.jss.2014.02.020\n10.1055/s-0032-1313357\n10.1016/j.jcms.2014.07.006\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.12.003\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2016.02.008\n10.1016/j.compind.2010.03.008\n10.1177/0309364615579317\n10.1177/0309364612451269\n10.1186/1743-0003-8-1\n10.1108/RPJ-03-2012-0027\n10.1186/1471-2474-13-84\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2014.09.044\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2015.04.069\n10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.5b00510\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.11.021\n10.1088/1758-5082/6/2/025005\n10.1111/vru.12176\n10.1080/02640414.2012.736629\n10.1016/j.tifs.2015.02.004\n10.1007/s11947-015-1528-6\n10.1097/00008526-200404000-00007\n10.1029/2011JF002289\n10.1038/nmeth.2089\n10.1016/j.bone.2007.07.007\n10.1016/S8756-3282(02)00782-2\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2009.11.020\n10.1016/j.media.2009.05.004\n10.1016/j.bone.2013.12.006\n10.1016/j.jcms.2014.12.016\n10.1002/adma.201201644\n10.1039/C6MH00065G\n10.1126/science.1198858\n10.1038/nature07247\n10.1038/ncomms1877\n10.1063/1.2803315\n10.1016/S1369-7021(09)70315-3\n10.1038/ncomms1758\n10.1088/1367-2630/9/9/323\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.175503\n10.1063/1.4709436\n10.1126/science.1252291\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.12.015\n10.1038/srep05979\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.185502\n10.1002/adma.201505409\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2011.06.011\n10.1038/nmat3364\n10.1038/nmat3331\n10.1126/science.345.6197.633-a\n10.1126/science.1252876\n10.1063/1.4913751\n10.1126/science.1186351\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.033901\n10.1063/1.4977561\n10.1016/S0021-9290(00)00110-X\n10.1067/mse.2003.22\n10.1007/s10439-004-7825-2\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0560\n10.1007/s00158-010-0508-8\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.02.024\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2013.11.069\n10.1021/acsami.6b03152\n10.1002/jbm.a.35855\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.06.012\n10.1002/adma.201301986\n10.1002/adma.201104395\n10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2006.09.005\n10.1002/jor.22023\n10.1016/S0021-9290(03)00010-1\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.11.032\n10.1109/TBME.2011.2179803\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.08.015\n10.1016/j.matdes.2013.01.071\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.09.049\n10.1016/j.ijplas.2011.03.008\n10.1016/0020-7403(67)90066-5\n10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2009.01.003\n10.1007/s00170-015-7576-2\n10.1108/RPJ-01-2013-0012\n10.1115/1.4028580\n10.1016/j.addma.2016.06.010\n10.1002/nme.5461\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.05.037\n10.1007/s00158-006-0027-9\n10.1016/S0021-9290(00)00124-X\n10.1080/10255849908907982\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.05.002\n10.1016/j.apm.2012.10.049\n10.1038/nmat3115\n10.1016/j.jmps.2014.08.008\n10.1038/nmat4863\n10.1115/1.4032423\n10.1126/science.1164865\n10.1038/nmat4089\n10.1016/j.procir.2012.07.108\n10.1007/s00170-009-2002-2\n10.1016/j.rcim.2010.03.008\n10.1007/s10439-016-1610-x\n10.1148/radiol.13122321\n10.1148/radiol.13122320\n10.1002/mp.12125\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.08.032\n10.1007/s10529-017-2367-5"}
{"title": "Polymers for 3D Printing and Customized Additive Manufacturing.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) alias 3D printing translates computer-aided design (CAD) virtual 3D models into physical objects. By digital slicing of CAD, 3D scan, or tomography data, AM builds objects layer by layer without the need for molds or machining. AM enables decentralized fabrication of customized objects on demand by exploiting digital information storage and retrieval via the Internet. The ongoing transition from rapid prototyping to rapid manufacturing prompts new challenges for mechanical engineers and materials scientists alike. Because polymers are by far the most utilized class of materials for AM, this Review focuses on polymer processing and the development of polymers and advanced polymer systems specifically for AM. AM techniques covered include vat photopolymerization (stereolithography), powder bed fusion (SLS), material and binder jetting (inkjet and aerosol 3D printing), sheet lamination (LOM), extrusion (FDM, 3D dispensing, 3D fiber deposition, and 3D plotting), and 3D bioprinting. The range of polymers used in AM encompasses thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers, hydrogels, functional polymers, polymer blends, composites, and biological systems. Aspects of polymer design, additives, and processing parameters as they relate to enhancing build speed and improving accuracy, functionality, surface finish, stability, mechanical properties, and porosity are addressed. Selected applications demonstrate how polymer-based AM is being exploited in lightweight engineering, architecture, food processing, optics, energy technology, dentistry, drug delivery, and personalized medicine. Unparalleled by metals and ceramics, polymer-based AM plays a key role in the emerging AM of advanced multifunctional and multimaterial systems including living biological systems as well as life-like

In this study, a custom-made micro-extrusion bioprinting system was built and utilized to fabricate different scaffold structures such as log-pile scaffold and two-ring scaffold. This approach showed tremendous potential because of its ability to produce microscale channels with almost any shape. We were able to fabricate these scaffolds by using a custom-made 3D bioprinter to print hydrogel solution, mostly composed of Pluronic F-127, then wash away hydrogen by phosphate buffer saline (PBS) after crosslinking of main structure. We were able to achieve the desired scaffold structure by feeding G-codes data into user interface (Pronterface) and then translating that model into a program that utilizes a customized programming language, which instructs the microfabrication printer nozzles to dispense the hydrogel at specific locations.

This technology has attracted extensive attention due to its possibility of curing disease in tissue engineering and organ regeneration. In this paper, we have developed a novel rotary forming device, prepared an alginate\u207bgelatin solution for the fabrication of vessel-like structures, and further proposed a theoretical model to analyze the parameters of motion synchronization. Using this rotary forming device, we firstly establish a theoretical model to analyze the thickness under the different nozzle extrusion speeds, nozzle speeds, and servo motor speeds. Secondly, the experiments with alginate\u207bgelatin solution are carried out to construct the vessel-like structures under all sorts of conditions. The experiment results show that the thickness cannot be adequately predicted by the theoretical model and the thickness can be controlled by changing the parameters. Finally, the optimized parameters of thickness have been adjusted to estimate the real thickness in 3D printing.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2017-07-31", "authors": ["HuanbaoLiu", "HuixingZhou", "HaimingLan", "TianyuLiu", "XiaolongLiu", "HejieYu"], "doi": "10.3390/mi8080237\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.07.038\n10.1039/C4BM00234B\n10.1002/bit.25493\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/1/015007\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.04.007\n10.1115/1.4024575\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.12.011\n10.18063/ijb.2016.02.010\n10.1002/anie.201505062\n10.1002/dvdy.24254\n10.1080/17452759.2017.1338065\n10.1115/1.3002759\n10.1002/adma.200701876\n10.1179/1743280414Y.0000000040\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045002\n10.18063/ijb.2017.01.001\n10.1039/C6LC00789A\n10.1155/2016/3569843\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.034\n10.1002/jbm.a.34420\n10.1002/adma.201305506\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.056\n10.1093/ejcts/ezu242\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.071\n10.1002/bit.25493\n10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00643\n10.1177/2472630317712221"}
{"title": "[Allogeneic transplants for biological reconstruction of bone defects].", "abstract": "A combination of allogeneic and autologous bone transplants is frequently used for the biological reconstruction of bone defects. Autologous bone transplants can be used either in the form of structural or cancellous bone transplants. The osteogenic potential of autologous cancellous bone is well-known and is still the gold standard with respect to osteoinduction and remodelling. Structural transplants, such as fibular and tricortical iliac crest grafts can be transplanted either free, i.e. non-vascularized or vascularized with anastomosed vessels. Allogeneic bone transplants can be used in a spongiose or structural form. In revision endoprosthetics the use of allogeneic bone transplants has essentially been reduced to impaction grafting, due to the introduction of trabecular metal as a permanently stable substitute. Allogeneic transplants have been restricted due to 3D-printing and the associated individually adapted reconstruction. In individual cases combined reconstruction consisting of allograft and endoprosthesis provide the advantage of safe load transmission and permanent reconstruction by the endoprosthesis and the possibility of soft tissue insertion of the allograft.", "journal": "Der Orthopade", "date": "2017-07-30", "authors": ["RWindhager", "G MHobusch", "MMatzner"], "doi": "10.1007/s00132-017-3452-0"}

{"title": "3D-printed biomaterials with regional auxetic properties.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering is replete with methods for inducing and mediating cell differentiation, which are crucial for ensuring proper regrowth of desired tissues. In this study, we developed a 3D-printed, non-positive Poisson's Ratio (NPPR) scaffold intended for future use in stretch-mediated cell differentiation applications, such as in muscle and tendon regeneration. We utilized dynamic optical projection stereolithography (DOPsL) to fabricate multi-layered, cell-laden NPPR scaffolds - these scaffolds can not only support aggregate cell growth, but can also be printed with locally-tunable force-displacement properties at length scales appropriate for tissue interaction.

The precise value of the inner semi cone angle of the nanopipettes taper was extracted from the acquired images and used for calculating their radius using electrochemical methods. Because of the low electrical resistivity presented by the 3D printed holder, the imaging of non-conductive nanomaterials, such as alumina powder, was found to be possible.

An investigation into the use of 3D-printed anatomical models in undergraduate anatomy education.", "abstract": "Understanding the three-dimensional (3D) nature of the human form is imperative for effective medical practice and the emergence of 3D printing creates numerous opportunities to enhance aspects of medical and healthcare training. A recently deceased, un-embalmed donor was scanned through high-resolution computed tomography. The scan data underwent segmentation and post-processing and a range of 3D-printed anatomical models were produced. A four-stage mixed-methods study was conducted to evaluate the educational value of the models in a medical program. (1) A quantitative pre/post-test to assess change in learner knowledge following 3D-printed model usage in a small group tutorial; (2) student focus group (3) a qualitative student questionnaire regarding personal student model usage (4) teaching faculty evaluation. The use of 3D-printed models in small-group anatomy teaching session resulted in a significant increase in knowledge (P\u2009=\u20090.0001) when compared to didactic 2D-image based teaching methods. Student focus groups yielded six key themes regarding the use of 3D-printed anatomical models: model properties, teaching integration, resource integration, assessment, clinical imaging, and pathology and anatomical variation. Questionnaires detailed how students used the models in the home environment and integrated them with anatomical learning resources such as textbooks and anatomy lectures. In conclusion, 3D-printed anatomical models can be successfully produced from the CT data set of a recently deceased donor.

Among all the means involved to achieve this aim, dielectrophoresis (DEP) is increasingly employed in molecules manipulation and concentration because it is non-destructive and high efficiency. This paper presents a methodology to achieve protein concentration utilizing the combination effects of electrokinetics and low frequency insulating dielectrophoresis (iDEP) generated within a microfluidic device, in which a submicron constricted channel was fabricated using DNA molecular combing and replica molding. This fabrication technique avoids using e-beam lithography or other complicated nanochannel fabrication methods, and provides an easy and low cost approach with the flexibility of controlling channel dimensions to create highly constricted channels embedded in a microfluidic device. With theoretical analysis and experiments, we demonstrated that fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) protein molecules can be significantly concentrated to form an arc-shaped band near the constricted channel under the effects of a negative dielectrophoretic force and DC electrokinetic forces within a short period of time. It was also observed that the amplitudes of the applied DC and AC electric fields, the AC frequencies as well as the suspending medium conductivities had strong effects on the concentration responses of the FITC-BSA molecules, including the concentrated area and position, intensities of the focused molecules, and concentration speed. Our method provides a simple and flexible approach for quickly concentrating protein molecules by controlling the applied electric field parameters. The iDEP device reported in this paper can be used as a stand-alone sensor or worked as a pre-concentration module integrated with biosensors for protein biomarker detection. Furthermore, low frequency dielectrophoresis provides practical uses for integrating the concentration module with a portable biosensing system.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-07-29", "authors": ["PengZhang", "YuxinLiu"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa82d6"}

The resulting 3D model was used to observe the anatomical features of the multilevel OLF area and to design the surgical approach. At the base of the spinous process, two channels were created using an osteotomy bilaterally to create a \"V\" shape to remove the bone ligamentous complex (BLC).

Both of these materials have demonstrated good biocompatibility. A major disadvantage associated with solid titanium cages is their radiopacity, limiting the postoperative monitoring of spinal fusion via standard imaging modalities. However, PEEK is radiolucent, allowing for a temporal assessment of the fusion mass by clinicians. On the other hand, PEEK is hydrophobic, which can limit bony ingrowth. Although both PEEK and titanium have demonstrated clinical success in obtaining a solid spinal fusion, innovations are being developed to improve fusion rates and to create stronger constructs using hybrid additive manufacturing approaches by incorporating both materials into a single interbody device.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the interbody fusion characteristic of a PEEK Titanium Composite (PTC) cage for use in lumbar fusion.\nThirty-four mature female sheep underwent two-level (L\nPost sacrifice, each surgically treated functional spinal unit underwent non-destructive kinematic testing, microcomputed tomography scanning, and histomorphometric analyses.\nRelative to the standard PEEK cages, the PTC constructs demonstrated significant reductions in ranges of motion and a significant increase in stiffness.

One way in which to obtain personalised medicines, on-site and on-demand is by three-dimensional printing (3DP). The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the shape, size and colour of different placebo 3D printed tablets (Printlets\u2122) manufactured by fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3DP on end-user acceptability regarding picking and swallowing. Ten different printlet shapes were prepared by 3DP for an open-label, randomised, exploratory pilot study with 50 participants. Participant-reported outcome (PRO) and researcher reported outcome (RRO) were collected after picking and swallowing of selected printlet geometries including sphere, torus, disc, capsule and tilted diamond shapes. The torus printlet received the highest PRO cores for ease of swallowing and ease of picking. Printlets with a similar appearance to conventional formulations (capsule and disc shape) were also found to be easy to swallow and pick which demonstrates that familiarity is a critical acceptability attribute for end-users. RRO scores were in agreement with the PRO scores. The sphere was not perceived to be an appropriate way of administering an oral solid medicine. Smaller printlet sizes were found to be preferable; however it was found that the perception of size was driven by the type of shape. Printlet colour was also found to affect the perception of the end-user.

{"title": "A preliminary study to estimate contact rates between free-roaming domestic dogs using novel miniature cameras.", "abstract": "Information on contacts between individuals within a population is crucial to inform disease control strategies, via parameterisation of disease spread models. In this study we investigated the use of dog-borne video cameras-in conjunction with global positioning systems (GPS) loggers-to both characterise dog-to-dog contacts and to estimate contact rates. We customized miniaturised video cameras, enclosed within 3D-printed plastic cases, and attached these to nylon dog collars. Using two 3400 mAh NCR lithium Li-ion batteries, cameras could record a maximum of 22 hr of continuous video footage. Together with a GPS logger, collars were attached to six free roaming domestic dogs (FRDDs) in two remote Indigenous communities in northern Australia. We recorded a total of 97 hr of video footage, ranging from 4.5 to 22 hr (mean 19.1) per dog, and observed a wide range of social behaviours. The majority (69%) of all observed interactions between community dogs involved direct physical contact. Direct contact behaviours included sniffing, licking, mouthing and play fighting. No contacts appeared to be aggressive, however multiple teeth baring incidents were observed during play fights. We identified a total of 153 contacts-equating to 8 to 147 contacts per dog per 24 hr-from the videos of the five dogs with camera data that could be analysed. These contacts were attributed to 42 unique dogs (range 1 to 19 per video) which could be identified (based on colour patterns and markings). Most dog activity was observed in urban (houses and roads) environments, but contacts were more common in bushland and beach environments. A variety of foraging behaviours were observed, included scavenging through rubbish and rolling on dead animal carcasses. Identified food consumed included chicken, raw bones, animal carcasses, rubbish, grass and cheese. For characterising contacts between FRDD, several benefits of analysing videos compared to GPS fixes alone were identified in this study, including visualisation of the nature of the contact between two dogs; and inclusion of a greater number of dogs in the study (which do not need to be wearing video or GPS collars). Some limitations identified included visualisation of contacts only during daylight hours; the camera lens being obscured on occasion by the dog's mandible or the dog resting on the camera; an insufficiently wide viewing angle (36\u00b0); battery life and robustness of the deployments; high costs of the deployment; and analysis of large volumes of often unsteady video footage. This study demonstrates that dog-borne video cameras, are a feasible technology for estimating and characterising contacts between FRDDs.

The initial fixity for 3D printed and compression-molded samples was similar, but the initial recovery was much lower for the 3D printed sample (R = 58%) than that for the compression-molded sample (R = 83%). The poor recovery in the first cycle is attributed to polyethylene crystals formed during programming that act to resist the permanent network recovery. This effect is magnified in the 3D printed part due to the higher strain (lower modulus in the 3D printed part) at a fixed programming stress. The fixity and recovery in subsequent shape memory cycles are greater for the 3D printed part than for the compression-molded part. Moreover, the programmed strain can be systematically modulated by inclusion of porosity in the printed part without adversely impacting the fixity or recovery. These characteristics enable the direct formation of complex shapes of thermoplastic shape memory polymers that can be recovered in three dimensions with the appropriate trigger, such as heat, through the use of FDM as a 3D printing technology.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-07-26", "authors": ["ZhiyangZhao", "FangPeng", "Kevin ACavicchi", "MukerremCakmak", "R AWeiss", "Bryan DVogt"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b07816"}

The proposed equipment relies on the use of modern prototyping tools such as 3D printers and microcontroller boards and only a few \"off-the-shelf\" parts to deliver a simple yet powerful EC-SPM equipment capable of performing simple space-resolved electrochemical measurements. The equipment was able to perform space-resolved electrochemical measurements using a platinum ultramicroelectrode (UME) as the working electrode on a scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) configuration and was used to record approach curves, line scans, and array scans over an insulating substrate. The performance of the proposed equipment was found to be adequate for simple SECM measurements under hindered diffusion conditions. Because of its flexible design (software and hardware), more complex array scan patterns, only found on high-end EC-SPM setups such as hopping mode scan, were easily implemented on the built equipment. Despite its simplicity, the versatility and low cost of the proposed design make it an attractive alternative as a teaching platform as well as a platform for developing more elaborate EC-SPM setups.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2017-07-26", "authors": ["Gabriel NMeloni"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.7b01764"}
{"title": "Asymmetric pedicle subtractionosteotomy (aPSO) guided by a 3D-printed model to correct a combined fixed sagittal and coronal imbalance.", "abstract": "Surgical correction of fixed thoracolumbar deformity is usually achieved by estimating the preoperatively planned correction angles during surgery and is therefore prone to inaccuracy. This is particularly problematic in biplanar deformities. To overcome these difficulties, 3D model for planning, preparation, and simulation of an asymmetric pedicle subtraction osteotomy (aPSO) was printed and used to realign coronal and sagittal balance in case of rigid degenerative kyphoscoliosis. A 59-year-old woman presented with severe back pain and spinal claudication and was diagnosed with a rigid kyphoscoliosis with multilevel spinal stenosis. Spino-pelvic parameters were measured preoperatively (pelvic incidence 47\u00b0 [PI], lumbar lordosis 18\u00b0 [LL]; pelvic tilt 42\u00b0 [PT], T1 pelvic angle 40\u00b0 [TPA], Cobb angle 33\u00b0, sagittal vertical axis 10.5\u00a0cm [SVA]). To aid the complex deformity in the sagittal and coronal plane, a 1:1 3D model of the spine was printed according to the preoperative computed tomography (CT). With the use of a rebalancing software, the spine was prepared in vitro as a model for intraoperative realignment and the correction was preoperatively simulated. Surgery was accomplished according to the preoperative software-guided plan. Asymmetric pedicle subtraction osteotomy (aPSO) of L3 identical to the 3D model was performed. Additionally, a Smith-Peterson osteotomy of L4/5 with transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and laminectomy of L2-S1 with pedicle screw instrumentation TH12-S1 was accomplished. Postoperative radiological parameters revealed good success (LL 40\u00b0, SVA 6\u00a0cm, PT 19\u00b0, TPA 22\u00b0, and a Cobb angle of 8\u00b0). Improvement of the Oswestry disability index (ODI) of 42 to 18, the visual analog scale (VAS) of 8 to 1, and walking distance 100 to 8000\u00a0m compared to preoperatively resulted at 24\u00a0months follow-up. The precise coronal and sagittal correction of a rigid degenerative kyphoscoliosis presents a major challenge. Asymmetric PSO is able to realign the thoracolumbar spine in both the coronal and sagittal planes. The creation of an in vitro 3D-printed model of a patient's spinal deformity in combination with a software to calculate the correction angles facilitates preoperative planning and implementation of aPSO.", "journal": "Neurosurgical review", "date": "2017-07-26", "authors": ["Pierre-PascalGirod", "SHartmann", "PKavakebi", "JObernauer", "MVerius", "CThom\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1007/s10143-017-0882-4"}

Stereolithography (SLA) offers a simple and predictable way for an accurate reconstruction of congenital or acquired defects.\nA 65-years old cancer patient with non- keratinized squamous cell carcinoma of left maxillary sinus came for a prosthetic clinical evaluation. A bilateral maxillectomy was performed and the treatment plan included definite obturator prosthesis for the upper arch. CT data and 3D planning software were used to create a 3D printing plastic model of the defect. A wax pattern of the hollow bulb was fabricated and cured with heat-cured silicone soft liner. A final impression was obtained with the hollow bulb placed intraorally. The master cast was duplicated and the new cast was invested and reflasked. The flasks were opened, wax was boiled out and some space was created in the internal part of the obturator. Transparent heat cured acrylic resin was sandwiched with, at the inner part of the bulb, improving the retention between the acrylic denture base and the silicone based soft lining material.

Although PAP is more efficacious at lowering the polysomnographic indices of OSA, the clinical effectiveness of PAP and oral appliances is similar, and patients are more likely to adhere to oral appliance therapy than to PAP treatment. Clinical examination is used to determine the candidacy of oral appliances and to select a particular appliance for a given patient. Endoscopic examination of the pharynx may be used to help assess the potential for efficacy. Otherwise, if available, titration of mandibular protrusion during sleep may be performed prior to appliance production in order to assess efficacy. Once a patient is fitted with a titratable oral appliance, further advancement is usually performed at home to resolve the clinical symptoms and signs of OSA. Clinical follow-up is needed to assess the outcome, side effects, and adherence, as the long-term adherence rate is approximately 50%.

Additionally, this paper discusses the important properties of bio-inks to be applied in the EBB technique, including biocompatibility, printability, as well as mechanical properties. The printability of a bio-ink is associated with the formation of first layer, ink rheological properties, and crosslinking mechanisms. Further, this paper discusses two bioprinting approaches to build up cartilage constructs, i.e., self-supporting hydrogel bioprinting and hybrid bioprinting, along with their applications in fabricating chondral, osteochondral, and zonally organized cartilage regenerative constructs.

{"title": "Matrix-Assisted Three-Dimensional Printing of Cellulose Nanofibers for Paper Microfluidics.", "abstract": "A cellulose nanofiber (CNF), one of the most attractive green bioresources, was adopted for construction of microfluidic devices using matrix-assisted three-dimensional (3D) printing. CNF hydrogels can support structures printed using CAD design in a 3D hydrogel environment with the appropriate combination of rheological properties between the CNF hydrogel and ink materials. Amazingly, the structure printed freely in the bulky CNF hydrogels was able to retain its highly resolved 3D features in an ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) paper using a simple drying process. The dimensional change in the CNF hydrogels from 3D to 2D resulted from simple dehydration of the CNFs and provided transparent, stackable paper-based 3D channel devices. As a proof of principle, the rheological properties of the CNF hydrogels, the 3D structure of the ink, the formation of channels by evacuation of the ink, and the highly localized selectivity of the devices are described.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-07-25", "authors": ["SungchulShin", "JinhoHyun"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b07609"}
{"title": "Applications of additive manufacturing in dentistry: A review.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing has been hailed as the third industrial revolution as it has caused a paradigm shift in the way objects have been manufactured. Conventionally, converting a raw material to a fully finished and assembled, usable product comprises several steps which can be eliminated by using this process as functional products can be created directly from the raw material at a fraction of the time originally consumed. Thus, AM has found applications in several sectors including automotive, aerospace, printed electronics, and healthcare. AM is increasingly being used in the healthcare sector, given its potential to fabricate patient-specific customized implants with required accuracy and precision. Implantable heart valves, rib cages, and bones are some of the examples where AM technologies are used. A vast variety of materials including ceramics, metals, polymers, and composites have been processed to fabricate intricate implants using 3D printing. The applications of AM in dentistry include maxillofacial implants, dentures, and other prosthetic aids. It may also be used in surgical training and planning, as anatomical models can be created at ease using AM. This article gives an overview of the AM process and reviews in detail the applications of 3D printing in dentistry. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Integrating the 3D printed exoskeleton with passive joints to compensate gravity and with active joints to rotate the shoulder and elbow joints resulted in ultra-light system that could assist planar reaching motion by using the vision-based control law. The EAsoftM can support the reaching motion with compliance realized by the soft materials and pneumatic actuation. In addition, the vision-based control law has been proposed for the precise control over the target reaching motion within the millimeter scale. Aiming at rehabilitation exercise for individuals, typically soft actuators have been developed for relatively small motions, such as grasping motion, and one of the challenges has been to extend their use for a wider range reaching motion. The proposed EAsoftM presented one possible solution for this challenge by transmitting the torque effectively along the anatomically aligned with a human body exoskeleton. The proposed integrated systems will be an ideal solution for neurorehabilitation where affordable, wearable, and portable systems are required to be customized for individuals with specific motor impairments.", "journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "date": "2017-07-25", "authors": ["Victoria WOguntosin", "YoshikiMori", "HyejongKim", "Slawomir JNasuto", "SadaoKawamura", "YoshikatsuHayashi"], "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2017.00352\n10.1109/TMECH.2011.2144614\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.740.408\n10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2010347\n10.1109/BioRob.2012.6290919\n10.1038/srep40869\n10.1007/s12541-012-0107-2\n10.1186/1743-0003-1-5\n10.1002/anie.201006464\n10.1109/7333.948460\n10.1109/AIM.2015.7222630\n10.1016/j.humov.2014.08.014\n10.2522/ptj.20090160\n10.1007/s11517-011-0797-0\n10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2265263\n10.1109/icorr.2007.4428510\n10.1186/1743-0003-11-3\n10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907161\n10.1002/adma.201203002\n10.1109/IROS.2012.6385785\n10.1109/ICORR.2015.7281291\n10.1109/ICORR.2015.7281175\n10.1109/TNSRE.2006.881553\n10.1073/pnas.1116564108\n10.1109/IROS.2013.6696995\n10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152246\n10.1682/JRRD.2005.04.0070\n10.1109/37.833638\n10.1109/robot.2000.845299\n10.1109/TMECH.2010.2090353"}

Extension of kirigami and origami patterning to micro-, meso-, and nanoscales enabled production of nanocomposites with unusual combination of properties, transitioning these art forms to the toolbox of materials design. Various subtractive and additive fabrication techniques applicable to nanocomposites and out-of-plane deformation of patterns enable a technological framework to negotiate often contradictory structural requirements for materials properties. Additionally, the long-searched possibility of patterned composites/parts with highly predictable set of properties/functions emerged.

{"title": "Protein-only, antimicrobial peptide-containing recombinant nanoparticles with inherent built-in antibacterial activity.", "abstract": "The emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistances is a serious concern in human and animal health. In this context, naturally occurring cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) might play a main role in a next generation of drugs against bacterial infections. Taking an innovative approach to design self-organizing functional proteins, we have generated here protein-only nanoparticles with intrinsic AMP microbicide activity. Using a recombinant version of the GWH1 antimicrobial peptide as building block, these materials show a wide antibacterial activity spectrum in absence of detectable toxicity on mammalian cells. The GWH1-based nanoparticles combine clinically appealing properties of nanoscale materials with full biocompatibility, structural and functional plasticity and biological efficacy exhibited by proteins. Because of the largely implemented biological fabrication of recombinant protein drugs, the protein-based platform presented here represents a novel and scalable strategy in antimicrobial drug design, that by solving some of the limitations of AMPs offers a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics.\nThe low molecular weight antimicrobial peptide GWH1 has been engineered to oligomerize as self-assembling protein-only nanoparticles of around 50nm. In this form, the peptide exhibits potent and broad antibacterial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, without any harmful effect over mammalian cells. As a solid proof-of-concept, this finding strongly supports the design and biofabrication of nanoscale antimicrobial materials with in-built functionalities. The protein-based homogeneous composition offer advantages over alternative materials explored as antimicrobial agents, regarding biocompatibility, biodegradability and environmental suitability.

{"title": "Reinforcements in avian wing bones: Experiments, analysis, and modeling.", "abstract": "Almost all species of modern birds are capable of flight; the mechanical competency of their wings and the rigidity of their skeletal system evolved to enable this outstanding feat. One of the most interesting examples of structural adaptation in birds is the internal structure of their wing bones. In flying birds, bones need to be sufficiently strong and stiff to withstand forces during takeoff, flight, and landing, with a minimum of weight. The cross-sectional morphology and presence of reinforcing structures (struts and ridges) found within bird wing bones vary from species to species, depending on how the wings are utilized. It is shown that both morphology and internal features increases the resistance to flexure and torsion with a minimum weight penalty. Prototypes of reinforcing struts fabricated by 3D printing were tested in diametral compression and torsion to validate the concept. In compression, the ovalization decreased through the insertion of struts, while they had no effect on torsional resistance. An elastic model of a circular ring reinforced by horizontal and vertical struts is developed to explain the compressive stiffening response of the ring caused by differently oriented struts.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2017-07-25", "authors": ["ENovitskaya", "C JRuestes", "M MPorter", "V ALubarda", "M AMeyers", "JMcKittrick"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.07.020"}

Today digitalization allows a machine-based manufacturing in subtractive (milling) and additive (printing) means using industrial-made PMMA or comparable resins. An in-vitro study should assess the surface finish and screen the wear resistance of conventional and industrial materials. Therefore, a total of 30 specimens made from conventionally PMMA (group C; powder-liquid, Palapress), polycarbonate ingots (group S; innoBlanc splint plus), and light-curing resin (group A; VarseoWax splint) were polished to examine the surface roughness (Ra) by profilometry and further analyzed by SEM. The specimens were loaded with a steatite ball moving 5000 times along 1cm with 5N of surface pressure under constant wetting (artificial saliva). The total height of profile (Pt) was calculated by further profilometry of the specimens. All specimen showed initially comparable Ra values ranging between 0.06 and 0.05\u00b5m (SD = 0.01) after polishing. SEM investigations revealed no visual cues for scratches or irregularities in any group. After abrasion test, the comparison of the wear depths, revealed mean Pt values of 111.4\u00b5m (SD = 18.5) in C, 85.7\u00b5m (SD = 21.5) in S, and 99.1\u00b5m (SD = 21.5) in A, whereas the mean of S was statistically different from C (p = 0.025).

Articles in English or French dealing with human clinical use of 3D printing were selected. Publication date, nationality of the authors, number of patients treated, clinical indication(s), type of printed object(s), type of printing (lab/hospital-made or professional/industry) and advantages/drawbacks were recorded.\nTwo hundred and ninety-seven articles from 35\u00a0countries met the criteria. The most represented country was the People's Republic of China (16% of the articles). A total of 2889\u00a0patients (10 per article on average) benefited from 3D printed objects. The most frequent clinical indications were dental implant surgery and mandibular reconstruction. The most frequently printed objects were surgical guides and anatomic models. Forty-five percent of the prints were professional. The main advantages were improvement in precision and reduction of surgical time. The main disadvantages were the cost of the objects and the manufacturing period when printed by the industry.\nThe arrival on the market of low-cost printers has increased the use of 3D printing in MFS. Anatomic models are not considered to be MDs and do not have to follow any regulation. Nowadays, they are easily printed with low-cost printers. They allow for better preoperative planning and training for the procedures and for pre-shaping of plates. Occlusal splints and surgical guides are intended for the smooth transfer of planning to the operating room. They are considered to be MDs and even if they are easy to print, they have to follow the regulations applying to MDs. Patient specific implants (custom-made plates and skeletal reconstruction modules) are much more demanding objects and their manufacturing remains nowadays in the hands of the industry. The main limitation of in-hospital 3D printing is the restrictive regulations applying to MDs. The main limitations of professional 3D printing are the cost and the lead time. 3D printed objects are nowadays easily available in MFS.

Previous evidence from in-vitro studies has shown that significant changes occur under simulated microgravity. For this reason, human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells were selected as cell model of intestinal epithelial barrier and their response to altered gravity conditions was investigated, especially on the protein level. In this study, we combined label-free shotgun proteomics and bioluminescent reporter gene assays to identify key proteins and pathways involved in the response of Caco-2 cells under reference and microgravity conditions. A two-dimensional clinostat was modified with 3D-printed adaptors to hold conventional T25 culture flasks.

In this paper we demonstrate that a custom digital light processor stereolithographic (DLP-SLA) 3D printer and a specifically-designed, low cost, custom resin can readily achieve flow channel cross sections as small as 18 \u03bcm \u00d7 20 \u03bcm. Our 3D printer has a projected image plane resolution of 7.6 \u03bcm and uses a 385 nm LED, which dramatically increases the available selection of UV absorbers for resin formulation compared to 3D printers with 405 nm LEDs. Beginning with 20 candidate absorbers, we demonstrate the evaluation criteria and process flow required to develop a high-resolution resin. In doing so, we introduce a new mathematical model for characterizing the resin optical penetration depth based only on measurement of the absorber's molar absorptivity. Our final resin formulation uses 2-nitrophenyl phenyl sulfide (NPS) as the UV absorber. We also develop a novel channel narrowing technique that, together with the new resin and 3D printer resolution, enables small flow channel fabrication.

However, traditional lab-scale techniques hardly reached the needed large scale production of cell spheroids, thus limiting their versatility in many biomedical fields. Microscale technologies have rapidly improved in the last decade, and contributed to the large scale production of cell spheroids with high controllability and reproducibility. Nonetheless, the existing microwell culture platforms are problematic due to unwanted cellular adhesion to the substrate as well as due to substantial amounts of cell loss. In this study, we have developed a novel configuration of cylindrical type polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel microwells featuring inverted-pyramidal openings (iPO). Highly refined microstructures of our novel microwell could be fabricated by our optimized micro-electro mechanical system protocols consisting of a silicon (Si) wet/dry etching, Si-to-polydimethylsiloxane substrate bonding, and the established soft-lithography techniques. The iPO, the PEG hydrogel, and the cylindrical geometry of our microwell successfully (1) avoided inefficient washing steps after cell seeding, (2) achieved the complete resistance to cellular adhesion on the microwell substrate, and (3) made all seeded cells readily gathered and jam-packed to form cell spheroids with uniform size, respectively. The maximal sizes of cell spheroids were confined to below 200 \u03bcm according to the size of microwells used in this study. The efficiency testing for cell spheroid formation was conducted in comparison with other types of microwells that have been often used in the fields. The results showed that our novel microwell platform effectively reached almost zero percent of cell loss while mass-producing human mesenchymal stem cell spheroids with highly precise control over spheroid's size and cell number.

{"title": "Repair of Tympanic Membrane Perforations with Customized Bioprinted Ear Grafts Using Chinchilla Models.", "abstract": "The goal of this work is to develop an innovative method that combines bioprinting and endoscopic imaging to repair tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs). TMPs are a serious health issue because they can lead to both conductive hearing loss and repeated otitis media. TMPs occur in 3-5% of cases after ear tube placement, as well as in cases of acute otitis media (the second most common infection in pediatrics), chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma, or as a result of barotrauma to the ear. About 55,000 tympanoplasties, the surgery performed to reconstruct TMPs, are performed every year, and the commonly used cartilage grafting technique has a success rate between 43% and 100%. This wide variability in successful tympanoplasty indicates that the current approach relies heavily on the skill of the surgeon to carve the shield graft into the shape of the TMP, which can be extremely difficult because of the perforation's irregular shape. To this end, we hypothesized that patient specific acellular grafts can be bioprinted to repair TMPs. In vitro data demonstrated that our approach resulted in excellent wound healing responses (e.g., cell invasion and proliferations) using our bioprinted gelatin methacrylate constructs. Based on these results, we then bioprinted customized acellular grafts to treat TMP based on endoscopic imaging of the perforation and demonstrated improved TMP healing in a chinchilla study. These ear graft techniques could transform clinical practice by eliminating the need for hand-carved grafts. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of concept of using bioprinting and endoscopic imaging to fabricate customized grafts to treat tissue perforations. This technology could be transferred to other medical pathologies and be used to rapidly scan internal organs such as intestines for microperforations, brain covering (Dura mater) for determination of sites of potential cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and vascular systems to determine arterial wall damage before aneurysm rupture in strokes.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Notably, characterization of these properties after implantation remains a challenge, raising the need for the development of novel quantitative imaging techniques for monitoring hydrogel implant behavior in situ. This study aims at (i) assessing the influence of hydrogel bioprinting patterns on electrical/mechanical behavior of cardiac implants based on a 3D-printing technique and (ii) investigating the potential of synchrotron X-ray phase-contrast imaging computed tomography (PCI-CT) for estimating elastic modulus/impedance/porosity and microstructural features of 3D-printed cardiac implants in situ via an ex vivo study. Alginate laden with human coronary artery endothelial cells was bioprinted layer by layer, forming cardiac constructs with varying architectures. The elastic modulus, impedance, porosity, and other structural features, along with the cell viability and degradation of printed implants were examined in vitro over 25 days. Two selected cardiac constructs were surgically implanted onto the myocardium of rats and 10 days later, the rat hearts with implants were imaged ex vivo by means of PCI-CT at varying X-ray energies and CT-scan times. The elastic modulus/impedance, porosity, and structural features of the implant were inferred from the PCI-CT images by using statistical models and compared with measured values. The printing patterns had significant effects on implant porosity, elastic modulus, and impedance. A particular 3D-printing pattern with an interstrand distance of 900\u2009\u03bcm and strand alignment angle of 0/45/90/135\u00b0 provided relatively higher stiffness and electrical conductivity with a suitable porosity, maintaining high cell viability over 7 days. The X-ray photon energy of 30-33\u2009keV utilizing a CT-scan time of 1-1.2\u2009h resulted in a low-dose PCI-CT, which provided a good visibility of the low-X-ray absorbent alginate implants. After 10 days postimplantation, the PCI-CT provided a reasonably accurate estimation of implant strand thickness and alignment, pore size and interconnectivity, porosity, elastic modulus, and impedance, which were consistent with our measurements. Findings from this study suggest that 3D-printing patterns can be used to modulate electrical/mechanical behavior of alginate implants, and PCI-CT can be potentially used as a 3D quantitative imaging tool for assessing structural and electrical/mechanical behavior of hydrogel cardiac implants in small animal models.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

There are different therapeutic modalities. Brachytherapy is one of the techniques used, in which it is necessary to build customized moulds for some patients. Currently, these moulds are made by hand using rudimentary techniques. We present a new procedure based on 3D printing and the analysis of the clinical workflow.\nMoulds can be made either by hand or by automated 3D printing. For making moulds by hand, a patient's alginate negative is created and, from that, the gypsum cast and customized moulds are made by hand from the patient's negative template. The new process is based on 3D printing. The first step is to take a 3D scan of the surface of the patient and then, 3D modelling software is used to obtain an accurate anatomical reconstruction of the treatment area. We present the clinical workflow using 3D scanning and printing technology, comparing its costs with the usual custom handmade mould protocol.\nThe time spent for the new process is 6.25 hours, in contrast to the time spent for the conventional process, which is 9.5 hours. We found a 34% reduction in time required to create a mould for brachytherapy treatment. The labor cost of the conventional process is 211.5 vs. 152.5 hours, so the reduction is 59 hours. There is also a 49.5% reduction in the financial costs, mostly due to lack of need of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the gypsum and the mould. 3D scanning and printing offers financial benefits and reduces the clinical workload.\nAs the present project demonstrates, through the application of 3D printing technologies, the costs and time spent during the process in the clinical workload in brachytherapy treatment are reduced.

Rapid prototyping (RP) systems allow these hurdles to be overcome by enabling the creation of a customized 3D model of the desired prosthesis.

However, due to the high cost of these applications and the special training required to operate them, they are not widely used.

Therefore, this process makes further treatment planning difficult for the maxillofacial prosthodontist. Here, we report the case of a 62-year-old woman who attended our clinic. Initially, she had presented with a right facial defect. This was later diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma and resected.

{"title": "Sorting cells by their density.", "abstract": "Sorting cells by their type is an important capability in biological research and medical diagnostics. However, most cell sorting techniques rely on labels or tags, which may have limited availability and specificity. Sorting different cell types by their different physical properties is an attractive alternative to labels because all cells intrinsically have these physical properties. But some physical properties, like cell size, vary significantly from cell to cell within a cell type; this makes it difficult to identify and sort cells based on their sizes alone. In this work we continuously sort different cells types by their density, a physical property with much lower cell-to-cell variation within a cell type (and therefore greater potential to discriminate different cell types) than other physical properties. We accomplish this using a 3D-printed microfluidic chip containing a horizontal flowing micron-scale density gradient. As cells flow through the chip, Earth's gravity makes each cell move vertically to the point where the cell's density matches the surrounding fluid's density. When the horizontal channel then splits, cells with different densities are routed to different outlets. As a proof of concept, we use our density sorter chip to sort polymer microbeads by their material (polyethylene and polystyrene) and blood cells by their type (white blood cells and red blood cells). The chip enriches the fraction of white blood cells in a blood sample from 0.1% (in whole blood) to nearly 98% (in the output of the chip), a 1000x enrichment. Any researcher with access to a 3D printer can easily replicate our density sorter chip and use it in their own research using the design files provided as online Supporting Information. Additionally, researchers can simulate the performance of a density sorter chip in their own applications using the Python-based simulation software that accompanies this work.

Isolated MA dilation (MAD) led to significantly increased antero-posterior distance (A-P) and decreased coaptation height (CH), tenting area (TA) and systolic leaflets angulation, resembling clinically recognized type I of mitral regurgitation with normal leaflet motion. Whereas concomitant MAD with PM displacement caused an increase in A-P, TA, CH. This geometrical configuration replicated typical determinants of type IIIb lesion with restricted leaflet motion. The proposed methods provided a realistic and repeatable ex vivo FMR model featuring two lesions clinically associated with the pathology.

{"title": "3D printed reversible shape changing soft actuators assisted by liquid crystal elastomers.", "abstract": "In this work, we advance printed active composites by combining 3D printing, printed electronics, and liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) to achieve soft actuators with free-standing two-way shape changing behaviors. Incorporated LCE strips are activated by Joule heating produced by printed conductive wires, while uniaxial deformation of the LCE strip is utilized as a driving force to achieve bending in the printed composite. The bending behavior of laminated hinges is first characterized in order to obtain a precise control of actuation, which is then exploited to actuate four demonstrative designs: a morphing airplane, a miura-ori structure, a cubic box, and a soft crawler. The soft morphing airplane and miura-ori structure are designed and fabricated with multiple laminated hinges to demonstrate the synergistic actions during actuation. The cubic box is constructed to show the capability of sequential folding by implementing multiple groups of conductive wires to achieve accurately addressable heating with temporal control. Finally, the two-way transformation is utilized as a driving force for the locomotion of a soft crawler stimulated by a periodic rectangular wave current. These examples show the great potential of using the hybrid 3D printing and pick-and-place method and using LCEs to achieve controllable shape change structures for a variety of potential practical applications.", "journal": "Soft matter", "date": "2017-07-20", "authors": ["ChaoYuan", "Devin JRoach", "Conner KDunn", "QuanyiMu", "XiaoKuang", "Christopher MYakacki", "T JWang", "KaiYu", "H JerryQi"], "doi": "10.1039/c7sm00759k"}

In addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena, can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called 'FlyPi'. Our design is based on a 3D-printed mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer, and high-definition camera system as well as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under \u20ac100 and features optional modules for light-emitting diode (LED)-based fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs approximately \u20ac200 or substantially less if the user is prepared to 'shop around'. All functions of FlyPi can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate FlyPi's capabilities, we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate FlyPi's utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several African universities.

{"title": "Mimicking arterial thrombosis in a 3D-printed microfluidic in vitro vascular model based on computed tomography angiography data.", "abstract": "Arterial thrombosis is the main instigating factor of heart attacks and strokes, which result in over 14 million deaths worldwide every year. The mechanism of thrombosis involves factors from the blood and the vessel wall, and it also relies strongly on 3D vessel geometry and local blood flow patterns. Microfluidic chip-based vascular models allow controlled in vitro studies of the interaction between vessel wall and blood in thrombosis, but until now, they could not fully recapitulate the 3D geometry and blood flow patterns of real-life healthy or diseased arteries. Here we present a method for fabricating microfluidic chips containing miniaturized vascular structures that closely mimic architectures found in both healthy and stenotic blood vessels. By applying stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing of computed tomography angiography (CTA) data, 3D vessel constructs were produced with diameters of 400 \u03bcm, and resolution as low as 25 \u03bcm. The 3D-printed templates in turn were used as moulds for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based soft lithography to create microfluidic chips containing miniaturized replicates of in vivo vessel geometries. By applying computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling a correlation in terms of flow fields and local wall shear rate was found between the original and miniaturized artery. The walls of the microfluidic chips were coated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) which formed a confluent monolayer as confirmed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The endothelialised microfluidic devices, with healthy and stenotic geometries, were perfused with human whole blood with fluorescently labeled platelets at physiologically relevant shear rates. After 15 minutes of perfusion the healthy geometries showed no sign of thrombosis, while the stenotic geometries did induce thrombosis at and downstream of the stenotic area. Overall, the novel methodology reported here, overcomes important design limitations found in typical 2D wafer-based soft lithography microfabrication techniques and shows great potential for controlled studies of the role of 3D vessel geometries and blood flow patterns in arterial thrombosis.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2017-07-19", "authors": ["Pedro FCosta", "Hugo JAlbers", "John E ALinssen", "Heleen H TMiddelkamp", "Lindavan der Hout", "RobertPassier", "Albertvan den Berg", "JosMalda", "Andries Dvan der Meer"], "doi": "10.1039/c7lc00202e"}

Data are reported as mean values (\u00b1 standard deviation).\nThe time needed to complete all tasks was 152.9 \u00b1 71.5 sec on the 1st attempt vs. 98.7 \u00b1 40.3 sec on the 4th attempt (P = 0.03). Likewise, the quality of performance score improved from 8.3 \u00b1 6.7 to 18.2 \u00b1 2.5 (P < 0.0001).

Some key points on concept of legal regulation of abovementioned sphere is a base of this study.\nScientific discussion on 3-D bioprinting, European Union`s and US experience in patenting of 3-D bioprinting technologies, European Medicine Agency (EMA) or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, European Medical Technology Industry Association (EUCOMED) Acts. Article is based on dialectical, comparative, analytic, synthetic and comprehensive research methods.\nGeneral debate of last few years comes down to an attempt to resolve hesitation between legal attempts for regulation of 3-D biobrinting and concept of complete prohibition of such activities. An adequate response to the mentioned challenge is a reasonable position between some aspects of prohibition and self-regulation, resulting in a moderate number of regulations and standards for developing and marketing. Such regulations may concern an intellectual property (IP) rights, regulation of distribution, premarket restrictions, control mechanism etc.\nScientific approach and regulatory settlement of 3-D bioprinting sphere must unite to achieve a fair balance between the interests of humanity and of individuals - on the one hand, and development of science and business benefits for stakeholders - on the other.

{"title": "Dosimetric characterization of 3D printed bolus at different infill percentage for external photon beam radiotherapy.", "abstract": "3D printing is rapidly evolving and further assessment of materials and technique is required for clinical applications. We evaluated 3D printed boluses with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactide (PLA) at different infill percentage.\nA low-cost 3D printer was used. The influence of the air inclusion within the 3D printed boluses was assessed thoroughly both with treatment planning system (TPS) and with physical measurements. For each bolus, two treatment plans were calculated with Monte Carlo algorithm, considering the computed tomography (CT) scan of the 3D printed bolus or modelling the 3D printed bolus as a virtual bolus structure with a homogeneous density. Depth dose measurements were performed with Gafchromic films.\nHigh infill percentage corresponds to high density and high homogeneity within bolus material. The approximation of the bolus in the TPS as a homogeneous material is satisfying for infill percentages greater than 20%. Measurements performed with PLA boluses are more comparable to the TPS calculated profiles. For boluses printed at 40% and 60% infill, the discrepancies between calculated and measured dose distribution are within 5%.\n3D printing technology allows modulating the shift of the build-up region by tuning the infill percentage of the 3D printed bolus in order to improve superficial target coverage.", "journal": "Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)", "date": "2017-07-18", "authors": ["RosalindaRicotti", "DeliaCiardo", "FlorianaPansini", "AlessiaBazani", "StefaniaComi", "RuggeroSpoto", "SamueleNoris", "FedericaCattani", "GuidoBaroni", "RobertoOrecchia", "AndreaVavassori", "Barbara AlicjaJereczek-Fossa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmp.2017.06.004"}

Cellulose, chitosan (a chitin derivative), and collagen are probably the most important components since they are the most abundant natural polymers on earth (cellulose and chitin) and in the human body (collagen). Peptides also merit attention because their self-assembling properties mimic the proteins that are present in the extracellular matrix. The present review is mainly focused on explaining the recent advances on hydrogels derived from the indicated polymers or their combinations. Attention has also been paid to the development of hydrogels for innovative biomedical uses. Therefore, smart materials displaying stimuli responsiveness and having shape memory properties are considered. The use of micro- and nanogels for drug delivery applications is also discussed, as well as the high potential of protein-based hydrogels in the production of bioactive matrices with recognition ability (molecular imprinting).

The thyroid gland, a relatively simple endocrine organ, is suitable for testing the proposed bioprinting technology. Here we report the bioprinting of a functional vascularized mouse thyroid gland construct from embryonic tissue spheroids as a proof of concept. Based on the self-assembly principle, we generated thyroid tissue starting from thyroid spheroids (TS) and allantoic spheroids (AS) as a source of thyrocytes and endothelial cells (EC), respectively. Inspired by mathematical modeling of spheroid fusion, we used an original 3D bioprinter to print TS in close association with AS within a collagen hydrogel. During the culture, closely placed embryonic tissue spheroids fused into a single integral construct, EC from AS invaded and vascularized TS, and epithelial cells from the TS progressively formed follicles. In this experimental setting, we observed formation of a capillary network around follicular cells, as observed during in utero thyroid development when thyroid epithelium controls the recruitment, invasion and expansion of EC around follicles. To prove that EC from AS are responsible for vascularization of the thyroid gland construct, we depleted endogenous EC from TS before bioprinting. EC from AS completely revascularized depleted thyroid tissue. The cultured bioprinted construct was functional as it could normalize blood thyroxine levels and body temperature after grafting under the kidney capsule of hypothyroid mice. Bioprinting of functional vascularized mouse thyroid gland construct represents a further advance in bioprinting technology, exploring the self-assembling properties of tissue spheroids.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-07-15", "authors": ["Elena ABulanova", "Elizaveta VKoudan", "JonathanDegosserie", "CharlotteHeymans", "Frederico DASPereira", "Vladislav AParfenov", "YiSun", "QiWang", "Suraya AAkhmedova", "Irina KSviridova", "Natalia SSergeeva", "Georgy AFrank", "Yusef DKhesuani", "Christophe EPierreux", "Vladimir AMironov"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa7fdd"}
{"title": "Three-dimensional (3D) culture in sarcoma research and the clinical significance.", "abstract": "Sarcomas are rare malignant tumors that arise from transformed cells of mesenchymal origin. Despite the progress in diagnosis and treatment, sarcomas have a high mortality rate due to local recurrence, metastasis, and the development of drug resistance to chemotherapy. New models for sarcoma research are required to further understand the disease and to develop new therapies. In vitro sarcoma modeling is challenging because of significant genetic heterogeneities, diverse pathological, and overlapping clinical characteristics. Studies on the mechanisms of recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance in sarcoma have resulted in the generation of novel three-dimensional (3D) culture models for sarcoma research. 3D culture models aim to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of sarcoma using biomaterial scaffolds of natural biological materials and artificial polymers. An ideal 3D culture model can properly mimic not only the microenvironment, oncogenesis, and maintenance of sarcoma cell growth, but also imitate the interactions between cells and to the extracellular matrix. More recently, 3D cell culture has been used to research the biological behavior and mechanism of chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance in different sarcoma models. Ultimately, findings using 3D models that more accurately reflect human sarcoma biology are likely to translate into improved clinical outcomes.

{"title": "Dry coating of solid dosage forms: an overview of processes and applications.", "abstract": "Dry coating techniques enable manufacturing of coated solid dosage forms with no, or very limited, use of solvents. As a result, major drawbacks associated with both organic solvents and aqueous coating systems can be overcome, such as toxicological, environmental, and safety-related issues on the one hand as well as costly drying phases and impaired product stability on the other. The considerable advantages related to solventless coating has been prompting a strong research interest in this field of pharmaceutics. In the article, processes and applications relevant to techniques intended for dry coating are analyzed and reviewed.

The \u03ba-carrageenan/PAAm DN hydrogel demonstrated an excellent recoverability and significant self-healing capability (even when notched). More importantly, the warm pregel solution of \u03ba-carrageenan/AAm can be used as an ink of a three-dimensional (3D) printer to print complex 3D structures with remarkable mechanical strength after UV exposure. Furthermore, the \u03ba-carrageenan/PAAm DN hydrogel exhibited a great strain sensitivity with a gauge factor of 0.63 at the strain of 1000%, and thus, the hydrogel can be used as sensitive strain sensors for applications in robotics and human motion detection.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-07-15", "authors": ["SijunLiu", "LinLi"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b07445"}
{"title": "Regulation of cell arrangement using a novel composite micropattern.", "abstract": "Micropatterning technique has been used to control single cell geometry in many researches, however, this is no report that it is used to control multicelluar geometry, which not only control single cell geometry but also organize those cells by a certain pattern. In this work, a composite protein micropattern is developed to control both cell shape and cell location simultaneously. The composite micropattern consists of a central circle 15 \u03bcm in diameter for single-cell capture, surrounded by small, square arrays (3 \u03bcm \u00d7 3 \u03bcm) for cell spreading. This is surrounded by a border 2 \u03bcm wide for restricting cell edges. The composite pattern results in two-cell and three-cell capture efficiencies of 32.1%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.94% and 24.2%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.89%, respectively, representing an 8.52% and 9.58% increase, respectively, over rates of original patterns. Fluorescent imaging of cytoskeleton alignment demonstrates that actin is gradually aligned parallel to the direction of the entire pattern arrangement, rather than to that of a single pattern. This indicates that cell arrangement is also an important factor in determining cell physiology. This composite micropattern could be a potential method to precisely control multi-cells for cell junctions, cell interactions, cell signal transduction, and eventually for tissue rebuilding study. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To achieve diagnostic utility and clinical impact, POCT technologies are immensely dependent on effective translation from academic laboratories out to real-world deployment. However, the current research and development pipeline is highly bottlenecked owing to multiple restraints in material, cost, and complexity of conventionally available fabrication techniques. Recently, 3D printing technology has emerged as a revolutionary, industry-compatible method enabling cost-effective, facile, and rapid manufacturing of objects. This has allowed iterative design-build-test cycles of various things, from microfluidic chips to smartphone interfaces, that are geared towards point-of-care applications. In this review, we focus on highlighting recent works that exploit 3D printing in developing POCT devices, underscoring its utility in all analytical steps.

The reconstruction of an artificial substitute by tissue engineering is a promising approach to solve this unmet clinical need. 3D printing technology provides an infinite possibility for engineering a trachea. Here, we 3D printed a biodegradable reticular polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold with similar morphology to the whole segment of rabbits' native trachea. The 3D-printed scaffold was suspended in culture with chondrocytes for 2 (Group I) or 4 (Group II) weeks, respectively. This in vitro suspension produced a more successful reconstruction of a tissue-engineered trachea (TET), which enhanced the overall support function of the replaced tracheal segment. After implantation of the chondrocyte-treated scaffold into the subcutaneous tissue of nude mice, the TET presented properties of mature cartilage tissue. To further evaluate the feasibility of repairing whole segment tracheal defects, replacement surgery of rabbits' native trachea by TET was performed. Following postoperative care, mean survival time in Group I was 14.38\u2009\u00b1\u20095.42 days, and in Group II was 22.58\u2009\u00b1\u200916.10 days, with the longest survival time being 10 weeks in Group II.

We first tested whether or not non-gated PC-MRI was appropriate for evaluating blood flow and WSS in rats. For both gated and non-gated techniques, VENC values in the range of 60-120\u2009cm/s with an interval of 10\u2009cm/s were also tested. Second, we optimized the in-plane resolution of PC-MRI for blood flow and WSS measurements. Results showed the usage of a gated instrument can provide more reproducible assessments, whereas VENC had an insignificant influence on all hemodynamic measurements (all P\u2009>\u20090.05). Lower resolutions, such as 0.63 mm, led to significant overestimations in blood flow and artery area quantifications and to an underestimation in WSS measurements (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). However, a higher resolution of 0.16 mm slightly increased measurement variation.

For this aim, a dedicated 3D printer was built in-house: a preliminary effort has been necessary to explore the printing parameter space to optimize the printing results in terms of geometry, tolerances and mechanical properties of the product. Analysed parameters included viscosity of the starting chitosan solution, which was measured with a Brookfield viscometer, and temperature of deposition, which was determined by filming the process with a cryocooled sensor thermal camera. Optimized parameters were applied to the production of scaffolds from solutions of chitosan alone or with the addition of raffinose as a viscosity modifier.

Unfortunately, dialysis is only a medium-term solution because large and protein-bound uremic solutes are not efficiently cleared from the body and lead to disease progression over time. Current strategies for improved renal replacement therapies (RRTs) range from whole organ engineering to biofabrication of renal assist devices and biological injectables for in vivo regeneration. Notably, all approaches coincide with the incorporation of cellular components and biomimetic micro-environments. Concerning the latter, hydrogels form promising materials as scaffolds and cell carrier systems due to the demonstrated biocompatibility of most natural hydrogels, tunable biochemical and mechanical properties, and various application possibilities.

The difficulties are the integration of suitable supply structures, the need of expensive equipment like an incubator and sophisticated pumps as well as the choice of material. The presented device is made out of hard, but non-cytotoxic materials (silicon and glass) and contains two vertical arranged membranes out of hydrogel. The porous membranes are used to separate the culture chamber from two supply channels for gases and nutrients. The cells are fed continuously by diffusion through the membranes without the need of an incubator and low requirements on the supply of medium to the assembly. The diffusion of oxygen is modelled in order to find the optimal dimensions of the chamber. The chip is connected via 3D-printed holders to the macroscopic world. The holders are coated with Parlyene C to ensure that only biocompatible materials are in contact with the culture medium. The experiments with MDCK-cells show the successful seeding inside the chip, culturing and passaging.

To develop efficient anti-fibrotic therapies, robust and representative in vitro models are urgently needed. The most widely used in vitro fibrosis model is the culture-induced activation of primary rodent hepatic stellate cells. While these cultures have contributed greatly to the current understanding of hepatic stellate cell activation, they seem to be inadequate to cover the complexity of this regenerative response. This review summarizes recent progress towards the development of 3D culture models of liver fibrosis. Thus far, only a few hepatic culture systems have successfully implemented hepatic stellate cells (or other non-parenchymal cells) into hepatocyte cultures.

{"title": "Simultaneous Delivery of Multiple Antibacterial Agents from Additively Manufactured Porous Biomaterials to Fully Eradicate Planktonic and Adherent Staphylococcus aureus.", "abstract": "Implant-associated infections are notoriously difficult to treat and may even result in amputation and death. The first few days after surgery are the most critical time to prevent those infections, preferably through full eradication of the micro-organisms entering the body perioperatively. That is particularly important for patients with a compromised immune system such as orthopedic oncology patients, as they are at higher risk for infection and complications. Full eradication of bacteria is, especially in a biofilm, extremely challenging due to the toxicity barrier that prevents delivery of high doses of antibacterial agents. This study aimed to use the potential synergistic effects of multiple antibacterial agents to prevent the use of toxic levels of these agents and achieve full eradication of planktonic and adherent bacteria. Silver ions and vancomycin were therefore simultaneously delivered from additively manufactured highly porous titanium implants with an extremely high surface area incorporating a bactericidal coating made from chitosan and gelatin applied by electrophoretic deposition (EPD). The presence of the chitosan/gelatin (Ch+Gel) coating, Ag, and vancomycin (Vanco) was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The release of vancomycin and silver ions continued for at least 21 days as measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and UV-spectroscopy. Antibacterial behavior against Staphylococcus aureus, both planktonic and in biofilm, was evaluated for up to 21 days. The Ch+Gel coating showed some bactericidal behavior on its own, while the loaded hydrogels (Ch+Gel+Ag and Ch+Gel+Vanco) achieved full eradication of both planktonic and adherent bacteria without causing significant levels of toxicity. Combining silver and vancomycin improved the release profiles of both agents and revealed a synergistic behavior that further increased the bactericidal effects.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-07-12", "authors": ["SBakhshandeh", "ZGorgin Karaji", "KLietaert", "A CFluit", "C H EBoel", "H CVogely", "TVermonden", "W EHennink", "HWeinans", "A AZadpoor", "SAmin Yavari"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b04950\n10.1016/j.ajic.2009.10.001\n10.1056/NEJMra040181\n10.1086/321863\n10.22203/eCM.v029a11\n10.1002/jor.22293\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.01.037\n10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0181\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2011.02383.x\n10.3390/ma8041871\n10.1016/S1359-6462(01)01132-0\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.12.002\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.054\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.030\n10.1021/acsami.6b03152\n10.1128/AAC.01568-12\n10.2147/IJN.S49284\n10.1016/j.nano.2007.02.001\n10.1002/cmdc.201400072\n10.1021/ja302808p\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.11.010\n10.1111/j.1751-7915.2008.00080.x\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.07.002\n10.1002/jbm.a.31648\n10.1021/bm100050d\n10.1016/j.vacuum.2012.05.031\n10.1103/PhysRevB.41.3190\n10.1155/2013/839016\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2010.09.049\n10.1021/acsami.6b02803\n10.1126/science.3629258\n10.1016/j.addr.2005.04.007\n10.1021/nn800596w\n10.1093/cid/cir078\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2015.03.066\n10.1128/AAC.01803-10\n10.1088/0957-4484/22/13/135101\n10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05253.x\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.07.005\n10.1021/acsami.6b04161\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3006276\n10.1126/science.284.5418.1318\n10.1093/jac/dku383\n10.1021/acsami.6b14026\n10.1053/ctrv.2000.0180\n10.1016/S8756-3282(02)00822-0\n10.1002/cncr.22546"}

{"title": "A 3D-printed mini-hydrocyclone for high throughput particle separation: application to primary harvesting of microalgae.", "abstract": "The separation of micro-sized particles in a continuous flow is crucial part of many industrial processes, from biopharmaceutical manufacturing to water treatment. Conventional separation techniques such as centrifugation and membrane filtration are largely limited by factors such as clogging, processing time and operation efficiency. Microfluidic based techniques have been gaining great attention in recent years as efficient and powerful approaches for particle-liquid separation. Yet the production of such systems using standard micro-fabrication techniques is proven to be tedious, costly and have cumbersome user interfaces, which all render commercialization difficult. Here, we demonstrate the design, fabrication and evaluation based on CFD simulation as well as experimentation of 3D-printed miniaturized hydrocyclones with smaller cut-size for high-throughput particle/cell sorting. The characteristics of the mini-cyclones were numerically investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques previously revealing that reduction in the size of the cyclone results in smaller cut-size of the particles. To showcase its utility, high-throughput algae harvesting from the medium with low energy input is demonstrated for the marine microalgae Tetraselmis suecica. Final microalgal biomass concentration was increased by 7.13 times in 11 minutes of operation time using our designed hydrocyclone (HC-1). We expect that this elegant approach can surmount the shortcomings of other microfluidic technologies such as clogging, low-throughput, cost and difficulty in operation. By moving away from production of planar microfluidic systems using conventional microfabrication techniques and embracing 3D-printing technology for construction of discrete elements, we envision 3D-printed mini-cyclones can be part of a library of standardized active and passive microfluidic components, suitable for particle-liquid separation.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2017-07-12", "authors": ["MairaShakeel Syed", "MehdiRafeie", "RitaHenderson", "DriesVandamme", "MohsenAsadnia", "MajidEbrahimi Warkiani"], "doi": "10.1039/c7lc00294g"}

Parallel to these technological advances, the search for an appropriate bioink that can provide a suitable microenvironment supporting cellular activities has been in the spotlight. In this respect, the decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) becomes a popular candidate as a well-qualified source of bioink because of its capability to inherit the intrinsic cues from a native ECM. Yet, few studies have been reported and its potential has been partially understood in the field of 3D cell printing.

However, it is still challenging to print structures with both, high shape fidelity and cell vitality. Herein, we used a synthetic nanosilicate clay, called Laponite, to build up scaffolds utilising the extrusion-based method 3D plotting. By blending with alginate and methylcellulose, a bioink was developed which allowed easy extrusion, achieving scaffolds with high printing fidelity. Following extrusion, approximately 70%-75% of printed immortalised human mesenchymal stem cells survived and cell viability was maintained over 21 days within the plotted constructs. Mechanical properties of scaffolds comprised of the composite bioink decreased over time when stored under cell culture conditions. Nevertheless, shape of the plotted constructs was preserved even over longer cultivation periods. Laponite is known for its favourable drug delivery properties. Two model proteins, bovine serum albumin and vascular endothelial growth factor were loaded into the bioink. We demonstrate that the release of both growth factors significantly changed to a more sustained profile by inclusion of Laponite in comparison to an alginate-methylcellulose blend in the absence of Laponite.

Treatment can include immobilisation of the affected joint with a custom-fitting splint, which is typically fabricated by hand from low temperature thermoplastic, but the approach poses several limitations. This study focused on the evaluation, by finite element analysis, of additive manufacturing techniques for wrist splints in order to improve upon the typical splinting approach. An additive manufactured/3D printed splint, specifically designed to be built using Objet Connex multi-material technology and a virtual model of a typical splint, digitised from a real patient-specific splint using three-dimensional scanning, were modelled in computer-aided design software. Forty finite element analysis simulations were performed in flexion-extension and radial-ulnar wrist movements to compare the displacements and the stresses. Simulations have shown that for low severity loads, the additive manufacturing splint has 25%, 76% and 27% less displacement in the main loading direction than the typical splint in flexion, extension and radial, respectively, while ulnar values were 75% lower in the traditional splint. For higher severity loads, the flexion and extension movements resulted in deflections that were 24% and 60%, respectively, lower in the additive manufacturing splint. However, for higher severity loading, the radial defection values were very similar in both splints and ulnar movement deflection was higher in the additive manufacturing splint. A physical prototype of the additive manufacturing splint was also manufactured and was tested under normal conditions to validate the finite element analysis data. Results from static tests showed maximum displacements of 3.46, 0.97, 3.53 and 2.51\u2009mm flexion, extension, radial and ulnar directions, respectively. According to these results, the present research argues that from a technical point of view, the additive manufacturing splint design stands at the same or even better level of performance in displacements and stress values in comparison to the typical low temperature thermoplastic approach and is therefore a feasible approach to splint design and manufacture.", "journal": "Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

The construct was composed of a PCL ultrathin membrane, ARPE-19 cell monolayer and Y79 cell-laden alginate/pluronic bioink. 3D bioprinting technology was applied herein to deliver the ARPE-19 cells and Y79 cell-laden bioink to ensure homogeneous ARPE-19 cell seeding; subsequently, two distinctive Y79 cell-seeding patterns were bioprinted on top of the ARPE-19 cell monolayer. The bioprinted ARPE-19 cells were evaluated by prestoblue assay, F-actin, and hematoxylin/eosin (HE) staining, and then the cells were observed under laser scanning and invert microscopy for 14 days. The Y79 cells in alginate/pluronic bioink after bioprinting had been closely monitored for 7 days. Live/dead assay and scanning electrical microscopy (SEM) were employed to investigate Y79 cell viability and morphology. Both the ARPE-19 and Y79 cells were in excellent condition, and the successfully bioprinted retina model could be utilized in drug delivery, disease mechanism and treatment method discoveries.", "journal": "International journal of bioprinting", "date": "2017-07-10", "authors": ["PujiangShi", "Tan Yong ShengEdgar", "Wai YeeYeong", "AugustinusLaude"], "doi": "10.18063/IJB.2017.02.008"}
{"title": "Deformation and fatigue of tough 3D printed elastomer scaffolds processed by fused deposition modeling and continuous liquid interface production.", "abstract": "Polyurethane (PU) based elastomers continue to gain popularity in a variety of biomedical applications as compliant implant materials. In parallel, advancements in additive manufacturing continue to provide new opportunities for biomedical applications by enabling the creation of more complex architectures for tissue scaffolding and patient specific implants. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of printed architecture on the monotonic and cyclic mechanical behavior of elastomeric PUs and to compare the structure-property relationship across two different printing approaches. We examined the tensile fatigue of notched specimens, 3D crosshatch scaffolds, and two 3D spherical pore architectures in a physically crosslinked polycarbonate urethane (PCU) printed via fused deposition modeling (FDM) as well as a photo-cured, chemically-crosslinked, elastomeric PU printed via continuous liquid interface production (CLIP). Both elastomers were relatively tolerant of 3D geometrical features as compared to stiffer synthetic implant materials such as PEEK and titanium. PCU and crosslinked PU samples with 3D porous structures demonstrated a reduced tensile failure stress as expected without a significant effect on tensile failure strain. PCU crosshatch samples demonstrated similar performance in strain-based tensile fatigue as solid controls; however, when plotted against stress amplitude and adjusted by porosity, it was clear that the architecture had an impact on performance. Square shaped notches or pores in crosslinked PU appeared to have a modest effect on strain-based tensile fatigue while circular shaped notches and pores had little impact relative to smooth samples. When plotted against stress amplitude, any differences in fatigue performance were small or not statistically significant for crosslinked PU samples. Despite the slight difference in local architecture and tolerances, crosslinked PU solid samples were found to perform on par with PCU solid samples in tensile fatigue, when appropriately adjusted for material hardness. Finally, tests of samples with printed architecture localized to the gage section revealed an effect in which fatigue performance appeared to drastically improve despite the localization of strain.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2017-07-10", "authors": ["Andrew TMiller", "David LSafranski", "CatherineWood", "Robert EGuldberg", "KenGall"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.06.038"}

Before ACL reconstruction, MSCs were seeded into the scaffold sleeves. ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon was performed on both legs of 15 adult rabbits (aged 12\u00a0weeks). We implanted 15 bone tunnels with scaffold sleeves with MSCs and implanted another 15 bone tunnels with scaffold sleeves without MSCs before passing the graft. The specimens were harvested at 4, 8, and 12\u00a0weeks. H&E staining, immunohistochemical staining of type II collagen, and micro-computed tomography of the tunnel cross-sectional area were evaluated. Histologic assessment was conducted with a histologic scoring system.\nIn the histologic assessment, a smooth bone-to-tendon transition through broad fibrocartilage formation was identified in the treatment group, and the interface zone showed abundant type II collagen production on immunohistochemical staining.

The use of virtual simulations utilizing numerical modeling techniques offers a potential approach to further optimize these devices. In a patient population at-risk of foot ulceration, we aimed to compare the pressure offloading performance of insoles that were optimized via numerical simulation techniques against shape-based devices. Twenty participants with diabetes and at-risk feet were enrolled in this study. Three pairs of personalized insoles: one based on shape data and subsequently manufactured via direct milling; and two were based on a design derived from shape, pressure, and ultrasound data which underwent a finite element analysis-based virtual optimization procedure. For the latter set of insole designs, one pair was manufactured via direct milling, and a second pair was manufactured through 3D printing. The offloading performance of the insoles was analyzed for forefoot regions identified as having elevated plantar pressures. In 88% of the regions of interest, the use of virtually optimized insoles resulted in lower peak plantar pressures compared to the shape-based devices. Overall, the virtually optimized insoles significantly reduced peak pressures by a mean of 41.3kPa (p<0.001, 95% CI [31.1, 51.5]) for milled and 40.5kPa (p<0.001, 95% CI [26.4, 54.5]) for printed devices compared to shape-based insoles.

The combination of low-friction superhydrophobic surfaces and droplets containing superparamagnetic particles is demonstrated to reliably dispense droplets with a precision (\u22646%) similar to standard air-displacement pipettes. The 3D printed microfluidic chips incorporate individual wells, a weir structure and differential channel depths to facilitate droplet splitting in differing ratios. Both empirical observations and numerical simulations show that the splitting is a combination of wetting and pressure differences. The method enables a parent drop to be dispensed and split into droplets ranging in size from 5-20 \u03bcL using different well volumes. Once dispensed/split the droplets can be further actuated, merged and mixed. An EDTA-based complexometric colorimetric titration for water hardness is conducted on-chip.

The aim of this report is to introduce our experiences in using virtual surgery and three-dimensional (3D) printing technique in treating this clinical challenge.\nA 26-year-old man presented with severe trauma in the maxillofacial area due to fall from height.\nComputed tomography images revealed middle face fractures and comminuted mandibular fracture including bilateral condyles.\nThe computed tomography data was used to construct the 3D cranio-maxillofacial models; then the displaced bone fragments were virtually reduced. On the basis of the finalized model, a customized titanium mesh tray was designed and fabricated using selective laser melting technology. During the surgery, a submandibular approach was adopted to repair the mandibular fracture. The reduction and fixation were performed according to preoperative plan, the bone defects in the mental area were reconstructed with iliac bone graft. The 3D-printed mesh tray served as an intraoperative template and carrier of bone graft. The healing process was uneventful, and the patient was satisfied with the mandible contour.\nVirtual surgical planning combined with 3D printing technology enables surgeon to visualize the reduction process preoperatively and guide intraoperative reduction, making the reduction less time consuming and more precise. 3D-printed titanium mesh tray can provide more satisfactory esthetic outcomes in treating complex comminuted mandibular fractures.", "journal": "Medicine", "date": "2017-07-07", "authors": ["JunliMa", "LiminMa", "ZhifaWang", "XiongjieZhu", "WeijianWang"], "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000007250"}

{"title": "Coloring 3D Printed Surfaces by Thermoforming.", "abstract": "Decorating the surfaces of 3D printed objects with color textures is still not readily available in most consumer-level or even high-end 3D printers. Existing techniques such as hydrographics color transfer suffer from the issues of air pockets in concave regions and discoloration in overly stretched regions. We propose a novel thermoforming-based coloring technique to alleviate these problems as well as to simplify the overall procedure. Thermoforming is a widely used technique in industry for plastic thin shell product manufacturing by pressing heated plastic sheets onto molds using atmospheric pressure. We attach on the transparent plastic sheet a precomputed color pattern decal prior to heating, and adhere it to 3D printed models treated as the molds in thermoforming. The 3D models are thus decorated with the desired color texture, as well as a thin, polished protective cover. The precomputation involves a physical simulation of the thermoforming process to compute the correct color pattern on the plastic sheet, and the vent hole layout on the 3D model for air pocket elimination. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our computational model and our prototype thermoforming surface coloring system through physical experiments.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics", "date": "2017-07-06", "authors": ["YizhongZhang", "YiyingTong", "KunZhou"], "doi": "10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598570"}
{"title": "Correlating rheological properties and printability of collagen bioinks: the effects of riboflavin photocrosslinking and pH.", "abstract": "Collagen has shown promise as a bioink for extrusion-based bioprinting, but further development of new collagen bioink formulations is necessary to improve their printability. Screening these formulations by measuring print accuracy is a costly and time consuming process. We hypothesized that rheological properties of the bioink before, during, and/or after gelation can be used to predict printability. In this study, we investigated the effects of riboflavin photocrosslinking and pH on type I collagen bioink rheology before, during, and after gelation and directly correlated these findings to the printability of each bioink formulation. From the riboflavin crosslinking study, results showed that riboflavin crosslinking increased the storage moduli of collagen bioinks, but the degree of improvement was less pronounced at higher collagen concentrations. Dots printed with collagen bioinks with riboflavin crosslinking exhibited smaller dot footprint areas than those printed with collagen bioinks without riboflavin crosslinking. From the pH study, results showed that gelation kinetics and final gel moduli were highly pH dependent and both exhibited maxima around pH 8. The shape fidelity of printed lines was highest at pH 8-9.5. The effect of riboflavin crosslinking and pH on cell viability was assessed using bovine chondrocytes. Cell viability in collagen gels was found to decrease after blue light activated riboflavin crosslinking but was not affected by pH. Correlations between rheological parameters and printability showed that the modulus associated with the bioink immediately after extrusion and before deposition was the best predictor of bioink printability. These findings will allow for the more rapid screening of collagen bioink formulations.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-07-06", "authors": ["NicoleDiamantides", "LouisWang", "TylarPruiksma", "JosephSiemiatkoski", "CarolineDugopolski", "SonyaShortkroff", "StephenKennedy", "Lawrence JBonassar"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa780f"}

Cardiac patches were analyzed with light and video microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, cell viability assays and optical electrical mapping. Cardiac tissue patches of all cell ratios beat spontaneously after 3D bioprinting. Patches exhibited ventricular-like action potential waveforms and uniform electrical conduction throughout the patch. Conduction velocities were higher and action potential durations were significantly longer in patches containing a lower percentage of FBs. Immunohistochemistry revealed staining for CM, FB and EC markers, with rudimentary CD31+ blood vessel formation. Immunofluorescence revealed the presence of Cx43, the main cardiac gap junction protein, localized to cell-cell borders.

However, due to the sophisticated anatomical geometry and complex resistivity distribution of the human head, constructing an accurate phantom for EIT research remains challenging, especially for skull modelling. In this paper, we designed and fabricated a novel head phantom with anatomically realistic geometry and continuously varying skull resistivity distribution based on 3D printing techniques. The skull model was constructed by simultaneously printing the distinct layers inside the skull with resistivity-controllable printing materials. The entire phantom was composed of saline skin, a 3D-printed skull, saline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 3D-printed brain parenchyma. The validation results demonstrated that the resistivity of the phantom was in good agreement with that of human tissue and was stable over time, and the new phantom performed well in EIT imaging.

{"title": "Use of 3D reconstruction cloacagrams and 3D printing in cloacal malformations.", "abstract": "Cloacal anomalies are complex to manage, and the anatomy affects prognosis and management. Assessment historically includes examination under anesthesia, and genitography is often performed, but these do not consistently capture three-dimensional (3D) detail or spatial relationships of the anatomic structures. Three-dimensional reconstruction cloacagrams can provide a high level of detail including channel measurements and the level of the cloaca (<3\u00a0cm vs. >3\u00a0cm), which typically determines the approach for surgical reconstruction and can impact long-term prognosis. Yet this imaging modality has not yet been directly compared with intra-operative or endoscopic findings.\nOur objective was to compare 3D reconstruction cloacagrams with endoscopic and intraoperative findings, as well as to describe the use of 3D printing to create models for surgical planning and education.\nAn IRB-approved retrospective review of all cloaca patients seen by our multi-disciplinary program from 2014 to 2016 was performed. All patients underwent examination under anesthesia, endoscopy, 3D reconstruction cloacagram, and subsequent reconstructive surgery at a later date. Patient characteristics, intraoperative details, and measurements from endoscopy and cloacagram were reviewed and compared. One of the 3D cloacagrams was reformatted for 3D printing to create a model for surgical planning.\nFour patients were included for review, with the Figure illustrating 3D cloacagram results. Measurements of common channel length and urethral length were similar between modalities, particularly with confirming the level of cloaca. No patient experienced any complications or adverse effects from cloacagram or endoscopy. A model was successfully created from cloacagram images with the use of 3D printing technology.\nAccurate preoperative assessment for cloacal anomalies is important for counseling and surgical planning. Three-dimensional cloacagrams have been shown to yield a high level of anatomic detail. Here, cloacagram measurements are shown to correlate well with endoscopic and intraoperative findings with regards to level of cloaca and M\u00fcllerian development. Measurement discrepancies may be due to technical variation indicating a need for further evaluation. The translation of the cloacagram images into a 3D printed model demonstrates potential applications of these models for pre-operative planning and education of both families and trainees.\nIn our series, 3D reconstruction cloacagrams yielded accurate measurements of urethral length and level of cloaca common channel and urethral length, similar to those found on endoscopy.

The gradient of gold nanoparticles is made in situ in a macroporous nonionic block copolymer hydrogel matrix, through gold ion diffusion control. The polymer provides a matrix for diffusion of gold ions, acts as a template for controlling nanoparticle growth, and facilitates the in situ reduction of gold ions to gold nanoparticles. A clear gradient in gold nanoparticles is observed across the 3D space of the polymer matrix using scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The particle gradient is further functionalized with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups via thiol-gold linkage to demonstrate the ability to form gradients with different chemical functionalities.

In this study, additive manufacturing and thermally induced phase separation are combined to create 3D scaffolds with tunable surface morphology from polymer gels. Surface features vary depending on the gel concentration, the exchanging temperature, and the nonsolvent used.

We investigated whether the use of 3D-printed left atrial appendage (LAA) models based on preprocedural computed tomography (CT) permits accurate device sizing.\nTwenty-two (22) patients (73\u00b18 years, 55% male) with atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation at high bleeding risk underwent LAA closure (WATCHMAN device). Preprocedurally, LAA was sized by TEE and third-generation dual-source CT. Based on CT, 3D printing models of LAA anatomy were created for simulation of device implantation. Device compression was assessed in a CT scan of the 3D model with the implanted device. Implantation was successful in all patients. Mean LAA ostium diameter based on TEE was 22\u00b14 mm and based on CT 25\u00b13 mm (p=0.014).

{"title": "Cell-instructive high-resolution micropatterned polylactic acid surfaces.", "abstract": "Micro and nanoscale topographical structuring of biomaterial surfaces has been a valuable tool for influencing cell behavior, including cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation. However, most fabrication techniques for surface patterning of implantable biomaterials suffer from a limited resolution, not allowing controlled generation of sub-cellular three-dimensional features. Here, a direct laser lithography technique based on two-photon absorption was used to construct several patterns varying in size between 500 nm and 15 \u03bcm. Through replication via an intermediate mold, the patterns were transferred into polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biomedical polymer, while retaining the original geometry. An osteoblast-like cell line, MG-63 was used for characterizing the morphological response to the topographical patterns. The results indicated that semi-continuous (dashed) lines, with a height of 1 \u03bcm were able to induce cell elongation in the direction of the lines. However, when dashes with a height of 0.5 \u03bcm were combined with perpendicularly crossing continuous lines (rails) with a height of 8 \u03bcm, the contact guidance effect of the dashes was lost and elongation of the cells was observed in the direction of the larger features. A second pattern, consisting of different arrays of pillars showed that, depending on the pillar height, the cells were either able to spread over the pattern or were confined between the pattern features. These differences in the ability of cells to spread further resulted in the formation of tension forces through stress fibers and displacement of vimentin. The method for high-resolution micropatterning of PLA as presented here can also be applied to other biomedical polymers, making it useful both for fundamental studies and for designing new biomaterials with improved functionality.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-07-04", "authors": ["DavidBarata", "PauloDias", "PaulWieringa", "Clemensvan Blitterswijk", "PamelaHabibovic"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa7d24"}

{"title": "Effects of living cells on the bioink printability during laser printing.", "abstract": "Laser-induced forward transfer has been a promising orifice-free bioprinting technique for the direct writing of three-dimensional cellular constructs from cell-laden bioinks. In order to optimize the printing performance, the effects of living cells on the bioink printability must be carefully investigated in terms of the ability to generate well-defined jets during the jet/droplet formation process as well as well-defined printed droplets on a receiving substrate during the jet/droplet deposition process. In this study, a time-resolved imaging approach has been implemented to study the jet/droplet formation and deposition processes when printing cell-free and cell-laden bioinks under different laser fluences. It is found that the jetting behavior changes from no material transferring to well-defined jetting with or without an initial bulgy shape to jetting with a bulgy shape/pluming/splashing as the laser fluence increases. Under desirable well-defined jetting, two impingement-based deposition and printing types are identified: droplet-impingement printing and jet-impingement printing with multiple breakups. Compared with cell-free bioink printing, the transfer threshold of the cell-laden bioink is higher while the jet velocity, jet breakup length, and printed droplet size are lower, shorter, and smaller, respectively. The addition of living cells transforms the printing type from jet-impingement printing with multiple breakups to droplet-impingement printing. During the printing of cell-laden bioinks, two non-ideal jetting behaviors, a non-straight jet with a non-straight trajectory and a straight jet with a non-straight trajectory, are identified mainly due to the local nonuniformity and nonhomogeneity of cell-laden bioinks.", "journal": "Biomicrofluidics", "date": "2017-07-04", "authors": ["ZhengyiZhang", "ChangxueXu", "RuitongXiong", "Douglas BChrisey", "YongHuang"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4985652\n10.1063/1.3116724\n10.1007/s003390051400\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.055\n10.1089/ten.tec.2011.0185\n10.1088/1758-5082/2/3/032001\n10.1557/mrs.2011.276\n10.1557/mrs.2013.209\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.034\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0798\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1088/1758-5090/8/2/025016\n10.1115/1.3002759\n10.1002/bit.24591\n10.1002/bit.25501\n10.1016/j.tsf.2008.02.043\n10.1016/j.bios.2004.08.047\n10.1088/1758-5082/4/2/025006\n10.1063/1.3202388\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045011\n10.1089/ten.tec.2009.0397\n10.1063/1.3248304\n10.1063/1.4759344\n10.1007/s00339-010-6030-4\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00919\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b00220\n10.1063/1.2191569\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.02.097\n10.1007/s00339-011-6751-z\n10.1088/1758-5082/5/4/045006\n10.1186/1475-925X-10-19\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.02.007\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.07.200\n10.1017/jfm.2012.337\n10.1016/j.tsf.2010.03.082\n10.1063/1.1691034\n10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2006.02.021\n10.1007/s10035-012-0318-3\n10.1007/BF00455415\n10.1063/1.1888026\n10.1088/0957-4484/19/33/335304\n10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2011.09.001\n10.1021/la501430x\n10.1115/1.4029264\n10.1016/j.physrep.2010.03.003\n10.1002/adma.201102800\n10.1007/s00253-012-4266-y\n10.1002/jbm.a.34326\n10.1016/S0142-9612(98)00107-0\n10.1177/154405910308201111\n10.1021/bp010070p\n10.1088/1758-5082/5/1/015002\n10.1016/j.jmapro.2015.06.023\n10.1088/0960-1317/22/8/085025\n10.1122/1.4717494\n10.1021/la1025526\n10.1021/la035128j\n10.1016/S0377-0257(97)00022-0\n10.1021/bm300407q\n10.1007/s10404-013-1248-z\n10.1063/1.3025596\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2007.07.020\n10.1089/107632704323061843\n10.1007/s10439-005-8971-x\n10.1115/1.4000101\n10.1115/1.2896118\n10.1115/1.4004685\n10.1002/bit.24455"}

This first use of a precisely controlled solvent free inkjet printing to produce drug loaded solid dosage forms is demonstrated using a naturally derived FDA approved material (beeswax) as the drug carrier and fenofibrate as the drug. Tablets with bespoke geometries (honeycomb architecture) were fabricated. The honeycomb architecture was modified by control of the honeycomb cell size, and hence surface area to enable control of drug release profiles without the need to alter the formulation. Analysis of the formed tablets showed the drug to be evenly distributed within the beeswax at the bulk scale with evidence of some localization at the micron scale. An analytical model utilizing a Fickian description of diffusion was developed to allow the prediction of drug release. A comparison of experimental and predicted drug release data revealed that in addition to surface area, other factors such as the cell diameter in the case of the honeycomb geometry and material wettability must be considered in practical dosage form design. This information when combined with the range of achievable geometries could allow the bespoke production of optimized personalised medicines for a variety of delivery vehicles in addition to tablets, such as medical devices for example.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2017-07-03", "authors": ["MaryKyobula", "AremuAdedeji", "Morgan RAlexander", "EhabSaleh", "RickyWildman", "IanAshcroft", "Paul RGellert", "Clive JRoberts"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.06.025"}

The patient had a history of severe dental trauma over 30\u00a0years ago. Both mandibular central incisors (teeth 31, 41) were tender to percussion and had a yellowish discoloration. They did not respond to thermal and electrical sensitivity tests. Two periapical radiographs from different projections revealed severe pulp canal calcifications and signs of periapical periodontitis. To facilitate the 'Microguided Endodontics' technique, a CBCT and an intra-oral surface scan were aligned using special software. This allowed the virtual planning of optimal access cavities up to the apical third of the root. In this technique, a 3D-printed template guides a customized drill to the orifice of the root canal. After negotiation of the root canals, conventional root canal treatment was performed.

One solution to cellular retention at the injection site has been the use of biogels to encapsulate cells within a microenvironment before and upon implantation. The current study utilized three-dimensional bioprinting technology to evaluate the ability to form SVF cell-laden spheroids with collagen I as a gel-forming biomatrix. A superhydrophobic surface was created to maintain the bioprinted structures in a spheroid shape. A hydrophilic disc was printed onto the hydrophobic surface to immobilize the spheroids during the gelation process. Conditions for the automated rapid formation of SVF cell-laden spheroids were explored, including time/pressure relationships for spheroid extrusion during bioprinting. The formed spheroids maintain SVF viability in both static culture and dynamic spinner culture. Spheroids also undergo a time-dependent contraction with the retention of angiogenic sprout phenotype over the 14-day culture period. The use of a biphilic surface exhibiting both superhydrophobicity to maintain the spheroid shape and a hydrophilicity to immobilize the spheroid during gel formation produces SVF cell-laden spheroids that can be immediately transplanted for therapeutic applications.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Potential of propagation-based synchrotron X-ray phase-contrast computed tomography for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Hydrogel-based cardiac tissue engineering offers great promise for myocardial infarction repair. The ability to visualize engineered systems in vivo in animal models is desired to monitor the performance of cardiac constructs. However, due to the low density and weak X-ray attenuation of hydrogels, conventional radiography and micro-computed tomography are unable to visualize the hydrogel cardiac constructs upon their implantation, thus limiting their use in animal systems. This paper presents a study on the optimization of synchrotron X-ray propagation-based phase-contrast imaging computed tomography (PCI-CT) for three-dimensional (3D) visualization and assessment of the hydrogel cardiac patches. First, alginate hydrogel was 3D-printed into cardiac patches, with the pores filled by fibrin. The hydrogel patches were then surgically implanted on rat hearts. A week after surgery, the hearts including patches were excised and embedded in a soft-tissue-mimicking gel for imaging by using PCI-CT at an X-ray energy of 25\u2005keV. During imaging, the sample-to-detector distances, CT-scan time and the region of interest (ROI) were varied and examined for their effects on both imaging quality and radiation dose. The results showed that phase-retrieved PCI-CT images provided edge-enhancement fringes at a sample-to-detector distance of 147\u2005cm that enabled visualization of anatomical and microstructural features of the myocardium and the implanted patch in the tissue-mimicking gel. For visualization of these features, PCI-CT offered a significantly higher performance than the dual absorption-phase and clinical magnetic resonance (3\u2005T) imaging techniques. Furthermore, by reducing the total CT-scan time and ROI, PCI-CT was examined for lowering the effective dose, meanwhile without much loss of imaging quality. In effect, the higher soft tissue contrast and low-dose potential of PCI-CT has been used along with an acceptable overall animal dose to achieve the high spatial resolution needed for cardiac implant visualization. As a result, PCI-CT at the identified imaging parameters offers great potential for 3D assessment of microstructural features of hydrogel cardiac patches.", "journal": "Journal of synchrotron radiation", "date": "2017-07-01", "authors": ["MohammadIzadifar", "PaulBabyn", "DeanChapman", "Michael EKelly", "XiongbiaoChen"], "doi": "10.1107/S1600577517006208"}

Control over molecular transport across the biofabricated membranes requires microstructural characterization. This study investigates, for the first time, the birefringence of chitosan membranes assembled with flow in a microfluidic environment, and the effects of pH and flow rate on the membrane's micro-alignment. The optical anisotropy of the formed membranes was quantified using a de S\u00e9narmont compensator for transmitted quantitative polarized light microscopy. The chitosan membranes were biofabricated within a small aperture in a microfluidic network with various flow and pH conditions of chitosan and alginate solutions. The measured optical retardance and parallelism index clearly indicate that the microstructure of the flow-assembled membrane was well organized and aligned along the direction of chitosan flow. Optical retardance increased significantly with the pH of the alginate solution, but was less sensitive to the variation of the flow rates of the polymer solutions during the biofabrication process. It was also determined that the birefringence signal dropped significantly across the membrane growth direction regardless of the molecular density in the membrane. The mechanism of the micro-alignment was discussed, which was presumably due to the molecular un-wrapping by shear flow. We envision that the current study paves a path to further understand and actively manipulate the microstructure of flow-assembled membranes for broad lab-on-a-chip applications.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-07-01", "authors": ["KLi", "S OCorrea", "PPham", "C BRaub", "XLuo"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa786e"}

{"title": "Design Optimization for Accurate Flow Simulations in 3D Printed Vascular Phantoms Derived from Computed Tomography Angiography.", "abstract": "3D printing has been used to create complex arterial phantoms to advance device testing and physiological condition evaluation. Stereolithographic (STL) files of patient-specific cardiovascular anatomy are acquired to build cardiac vasculature through advanced mesh-manipulation techniques. Management of distal branches in the arterial tree is important to make such phantoms practicable. We investigated methods to manage the distal arterial flow resistance and pressure thus creating physiologically and geometrically accurate phantoms that can be used for simulations of image-guided interventional procedures with new devices. Patient specific CT data were imported into a Vital Imaging workstation, segmented, and exported as STL files. Using a mesh-manipulation program (Meshmixer) we created flow models of the coronary tree. Distal arteries were connected to a compliance chamber. The phantom was then printed using a Stratasys Connex3 multimaterial printer: the vessel in TangoPlus and the fluid flow simulation chamber in Vero. The model was connected to a programmable pump and pressure sensors measured flow characteristics through the phantoms. Physiological flow simulations for patient-specific vasculature were done for six cardiac models (three different vasculatures comparing two new designs). For the coronary phantom we obtained physiologically relevant waves which oscillated between 80 and 120 mmHg and a flow rate of ~125 ml/min, within the literature reported values. The pressure wave was similar with those acquired in human patients. Thus we demonstrated that 3D printed phantoms can be used not only to reproduce the correct patient anatomy for device testing in image-guided interventions, but also for physiological simulations.

The development of micromolding for mass production remains a challenge because of the multifaceted demands of UV curable materials and the risk of demolding-related defects, particularly when patterning high-aspect-ratio features. In this research, a robust micromolding approach is demonstrated that integrates thiol-ene polymerization and UV LED curing. The moduli of cured thiol-ene coatings were tuned over 2 orders of magnitude by simply adjusting the acrylate concentration of a coating formulation, the curing completed in all cases within 10 s of LED exposure. Densely packed 50-\u03bcm-wide gratings were faithfully replicated in coatings ranging from soft materials to stiff highly cross-linked networks. Further, surface energy was modified with a fluorinated polymer, achieving a surface energy reduction of more than a half at a loading of 1 wt %, and enabling tall (100 \u03bcm) defect-free patterns to be attained. The demolding strengths of microstructured coatings were compared using quantitative peel testing, showing its decrease with decreasing surface energy, coating modulus, and grating height. This micromolding process, combining tunability in thermomechanical and surface properties, makes thiol-ene microstructured coatings attractive candidates for roll-to-roll manufacture.

We developed a selectable dual color third generation lentiviral reporter (hEF1\u03b1-H2B-mOrange2-IRES-EGFP PGK-Puro) to differentially label the nucleus and cytoplasm of iPS-ECs which allowed real-time tracking of key steps of vascular morphogenesis such as vacuole formation and coalescence to form shared multicellular lumens. We implement 3D quantification of the network character and validate that transduced and untransduced iPS-ECs can form tubules in fibrin with or without supporting hMSCs. In addition to natural fibrin gels, we also investigated tubulogenesis in GelMA, a semi-synthetic material that has received increased interest due to its ability to be photopatterned and 3D printed, and which may thus boost development of complex 3D models for regenerative medicine studies. We find that iPS-ECs alone have a muted tubulogenic response within GelMA, but that their tubulogenic response is enhanced when they are co-cultured with a small fraction of hMSCs (2% of total cells). Our work bolsters previous findings by validating established tubulogenic mechanisms with commercially available iPS-ECs, and we expect our findings will benefit biologic studies of vasculogenesis and will have applications in tissue engineering to pre-vascularize tissue constructs which are fabricated with advanced photopatterning and three-dimensional printing.", "journal": "Biomaterials science", "date": "2017-07-01", "authors": ["G ACalderon", "PThai", "C WHsu", "BGrigoryan", "S MGibson", "M EDickinson", "J SMiller"], "doi": "10.1039/c7bm00223h"}

This paper demonstrates the 3D printing of photoresponsive shape memory devices through combining fused deposition modeling printing technology and photoresponsive shape memory composites based on shape memory polymers and carbon black with high photothermal conversion efficiency.

The use of porous scaffolds is a potential method for repairing these defects. Now, additive manufacturing techniques provide a solution for the fabrication of porous scaffolds with specific geometrical shapes and complex structures. The goal of this study was to design and optimize a three-dimensional tetrahedral titanium scaffold for the reconstruction of mandibular defects. With a fixed strut diameter of 0.45mm and a mean cell size of 2.2mm, a tetrahedral structural porous scaffold was designed for a simulated anatomical defect derived from computed tomography (CT) data of a human mandible. An optimization method based on the concept of uniform stress was performed on the initial scaffold to realize a minimal-weight design. Geometric and mechanical comparisons between the initial and optimized scaffold show that the optimized scaffold exhibits a larger porosity, 81.90%, as well as a more homogeneous stress distribution.

These tools do not fully and adequately meet the needs of the teachers because they are long to produce, expensive, and not versatile enough to provide rapid updating of the content. For instance, the same RLM can barely be used during different lessons. In addition, those maps do not provide any interactivity, which reduces students' autonomy. With the emergence of 3D printing and low-cost microcontrollers, it is now easy to design affordable interactive small-scale models (SSMs) which are adapted to the needs of special education teachers. However, no study has previously been conducted to evaluate non-visual learning using interactive SSMs. In collaboration with a specialized teacher, we designed a SSM and a RLM representing the evolution of the geography and history of a fictitious kingdom. The two conditions were compared in a study with 24 visually impaired students regarding the memorization of the spatial layout and historical contents. The study showed that the interactive SSM improved both space and text memorization as compared to the RLM with braille legend.

We present two experimental setups using 3D printed patient-specific neurovasculature to simulate different disease anatomies. To simulate the human neurovasculature in the Circle of Willis, patient-based phantoms with aneurysms were 3D printed using a Objet Eden 260V printer. Anthropomorphic head phantoms and a human skull combined with acrylic plates simulated human head bone anatomy and x-ray attenuation. For dynamic studies the 3D printed phantom was connected to a pulsatile flow loop with the anthropomorphic phantom underneath. By combining different 3D printed phantoms and the anthropomorphic phantoms, different patient pathologies can be simulated. For static studies a 3D printed neurovascular phantom was embedded inside a human skull and used as a positional reference for treatment devices such as stents.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the records of 15 consecutive patients who underwent ACCF surgeries with AA-TMC implantation. The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scoring system, a visual analogue scale (VAS), the mean intervertebral height (MIBH) of the surgical segments, and the surgical segmental angle (SSA) were recorded preoperatively, immediately after surgery and at the final follow-up visit. The outcomes of these parameters at different time points were compared. RESULTS Six months after ACCF surgery, solid bony fusions of the surgical level were achieved in all patients. The mean MIBH was 21.05\u00b11.99 mm preoperatively, 27.51\u00b11.44 mm immediately after surgery (P<0.05), and 26.85\u00b11.25 mm at the last follow-up visit (P<0.05). At the last follow-up visit, none of the AA-TMCs exhibited severe subsidence (>3 mm). The mean SSA was 6.66\u00b17.08\u00b0 preoperatively, 14.03\u00b12.3\u00b0 immediately after surgery (P<0.05), and 15.09\u00b12.1\u00b0 at the final follow-up visit (P>0.05). The mean VAS and JOA scores were 6.6\u00b11.26 and 10.47\u00b12.07, respectively, preoperatively and 2.47\u00b11.3 and 13.6\u00b11.96 immediately after surgery, respectively (P<0.05). At the last follow-up visit, the mean VAS and JOA were further restored to 1.67\u00b11.18 and 14.9\u00b11.39, respectively (P<0.05).

A phantom model for transfixion practice would help train clinicians in FNAC.\nTo fabricate a tailored phantom with consideration for authenticity of size, touch, feel, and ultrasonographic (US) characteristics.\nA three-dimensional (3D) digital model of the human neck was reconstructed from computed tomography data of a subject. This model was used to create 3D-printed templates for various organs that require US visualization. The templates were injected with polymers that provided similar degrees of ultrasound permeability as the corresponding organs. For fabrication of each organ, the respective molds of organs, blood vessels, thyroid gland, and tumor were injected with the material. The fabricated components were then removed from the templates and colored. Individual components were then positioned in the neck mold, and agar gel was poured in. The complete phantom was then removed from the mold. Thereafter, 45 medical doctors and students performed ultrasound-guided FNAC using the phantom, following which they were queried regarding the value of the phantom.\nThe structure, US characteristics, and elasticity of the phantom were similar to those of the human subject. In the survey, all 45 participants replied that they found the phantom useful for FNAC training, and 30 medical students professed increased interest in thyroid diseases after using the phantom.\nWe successfully fabricated a tailored thyroid gland phantom for transfixion practice.

Rheological analysis showed that all groups had viscoelastic properties. It was also shown that under simulated physiological conditions, chitosan and chitosan-HA hydrogels were stable. Also, the viscosity values of the bio-solutions were in an applicable range to be used in 3D bio-printers. Cell viability and proliferation analyses documented that after printing with bio-solutions, cells continued to be viable in all groups. It was observed that cells printed within chitosan-HA composite hydrogel had peak expression levels for early and late stages osteogenic markers. It was concluded that cells within chitosan and chitosan-HA hydrogels had mineralized and differentiated osteogenically after 21 days of culture.

{"title": "Thermal stability and rheological properties of the 'non-stick' Caf1 biomaterial.", "abstract": "The ability to culture cells in three-dimensions has many applications, from drug discovery to wound healing. 3D cell culture methods often require appropriate scaffolds that mimic the cellular environments of different tissue types. The choice of material from which these scaffolds are made is of paramount importance, as its properties will define the manner in which cells interact with the scaffold. Caf1 is a protein polymer that is secreted from its host organism, Yersinia pestis, to enable escape from phagocytosis. In vitro, cells adhere poorly to the protein unless adhesion motifs are specifically introduced. Caf1 is a good candidate biomaterial due to its definable bioactivity, economical production and its ability to form hydrogels, through the use of cross-linkers. In this study, the thermostability of Caf1 was tested over a range of chemical conditions, and an initial characterisation of its rheological properties conducted in order to assess the suitability of Caf1 as a biomedical material. The results show that Caf1 retains its high thermostability even in harsh conditions such as extremes of pH, high salt concentrations and the presence of detergents. In solution, the concentrated polymer behaves as a complex viscous liquid. Due to these properties, Caf1 polymers are compatible with 3D bioprinting technologies and could be made to form a stimuli-responsive biomaterial that can alter its macrorheological properties in response to external factors.

This study aims to investigate the printing-induced cell injury and evaluates injury types of post-printing cells using the annexin V/7-aminoactinomycin D and FAM-DEVD-FMK/propidium iodide assays during laser printing of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. As observed, the percentage of post-printing early apoptotic mouse fibroblasts increases with the incubation time, indicating that post-printing apoptotic mouse fibroblasts have different initiation lag times of apoptosis due to different levels of mechanical stress exerted during laser printing. Post-printing necrotic mouse fibroblasts can be detected immediately after printing, while post-printing early apoptotic mouse fibroblasts need time to develop into a late apoptotic stage. The minimum time needed for post-printing early apoptotic mouse fibroblasts to complete their apoptosis pathway and transition into late apoptotic mouse fibroblasts is from 4 h to 5 h post-printing.

The prepared scaffolds possessed a connected network with triangle pore morphology and the surfaces of the \u03b2-TCP scaffolds were uniformly modified by the Ag@GO nanocomposite layers. The Ag content in the scaffolds was controlled by changing the coating times and concentration of the Ag@GO nanocomposites. The antibacterial activity of the scaffolds was assessed with Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, E. coli). The results demonstrated that the scaffolds with Ag@GO nanocomposites presented excellent antibacterial activity. In addition, the scaffolds coated with Ag@GO nanocomposites conspicuously accelerated the osteogenic differentiation of rabbit bone marrow stromal cells by improving their alkaline phosphatase activity and bone-related gene expression (osteopontin, runt-related transcription factor 2, osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein).

Unlike the non-woven morphology in a random nanofibrous mesh, PLLA/gelatin composite nanofibers in the nestlike nanofibrous mesh displayed both non-woven and parallel morphologies. Both kinds of nanofibrous mesh were \u223c50 \u03bcm thick as-prepared, and shrank to \u223c30 \u03bcm after seeding with bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs). After 7 days of in vitro culture, cell sheets could form on both meshes (CSM) and on the culture plate. It was found that application of nanofibrous mesh promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMSC sheets compared with the control. The nestlike mesh displayed slight superiority over the random mesh in enhancing osteogenic differentiation, but their different fiber arrangements did not cause much difference in cell proliferation. Three-dimensional multi-layered CSM constructs were built by stacking four mono-layered CSMs together. The CSM constructs (based on a nestlike or random nanofibrous mesh) were incubated in vitro for 3 days before being implanted into rat cranial defects.

To determine a gold standard, the distances were measured with a coordinate measuring instrument (Zeiss O-Inspect 422). The master model was scanned 37 times with the following intraoral scanners: Apollo DI (Sirona), CS 3500 (Carestream Dental), iTero (Cadent), PlanScan (Planmeca), Trios (3Shape), and True Definition (3M Espe), and indirectly digitized with the OrthoX Scan (Dentaurum). The digital models were then measured, and deviations from the gold standard calculated. Significant differences were found between the devices. Among the intraoral scanners, Trios and iTero showed the most accurate results, although CS 3500, True Definition, and Apollo DI achieved comparable results.

{"title": "Welding of 3D-printed carbon nanotube-polymer composites by locally induced microwave heating.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing through material extrusion, often termed three-dimensional (3D) printing, is a burgeoning method for manufacturing thermoplastic components. However, a key obstacle facing 3D-printed plastic parts in engineering applications is the weak weld between successive filament traces, which often leads to delamination and mechanical failure. This is the chief obstacle to the use of thermoplastic additive manufacturing. We report a novel concept for welding 3D-printed thermoplastic interfaces using intense localized heating of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by microwave irradiation. The microwave heating of the CNT-polymer composites is a function of CNT percolation, as shown through in situ infrared imaging and simulation. We apply CNT-loaded coatings to a 3D printer filament; after printing, microwave irradiation is shown to improve the weld fracture strength by 275%. These remarkable results open up entirely new design spaces for additive manufacturing and also yield new insight into the coupling between dielectric properties and radio frequency field response for nanomaterial networks.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2017-06-21", "authors": ["Charles BSweeney", "Blake ALackey", "Martin JPospisil", "Thomas CAchee", "Victoria KHicks", "Aaron GMoran", "Blake RTeipel", "Mohammad ASaed", "Micah JGreen"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.1700262"}

These machines are powered by a muscle strip composed of differentiated skeletal myofibers in a matrix of natural proteins, including fibrin, that provide physical support and cues to the cells as an engineered basement membrane. However, maintaining consistent results becomes challenging when sustaining a living system in vitro. Skeletal muscle must be preserved in a differentiated state and the system is subject to degradation by proteolytic enzymes that can break down its mechanical integrity. Here we examine the life expectancy, breakdown, and device failure of engineered skeletal muscle bio-bots as a result of degradation by three\u00a0classes\u00a0of proteases: plasmin, cathepsin L, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). We also demonstrate the use of gelatin zymography to determine the effects of differentiation and inhibitor concentration on protease expression.

{"title": "Microcontact Peeling: A Cell Micropatterning Technique for Circumventing Direct Adsorption of Proteins to Hydrophobic PDMS.", "abstract": "Microcontact printing (\u03bcCPr) is one of the most popular techniques used for cell micropatterning. In conventional \u03bcCPr, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp with microfeatures is used to adsorb extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins onto the featured surface and transfer them onto particular areas of a cell culture substrate. However, some types of functional proteins other than ECM have been reported to denature upon direct adsorption to hydrophobic PDMS. Here we describe a detailed protocol of an alternative technique--microcontact peeling (\u03bcCPe)--that allows for cell micropatterning while circumventing the step of adsorbing proteins to bare PDMS. This technique employs microfeatured materials with a relatively high surface energy such as copper, instead of using a microfeatured PDMS stamp, to peel off a cell-adhesive layer present on the surface of substrates. Consequently, cell-nonadhesive substrates are exposed at the specific surface that undergoes the physical contact with the microfeatured material. Thus, although \u03bcCPe and \u03bcCPr are apparently similar, the former does not comprise a process of transferring biomolecules through hydrophobic PDMS. \u00a9 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "journal": "Current protocols in cell biology", "date": "2017-06-20", "authors": ["ShoYokoyama", "Tsubasa SMatsui", "ShinjiDeguchi"], "doi": "10.1002/cpcb.22"}

In vitro, the ability to engineer the ECM at the micro- and nanoscales is a critical tool to systematically interrogate the influence of ECM properties on cellular responses. Specifically, both topographical and chemical surface patterning has been shown to direct cell alignment and tissue architecture on biomaterial surfaces, however, it has proven challenging to independently control these surface properties.

{"title": "Biofabrication of soft tissue templates for engineering the bone-ligament interface.", "abstract": "Regenerating damaged tissue interfaces remains a significant clinical challenge, requiring recapitulation of the structure, composition, and function of the native enthesis. In the ligament-to-bone interface, this region transitions from ligament to fibrocartilage, to calcified cartilage and then to bone. This gradation in tissue types facilitates the transfer of load between soft and hard structures while minimizing stress concentrations at the interface. Previous attempts to engineer the ligament-bone interface have utilized various scaffold materials with an array of various cell types and/or biological cues. The primary goal of this study was to engineer a multiphased construct mimicking the ligament-bone interface by driving differentiation of a single population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), seeded within blended fibrin-alginate hydrogels, down an endochondral, fibrocartilaginous, or ligamentous pathway through spatial presentation of growth factors along the length of the construct within a custom-developed, dual-chamber culture system. MSCs within these engineered constructs demonstrated spatially distinct regions of differentiation, adopting either a cartilaginous or ligamentous phenotype depending on their local environment. Furthermore, there was also evidence of spatially defined progression toward an endochondral phenotype when chondrogenically primed MSCs within this construct were additionally exposed to hypertrophic cues. The study demonstrates the feasibility of engineering spatially complex soft tissues within a single MSC laden hydrogel through the defined presentation of biochemical cues.

Modular and flexible platforms for fabrication of such multi-cellular modules and their characterization have been lacking. Here, we present a modular cellular system, made up of multi-layered tissue rings containing integrated skeletal muscle and motor neurons (MNs) embedded in an extracellular matrix. The MNs were differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells through the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), which are spherical aggregations of cells grown in a suspension culture. The EBs were integrated into a tissue ring with skeletal muscle, which was differentiated in parallel, to create a co-culture amenable to both cell types. The multi-layered rings were then sequentially placed on a stationary three-dimensional-printed hydrogel structure resembling an anatomical muscle-tendon-bone organization. We demonstrate that the site-specific innervation of a group of muscle fibers in the multi-layered tissue rings allows for muscle contraction via chemical stimulation of MNs with glutamate, a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, with the frequency of contraction increasing with glutamate concentration. The addition of tubocurarine chloride (a nicotinic receptor antagonist) halted the contractions, indicating that muscle contraction was MN induced.

At the same time, flow patterns and velocities are accessible by 4-dimensional phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4D pcMRI). Complexity of protocol design and imaging duration has limited the use of this technique in clinical imaging. A new approach is presented to overcome these limitations.\nThree-dimensional (3D) replicas of 2 cerebral aneurysms were fabricated by fused deposition prototyping (3D printing) and imaged using 4D pcMRI while connected to a magnetic resonance imaging-compatible continuous flow loop. Acquisition parameters were optimized with imaging times not to exceed 10 minutes. Six patients harboring cerebral aneurysms with sizes ranging from 4.7 to 13.8 mm were imaged with the optimized 4D pcMRI protocol. After treatment with the pipeline embolization device (PED), 4D pcMRI examinations were repeated in 3 patients.\nIn all cases, major flow patterns were visualized well; smaller aneurysms posed a challenge because of limited spatial resolution, whereas larger aneurysms contained regions of low velocity resulting in limited contrast in the flow-sensitive images. After PED placement, ordered aneurysmal flow was disrupted and intra-aneurysmal velocity was reduced on average by 24.5% (range, 12.9-31.5%). Exploratory statistical analysis yielded a positive significant correlation (P < 0.01) between changes in inflow velocity and posttreatment intra-aneurysmal flow velocity.\n4D pcMRI flow imaging in cerebral aneurysms within a time frame suitable for clinical imaging applications is feasible with optimized acquisition parameters, thereby enabling quantification of intra-aneurysmal flow changes after flow diverter device treatment.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2017-06-19", "authors": ["ChristofKarmonik", "Jeff RAnderson", "SabaElias", "RichardKlucznik", "OrlandoDiaz", "Yi JonathanZhang", "Robert GGrossman", "Gavin WBritz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.06.042"}
{"title": "Effect of in vitro enzymatic degradation on 3D printed poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) scaffolds: morphological, chemical and mechanical properties.", "abstract": "In recent years, the tissue engineering (TE) field has significantly benefited from advanced techniques such as additive manufacturing (AM), for the design of customized 3D scaffolds with the aim of guided tissue repair. Among the wide range of materials available to biomanufacture 3D scaffolds, poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) clearly arises as the synthetic polymer with the greatest potential, due to its unique properties - namely, biocompatibility, biodegradability, thermal and chemical stability and processability. This study aimed for the first time to investigate the effect of pore geometry on the in vitro enzymatic chain cleavage mechanism of PCL scaffolds manufactured by the AM extrusion process.\nMethods: Morphological properties of 3D printed PCL scaffolds before and after degradation were evaluated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and micro-computed tomography (\u03bc-CT). Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was employed to determine possible variations in the crystallinity of the scaffolds during the degradation period. The molecular weight was assessed using Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) while the mechanical properties were investigated under static compression conditions.\nMorphological results suggested a uniform reduction of filament diameter, while increasing the scaffolds' porosity. DSC analysis revealed and increment in the crystallinity degree while the molecular weight, evaluated through SEC, remained almost constant during the incubation period (25 days). Mechanical analysis highlighted a decrease in the compressive modulus and maximum stress over time, probably related to the significant weight loss of the scaffolds.\nAll of these results suggest that PCL scaffolds undergo enzymatic degradation through a surface erosion mechanism, which leads to significant variations in mechanical, physical and chemical properties, but which has little influence on pore geometry.", "journal": "Journal of applied biomaterials & functional materials", "date": "2017-06-18", "authors": ["JoanaFerreira", "AntonioGloria", "StefaniaCometa", "Jorge F JCoelho", "MarcoDomingos"], "doi": "10.5301/jabfm.5000363"}

Additively manufactured porous implants have recently shown tremendous promise in improving bone regeneration and osseointegration, but, as any conventional implant, are threatened by infection. In this study, we therefore used rational design and additive manufacturing in the form of selective laser melting (SLM) to fabricate porous titanium implants with interconnected pores, resulting in a 3.75 times larger surface area than corresponding solid implants. The SLM implants were biofunctionalized by embedding silver nanoparticles in an oxide surface layer grown using plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) in Ca/P-based electrolytes. The PEO layer of the SLM implants released silver ions for at least 28 days. X-ray diffraction analysis detected hydroxyapatite on the SLM PEO implants but not on the corresponding solid implants.

{"title": "From intricate to integrated: Biofabrication of articulating joints.", "abstract": "Articulating joints owe their function to the specialized architecture and the complex interplay between multiple tissues including cartilage, bone and synovium. Especially the cartilage component has limited self-healing capacity and damage often leads to the onset of osteoarthritis, eventually resulting in failure of the joint as an organ. Although in its infancy, biofabrication has emerged as a promising technology to reproduce the intricate organization of the joint, thus enabling the introduction of novel surgical treatments, regenerative therapies, and new sets of tools to enhance our understanding of joint physiology and pathology. Herein, we address the current challenges to recapitulate the complexity of articulating joints and how biofabrication could overcome them. The combination of multiple materials, biological cues and cells in a layer-by-layer fashion, can assist in reproducing both the zonal organization of cartilage and the gradual transition from resilient cartilage toward the subchondral bone in biofabricated osteochondral grafts. In this way, optimal integration of engineered constructs with the natural surrounding tissues can be obtained. Mechanical characteristics, including the smoothness and low friction that are hallmarks of the articular surface, can be tuned with multi-head or hybrid printers by controlling the spatial patterning of printed structures. Moreover, biofabrication can use digital medical images as blueprints for printing patient-specific implants. Finally, the current rapid advances in biofabrication hold significant potential for developing joint-on-a-chip models for personalized medicine and drug testing or even for the creation of implants that may be used to treat larger parts of the articulating joint. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

{"title": "A Sensory Material Approach for Reducing Variability in Additively Manufactured Metal Parts.", "abstract": "Despite the recent growth in interest for metal additive manufacturing (AM) in the biomedical and aerospace industries, variability in the performance, composition, and microstructure of AM parts remains a major impediment to its widespread adoption. The underlying physical mechanisms, which cause variability, as well as the scale and nature of variability are not well understood, and current methods are ineffective at capturing these details. Here, a Nickel-Titanium alloy is used as a sensory material in order to quantitatively, and rather rapidly, observe compositional and/or microstructural variability in selective laser melting manufactured parts; thereby providing a means to evaluate the role of process parameters on the variability. We perform detailed microstructural investigations using transmission electron microscopy at various locations to reveal the origins of microstructural variability in this sensory material. This approach helped reveal how reducing the distance between adjacent laser scans below a critical value greatly reduces both the in-sample and sample-to-sample variability. Microstructural investigations revealed that when the laser scan distance is wide, there is an inhomogeneity in subgrain size, precipitate distribution, and dislocation density in the microstructure, responsible for the observed variability.

{"title": "A heuristic computational model of basic cellular processes and oxygenation during spheroid-dependent biofabrication.", "abstract": "An emerging approach in biofabrication is the creation of 3D tissue constructs through scaffold-free, cell spheroid-only methods. The basic mechanism in this technology is spheroid fusion, which is driven by the minimization of energy, the same biophysical mechanism that governs spheroid formation. However, other factors such as oxygen and metabolite accessibility within spheroids impact on spheroid properties and their ability to form larger-scale structures. The goal of our work is to develop a simulation platform eventually capable of predicting the conditions that minimize metabolism-related cell loss within spheroids. To describe the behavior and dynamic properties of the cells in response to their neighbors and to transient nutrient concentration fields, we developed a hybrid discrete-continuous heuristic model, combining a cellular Potts-type approach with field equations applied to a randomly populated spheroid cross-section of prescribed cell-type constituency. This model allows for the description of: (i) cellular adhesiveness and motility; (ii) interactions with concentration fields, including diffusivity and oxygen consumption; and (iii) concentration-dependent, stochastic cell dynamics, driven by metabolite-dependent cell death. Our model readily captured the basic steps of spheroid-based biofabrication (as specifically dedicated to scaffold-free bioprinting), including intra-spheroid cell sorting (both in 2D and 3D implementations), spheroid defect closure, and inter-spheroid fusion. Moreover, we found that when hypoxia occurring at the core of the spheroid was set to trigger cell death, this was amplified upon spheroid fusion, but could be mitigated by external oxygen supplementation. In conclusion, optimization and further development of scaffold-free bioprinting techniques could benefit from our computational model which is able to simultaneously account for both cellular dynamics and metabolism in constructs obtained by scaffold-free biofabrication.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-06-16", "authors": ["T JSego", "UKasacheuski", "DHauersperger", "ATovar", "N IMoldovan"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa6ed4"}

Light absorption by the semiconductor nanorod is followed by charge separation and electron transfer to the metal tip, enabling redox reactions to form radicals in aerobic conditions.

{"title": "Programmable Deployment of Tensegrity Structures by Stimulus-Responsive Polymers.", "abstract": "Tensegrity structures with detached\u00a0struts are naturally suitable for deployable applications, both in terrestrial and outer-space structures, as well as morphing devices. Composed of discontinuous struts and continuous cables, such systems are only structurally stable when self-stress is induced; otherwise, they lose the original geometrical configuration (while keeping the topology) and thus can be tightly packed. We exploit this feature by using stimulus responsive polymers to introduce a paradigm for creating actively deployable 3D structures with complex shapes. The shape-change of 3D printed smart materials adds an active dimension to the configurational space of some structural components. Then we achieve dramatic global volume expansion by amplifying component-wise deformations to global configurational change via the inherent deployability of tensegrity. Through modular design, we can generate active tensegrities that are relatively stiff yet resilient with various complexities.

The powder-solid transformation, temperature dependent physical properties and the preservation of the heat are taken into account. The effect of the additive manufacturing multilayer feature on the molten pool dynamics, cooling rate, crystal size, microstructure morphology, micro-hardness and types of the residual stress has been investigated. It shows that the operating temperature and the thermo-capillary convection obtained within the molten pool generally increases as the processing multilayers are successively added, while the thermal effect depth is negatively reduced. The preferential direction of the heat diffusion generally changes from a downward pattern, then to the slightly strengthened horizontal direction and finally to a typically horizontal one for various deposited layers being processed. Therefore, the microstructure of the solidified part along the building direction (Region I to Region V) undergoes an interesting transformation: directional columnar cellular microstructure, crosswise-extended cellular microstructure, refined cellular microstructure, fragmentation microstructure and the coarse cellular microstructure.

We sought to create and provide validity evidence for a novel 3D-printed simulator of the nose and paranasal sinuses.\nSinonasal computed tomography (CT) images of a patient were imported into 3D visualization software. Segmentation of bony and soft tissue structures was then performed. The model was printed using simulated bone and soft tissue materials. Rhinologists and otolaryngology residents completed 6 prespecified tasks including maxillary antrostomy and frontal recess dissection on the simulator. Participants evaluated the model using survey ratings based on a 5-point Likert scale. The average time to complete each task was calculated. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate ratings, and thematic analysis was done for qualitative questions.\nA total of 20 participants (10 rhinologists and 10 otolaryngology residents) tested the model and answered the survey. Overall the participants felt that the simulator would be useful as a training/educational tool (4.6/5), and that it should be integrated as part of the rhinology training curriculum (4.5/5).

For quantitative studies of these promoters, the concentration of only a single factor is typically varied to obtain the dose response or transfer function of the promoters with respect to the factor. Such design of experiments has limited our ability to understand quantitative, combinatorial interactions between multiple regulatory factors at promoters. This limitation is primarily due to the intractable number of experimental combinations that arise from multifactorial design of experiments. To overcome this major limitation, we integrate impact printing and cell-free systems to enable multi-dimensional studies of genetic promoters. We first present a gradient printing system which comprises parallel piezoelectric cantilever beams as a scalable actuator array to generate droplets with tunable volumes in the range of 100 pL-10 nL, which facilitates highly accurate direct dilutions in the range of 1-10\u2009000-fold in a 1 \u03bcL drop. Next, we apply this technology to study interactions between three regulatory factors at a synthetic genetic promoter. Finally, a mathematical model of gene regulatory modules is established using the multi-parametric and multi-dimensional data.

{"title": "Assessing the Suitability of Cellulose-Nanodiamond Composite As a Multifunctional Biointerface Material for Bone Tissue Regeneration.", "abstract": "Interfacial surface properties, both physical and chemical, are known to play a critical role in achieving long-term stability of cell-biomaterial interactions. Novel bone tissue engineering technologies, which provide a suitable interface between cells and biomaterials and mitigate aseptic osteolysis, are sought and can be developed via the incorporation of nanostructured materials. In this sense, engineered nanobased constructs provide an effective interface and suitable topography for direct interaction with cells, promoting faster osseointegration and anchoring. Therefore, herein we have investigated the surface functionalization, biocompatibility, and effect of cellulose-nanodiamond conjugates on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were aminated through a 3-aminopropyltriethyoxysilane (APTES) silylation, while nanodiamonds (ND) were treated with a strong acid oxidation reflux, as to produce carboxyl groups on the surface. Thereafter, the two products were covalently joined through an amide linkage, using a common bioconjugation reaction. Human fetal osteoblastic cells (hFOB) were seeded for 7 days to investigate the in vitro performance of the cellulose-nanodiamond conjugates. By employing immunocytochemistry, the bone matrix expression of osteocalcin (OC) and bone sialoprotein (BSP) was analyzed, demonstrating the viability and capacity of osteoblasts to proliferate and differentiate on the developed composite. These results suggest that cellulose-nanodiamond composites, which we call oxidized biocompatible interfacial nanocomposites (oBINC), have the potential to serve as a biointerface material for cell adhesion, proliferationand differentiation because of their osteoconductive properties and biocompatibility; furthermore, they show promising applications for bone tissue regeneration.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2017-06-12", "authors": ["KarleneVega-Figueroa", "JaimeSantill\u00e1n", "CarlosGarc\u00eda", "Jos\u00e9 AGonz\u00e1lez-Feliciano", "Samir ABello", "Yaiel GRodr\u00edguez", "EdwinOrtiz-Quiles", "EduardoNicolau"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00026"}

Human mesenchymal stem cells were seeded on the composites, and various biological evaluations were performed over 9 days. With a mass fraction of \u03b2-TCP of 30%, differentiation began earlier; however, the cell proliferation rate was lower.

However, the fabrication of a bioceramic (high weight percent)-based 3D microfibrous structure is extremely difficult because of the low process-ability of bioceramics. In addition, three-dimensional (3D) microfibrous structure can induce more realistic cellular behavior when compared to that of 2D fibrous structure. Hence, the requirement of a 3D fibrous ceramic-based structure is an important issue in bioceramic scaffolds. In this study, a bioceramic (\u03b1-TCP)-based scaffold in which the weight fraction of the ceramic exceeded 70% was fabricated using an electrohydrodynamic printing (EHDP) process. The fabricated ceramic structure consisted of layer-by-layered struts entangled with polycaprolactone microfibers and the bioceramic phase. Various processing conditions (such as applied electric field, flow rate, nozzle size, and weight fraction of the bioceramic) were manipulated to obtain an optimal processing window. A 3D printed porous structure was used as a control, which had pore geometry similar to that of a structure fabricated using the EHDP process.

CT scans of hands and feet were analyzed using Boholo surgical simulator software (www.boholo.com). This allowed for the creation of a mirror image of the healthy thumb using the uninjured thumb. Using 3D images of the reconstructed thumb, a model of the big toe and the second toe was created to understand the dimensions of the donor site. This model was also used to repair the donor site defect by designing appropriate iliac bone and superficial circumflex iliac artery flaps. The polylactic acid model of the donor toes and reconstructed thumb was produced using 3D printing. Surgically, the wrap-around flap of the first dorsal metatarsal artery and vein combined with the joint and bone of the second toe was based upon the model donor site. Sensation was reconstructed by anastomosing the dorsal nerve of the foot and the plantar digital nerve of the great toe. Patients commenced exercises 2 weeks after surgery.\nAll reconstructed thumbs survived, although partial flap necrosis occurred in one case. This was managed with regular dressing changes. Patients were followed up for 3-15 months. The lengths of the reconstructed thumbs are 34-49 mm. The widths of the thumb nail beds are 16-19 mm, and the thickness of the digital pulp is 16-20 mm. The thumb opposition function was 0-1.5 cm; the extension angle was 5\u00b0-20\u00b0 (mean, 16\u00b0), and the angle of flexion was 38\u00b0-55\u00b0 (mean, 47\u00b0).

Based on the criteria set forth by the Standard on Approval of Reconstructed Thumb and Finger Functional Assessment of the Chinese Medical Association, the results were considered excellent for four cases and good for one case. The success rate was 100%.\nWhen planning a wrap-around flap and second toe transplant to reconstruct a thumb, both the donor and recipient sites can be modeled using 3D printing.

Printing quality can be improved by EAL-assisted laser printing when using various alginate solutions (1%, 2%, and 4%) and cell-laden bioinks (2% alginate and 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-06-10", "authors": ["RuitongXiong", "ZhengyiZhang", "WenxuanChai", "Douglas BChrisey", "YongHuang"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa74f2"}

{"title": "3D Printing-Based Integrated Water Quality Sensing System.", "abstract": "The online and accurate monitoring of drinking water supply networks is critically in demand to rapidly detect the accidental or deliberate contamination of drinking water. At present, miniaturized water quality monitoring sensors developed in the laboratories are usually tested under ambient pressure and steady-state flow conditions; however, in Water Distribution Systems (WDS), both the pressure and the flowrate fluctuate. In this paper, an interface is designed and fabricated using additive manufacturing or 3D printing technology-material extrusion (Trade Name: fused deposition modeling, FDM) and material jetting-to provide a conduit for miniaturized sensors for continuous online water quality monitoring. The interface is designed to meet two main criteria: low pressure at the inlet of the sensors and a low flowrate to minimize the water bled (i.e., leakage), despite varying pressure from WDS. To meet the above criteria, a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model was used to optimize the geometry of the channel. The 3D printed interface, with the embedded miniaturized pH and conductivity sensors, was then tested at different temperatures and flowrates. The results show that the response of the pH sensor is independent of the flowrate and temperature. As for the conductivity sensor, the flowrate and temperature affect only the readings at a very low conductivity (4 \u00b5S/cm) and high flowrates (30 mL/min), and a very high conductivity (460 \u00b5S/cm), respectively.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-06-09", "authors": ["MuinulBanna", "KaustavBera", "RyanSochol", "LiweiLin", "HomayounNajjaran", "RehanSadiq", "MinaHoorfar"], "doi": "10.3390/s17061336\n10.1128/CMR.00077-09\n10.2105/AJPH.87.4.580\n10.1080/10643389.2013.781936\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(2006)132:3(192)\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.12.002\n10.1021/ac403397r\n10.1039/C4LC00171K\n10.1002/1097-4636(200009)53:5<525::AID-JBM12>3.0.CO;2-1\n10.1039/C5LC00126A\n10.1073/pnas.1414764111\n10.1039/C3LC51360B\n10.1039/C5LC01389E\n10.1007/s40472-016-0085-x\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2361651\n10.1080/17452759.2016.1242915\n10.1007/s10404-015-1688-8\n10.3390/s17040828\n10.4319/lo.1962.7.3.0330"}

{"title": "Next generation human skin constructs as advanced tools for drug development.", "abstract": "Many diseases, as well as side effects of drugs, manifest themselves through skin symptoms. Skin is a complex tissue that hosts various specialized cell types and performs many roles including physical barrier, immune and sensory functions. Therefore, modeling skin in\u00a0vitro presents technical challenges for tissue engineering. Since the first attempts at engineering human epidermis in 1970s, there has been a growing interest in generating full-thickness skin constructs mimicking physiological functions by incorporating various skin components, such as vasculature and melanocytes for pigmentation. Development of biomimetic in\u00a0vitro human skin models with these physiological functions provides a new tool for drug discovery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine and basic research for skin biology. This goal, however, has long been delayed by the limited availability of different cell types, the challenges in establishing co-culture conditions, and the ability to recapitulate the 3D anatomy of the skin. Recent breakthroughs in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and microfabrication techniques such as 3D-printing have allowed for building more reliable and complex in\u00a0vitro skin models for pharmaceutical screening. In this review, we focus on the current developments and prevailing challenges in generating skin constructs with vasculature, skin appendages such as hair follicles, pigmentation, immune response, innervation, and hypodermis. Furthermore, we discuss the promising advances that iPSC technology offers in order to generate in\u00a0vitro models of genetic skin diseases, such as epidermolysis bullosa and psoriasis. We also discuss how future integration of the next generation human skin constructs onto microfluidic platforms along with other tissues could revolutionize the early stages of drug development by creating reliable evaluation of patient-specific effects of pharmaceutical agents. Impact statement Skin is a complex tissue that hosts various specialized cell types and performs many roles including barrier, immune, and sensory functions. For human-relevant drug testing, there has been a growing interest in building more physiological skin constructs by incorporating different skin components, such as vasculature, appendages, pigment, innervation, and adipose tissue. This paper provides an overview of the strategies to build complex human skin constructs that can faithfully recapitulate human skin and thus can be used in drug development targeting skin diseases. In particular, we discuss recent developments and remaining challenges in incorporating various skin components, availability of iPSC-derived skin cell types and in\u00a0vitro skin disease models.

{"title": "3D Printing by Multiphase Silicone/Water Capillary Inks.", "abstract": "3D printing of polymers is accomplished easily with thermoplastics as the extruded hot melt solidifies rapidly during the printing process. Printing with liquid polymer precursors is more challenging due to their longer curing times. One curable liquid polymer of specific interest is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). This study demonstrates a new efficient technique for 3D printing with PDMS by using a capillary suspension ink containing PDMS in the form of both precured microbeads and uncured liquid precursor, dispersed in water as continuous medium. The PDMS microbeads are held together in thixotropic granular paste by capillary attraction induced by the liquid precursor. These capillary suspensions possess high storage moduli and yield stresses that are needed for direct ink writing. They could be 3D printed and cured both in air and under water. The resulting PDMS structures are remarkably elastic, flexible, and extensible. As the ink is made of porous, biocompatible silicone that can be printed directly inside aqueous medium, it can be used in 3D printed biomedical products, or in applications such as direct printing of bioscaffolds on live tissue.

Furthermore, interactions between host tissue and developing tumors influence the susceptibility of tumors to drug treatments. Host-liver colorectal-tumor spheroids composed of primary human hepatocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and colon carcinoma HCT116 cells were created in simulated microgravity rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. The cells were seeded on hyaluronic acid-based microcarriers, loaded with liver-specific growth factors and ECM components. Only in the presence of MSC, large tumor foci rapidly formed inside the spheroids and increased in size steadily over time, while not greatly impacting albumin secretion from hepatocytes. The presence of MSC appeared to drive self-organization and formation of a stroma-like tissue surrounding the tumor foci and hepatocytes. Exposure to a commonly used chemotherapeutic 5-FU showed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity. However, if tumor organoids were allowed to mature in the RWV, they were less sensitive to the drug treatment.

A statistical study of the cracking behavior as a function of crystal orientation in a laser 3D-printed DL125L Ni-based superalloy polycrystal is investigated here using the synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction. The dislocation slip system in each of the forty crystal grains adjacent to the 300\u2009\u03bcm long crack has been analyzed through Laue diffraction peak shapes. In all these grains, edge-type geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) dominate, and their dislocation line directions are almost parallel to the crack plane. Based on Schmid's law, the equivalent uniaxial tensile force direction is revealed normal to the trace of the crack. A qualitative mechanism is thus proposed. Thermal tensile stress perpendicular to the laser scanning direction is elevated due to a significant temperature gradient, and thus locations in the materials where the thermal stress exceeds the yield stress undergo plastic deformation mediated by GND activations.

DOM was successfully loaded into hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) filaments using hot melt extrusion (HME). The filaments were then printed into hollow structured tablets through changing the shell numbers and the infill percentages.

{"title": "The virtual approach to the assessment of skeletal injuries in human skeletal remains of forensic importance.", "abstract": "While assessing skeletal injuries in human skeletal remains, forensic anthropologists are frequently presented with fractured, fragmented, or otherwise modified skeletal remains. The examination of evidence and the mechanisms of skeletal injuries often require that separate osseous elements be permanently or temporarily reassembled or reconstructed. If not dealt with properly, such reconstructions may impede accurate interpretation of the evidence. Nowadays, routine forensic examinations increasingly incorporate digital imaging technologies. As a result, a variety of PC-assisted imaging techniques, collectively referred to as the virtual approach, have been made available to treat fragmentary skeletal remains. The present study employs a 3D virtual approach to assess mechanisms of skeletal injuries, and provides an expert opinion of causative tools in three forensic cases involving human skeletal remains where integrity was compromised by multiple peri- or postmortem alterations resulting in fragmentation and/or incompleteness. Three fragmentary skulls and an incomplete set of foot bones with evidence of perimortem fractures (gunshot wounds) and sharp force trauma (saw marks) were digitized using a desktop laser scanner. The digitized skeletal elements were reassembled in the virtual workspace using functionalities incorporated in AMIRA", "journal": "Journal of forensic and legal medicine", "date": "2017-06-07", "authors": ["PetraUrbanov\u00e1", "Ann HRoss", "Mikol\u00e1\u0161Jurda", "Ivana\u0160pl\u00edchalov\u00e1"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jflm.2017.05.015"}
{"title": "3D printing and milling a real-time PCR device for infectious disease diagnostics.", "abstract": "Diagnosing infectious diseases using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) offers a conclusive result in determining the infection, the strain or type of pathogen, and the level of infection. However, due to the high-cost instrumentation involved and the complexity in maintenance, it is rarely used in the field to make a quick turnaround diagnosis. In order to provide a higher level of accessibility than current qPCR devices, a set of 3D manufacturing methods is explored as a possible option to fabricate a low-cost and portable qPCR device. The key advantage of this approach is the ability to upload the digital format of the design files on the internet for wide distribution so that people at any location can simply download and feed into their 3D printers for quick manufacturing. The material and design are carefully selected to minimize the number of custom parts that depend on advanced manufacturing processes which lower accessibility. The presented 3D manufactured qPCR device is tested with 20-\u03bcL samples that contain various concentrations of lentivirus, the same type as HIV. A reverse-transcription step is a part of the device's operation, which takes place prior to the qPCR step to reverse transcribe the target RNA from the lentivirus into complementary DNA (cDNA). This is immediately followed by qPCR which quantifies the target sequence molecules in the sample during the PCR amplification process. The entire process of thermal control and time-coordinated fluorescence reading is automated by closed-loop feedback and a microcontroller. The resulting device is portable and battery-operated, with a size of 12 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 cm3 and mass of only 214 g. By uploading and sharing the design files online, the presented low-cost qPCR device may provide easier access to a robust diagnosis protocol for various infectious diseases, such as HIV and malaria.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-06-07", "authors": ["GeoffreyMulberry", "Kevin AWhite", "ManjushaVaidya", "KiminobuSugaya", "Brian NKim"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0179133\n10.1128/CMR.15.1.66-78.2002\n10.1093/infdis/jir789\n10.1093/nar/gni143\n10.15585/mmwr.mm6502a3\n10.1093/nar/gkm389\n10.1039/c5lc01415h\n10.1039/c3cs60144g\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082704\n10.1093/nar/gkl416\n10.1039/c6lc00284f\n10.1039/c5lc00685f\n10.1002/elps.201400321\n10.1371/journal.pone.0023783\n10.1371/journal.pone.0140349\n10.1371/journal.pone.0134989\n10.1371/journal.pone.0110475\n10.1101/gad.1642408\n10.1371/journal.pone.0085869\n10.1128/JCM.01626-10"}
{"title": "3D bioprinting of methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA) hydrogel with intrinsic osteogenicity.", "abstract": "In bone regenerative medicine there is a need for suitable bone substitutes. Hydrogels have excellent biocompatible and biodegradable characteristics, but their visco-elastic properties limit their applicability, especially with respect to 3D bioprinting. In this study, we modified the naturally occurring extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA), in order to yield photo-crosslinkable hydrogels with increased mechanical stiffness and long-term stability, and with minimal decrease in cytocompatibility. Application of these tailor-made methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA) gels for bone tissue engineering and 3D bioprinting was the subject of investigation. Visco-elastic properties of MeHA gels, measured by rheology and dynamic mechanical analysis, showed that irradiation of the hydrogels with UV light led to increased storage moduli and elastic moduli, indicating increasing gel rigidity. Subsequently, human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were incorporated into MeHA hydrogels, and cell viability remained 64.4% after 21 days of culture. Osteogenic differentiation of MSCs occurred spontaneously in hydrogels with high concentrations of MeHA polymer, in absence of additional osteogenic stimuli. Addition of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) to the culture medium further increased osteogenic differentiation, as evidenced by increased matrix mineralisation. MeHA hydrogels demonstrated to be suitable for 3D bioprinting, and were printed into porous and anatomically shaped scaffolds. Taken together, photosensitive MeHA-based hydrogels fulfilled our criteria for cellular bioprinted bone constructs within a narrow window of concentration.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2017-06-07", "authors": ["Michelle TPoldervaart", "BirgitGoversen", "Mylenede Ruijter", "AnnaAbbadessa", "Ferry P WMelchels", "F Cumhur\u00d6ner", "Wouter J ADhert", "TinaVermonden", "JacquelineAlblas"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0177628\n10.1002/adma.200802106\n10.1038/nmat2269\n10.5301/JABFM.2012.9418\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.03.012\n10.1002/adma.201303233\n10.1007/s10544-012-9649-4\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2010.0011\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.003\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2011.0060\n10.1021/bm049508a\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.078\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.09.037\n10.1021/bm300324m\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2012.04333.x\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0019\n10.1088/1758-5082/3/2/021001\n10.1002/bit.10605\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.047\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.050\n10.1002/jbm.a.30821\n10.1074/jbc.M112.349209\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.07.045\n10.1089/ten.2006.0126\n10.1016/j.matbio.2005.03.004\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.125\n10.1002/jor.22374\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.037\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.11.022\n10.1080/07853890701881788\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0001"}
{"title": "Direct 3D cell-printing of human skin with functional transwell system.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) cell-printing has been emerging as a promising technology with which to build up human skin models by enabling rapid and versatile design. Despite the technological advances, challenges remain in the development of fully functional models that recapitulate complexities in the native tissue. Moreover, although several approaches have been explored for the development of biomimetic human skin models, the present skin models based on multistep fabrication methods using polydimethylsiloxane chips and commercial transwell inserts could be tackled by leveraging 3D cell-printing technology. In this paper, we present a new 3D cell-printing strategy for engineering a 3D human skin model with a functional transwell system in a single-step process. A hybrid 3D cell-printing system was developed, allowing for the use of extrusion and inkjet modules at the same time. We began by revealing the significance of each module in engineering human skin models; by using the extrusion-dispensing module, we engineered a collagen-based construct with polycaprolactone (PCL) mesh that prevented the contraction of collagen during tissue maturation; the inkjet-based dispensing module was used to uniformly distribute keratinocytes. Taking these features together, we engineered a human skin model with a functional transwell system; the transwell system and fibroblast-populated dermis were consecutively fabricated by using the extrusion modules. Following this process, keratinocytes were uniformly distributed onto the engineered dermis by the inkjet module. Our transwell system indicates a supportive 3D construct composed of PCL, enabling the maturation of a skin model without the aid of commercial transwell inserts. This skin model revealed favorable biological characteristics that included a stabilized fibroblast-stretched dermis and stratified epidermis layers after 14 days. It was also observed that a 50 times reduction in cost was achieved and 10 times less medium was used than in a conventional culture. Collectively, because this single-step process opens up chances for versatile designs, we envision that our cell-printing strategy could provide an attractive platform in engineering various human skin models.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-06-07", "authors": ["Byoung SooKim", "Jung-SeobLee", "GeGao", "Dong-WooCho"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa71c8"}
{"title": "Structurally and Functionally Optimized Silk-Fibroin-Gelatin Scaffold Using 3D Printing to Repair Cartilage Injury In Vitro and In Vivo.", "abstract": "Articular cartilage repair remains a great challenge for clinicians and researchers. Recently, there emerges a promising way to achieve one-step cartilage repair in situ by combining endogenic bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) with suitable biomaterials using a tissue engineering technique. To meet the increasing demand for cartilage tissue engineering, a structurally and functionally optimized scaffold is designed, by integrating silk fibroin with gelatin in combination with BMSC-specific-affinity peptide using 3D printing (3DP) technology. The combination ratio of silk fibroin and gelatin greatly balances the mechanical properties and degradation rate to match the newly formed cartilage. This dually optimized scaffold has shown superior performance for cartilage repair in a knee joint because it not only retains adequate BMSCs, due to efficient recruiting ability, and acts as a physical barrier for blood clots, but also provides a mechanical protection before neocartilage formation and a suitable 3D microenvironment for BMSC proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production. It appears to be a promising biomaterial for knee cartilage repair and is worthy of further investigation in large animal studies and preclinical applications. Beyond knee cartilage, this dually optimized scaffold may also serve as an ideal biomaterial for the regeneration of other joint cartilages.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2017-06-07", "authors": ["WeiliShi", "MuyangSun", "XiaoqingHu", "BoRen", "JinCheng", "ChenxiLi", "XiaoningDuan", "XinFu", "JiyingZhang", "HaifengChen", "YingfangAo"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.201701089"}

{"title": "The role of 3D printing in anatomy education and surgical training: A narrative review.", "abstract": "This article was migrated. The article was marked as recommended. Recent expansions in the development and availability of three-dimensional printing (3Dp) have led to the uptake of this valuable and effective technology within the modern context of medical education. It is proposed that 3Dp is entirely appropriate for the creation of anatomical models for purposes of teaching and training due to the ability of this technology to produce accurate 3D physical representations based on a processed data set acquired from sources including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). When investigating the currently available educational research with respect to 3Dp, it is important that the best evidence supporting the practical and theoretical benefits of this technology in teaching and training can be identified, while any obstacles to the effective implementation of 3Dp can also be determined. Here, literature describing recent primary research with respect to the capability and utility of 3Dp in anatomy and surgery have been explored in a narrative review. The impact on resources of implementing this technology within medical education have also been investigated. In order to emphasise wider applications in medicine, the role of 3Dp in medical practice and research have also been examined. To identify recent literature appropriate for this review published up to March 2017, suitable search terms were determined and applied using PubMed and results were judged against an established checklist.

In this study, as materials for strain sensor devices, we exploit the low-cost, carbon-based, 3-dimensional (3D) printable composite dough. The dough is prepared via a chemical method based on the formation of electrostatic assemblies between 1-dimensional, amine-functionalized, multi-walled carbon nanotubes and 2-dimensional graphene oxides. The resulting composite dough has an extremely high storage modulus, which allows a vertically-stackable, 3D printing process for fabricating strain sensor devices on various dense, porous and structured substrates. The device performance parameters, including gauge factor, hysteresis, linearity, and overshooting behavior are found to be adjustable by controlling the printing process parameters. The fabricated strain sensor devices demonstrate the ability to distinguish actual human body motions. A high gauge factor of over 70 as well as other excellent device performance parameters are achievable for the printed sensor devices, and even small strains, below 1%, are also detectable by the fabricated sensor devices.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2017-06-06", "authors": ["Ju YoungKim", "SeulgiJi", "SungmookJung", "Beyong-HwanRyu", "Hyun-SukKim", "Sun SookLee", "YoungminChoi", "SunhoJeong"], "doi": "10.1039/c7nr01865g"}

Surgical resection and reconstruction was performed in combination with a 3D-printed, patient-specific implant. Custom design features included porous titanium end plates, corrective angulation of the implant to restore sagittal balance, and pedicle screw holes in the 3D implant to assist with insertion of the device. In addition, attachment of the anterior column construct to the posterior pedicle screw construct was possible due to the customized features of the patient-specific implant.\nAn advantage of 3DP is the ability to manufacture patient-specific implants, as in the current case example. Additionally, the use of 3DP has been able to reduce operative time significantly. Surgical procedures can be preplanned using 3DP patient-specific models.

Numerous scaffolds have been tested in the orthopedic field with the aim of improving cell viability, attachment, proliferation and homing, osteogenic differentiation, vascularization, host integration and load bearing. The main traits that characterize a scaffold suitable for bone regeneration concerning its biological requirements, structural features, composition, and types of fabrication are described in detail. Attention is then focused on conventional and Rapid Prototyping scaffold manufacturing techniques. Conventional manufacturing approaches are subtractive methods where parts of the material are removed from an initial block to achieve the desired shape. Rapid Prototyping techniques, introduced to overcome standard techniques limitations, are additive fabrication processes that manufacture the final three-dimensional object via deposition of overlying layers. An important improvement is the possibility to create custom-made products by means of computer assisted technologies, starting from patient's medical images. As a conclusion, it is highlighted that, despite its encouraging results, the clinical approach of Bone Tissue Engineering has not taken place on a large scale yet, due to the need of more in depth studies, its high manufacturing costs and the difficulty to obtain regulatory approval.

{"title": "A microcontroller-based simulation of dural venous sinus injury for neurosurgical training.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Surgical simulation has the potential to supplement and enhance traditional resident training. However, the high cost of equipment and limited number of available scenarios have inhibited wider integration of simulation in neurosurgical education. In this study the authors provide initial validation of a novel, low-cost simulation platform that recreates the stress of surgery using a combination of hands-on, model-based, and computer elements. Trainee skill was quantified using multiple time and performance measures. The simulation was initially validated using trainees at the start of their intern year. METHODS The simulation recreates intraoperative superior sagittal sinus injury complicated by air embolism. The simulator model consists of 2 components: a reusable base and a disposable craniotomy pack. The simulator software is flexible and modular to allow adjustments in difficulty or the creation of entirely new clinical scenarios. The reusable simulator base incorporates a powerful microcomputer and multiple sensors and actuators to provide continuous feedback to the software controller, which in turn adjusts both the screen output and physical elements of the model. The disposable craniotomy pack incorporates 3D-printed sections of model skull and brain, as well as artificial dura that incorporates a model sagittal sinus. RESULTS Twelve participants at the 2015 Western Region Society of Neurological Surgeons postgraduate year 1 resident course (\"boot camp\") provided informed consent and enrolled in a study testing the prototype device. Each trainee was required to successfully create a bilateral parasagittal craniotomy, repair a dural sinus tear, and recognize and correct an air embolus. Participant stress was measured using a heart rate wrist monitor. After participation, each resident completed a 13-question categorical survey. CONCLUSIONS All trainee participants experienced tachycardia during the simulation, although the point in the simulation at which they experienced tachycardia varied. Survey results indicated that participants agreed the simulation was realistic, created stress, and was a useful tool in training neurosurgical residents.

It is challenging to translate this ordered and multiscale structural organization in synthetic, bulk composites. Herein, a combination of top-down and bottom-up approach is demonstrated, to form a polymer-ceramic composite by macroscopically aligning the self-assembled nanostructure of polymerizable lyotropic liquid crystals via 3D printing. The polymer matrix is then uniformly reinforced with bone-like apatite via in situ biomimetic mineralization. The combinatorial method enables the formation of macrosized, heterogeneous composites where the nanostructure and chemical composition is locally tuned over microscopic distances. This enables precise control over the mechanics in specific directions and regions, with a unique intrinsic-extrinsic toughening mechanism.

{"title": "Cell sheet based bioink for 3D bioprinting applications.", "abstract": "In this research, a novel development of bioink from cell sheets is presented for scaffold free bioprinting applications. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) coated surfaces were first prepared by using initiated chemical vapor deposition method. Cell-sheets were then grown on these thermoresponsive pNIPAAm coated surfaces and easily detached without disturbing delicate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-cell interactions. The detached cells sheets were used to prepare cell sheet based bioink and bioprinted to form various shapes. The results showed that the prepared cell-sheet based bioink shows an increase in the structural integrity compare to cell-aggregates suggesting that the cell sheet aggregates preserved interconnected ECM proteins. The viability of cell sheet based aggregates was also compared to single cell aggregates at three different time points in a seven-day period after printing. The developed cell-sheet based bioink has several advantages in terms of shape fidelity, reproducibility and automated deposition for bioprinting applications. The results also demonstrated that the bioprinted constructs secreted collagen type I which is a strong indication of starting ECM deposition. Moreover, the immunostaining results showed that the fibronectin in cell sheets was preserved during and after the preparation process of bioink.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-06-02", "authors": ["EBakirci", "BToprakhisar", "M CZeybek", "G OInce", "BKoc"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa764f"}

Where in early days computational models were used to better understand the biomechanical requirements of targeted tissues to be regenerated, recently, more and more models are formulated to combine such biomechanical requirements with cell fate predictions to aid in the design of functional three-dimensional scaffolds. In this review, we highlight how computational modeling has been used to understand the mechanisms behind tissue formation and can be used for more rational and biomimetic scaffold-based tissue regeneration strategies. With a particular focus on musculoskeletal tissues, we discuss recent models attempting to predict cell activity in relation to specific mechanical and physical stimuli that can be applied to them through porous three-dimensional scaffolds. In doing so, we review the most common scaffold fabrication methods, with a critical view on those technologies that offer better properties to be more easily combined with computational modeling.

Additive manufacturing provides a cost-effective means to create patient-specific implants and allows for customized textures for integration with bone and other tissues. Our objective was to compare the osseointegration strength of two primary additive manufacturing methods of producing textured implants: electron beam melting (EBM) (mean Ra\u2009=\u200923\u2009\u03bcm) and direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) (mean Ra\u2009=\u200910\u2009\u03bcm). Due to spatial resolution, DMLS can produce surfaces with a roughness comparable to EBM. Two cohorts of Sprague-Dawley rats received bilateral, titanium implants in their distal femurs and were followed for 4 weeks. The first-cohort animals received EBM implants transcortically in one femur and a DMLS implant in the contralateral femur. The second cohort received DMLS implants (either fine textured or coarse textured to mimic EBM) in the intramedullary canal of each femur. Osseointegration was evaluated through mechanical testing and micro-computed tomography (bone volume fraction [BV/TV] and bone-implant contact [BIC]). The fixation strength of coarse textured implants provided superior interlocking relative to fine textured implants without affecting BV/TV or BIC in both cohorts. Coarse EBM implants in a transcortical model demonstrated an 85% increase in removal torque relative to the fine DMLS textured implants.

New additive manufacturing processes based on laser sintering has been developed for quick fabrication of RPDs metal frameworks at low cost. The objective of this study was to characterize the mechanical, physical, and biocompatibility properties of RPD cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloys produced by two laser-sintering systems and compare them to those prepared using traditional casting methods. The laser-sintered Co-Cr alloys were processed by the selective laser-sintering method (SLS) and the direct metal laser-sintering (DMLS) method using the Phenix system (L-1) and EOS system (L-2), respectively. L-1 and L-2 techniques were 8 and 3.5 times more precise than the casting (CC) technique (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Co-Cr alloys processed by L-1 and L-2 showed higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) hardness (14-19%), yield strength (10-13%), and fatigue resistance (71-72%) compared to CC alloys. This was probably due to their smaller grain size and higher microstructural homogeneity. All Co-Cr alloys exhibited low porosity (2.1-3.3%); however, pore distribution was more homogenous in L-1 and L-2 alloys when compared to CC alloys.

{"title": "Simulating effects of brain atrophy in longitudinal PET imaging with an anthropomorphic brain phantom.", "abstract": "In longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET), the presence of volumetric changes over time can lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the true changes in the quantified PET signal due to the partial volume effect (PVE) introduced by the limited spatial resolution of existing PET cameras and reconstruction algorithms. Here, a 3D-printed anthropomorphic brain phantom with attachable striata in three sizes was designed to enable controlled volumetric changes. Using a method to eliminate the non-radioactive plastic wall, and manipulating BP levels by adding different number of events from list-mode acquisitions, we investigated the artificial volume dependence of BP due to PVE, and potential bias arising from varying BP. Comparing multiple reconstruction algorithms we found that a high-resolution ordered-subsets maximization algorithm with spatially variant point-spread function resolution modeling provided the most accurate data. For striatum, the BP changed by 0.08% for every 1% volume change, but for smaller volumes such as the posterior caudate the artificial change in BP was as high as 0.7% per 1% volume change. A simple gross correction for striatal volume is unsatisfactory, as the amplitude of the PVE on the BP differs depending on where in the striatum the change occurred. Therefore, to correctly interpret age-related longitudinal changes in the BP, we must account for volumetric changes also within a structure, rather than across the whole volume. The present 3D-printing technology, combined with the wall removal method, can be implemented to gain knowledge about the predictable bias introduced by the PVE differences in uptake regions of varying shape.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2017-06-01", "authors": ["L SJonasson", "JAxelsson", "KRiklund", "C JBoraxbekk"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6560/aa6e1b"}

We aimed to investigate the additional benefit conferred by volume rendering of tomographic images and 3D printing for diagnosis and interventional planning.\nFour cases of coronary fistulae were considered for transcatheter closure. Multidetector computed tomography (three cases) or cardiac magnetic resonance (one case) images were acquired and segmented using Mimics software. Each case was reviewed after incremental consideration of diagnostic resources: two cardiologists reported source and volume-rendered images; device closure was discussed by the interventional cardiology team. All diagnoses and planned management were reviewed after inspection of a 3D model. Using source images alone, both cardiologists correctly described the course and drainage in two out of four cases. Aided by volume rendering, this improved to three out of four cases. Inspection of the 3D printed model prompted the planned interventional approach and device sizing to be altered in two out of four cases. In one out of four cases, the intervention was abandoned after inspection of the 3D printed model.\nDiagnosis and management of patients with coronary artery fistulae rely on detailed image analyses. 3D models add value when determining the feasibility of, and the approach to intervention in these cases.", "journal": "EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology", "date": "2017-05-31", "authors": ["Mari NievesVelasco Forte", "NickByrne", "IsraelValverde Perez", "AaronBell", "GorkaG\u00f3mez-Ciriza", "ThomasKrasemann", "HorstSievert", "JohnSimpson", "KuberanPushparajah", "RezaRazavi", "ShakeelQureshi", "TariqueHussain"], "doi": "10.4244/EIJ-D-16-00897"}

The implant fixation points allow implant behaviour with respect to intracranial pressure conditions. However, increased fixation points lead to variation in deformation and equivalent stress. Finite element analysis is providing a valuable insight to know the deformation and equivalent stress.\nThe patient CT data (Computed Tomography) is processed in Mimics software to get the mesh model. The implant is modelled by using modified reverse engineering technique with the help of Rhinoceros software. This modelling method is applicable for all types of defects including those beyond the middle line and multiple ones. It is designed with eight fixation points and ten fixation points to fix an implant. Consequently, the mechanical deformation and equivalent stress (von Mises) are calculated in ANSYS 15 software with distinctive material properties such as Titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK).\nThe deformation and equivalent stress results are obtained through ANSYS 15 software. It is observed that Ti6Al4V material shows low deformation and PEEK material shows less equivalent stress. Among all materials PEEK shows noticeably good result.\nHence, a concept was established and more clinically relevant results can be expected with implementation of realistic 3D printed model in the future.

One of the three dimensional printing techniques is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) which works on the basis of hot melt extrusion-well known in the pharmaceutical technology. Combination of fused deposition modelling with preparation of the orodispersible film with poorly water soluble substance such as aripiprazole seems to be extra advantageous in terms of dissolution rate. 3D printed as well as casted films were compared in terms of physicochemical and mechanical properties. Moreover, drug-free films were prepared to evaluate the impact of the extrusion process and aripiprazole presence on the film properties. X-ray diffractometry and thermal analyses confirmed transition of aripiprazole into amorphous state during film preparation using 3D printing technique. Amorphization of the aripiprazole and porous structure of printed film led to increased dissolution rate in comparison to casted films, which, however have slightly better mechanical properties due to their continuous structure.

Each consisted of cutting guides and three-dimensionally (3D) printed custom titanium plates to guide the osteotomy and repositioning the bony segments without the use of the surgical splints. Finally, the outcome evaluation was completed by comparing planned outcomes with postoperative outcomes. All operations were successfully completed using the POSG system. The largest root-mean-square deviations were 0.74mm and 1.93\u00b0 for the maxillary dental arch, 1.10mm and 2.82\u00b0 for the mandibular arch, 0.83mm and 2.59\u00b0 for the mandibular body, and 0.98mm and 2.45\u00b0 for the proximal segments.

In the last two decades, tissue-engineered skin constructs have shown great promise in the treatment of various skin-related disorders such as deep burns and wounds. The treatment methods for skin replacement and repair have evolved from utilization of autologous epidermal sheets to more complex bilayered cutaneous tissue engineered skin substitutes. However, inadequate vascularization, lack of flexibility in drug/growth factors loading and inability to reconstitute skin appendages such as hair follicles limits their utilization for restoration of normal skin anatomy on a routine basis. Recent advancements in cutting-edge technology from stem cell biology, nanotechnology, and various vascularization strategies have provided a tremendous springboard for researchers in developing and manipulating tissue engineered skin substitutes for improved skin regeneration and wound healing. This review summarizes the overview of skin tissue engineering and wound healing. Herein, developments and challenges of various available biomaterials, cell sources and in vitro skin models (full thickness and wound healing models) in tissue-engineered skin research are discussed.

This approach makes use of primary human sinusoidal endothelial cells, stellate cells and hepatocytes that are seeded sequentially on hollow fiber membranes (HF) in order to mimic the layers of cells found in vivo. To this purpose modified polyethersulfone (PES) HF membranes were used for the creation of a 3D human liver system in static and dynamic conditions. In order to verify the positive effect of non-parenchymal cells on the maintenance of hepatocyte viability and functions, homotypic cultures of hepatocytes alone on the HF membranes were further investigated. The membrane surface allowed the attachment and self-assembly of the cells, forming tissue-like structures around and between fibers. Sinusoidal cells formed tube-like structures that surrounded hepatocytes organized in cords within aggregates promoted by stellate cells. The co-culture of hepatocytes with sinusoidal endothelial and hepatic stellate cells preserved structural architecture of the construct and improved the liver-specific functions. Most importantly, cells co-cultured in a HF membrane bioreactor synthesized albumin and urea for 28 days. The liver membrane bioreactor also preserved the drug biotransformation activity with a continuous production of diazepam phase I metabolites for an extended period of time.

A 23-year-old man was confirmed by radiological examination to have fractures of multiple ribs, with hemopneumothorax and communicated fractures of the left acetabulum. According to the Letounel and Judet classification, T-shaped fracture involving posterior wall was diagnosed. A 3D printing pelvic model was established using CT digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) data preoperatively, with which surgical procedures were simulated in preoperative surgery to confirm the sequence of the reduction and fixation as well as the position and length of the implants. Open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) of the acetabular fracture using modified ilioinguinal and Kocher-Langenbeck approaches was performed 25 days after injury. Plates that had been pre-bent in the preoperative surgery were positioned and screws were tightened in the directions determined in the preoperative planning following satisfactory reduction. The duration of the operation was 170 min and blood loss was 900 mL. Postoperative X-rays showed that anatomical reduction of the acetabulum was achieved and the hip joint was congruous. The position and length of the implants were not different when compared with those in preoperative surgery on 3D printing models.

For reasons of changes in curriculum emphasis, cost, availability, expertise, and ethical concerns, several medical schools have replaced wet cadaveric specimens with plastinated prosections, plastic models, imaging, and digital models. Discussions about the qualities and limitations of these alternative teaching resources are on-going. We hypothesize that three-dimensional printed (3DP) models can replace or indeed enhance existing resources for anatomical education. A novel multi-colored and multi-material 3DP model of the upper limb was developed based on a plastinated upper limb prosection, capturing muscles, nerves, arteries and bones with a spatial resolution of \u223c1\u00a0mm. This study aims to examine the educational value of the 3DP model from the learner's point of view. Students (n\u00a0=\u00a015) compared the developed 3DP models with the plastinated prosections, and provided their views on their learning experience using 3DP models using a survey and focus group discussion. Anatomical features in 3DP models were rated as accurate by all students. Several positive aspects of 3DP models were highlighted, such as the color coding by tissue type, flexibility and that less care was needed in the handling and examination of the specimen than plastinated specimens which facilitated the appreciation of relations between the anatomical structures. However, students reported that anatomical features in 3DP models are less realistic compared to the plastinated specimens. Multi-colored, multi-material 3DP models are a valuable resource for anatomical education and an excellent adjunct to wet cadaveric or plastinated prosections.

Medical 3D printing consists of three main steps: image acquisition, virtual reconstruction and 3D manufacturing. It is a promising tool for preoperative evaluation, medical device design, hemodynamic simulation and medical education, it is also likely to reduce operative risk and increase operative success. However, the most relevant studies are case reports or series which are underpowered in testing its actual effect on patient outcomes. The decision of making a 3D cardiac model may seem arbitrary since it is mostly based on a cardiologist's perceived difficulty in performing an interventional procedure. A uniform consensus is urgently necessary to standardize the key steps of 3D printing from imaging acquisition to final production. In the future, more clinical trials of rigorous design are possible to further validate the effect of 3D printing on the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

{"title": "Three-dimensional Printing of Silver Microarchitectures Using Newtonian Nanoparticle Inks.", "abstract": "Although three-dimensional (3D) printing has recently emerged as a technology to potentially bring about the next industrial revolution, the limited selection of usable materials restricts its use to simple prototyping. In particular, metallic 3D printing with submicrometer spatial resolution is essential for the realization of 3D-printed electronics. Herein, a meniscus-guided 3D printing method that exploits a low-viscosity (\u223c7 mPa\u00b7s) silver nanoparticle (AgNP) ink meniscus with Newtonian fluid characteristics (which is compatible with conventional inkjet printers) to fabricate 3D silver microarchitectures is reported. Poly(acrylic acid)-capped AgNP ink that exhibits a continuous ink flow through a confined nozzle without aggregation is designed in this study. Guiding the ink meniscus with controlled direction and speed enables both vertical pulling and layer-by-layer processing, resulting in the creation of 3D microobjects with designed shapes other than those for simple wiring.

Although significant progress has been made in developing microfluidic systems for nucleic acid and whole bacteria immunoassay tests, their practical application is limited by complex protocols, bulky peripherals, and slow operation. Here we present a microfluidic capillaric circuit (CC) optimized for rapid and automated detection of bacteria in urine. Molds for CCs were constructed using previously established design rules, then 3D-printed and replicated into poly(dimethylsiloxane). CCs autonomously and sequentially performed all liquid delivery steps required for the assay. For efficient bacteria capture, on-the-spot packing of antibody-functionalized microbeads was completed in <20 s followed by autonomous sequential delivery of 100 \u03bcL of bacteria sample, biotinylated detection antibodies, fluorescent streptavidin conjugate, and wash buffer for a total volume \u2248115 \u03bcL. The assay was completed in <7 min.

{"title": "Utility of 3D printed temporal bones in pre-surgical planning for complex BoneBridge cases.", "abstract": "With the advent of single-sided hearing loss increasingly being treated with cochlear implantation, bone conduction implants are reserved for cases of conductive and mixed hearing loss with greater complexity. The BoneBridge (BB, MED-EL, Innsbruck, Austria) is an active fully implantable device with no attenuation of sound energy through soft tissue. However, the floating mass transducer (FMT) part of the device is very bulky, which limits insertion in complicated ears. In this study, 3D printed temporal bones of patients were used to study its utility in preoperative planning on complicated cases. Computed tomography (CT) scans of 16 ears were used to 3D print their temporal bones. Three otologists graded the use of routine preoperative planning provided by MED-EL and that of operating on the 3D printed bone of the patient. Data were collated to assess the advantage and disadvantage of the technology. There was a statistically significant benefit in using 3D printed temporal bones to plan surgery for difficult cases of BoneBridge surgery compared to the current standard. Surgeons preferred to have the printed bones in theatre to plan their drill sites and make the transition of the planning to the patient's operation more precise. 3D printing is an innovative use of technology in the use of preoperative planning for complex ear surgery. Surgical planning can be done on the patient's own anatomy which may help to decrease operating time, reduce cost, increase surgical precision and thus reduce complications.", "journal": "European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery", "date": "2017-05-26", "authors": ["PayalMukherjee", "KaiCheng", "SeanFlanagan", "SimonGreenberg"], "doi": "10.1007/s00405-017-4618-4"}

Gelatin/alginate hydrogel scaffolds were printed using a bioplotter, and the cytotoxicity of the aqueous extracts of the scaffold material was tested in the third passage of HDPCs using cell counting kit-8. Scanning electron microscopy and trypan blue were used to assess the adhesion and proliferation of the cells seeded in the scaffold material at a low or high concentration.\nThe aqueous extract of the scaffolds at different concentrations showed no obvious cytotoxicity and promoted the proliferation of HDPCs. The scaffolds had a good biocompatibility and HDPCs seeded in the scaffold showed good cell growth. Cell seeding at a high concentration in the scaffold better promoted the adhesion of HDPCs and resulted in a greater cell number on the scaffold surface compared with low-concentration cell seeding after a 5-day culture (P<0.05).\nGelatin<alginate hydrogel scaffolds prepared by 3D bioprinting has a good biocompatibility and promotes the proliferation of HDPCs, and can be used as a scaffold material for tooth regeneration.

Many techniques are used in conjunction with surgical intervention and are a necessary compliment to orthognathic surgery. Basic knowledge of these practices will aid in the surgeon's ability to adequately treat the patient.\nMany orthodontists and surgeons are eliminating presurgical orthodontics to adopt a strategy of 'surgery first' orthodontics in orthognathic surgery. This has the benefit of immediate improvement in facial aesthetics and shorter treatment times. The advent of virtual surgical planning has helped facilitate the development of this new paradigm by making surgical planning faster and easier. Furthermore, using intraoperative surgical navigation is improving overall precision and outcomes.\nA variety of surgical and nonsurgical treatments may be employed in the treatment of malocclusion. It is important to be familiar with all options available and tailor the patient's treatment plan accordingly.

However, it generates limited three-dimensional structures of relevant physiological thicknesses. 3D printing allows digitally controlled fabrication of three-dimensional single/multimaterial constructs with precisely ordered fiber and pore architecture in a single build. However, this approach generally lacks the ability to achieve submicron resolution features to mimic native tissue. The goal of this study was to fabricate and evaluate 3D printed, electrospun, and combination of 3D printed/electrospun scaffolds to mimic the native architecture of heterogeneous tissue. We assessed their ability to support viability and proliferation of human adipose derived stem cells (hASC). Cells had increased proliferation and high viability over 21 days on all scaffolds. We further tested implantation of stacked-electrospun scaffold versus combined electrospun/3D scaffold on a cadaveric pig knee model and found that stacked-electrospun scaffold easily delaminated during implantation while the combined scaffold was easier to implant.

A gel phantom was used to measure the dose distribution of a clinical case of intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed for dose readouts. The measured dose volumes were compared with the planned dose volume. The relative volume histograms showed that relative volumes with a negative percent dose difference decreased as time elapsed. Furthermore, the histograms revealed few changes after 24h postirradiation. For the 3%/3mm and 2%/2mm criteria, the pass rates of the 12- and 24-h dose volumes were higher than 95%, respectively.

{"title": "Evaluation of 3D Additively Manufactured Canine Brain Models for Teaching Veterinary Neuroanatomy.", "abstract": "Physical specimens are essential to the teaching of veterinary anatomy. While fresh and fixed cadavers have long been the medium of choice, plastinated specimens have gained widespread acceptance as adjuncts to dissection materials. Even though the plastination process increases the durability of specimens, these are still derived from animal tissues and require periodic replacement if used by students on a regular basis. This study investigated the use of three-dimensional additively manufactured (3D AM) models (colloquially referred to as 3D-printed models) of the canine brain as a replacement for plastinated or formalin-fixed brains. The models investigated were built based on a micro-MRI of a single canine brain and have numerous practical advantages, such as durability, lower cost over time, and reduction of animal use. The effectiveness of the models was assessed by comparing performance among students who were instructed using either plastinated brains or 3D AM models. This study used propensity score matching to generate similar pairs of students. Pairings were based on gender and initial anatomy performance across two consecutive classes of first-year veterinary students. Students' performance on a practical neuroanatomy exam was compared, and no significant differences were found in scores based on the type of material (3D AM models or plastinated specimens) used for instruction. Students in both groups were equally able to identify neuroanatomical structures on cadaveric material, as well as respond to questions involving application of neuroanatomy knowledge. Therefore, we postulate that 3D AM canine brain models are an acceptable alternative to plastinated specimens in teaching veterinary neuroanatomy.", "journal": "Journal of veterinary medical education", "date": "2017-05-24", "authors": ["Regina MSchoenfeld-Tacher", "Timothy JHorn", "Tyler AScheviak", "Kenneth DRoyal", "Lola CHudson"], "doi": "10.3138/jvme.0416-080R"}

The objective of this study is to develop a novel Laponite nanoclay-enabled \"printing-then-solidification\" additive manufacturing approach to extrude complex three-dimensional (3D) structures made of various liquid build materials. Laponite, a member of the smectite mineral family, is investigated to serve as a yield-stress support bath material for the extrusion printing of liquid build materials. Using the printing-then-solidification approach, the printed structure remains liquid and retains its shape with the help of the Laponite support bath. Then the completed liquid structures are solidified in situ by applying suitable cross-linking mechanisms. Finally, the solidified structures are harvested from the Laponite nanoclay support bath for any further processing as needed. Due to its chemical and physical stability, liquid build materials with different solidification/curing/gelation mechanisms can be fabricated in the Laponite bath using the printing-then-solidification approach. The feasibility of the proposed Laponite-enabled printing-then-solidification approach is demonstrated by fabricating several complicated structures made of various liquid build materials, including alginate with ionic cross-linking, gelatin with thermal cross-linking, and SU-8 with photo-cross-linking. During gelatin structure printing, living cells are included and the postfabrication cell viability is above 90%.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-05-24", "authors": ["YifeiJin", "AshleyCompaan", "WenxuanChai", "YongHuang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b02398"}

Articles deemed suitable were analyzed and data on the 3D-printed models-including both technical properties and desirable application-and their impact on clinical proceedings were extracted.\nFourteen articles, presenting unique utilizations of 3D models, were found suitable for data analysis. A great majority of articles (93%) discussed models used for preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. PolyJet was the most common (43%) and, at the same time, most expensive 3D printing technology used in the development process. Many authors of reviewed articles reported that models were accurate (71%) and allowed them to understand patient's complex anatomy and its spatial relationships.\nAlthough the technology is still in its early stages, presented models are considered useful in preoperative planning and patient and student education.

{"title": "Reproducible 3D printed head tanks for electrical impedance tomography with realistic shape and conductivity distribution.", "abstract": "Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has many promising applications in brain injury monitoring. To evaluate both instrumentation and reconstruction algorithms, experiments are first performed in head tanks. Existing methods, whilst accurate, produce a discontinuous conductivity, and are often made by hand, making it hard for other researchers to replicate.\nWe have developed a method for constructing head tanks directly in a 3D printer. Conductivity was controlled through perforations in the skull surface, which allow for saline to pass through. Varying the diameter of the holes allowed for the conductivity to be controlled with 3% error for the target conductivity range. Taking CT and MRI segmentations as a basis, this method was employed to create an adult tank with a continuous conductivity distribution, and a neonatal tank with fontanelles.\nUsing 3D scanning a geometric accuracy of 0.21\u2009mm was recorded, equal to that of the precision of the 3D printer used. Differences of 6.1%\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u20096.4% (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u200911 in 4 tanks) compared to simulations were recorded in c. 800 boundary voltages. This may be attributed to the morphology of the skulls increasing tortuosity effects and hole misalignment. Despite significant differences in errors between three repetitions of the neonatal tank, images of a realistic perturbation could still be reconstructed with different tanks used for the baseline and perturbation datasets.\nThese phantoms can be reproduced by any researcher with access to a 'hobbyist' 3D printer in a matter of days.

{"title": "Fabrication of biomimetic bone grafts with multi-material 3D printing.", "abstract": "Extrusion deposition is a versatile method for the 3D printing of biomaterials such as hydrogels, ceramics, and suspensions. Recently, a new class of emulsion inks were developed that can be used to create tunable, hierarchically porous materials with a cure-on-dispense method. Propylene fumarate dimethacrylate (PFDMA) was selected to fabricate bone grafts using this technology due to its established biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, and good compressive properties. Scaffolds fabricated from PFDMA emulsion inks displayed compressive modulus and yield strength of approximately 15 and 1 MPa, respectively. A decrease in infill (from 100% to 70%) resulted in a six-fold increase in permeability; however, there was also a corollary decrease in mechanical properties. In order to generate scaffolds with increased permeability without sacrificing mechanical strength, a biomimetic approach to scaffold design was used to reinforce the highly porous emulsion inks with a dense cortical shell of thermoplastic polyester. Herein, we present an open source method for printing multi-material bone grafts based on PFDMA polyHIPEs with hierarchical porosity and reinforced with a dense shell of poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) or poly(lactic acid) (PLA). A multi-modal printing setup was first developed that combined paste extrusion and high temperature thermoplastic extrusion with high positional accuracy in dual deposition. Scaffolds printed with a PCL shell displayed compressive modulus and yield strength of approximately 30 and 3 MPa, respectively. Scaffolds printed with a PLA shell showed compressive modulus and yield strength of approximately 100 and 10 MPa, respectively. By combining this new paste extrusion of emulsion inks with traditional thermoplastic extrusion printing, we have created scaffolds with superior strength that promote cell viability and proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells.

The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of fibula remodelling using the three kinds of fibula cutting guides above in a simulation procedure in\u00a0vitro.\nCutting and reshaping of fibula analogs were guided by the three kinds of guides mentioned above. Then the fibula segments were glued together and scanned with CT, and finally the 3D accuracy of fibula reshaping was compared to the virtual plan.\nComparisons were made with regard to planned versus actual fibula segment length and angle projections in 3 planes.

{"title": "Development and validation of a physical model to investigate the biomechanics of infant head impact.", "abstract": "Head injury in childhood is the single most common cause of death or permanent disability from injury. However, despite its frequency and significance, there is little understanding of the response of a child's head to injurious loading. This is a significant limitation when making early diagnoses, informing clinical and/or forensic management or injury prevention strategies. With respect to impact vulnerability, current understanding is predominantly based on a few post-mortem-human-surrogate (PMHS) experiments. Researchers, out of experimental necessity, typically derive acceleration data, currently an established measure for head impact vulnerability, by calculation. Impact force is divided by the head mass, to produce a \"global approximation\", a single-generalised head response acceleration value. A need exists for a new experimental methodology, which can provide specific regional or localised response data. A surrogate infant head, was created from high resolution computer tomography scans with properties closely matched to tissue response data and validated against PMHS head impact acceleration data. The skull was 3D-printed from co-polymer materials. The brain, represented as a lumped mass, comprised of an injected gelatin/water mix. High-Speed Digital-Image-Correlation optically measured linear and angular velocities and accelerations, strains and strain rates. The \"global approximation\" was challenged by comparison with regional and local acceleration data. During impacts, perpendicular (at 90\u00b0) to a surface, regional and local accelerations were up to three times greater than the concomitant \"global\" accelerations. Differential acceleration patterns were very sensitive to impact location. Suture and fontanelle regions demonstrated ten times more strain (103%/s) than bone, resulting in skull deformations similar in magnitude to those observed during child birth, but at much higher rates. Surprisingly, perpendicular impacts produced significantly greater rotational velocities and accelerations, which are closer to current published injury thresholds than expected, seemingly as a result of deformational changes to the complex skull geometry. The methodology has proven a significant new step in characterising and understanding infant head injury mechanics.", "journal": "Forensic science international", "date": "2017-05-20", "authors": ["MJones", "DDarwall", "GKhalid", "RPrabhu", "AKemp", "Owen JArthurs", "PTheobald"], "doi": "10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.03.025"}

{"title": "Three-Dimensional Printing: Custom-Made Implants for Craniomaxillofacial Reconstructive Surgery.", "abstract": "Craniomaxillofacial reconstructive surgery is a challenging field. First it aims to restore primary functions and second to preserve craniofacial anatomical features like symmetry and harmony. Three-dimensional (3D) printed biomodels have been widely adopted in medical fields by providing tactile feedback and a superior appreciation of visuospatial relationship between anatomical structures. Craniomaxillofacial reconstructive surgery was one of the first areas to implement 3D printing technology in their practice. Biomodeling has been used in craniofacial reconstruction of traumatic injuries, congenital disorders, tumor removal, iatrogenic injuries (e.g., decompressive craniectomies), orthognathic surgery, and implantology. 3D printing has proven to improve and enable an optimization of preoperative planning, develop intraoperative guidance tools, reduce operative time, and significantly improve the biofunctional and the aesthetic outcome. This technology has also shown great potential in enriching the teaching of medical students and surgical residents.

In augmentation rhinoplasty, determining the ideal material and design method has been a critical issue for many years. Thus, these technologies are expected to make important contributions to augmentation rhinoplasty.\nWe sought to validate the feasibility of the 3D carving simulation and patient-specific implant fabrication system (3D carving system) in a clinical trial using reproducibility tests.\nPatient-specific implants were designed using a program developed in-house with preoperative computed tomography (CT). Negative molds of the implant were fabricated by a 3D printer and silicone was injected into these molds. Ten actual silicone implants were fabricated and compared with virtually designed implants. Seven patients underwent surgery and postoperative CT to confirm implant positioning.\nVirtually designed implants were produced into actual implants within 0.07 mm with a 0.17% \u00b1 0.11% difference. The percentage within the gap was the highest at the cephalic end of the implant and reduced from the cephalic to caudal end (most cephalic point: 100%; rightmost and leftmost point of the implant at the caudal end of the nasal bone: 57.1% and 71.4%, respectively; rightmost and leftmost point at the supratip break: 28.6% and 28.6%, respectively; and most caudal point: 0%).\nThe 3D carving system can facilitate rhinoplasty by enabling the more intuitive, rapid, and accurate fabrication of implants irrespective of surgeon experience level.\n4.", "journal": "Aesthetic surgery journal", "date": "2017-05-19", "authors": ["Yim DonChoi", "YoungjunKim", "EunSooPark"], "doi": "10.1093/asj/sjx046"}

{"title": "A Preclinical Assessment of Early Continuous Passive Motion and Treadmill Therapeutic Exercises for Generating Chondroprotective Effects After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture.", "abstract": "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a well-known risk factor for the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). However, whether using continuous passive motion (CPM) with or without additional treadmill exercise (TRE) in early ACL injury might provide chondroprotective effects and further decrease the risk of PTOA has yet to be determined.\nCPM may offer an enhanced chondroprotective effect, but TRE may attenuate that effect due to the mechanical stress on the joint and inflammatory cytokines in the joint.\nControlled laboratory study.\nThirty adult New Zealand White male rabbits were randomly allocated to sedentary (SED), CPM, TRE, or CPM+TRE groups. Each rabbit underwent an ACL transection (ACLT) on the right knee, with the contralateral knee used as an internal control (sham). The 4 joint surfaces (ie, medial and lateral femoral condyles and tibial plateaus) were evaluated 4 weeks after surgery for gross appearance, histological characteristics, and quantitative osteoarthritis (OA) scores.\nOverall, at the end of testing, the CPM group experienced the best protective therapeutic effects in all compartments. In gross appearance, CPM resulted in normal articular surfaces, while the TRE and SED groups exhibited surface abrasion. Histological analysis showed significant differences in articular cartilage status. The CPM group had significantly better histological OA scores ( P < .01), corresponding to the smoothest cartilage surface and sound chondrocyte and collagen arrangement. This group also showed abundant glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and a sound growth microenvironment, with significantly lower expression levels of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and the apoptotic marker caspase 3. In contrast, the TRE and SED groups showed several features of damage: distinct graded cartilage abrasion; damaged collagen fibers, corresponding to noticeable collagen type X (osteoarthritic cartilage); reduced cartilage thickness; fewer cartilaginous cells; and the appearance of chondrocyte clusters. These groups also showed loss of GAG, corresponding to higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of articular chondrocytes. Furthermore, the CPM+TRE group displayed visible pathological changes in the superficial cartilage, indicating that early loading exercise may contribute to osteoarthritis. The sham treatment showed no difference in the changes in all compartments between groups.\nImmediate CPM therapy produces a superior in situ microenvironment for reducing the occurrence of PTOA after ACL injury without reconstruction in rabbits.\nThese data suggest that immediate application of CPM therapy may be necessary to create a sound microenvironment in joints and possibly to decrease the risk of PTOA without or while awaiting ACL reconstruction. In contrast, both early active loading exercise and inactivity lead to the development of PTOA.", "journal": "The American journal of sports medicine", "date": "2017-05-19", "authors": ["Nai-JenChang", "Kuan-WeiLee", "Chih-JouChu", "Ming-YouShie", "Pei-HsiChou", "Chih-ChanLin", "Peir-InLiang"], "doi": "10.1177/0363546517704847"}

However, the use of a virtual, on-screen display limits the ability of these tomographic images to fully convey the anatomical information embedded within. One solution is to interface a biomedical imaging data set with 3D printing technology to generate a physical replica. Here we detail a complementary method to visualize tomographic imaging data with a hand-held model: Sub Surface Laser Engraving (SSLE) of crystal glass. SSLE offers several unique benefits including: the facile ability to include anatomical labels, as well as a scale bar; streamlined multipart assembly of complex structures in one medium; high resolution in the X, Y, and Z planes; and semi-transparent shells for visualization of internal anatomical substructures. Here we demonstrate the process of SSLE with CT data sets derived from pre-clinical and clinical sources.

Some of the polymers compatible with EHS are alginate, chitosan, and other similar natural polymers, which are subject to ionotropic or physical gelation. It is desirable to further extend the use of the EHS technique beyond such polymers for wider biofabrication applications. Here, building upon our previous work of making PEG microspheres via EHS, we utilized the principles of EHS to fabricate cell-laden polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel microspheres. The gelation of PEG hydrogel microspheres was achieved by forming covalent crosslinks between multiarm PEG acrylate and dithiol crosslinkers via Michael-type addition. We conducted a detailed investigation of the critical parameters of EHS, such as the applied voltage, inner needle diameter (i.d. needle), and flow rate, to obtain PEG microspheres with high cell viability and tightly-controlled diameters in the range of 70-300 \u03bcm. The polydispersity of cell-laden PEG hydrogel microspheres as measured by % coefficient of variation was between 6% and 23% for all conditions tested.

{"title": "Technical Note: System for evaluating local hypothermia as a radioprotector of the rectum in a small animal model.", "abstract": "The protective effects of induced or even accidental hypothermia on the human body are widespread with several medical uses currently under active research. In vitro experiments using human cell lines have shown hypothermia provides a radioprotective effect that becomes more pronounced at large, single-fraction doses common to stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatments. This work describes the development of a system to evaluate local hypothermia for a radioprotective effect of the rat rectum during a large dose of radiation relevant to prostate SBRT. This includes the evaluation of a 3D-printed small animal rectal cooling device and the integration with a small animal irradiator.\nA 3-cm long, dual-lumen rectal temperature control apparatus (RTCA) was designed in SOLIDWORKS CAD for 3D printing. The RTCA was capable of recirculating flow in a device small enough for insertion into the rat rectum, with a metal support rod for strength as well as visibility during radiation treatment planning. The outer walls of the RTCA comprised of thin heat shrink plastic, achieving efficient heat transfer into adjacent tissues. Following leak-proof testing, fiber optic temperature probes were used to evaluate the temperature over time when placed adjacent to the cooling device within the rat rectum. MRI thermometry characterized the relative temperature distribution in concentric ROIs surrounding the probe. Integration with an image-guided small animal irradiator and associated treatment planning system included evaluation for imaging artifacts and effect of brass tubing on dose calculation.\nThe rectal temperature adjacent to the cooling device decreased from body temperature to 15\u00b0C within 10-20\u00a0min from device insertion and was maintained at 15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00b0C during active cooling for the evaluated time of one hour. MR thermometry revealed a steep temperature gradient with increasing distance from the cooling device with the desired temperature range maintained within the surrounding few millimeters.\nA 3D-printed rectal cooling device was fabricated for the purpose of inducing local hypothermia in the rat rectum. The RTCA was simply integrated with an image-guided small animal irradiator and Monte Carlo-based treatment planning system to facilitate an in\u00a0vivo investigation of the radioprotective effect of hypothermia for late rectal toxicity following a single large dose of radiation.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2017-05-18", "authors": ["Brian AHrycushko", "ChenchenBing", "CecilFutch", "MichelleWodzak", "StrahinjaStojadinovic", "Paul MMedin", "RajivChopra"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.12353"}
{"title": "Transmission characteristics of a two dimensional antiscatter grid prototype for CBCT.", "abstract": "High fraction of scattered radiation in cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging degrades CT number accuracy and visualization of low contrast objects. To suppress scatter in CBCT projections, we developed a focused, two-dimensional antiscatter grid (2DASG) prototype. In this work, we report on the primary and scatter transmission characteristics of the 2DASG prototype aimed for linac mounted, offset detector geometry CBCT systems in radiation therapy, and compared its performance to a conventional one-dimensional ASG (1DASG).\nThe 2DASG is an array of through-holes separated by 0.1\u00a0mm septa that was fabricated from tungsten using additive manufacturing techniques. Through-holes' focusing geometry was designed for offset detector CBCT in Varian TrueBeam system. Two types of ASGs were evaluated: (a) a conventional 1DASG with a grid ratio of 10, (b) the 2DASG prototype with a grid ratio of 8.2. To assess the scatter suppression performance of both ASGs, Scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) and scatter transmission fraction (Ts) were measured using the beam stop method. Scatter and primary intensities were modulated by varying the phantom thickness between 10 and 40\u00a0cm. Additionally, the effect of air gap and bow tie (BT) filter on SPR and Ts were evaluated. Average primary transmission fraction (T\nIn comparison to 1DASG, 2DASG reduced SPRs by a factor of 3 to 6 across the range of phantom setups investigated. Ts values for 1D and 2DASGs were in the range of 21 to 29%, and 5 to 14% respectively. 2DASG continued to provide lower SPR and Ts at increased air gap and with BT filter. Tp of 1D and 2DASGs were 70.6% and 84.7% respectively. Due to the septal shadow of the 2DASG, its pixel specific primary transmission values varied between 32.5% and 99.1%. With respect to 1DASG, 2DASG provided up to factor of 1.7 more improvement in SNR across the SPR range investigated. Moreover, 2DASG provided improved visualization of low contrast objects with respect to 1DASG and NOASG setups.\nWhen compared to a conventional 1DASG, 2DASG prototype provided noticeably lower SPR and Ts values, indicating its superior scatter suppression performance. 2DASG also provided 19% higher average primary transmission that was attributed to the absence of interseptal spacers and optimized grid geometry.

The traditional routes of microgel synthesis produce materials that predominantly swell in aqueous solvents or, less often, in aggressive organic solvents, constraining ways that these exceptionally useful materials can be used. For example, aqueous microgels have been used as the foundation of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting applications, yet the incompatibility of available microgels with nonpolar liquids, such as oils, limits their use in 3D printing with oil-based materials, such as silicone. We present a method to make micro-organogels swollen in mineral oil, using block copolymer self-assembly. The rheological properties of this micro-organogel material can be tuned, leveraging the jamming transition to facilitate its use in 3D printing of silicone structures. We find that the minimum printed feature size can be controlled by the yield stress of the micro-organogel medium, enabling the fabrication of numerous complex silicone structures, including branched perfusable networks and functional fluid pumps.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2017-05-17", "authors": ["Christopher SO'Bryan", "TapomoyBhattacharjee", "SamuelHart", "Christopher PKabb", "Kyle DSchulze", "IndrasenaChilakala", "Brent SSumerlin", "W GregorySawyer", "Thomas EAngelini"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.1602800"}

Current methods of fabricating origami structures still have several limitations, such as complex material systems or tedious processing steps. We present a simple approach for creating three-dimensional (3D) origami structures by the frontal photopolymerization method, which can be easily implemented by using a commercial projector. The concept of our method is based on the volume shrinkage during photopolymerization. By adding photoabsorbers into the polymer resin, an attenuated light field is created and leads to a nonuniform curing along the thickness direction. The layer directly exposed to light cures faster than the next layer; this nonuniform curing degree leads to nonuniform curing-induced volume shrinkage. This further introduces a nonuniform stress field, which drives the film to bend toward the newly formed side. The degree of bending can be controlled by adjusting the gray scale and the irradiation time, an easy approach for creating origami structures. The behavior is examined both experimentally and theoretically. Two methods are also proposed to create different types of 3D origami structures.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2017-05-17", "authors": ["ZeangZhao", "JiangtaoWu", "XiaomingMu", "HaosenChen", "H JerryQi", "DainingFang"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.1602326"}

The applications of these fibers, however, have been limited because of the hazardous solvents used to make them, difficulties in controlling the pore sizes of their membrane forms, and downscaling the size of the fiber. Nevertheless, extending the use of these fibers, for example in the production of a free-standing porous membrane appropriate for cell-based research, is highly needed for tissue engineering, organ-on-a-chip, and drug delivery research and applications. Here, we fabricated a free-standing porous membrane by using a novel method that involved simultaneously spinning multiple strands of submicron-thick 'noodle-like' fibers. In addition to the novelty of the single noodle fiber in overcoming the size-reducing limitations of conventional microfluidic spinning methods, these fibers can hence form the units of 'noodle membranes' whose pores have sizes that the convention electrospinning method cannot achieve. We confirmed the potential of the noodle membrane to serve as a free-standing porous membrane in two simple experiments. Also, we found that noodle membranes have an advantage in loading different amounts of different materials in itself that it was also shown to be of use as a new type of scaffold for complex tissue regeneration.

Hot melt extrusion was used to generate paracetamol-loaded filaments from three different grades of the pharmaceutical excipient hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), grades LG, MG and HG. One-step 3DP was used to process these filaments into enteric printlets incorporating up to 50% drug loading with two different infill percentages (20 and 100%). X-ray Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) analysis revealed that printlets with 20% infill had cavities in the core compared to 100% infill, and that the density of the 50% drug loading printlets was higher than the equivalent formulations loaded with 5% drug. In biorelevant bicarbonate dissolution media, drug release from the printlets was dependent on the polymer composition, drug loading and the internal structure of the formulations. All HPMCAS-based printlets showed delayed drug release properties, and in the intestinal conditions, drug release was faster from the printlets prepared with polymers with a lower pH-threshold: HPMCAS LG > HPMCAS MG > HPMCAS HG.

With the help of a template supported by osteosynthesis screws, which had already been inserted during the augmentation procedure, the plan was applied to the patient.

{"title": "3D bioprinting for drug discovery and development in pharmaceutics.", "abstract": "Successful launch of a commercial drug requires significant investment of time and financial resources wherein late-stage failures become a reason for catastrophic failures in drug discovery. This calls for infusing constant innovations in technologies, which can give reliable prediction of efficacy, and more importantly, toxicology of the compound early in the drug discovery process before clinical trials. Though computational advances have resulted in more rationale in silico designing, in vitro experimental studies still require gaining industry confidence and improving in vitro-in vivo correlations. In this quest, due to their ability to mimic the spatial and chemical attributes of native tissues, three-dimensional (3D) tissue models have now proven to provide better results for drug screening compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) models. However, in vitro fabrication of living tissues has remained a bottleneck in realizing the full potential of 3D models. Recent advances in bioprinting provide a valuable tool to fabricate biomimetic constructs, which can be applied in different stages of drug discovery research. This paper presents the first comprehensive review of bioprinting techniques applied for fabrication of 3D tissue models for pharmaceutical studies. A comparative evaluation of different bioprinting modalities is performed to assess the performance and ability of fabricating 3D tissue models for pharmaceutical use as the critical selection of bioprinting modalities indeed plays a crucial role in efficacy and toxicology testing of drugs and accelerates the drug development cycle. In addition, limitations with current tissue models are discussed thoroughly and future prospects of the role of bioprinting in pharmaceutics are provided to the reader.\nPresent advances in tissue biofabrication have crucial role to play in aiding the pharmaceutical development process achieve its objectives. Advent of three-dimensional (3D) models, in particular, is viewed with immense interest by the community due to their ability to mimic in vivo hierarchical tissue architecture and heterogeneous composition. Successful realization of 3D models will not only provide greater in vitro-in vivo correlation compared to the two-dimensional (2D) models, but also eventually replace pre-clinical animal testing, which has their own shortcomings. Amongst all fabrication techniques, bioprinting- comprising all the different modalities (extrusion-, droplet- and laser-based bioprinting), is emerging as the most viable fabrication technique to create the biomimetic tissue constructs. Notwithstanding the interest in bioprinting by the pharmaceutical development researchers, it can be seen that there is a limited availability of comparative literature which can guide the proper selection of bioprinting processes and associated considerations, such as the bioink selection for a particular pharmaceutical study. Thus, this work emphasizes these aspects of bioprinting and presents them in perspective of differential requirements of different pharmaceutical studies like in vitro predictive toxicology, high-throughput screening, drug delivery and tissue-specific efficacies. Moreover, since bioprinting techniques are mostly applied in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, a comparative analysis of similarities and differences are also expounded to help researchers make informed decisions based on contemporary literature.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2017-05-16", "authors": ["WeijiePeng", "PallabDatta", "BugraAyan", "VeliOzbolat", "DonnaSosnoski", "Ibrahim TOzbolat"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2017.05.025"}

Despite being a relatively simple technique, electrospinning is strongly influenced by polymer solution characteristics, processing parameters and environmental conditions, which strongly determine the production of fibers and their morphology.

We have recently shown that Laser Assisted Bioprinting (LAB), due to its unprecedented cell printing resolution and precision, is an attractive tool for the in situ printing of a bone substitute.

{"title": "Clinical applications of 3-dimensional printing in radiation therapy.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing is suitable for the fabrication of complex radiotherapy bolus. Although investigated from dosimetric and feasibility standpoints, there are few reports to date of its use for actual patient treatment. This study illustrates the versatile applications of 3D printing in clinical radiation oncology through a selection of patient cases, namely, to create bolus for photon and modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT), as well as applicators for surface high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Photon boluses were 3D-printed to treat a recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nasal septum and a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the posterior pinna. For a patient with a mycosis fungoides involving the upper face, a 3D-printed MERT bolus was used. To treat an SCC of the nose, a 3D-printed applicator for surface brachytherapy was made. The structures' fit to the anatomy and the radiotherapy treatment plans were assessed. Based on the treatment planning computed tomography (CT), the size of the largest air gap at the interface of the 3D-printed structure was 3\u2009mm for the SCC of the nasal septum, 3\u2009mm for the BCC of the pinna, 2\u2009mm for the mycosis fungoides of the face, and 2\u2009mm for the SCC of the nose. Acceptable treatment plans were obtained for the SCC of the nasal septum (95% isodose to 99.8% of planning target volume [PTV]), the BCC of the pinna (95% isodose to 97.7% of PTV), and the mycosis fungoides of the face (90% isodose to 92.5% of PTV). For the latter, compared with a plan with a uniform thickness bolus, the one featuring the MERT bolus achieved relative sparing of all the organs at risk (OARs) distal to the target volume, while maintaining similar target volume coverage. The surface brachytherapy plan for the SCC of the nose had adequate coverage (95% isodose to 95.6% of clinical target volume [CTV]), but a relatively high dose to the left eye, owing to its proximity to the tumor. 3D printing can be implemented effectively in the clinical setting to create highly conformal bolus for photon and MERT, as well as applicators for surface brachytherapy.", "journal": "Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists", "date": "2017-05-13", "authors": ["YizhouZhao", "KathrynMoran", "MammoYewondwossen", "JamesAllan", "ScottClarke", "MuraliRajaraman", "DerekWilke", "PaulJoseph", "James LRobar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.meddos.2017.03.001"}

However, bolus fabrication based on computed tomography (CT) scans is complicated and also delivers unwanted irradiation. Consequently, we fabricated a bolus using a 3D scanner and evaluated its efficacy. The head of an Alderson Rando phantom was scanned with a 3D scanner. The 3D surface data were exported and reconstructed with Geomagic Design X software. A 3D bolus of 5-mm thickness designed to fit onto the nose was printed with the use of rubber-like printing material, and a radiotherapy plan was developed. We successfully fabricated the customized 3D bolus, and further, a CT simulation indicated an acceptable fit of the 3D bolus to the nose. There was no air gap between the bolus and the phantom surface. The percent depth dose (PDD) curve of the phantom with the 3D bolus showed an enhanced surface dose when compared with that of the phantom without the bolus. The PDD of the 3D bolus was comparable with that of a commercial superflab bolus. The radiotherapy plan considering the 3D bolus showed improved target coverage when compared with that without the bolus.

{"title": "Importance of endogenous extracellular matrix in biomechanical properties of human skin model.", "abstract": "The physical and mechanical properties of cells modulate their behavior such proliferation rate, migration and extracellular matrix remodeling. In order to study cell behavior in a tissue-like environment in vitro, it is of utmost importance to develop biologically and physically relevant 3D cell models. Here, we characterized the physical properties of a single cell type growing in configurations of increasing complexity. From one human skin biopsy, primary dermal fibroblasts were isolated and seeded to give monolayer (2D model), spheroid (3D model poor in extracellular matrix) and tissue-engineered cell sheet (3D model rich in endogenous extracellular matrix). Living native human dermis tissue was used as a gold standard. Nanomechanical and viscoelastic properties at the cell scale were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) while biphoton microscopy allowed collagen detection by second harmonic generation and scanning electron microscopy helped in model morphological characterization. In all models, fibroblasts presented a similar typical elongated cell shape, with a cytoskeleton well-arranged along the long axis of the cell. However, elastic moduli of the tissue-engineered cell sheet and native dermis tissue were similar and statistically lower than monolayer and spheroid models. We successfully carried out AFM force measurements on 3D models such as spheroids and tissue-engineered cell sheets, as well as on living native human tissue. We demonstrated that a tissue-engineered dermal model recapitulates the mechanical properties of human native dermal tissue unlike the classically used monolayer and spheroid models.

{"title": "Creating Three-dimensional Printed Models of Acetabular Fractures for Use as Educational Tools.", "abstract": "Acetabular fractures are frequently encountered in some clinical practices, and the precise classification of these fractures greatly influences treatments and outcomes. The authors identified the need for an educational aid when teaching acetabular fracture classifications, given the complex spatial anatomy and the nonintuitive classification system that is commonly used. Three-dimensional ( 3D three-dimensional ) printing is an evolving technique that has applications as an educational aid, providing the student with a tangible object to interact with and learn from. In this article, the authors review their experience creating 3D three-dimensional printed models of the hip for educational purposes. Their goal was to create 3D three-dimensional printed models for use as educational aids when teaching acetabular fracture classifications. Complex cases involving a combination of fracture types, subtle nondisplaced fractures, and/or fractures with associated osteopenia or artifacts were excluded. The selected computed tomographic (CT) scans were loaded into a medical 3D three-dimensional volume-rendering program, and a 3D three-dimensional volumetric model was created. Standard Tessellation Language ( STL Standard Tessellation Language ) files were then exported to STL Standard Tessellation Language model-editing software and edited to retain only the involved hemipelvis. In some cases, the proximal femur and ipsilateral hemisacrum may be included to emphasize hip alignment or disruption of the force transfer. Displaced fracture fragments can be printed as separate segments or a single unit after the addition of struts. Printing was performed by using an additive manufacturing principle, with approximately 36-48 hours needed for printing, postprocessing, and drying. The cost to print a 1:1 scale model was approximately $100-$200, depending on the amount of plastic material used. These models can then be painted according to the two-column theory regarding acetabular fractures.

Skeletal muscle bioactuators are developed to power these bio-bots, and an approach is presented to make them dynamically responsive to changing environmental loads and robustly resilient to induced damage. Specifically, since the predominant cause of skeletal muscle loss of function is mechanical damage, the underlying mechanisms of damage are investigated in vitro, and an in vivo inspired healing strategy is developed to counteract this damage. The protocol that is developed yields complete recovery of healthy tissue functionality within two days of damage, setting the stage for a more robust, resilient, and adaptive bioactuator technology than previously demonstrated.

Finally, chemical gradients were created in 3D printed scaffolds with controlled geometry and porosity. The combination of additive manufacturing and surface modification is a viable tool for the fabrication of 3D constructs with controlled structural and chemical gradients. These constructs can be employed for mimicking continuous tissue gradients for interface tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2017-05-10", "authors": ["UgoD'Amora", "MatteoD'Este", "DavidEglin", "FatemehSafari", "Christoph MSprecher", "AntonioGloria", "RobertoDe Santis", "MauroAlini", "LuigiAmbrosio"], "doi": "10.1002/term.2457"}

In this article, we show how the basic principles of this methodology can be exploited for in vitro cell cultures-often referred to as organ-on-a-chip devices. Due to the key role of the biological cells, we have introduced the term bio-mechatronic design, to highlight the complexity of designing a system that should integrate biology, mechanics and electronics in the same device structure. The strength of the mechatronic design is to match the needs of the potential users to a systematic evaluation of overall functional design alternative. It may be especially attractive for organs-on-chips where biological constituents such as cells and tissues in 3D settings and in a fluidic environment should be compared, screened and selected. Through this approach, design solutions ranked to customer needs are generated according to specified criteria, thereby defining the key constraints of the fabrication. As an example, the bio-mechatronic methodology is applied to a liver-on-a-chip based on information extrapolated from previous theoretical and experimental knowledge.

{"title": "A preliminary investigation into the design of pressure cushions and their potential applications for forearm robotic orthoses.", "abstract": "Load cells are often used in rehabilitation robotics to monitor human-robot interaction. While load cells are accurate and suitable for the stationary end-point robots used in rehabilitation hospitals, their cost and inability to conform to the shape of the body hinder their application in developing affordable and wearable robotic orthoses for assisting individuals in the activities of daily living. This exploratory work investigates the possibility of using an alternative technology, namely compliant polymeric air cushions, to measure interaction forces between the user and a wearable rigid structure.\nA polymeric air cushion was designed, analyzed using a finite element model (FEM), and tested using a bench-top characterization system. The cushions underwent repeatability testing, and signal delay testing from a step response while increasing the length of the cushion's tubes. Subsequently, a 3D printed wrist brace prototype was integrated with six polymeric air cushions and tested in static conditions where a volunteer exerted isometric pronation/supination torque and forces in vertical and horizontal directions. The load measured by integrating data recorded by the six sensors was compared with force data measured by a high quality load cell and torque sensor.\nThe FEM and experimental data comparison was within the error bounds of the external differential pressure sensor used to monitor the pressure inside the cushion. The ratio obtained experimentally between the pressure inside the pressure cushion and the 8\u00a0N applied load deviated by only 1.28% from the FEM. A drift smaller than 1% was observed over 10 cycles. The rise times of the cushion under an 8\u00a0N step response for a 0.46, 1.03, and 2.02\u00a0m length tube was 0.45, 0.39, and 0.37\u00a0s. Tests with the wrist brace showed a moderate root mean square error (RMSE) between the force estimated by the pressure cushions and the external load cells. Specifically, the RMSE was 13\u00a0mNm, 500\u00a0mN, and 1.24\u00a0N for forearm pronation/supination torque, vertical force, and horizontal force, respectively.\nThe use of compliant pressure cushions was shown to be promising for monitoring interaction forces between the forearm and a rigid brace.

On the other hand, bio-functional surfaces on metallic biomaterials such as titanium and its alloys are necessary to enhance the biological interactions with the host tissue. This study discusses the effect of plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), as a surface modification technique to produce bio-functional layers, on the mechanical properties of additively manufactured Ti6Al4V scaffolds based on the cubic unit cell. For this purpose, the PEO process with two different oxidation times was applied on scaffolds with four different values of relative density. The effects of the PEO process were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), optical microscopy as well as static and dynamic (fatigue) mechanical testing under compression. SEM results indicated pore formation on the surface of the scaffolds after oxidation with a thickness of 4.85\u00b10.36\u03bcm of the oxide layer after 2min and 9.04\u00b12.27\u03bcm after 5min oxidation (based on optical images). The static test results showed the high effect of relative density of porous structure on its mechanical properties. However, oxidation did not influence most of the mechanical properties such as maximum stress, yield stress, plateau stress, and energy absorption, although its effect on the elastic modulus was considerable.

Unlike conventional methods of making cellular scaffolds, three-dimensional (3D) printing or additive manufacturing opens up new possibilities to fabricate those customisable intricate designs with highly interconnected pores. In the past decade, metallic powder-bed based 3D printing methods emerged and the techniques are becoming increasingly mature recently, where selective laser melting (SLM) and selective electron beam melting (SEBM) are the two representatives. Due to the advantages of good dimensional accuracy, high build resolution, clean build environment, saving materials, high customisability, etc., SLM and SEBM show huge potential in direct customisable manufacturing of metallic cellular scaffolds for orthopaedic implants. Ti-6Al-4V to date is still considered to be the optimal materials for producing orthopaedic implants due to its best combination of biocompatibility, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties.

However, a substantial laser intensity is required to generate sufficient optical gradient forces to move a small object in a certain direction, causing limited throughput for applications. A high-throughput light-directed assembly is demonstrated as a printing technology by introducing gold nanorods to induce thermal convection flows that move microparticles (diameter = 40 \u00b5m to several hundreds of micrometers) to specific light-guided locations, forming desired patterns. With the advantage of effective light-directed assembly, the microfluidic-fabricated monodispersed biocompatible microparticles are used as building blocks to construct a structured assembly (\u224810 cm scale) in \u22482 min. The control with microscale precision is approached by changing the size of the laser light spot. After crosslinking assembly of building blocks, a novel soft material with wanted pattern is approached. To demonstrate its application, the mesenchymal stem-cell-seeded hydrogel microparticles are prepared as functional building blocks to construct scaffold-free tissues with desired structures.

{"title": "3D printed liner for treatment of periprosthetic joint infections.", "abstract": "In the United States, long standing deep infections of joint arthroplasty, such as total knee and total hip replacements, are treated with two-stage exchange. This requires the removal of the prior implant, placement of an antibiotic eluting spacer block made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), followed by re-implantation of a new implant after treatment with intravenous antibiotics for six to eight weeks. Unfortunately, the use of PMMA as a spacer material has limitations in terms of mechanical and drug-eluting properties. PMMA is brittle and elutes most of the antibiotics within the first few days. Furthermore, the polymerization reaction for PMMA is highly exothermic, thereby limiting the use to heat-stable antibiotics. We hypothesize that the use of a 3D printed polymeric liner made of polylactic acid (PLA) would overcome the limitations of PMMA because it is a stronger and a less brittle material than PMMA. Furthermore, the liner can also act as a controlled drug delivery vehicle by using built in reservoirs and a network of micro-channels as well as by incorporating antibiotics directly into the polymer during manufacturing stage.

However, ADMSC exhibit the tendency to undergo hypertrophic differentiation, rather than forming permanent hyaline cartilage phenotype changes. This may hinder their implementation in articular cartilage regeneration, but may allow the possibility for bone and bone to soft tissue interface repair. In this study, we examined the effects of hydroxyapatite (HAp) on the chondrogenesis and hypertrophy of ADMSC within bioprinted hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels. We found that a small amount of HAp (\u223c10% of polymer concentration) promoted both chondrogenic and hypertrophic differentiation of ADMSC. Increased HAp contents promoted hypertrophic conversion and early osteogenic differentiation of encapsulated ADMSC. Subsequently, ADMSC-laden, stratified constructs with nonmineralized and mineralized layers (i.e., HA based and HA-HAp based) were 3D bioprinted. The constructs were conditioned in chondrogenic medium in either a normoxic or hypoxic environment for 8 weeks to assess the effects of oxygen tension on ADMSC differentiation and interface integration. We further implanted the bioprinted constructs subcutaneously into nude mice for 4 weeks. It was found that hypoxia partially inhibited hypertrophic differentiation by significantly down-regulating the expression of COL10A1, ALP, and MMP13. In addition, hypoxia also suppressed spontaneous calcification of ADMSC and promoted interface integration. This study demonstrates that both HAp content and hypoxia are important to mediate chondrogenesis, hypertrophy, and endochondral ossification of ADMSC.

METHODS Forty-four patients (19 males and 25 females; mean age 36.5 \u00b1 9.2 years, range 11-62 years; symptom duration 1 month-15 years) with a CVJ abnormality who were admitted to the authors' institution between April 2010 and April 2015 were retrospectively studied. The individualized 3D printed model of the CVJ was produced based on the individual CT data by use of 3D printing technology. The posterior internal fixation was simulated on the model to obtain data for individual patients, which were then used for intraoperative assistance. One-stage posterior decompression combined with internal fixation was performed. The results were evaluated using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale, atlanto-dens interval (ADI), and cervicomedullary angle (CMA). The patients underwent follow-up and outcomes were evaluated using CT, MRI, and the JOA scale score. The comparison between preoperative and postoperative JOA scale scores was done using a paired t-test. RESULTS Thirty-eight individualized 3D printed models were successfully built. The 38 patients underwent successful posterior internal fixation performed with the assistance of 3D printed models. In the 6 patients without an individualized printed model (i.e., the patients who underwent surgery before 3D printed modeling was available at the authors' institution), the pedicle screw was inserted incorrectly into the transverse foramen in 2 patients and inserted incorrectly into the vertebral canal in 1 patient. All patients were observed for a mean of 26 months (range 3-52 months). The postoperative JOA scale scores for all patients significantly improved from the preoperative scores. Among the 41 patients treated with atlantoaxial distraction reduction, postoperative MRI and CT showed complete reduction in 31 patients and incomplete reduction in 10 patients (reduction rate > 50%). The postoperative ADI significantly decreased, and the CMA significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS Individualized 3D printed model-assisted posterior internal fixation seems feasible and effective in optimizing the treatment of CVJ abnormalities. In addition, it offers many advantages, including preoperative simulation, intraoperatve guidance, and intraoperative error minimization.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

Here, a multimaterial, multiscale, and multifunctional 3D printing approach is employed to fabricate 3D tactile sensors under ambient conditions conformally onto freeform surfaces.

{"title": "Homogenous scaffold-based cranial/skull implant modelling and structural analysis-unit cell algorithm-meshless approach.", "abstract": "This computational study explores a unique modelling approach of the cranial implant, homogenous scaffold algorithm and meshless method, respectively. This meshless method is employed to review the implant underneath intracranial pressure (ICP) conditions with a standard ICP range of 7\u00a0mm of Hg to 15\u00a0mm of Hg. The algorithm is used to introduce uniform porosity within the implant enabling the implant behaviour with respect to ICP conditions. However, increase in the porosity leads to variation in deformation and equivalent stress, respectively. The meshless approach provides a valuable insight in order to know the effect of total deformation and equivalent stress (von Mises stress) and replaces the standard meshing strategies. The patient CT data (computed tomography) is processed in MIMICS software to get the mesh model. An entirely unique modelling approach is developed to model the cranial implant with the assistance of the Rhinoceros software. This modelling methodology is the easiest one and addressing both the symmetrical and asymmetrical defects. The implant is embedded in a unit cell-based porous structure with the help of an algorithm, and this algorithm is simple to manage the consistency in porosity and pore size of the scaffold. Totally six types of implants are modelled with variation in porosity and replicate the original cranial bone. Among six implants, Type 2 (porosity 82.62%) and Type 5 (porosity 45.73%) implants are analysed with the meshless approach under ICP. The total deformation and equivalent stress (von Mises stress) of porous implants are compared with the solid implant under same ICP conditions. Consequently, distinctive materials are used for structural analysis such as titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) and polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK), respectively. The deformation and equivalent stress (von Mises stress) results are obtained through the structural analysis. It was observed from the results that the titanium-based solid implant is the best implant in all aspects, while considering weight and osseointegration PEEK-based Type 5 implant is the best one. A novel free-form closed curve network (FCN) technique is successfully developed to model a cranial implant for symmetrical and asymmetrical defects. The porous implant is adequately modelled through the unit cell algorithm and analysed through meshless approach.

The developed 3D-printed spine QA phantom consisted of an acrylic body phantom and a 3D-printed spine shaped object. DLP and Polyjet 3D printers using a high-density acrylic polymer were employed to produce spine-shaped phantoms based on CT images. Image fusion was performed to evaluate the reproducibility of our phantom, and the Hounsfield units (HUs) were measured based on each CT image. Two different intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans based on both CT phantom image sets from the two printed spine-shaped phantoms with acrylic body phantoms were designed to deliver 16 Gy dose to the planning target volume (PTV) and were compared for target coverage and normal organ-sparing. Image fusion demonstrated good reproducibility of the developed phantom. The HU values of the DLP- and Polyjet-printed spine vertebrae differed by 54.3 on average. The PTV Dmax dose for the DLP-generated phantom was about 1.488 Gy higher than that for the Polyjet-generated phantom. The organs at risk received a lower dose for the 3D printed spine-shaped phantom image using the DLP technique than for the phantom image using the Polyjet technique. Despite using the same material for printing the spine-shaped phantom, these phantoms generated by different 3D printing techniques, DLP and Polyjet, showed different HU values and these differently appearing HU values according to the printing technique could be an extra consideration for developing the 3D printed spine-shaped phantom depending on the patient's age and the density of the spinal bone.

{"title": "Introducing biomimetic shear and ion gradients to microfluidic spinning improves silk fiber strength.", "abstract": "Silkworm silk is an attractive biopolymer for biomedical applications due to its high mechanical strength and biocompatibility; as a result, there is increasing interest in scalable devices to spin silk and recombinant silk so as to improve and customize their properties for diverse biomedical purposes (Vepari and Kaplan 2007 Prog. Polym. Sci. 32 ). While artificial spinning of regenerated silk fibroins adds tunability to properties such as degradation rate and surface functionalization, the resulting fibers do not yet approach the mechanical strength of native silkworm silk. These drawbacks reduce the applicability and attractiveness of artificial silk (Kinahan et al 2011 Biomacromolecules 12 ). Here, we used computational fluid dynamic simulations to incorporate shear in tandem with biomimetic ion gradients by coupling a modular novel glass microfluidic device to our previous co-axial flow device. Fibers spun with this combined apparatus demonstrated a significant increase in mechanical strength compared to fibers spun with the basic apparatus alone, with a three-fold increase in Young's modulus and extensibility and a twelve-fold increase in toughness. These results thus demonstrate the critical importance of ionic milieu and shear stress in spinning strong fibers from solubilized silk fibroin.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-05-05", "authors": ["DavidLi", "Matthew MJacobsen", "NaeGyune Rim", "DanielBackman", "David LKaplan", "Joyce YWong"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa711b"}

We first evaluated the 3D shaping ability of hydroxybutyl chitosan (HBC), a thermoresponsive polymer, by using a robotic dispensing 3D printer. HBC polymer could be laminated to a height of 1124\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u2009\u03bcm. Based on this result, we fabricated 3D gel frames of various shapes, such as square, triangular, rectangular, and circular, for shape control of 3D tissue and then normal human cardiac fibroblasts (NHCFs) coated with extracellular matrix nanofilms were seeded in the frames. Observation of shape-controlled tissues after 1 day of cultivation showed that the orientation of fibroblasts was in one direction when a short-sided, thin, rectangular-shaped frame was used. Next, we tried to fabricate orientation-controlled tissue with a vascular network by coculturing NHCF and normal human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. As a consequence of cultivation for 4 days, observation of cocultured tissue confirmed aligned cells and blood capillaries in orientation-controlled tissue. Our results clearly demonstrated that it would be possible to control the cell orientation by controlling the shape of the tissues by combining a cell accumulation technique and a 3D printing system. The results of this study suggest promising strategies for the fabrication of oriented 3D tissues in vitro.

{"title": "Self-Supporting Nanoclay as Internal Scaffold Material for Direct Printing of Soft Hydrogel Composite Structures in Air.", "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology enables the freeform fabrication of complex constructs from various hydrogels and is receiving increasing attention in tissue engineering. The objective of this study is to develop a novel self-supporting direct hydrogel printing approach to extrude complex 3D hydrogel composite structures in air without the help of a support bath. Laponite, a member of the smectite mineral family, is investigated to serve as an internal scaffold material for the direct printing of hydrogel composite structures in air. In the proposed printing approach, due to its yield-stress property, Laponite nanoclay can be easily extruded through a nozzle as a liquid and self-supported after extrusion as a solid. Its unique crystal structure with positive and negative charges enables it to be mixed with many chemically and physically cross-linked hydrogels, which makes it an ideal internal scaffold material for the fabrication of various hydrogel structures. By mixing Laponite nanoclay with various hydrogel precursors, the hydrogel composites retain their self-supporting capacity and can be printed into 3D structures directly in air and retain their shapes before cross-linking. Then, the whole structures are solidified in situ by applying suitable cross-linking stimuli. The addition of Laponite nanoclay can effectively improve the mechanical and biological properties of hydrogel composites. Specifically, the addition of Laponite nanoclay results in a significant increase in the Young's modulus of each hydrogel-Laponite composite: 1.9-fold increase for the poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA)-Laponite composite, 7.4-fold increase for the alginate-Laponite composite, and 3.3-fold increase for the gelatin-Laponite composite.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-05-04", "authors": ["YifeiJin", "ChengchengLiu", "WenxuanChai", "AshleyCompaan", "YongHuang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b03613"}

The photographs were exported and uploaded into Amira, for transformation into a digital (.stl) model, which was imported into Blender, an open source software platform for digital modification of data. The unaffected auricle as digitally isolated and inverted to render a model for the contralateral side. The depths of the scapha, triangular fossa, and cymba were deepened to accentuate their contours. Extra relief was added to the helical root to further distinguish this structure. The ear was then digitally deconstructed and separated into its individual auricular components for reconstruction. The completed ear and its individual components were 3D printed using polylactic acid filament and sterilized following manufacturer specifications.\nThe sterilized models were brought to the operating room to be utilized by the surgeon. The models allowed for more accurate anatomic measurements compared to 2D tracings, which reduced the degree of estimation required by surgeons. Approximately 20\u00a0g of the PLA filament were utilized for the construction of these models, yielding a total material cost of approximately $1.\nUsing the methodology detailed in this report, as well as departmentally available resources (3D digital photography and 3D printing), a sterilizable, patient-specific, and inexpensive 3D auricular model was fabricated to be used intraoperatively.

{"title": "Extrusion Bioprinting of Shear-Thinning Gelatin Methacryloyl Bioinks.", "abstract": "Bioprinting is an emerging technique for the fabrication of 3D cell-laden constructs. However, the progress for generating a 3D complex physiological microenvironment has been hampered by a lack of advanced cell-responsive bioinks that enable bioprinting with high structural fidelity, particularly in the case of extrusion-based bioprinting. Herein, this paper reports a novel strategy to directly bioprint cell-laden gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) constructs using bioinks of GelMA physical gels (GPGs) achieved through a simple cooling process. Attributed to their shear-thinning and self-healing properties, the GPG bioinks can retain the shape and form integral structures after deposition, allowing for subsequent UV crosslinking for permanent stabilization. This paper shows the structural fidelity by bioprinting various 3D structures that are typically challenging to fabricate using conventional bioinks under extrusion modes. Moreover, the use of the GPG bioinks enables direct bioprinting of highly porous and soft constructs at relatively low concentrations (down to 3%) of GelMA. It is also demonstrated that the bioprinted constructs not only permit cell survival but also enhance cell proliferation as well as spreading at lower concentrations of the GPG bioinks. It is believed that such a strategy of bioprinting will provide many opportunities in convenient fabrication of 3D cell-laden constructs for applications in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and pharmaceutical screening.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2017-05-04", "authors": ["WanjunLiu", "Marcel AHeinrich", "YixiaoZhou", "AliAkpek", "NingHu", "XiaoLiu", "XiaofeiGuan", "ZheZhong", "XiangyuJin", "AliKhademhosseini", "Yu ShrikeZhang"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201601451"}

To mimic the microenvironment, it is necessary that scaffolds effectively mimic the extracellular matrix of natural cartilage and subchondral bone. In this study, biomimetic osteochondral scaffolds containing an oriented cartilage layer, a compact layer, and a three-dimensional (3D)-printed core-sheath structured-bone layer were developed. The oriented cartilage layer was designed to mimic the structural and material characteristics of native cartilage tissue and was fabricated with cartilage matrix-chitosan materials, using thermal-induced phase-separation technology. The 3D-printed core-sheath structured-bone layer was fabricated with poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide)/\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate-collagen materials by low-temperature deposition technology, using a specially designed core-sheath nozzle, and was designed to mimic the mechanical characteristics of subchondral bone and improve scaffold hydrophilicity. The compact layer was designed to mimic the calcified-layer structure of natural cartilage to ensure the presence of different suitable microenvironments for the regeneration of bone and cartilage. A dissolving-bonding process was developed to effectively combine the three parts together, after which the bone and cartilage scaffolds exhibited good mechanical properties and hydrophilicity. Additionally, goat autologous bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated and then seeded into the bone and cartilage layers, respectively, and following a 1 week culture in vitro, the BMSC-scaffold constructs were implanted into a goat articular-defect model. Our results indicated that the scaffolds exhibited good biocompatibility, and 24 weeks after implantation, the femoral condyle surface was relatively flat and consisted of a large quantity of hyaloid cartilage. Furthermore, histological staining revealed regenerated trabecular bone formed in the subchondral bone-defect area.

To address this issue the expedient use of antimicrobial metals such as zinc, copper and silver were incorporated into an FDA-approved polymer (polycaprolactone - PCL) to produce filaments for 3D printing. These metals have broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, and moreover, copper and zinc can enhance the wound healing process. 3D scanning was used to construct 3D models of a nose and ear to provide the opportunity to customize shape and size of a wound dressing to an individual patient. Hot melt extrusion was used to extrude pellets obtained by vacuum-drying of solutions of PCL and the different metals in order to manufacture metal-homogeneously-loaded filaments. Wound dressings with different shapes were produced with the filaments containing different concentrations of metals. Release of the metals from the dressings was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. All the different metal dressings show fast release (up to 24h) followed by slow release (up to 72h). The antibacterial efficacy of the wound dressings was tested using a thermal activity monitor system, revealing that silver and copper wound dressings had the most potent bactericidal properties.

AAA phantoms could be used for experimental validation of the numerical studies and for pre-intervention testing of endovascular grafts. We have applied multi-material 3D printing technology to manufacture idealized AAA phantoms with anisotropic mechanical behavior. Different composites were fabricated and the phantom specimens were characterized by biaxial tensile tests while using a constitutive model to fit the experimental data. One composite was chosen to manufacture the phantom based on having the same mechanical properties as those reported in the literature for human AAA tissue; the strain energy and anisotropic index were compared to make this choice. The materials for the matrix and fibers of the selected composite are, respectively, the digital materials FLX9940 and FLX9960 developed by Stratasys. The fiber proportion for the composite is equal to 0.15. The differences between the composite behavior and the AAA tissue are small, with a small difference in the strain energy (0.4%) and a maximum difference of 12.4% in the peak Green strain ratio.

Approximately 1\u00a0year after the traumatic incident, autotransplantation with the help of 3D planning and rapid prototyping was performed. The right maxillary third molar replaced the right maxillary first premolar. The 2 mandibular wisdom teeth replaced the left mandibular first and second\u00a0molars.

These replicas of the donor teeth were designed based on the preoperative cone-beam computed tomogram and manufactured with the help of 3D printing techniques. The use of a replica of the donor tooth resulted in a predictable and straightforward procedure, with extra-alveolar times shorter than 2\u00a0minutes for all transplantations. The transplanted teeth were placed in infraocclusion and fixed with a suture splint. Postoperative follow-up showed physiologic integration of the transplanted teeth and a successful outcome for all transplants.

We printed two 3D models of complex aneurysms based on computed tomography angiography data using a 3D printer: a whole model, which was all-in-one printed hollow aneurysm method with colorful and multiple materials and included the hollow aneurysm, adjacent arteries, skull base, and nerves, and a regional model that included the hollow aneurysm and adjacent arteries. The 3D models were used for surgical planning and for practice in craniotomy and clipping. Neurosurgeons rated the models via questionnaires.\nBoth 3D aneurysm models were accurate: the diameter, width, and neck of the aneurysms in the models were not significantly different from the computed tomography angiography data (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the models were useful for selecting clips before surgery. The whole 3D model improved understanding of the surgical view more than the regional model did (P < 0.05); however, the clip application felt more realistic in the regional model (P\u00a0< 0.05).

The whole model was more useful for planning the trajectory of approach to the aneurysm when it was located in close proximity to bone and nerves, whereas the regional 3D aneurysm model was appropriate for aneurysms not involving bone and nerves.

{"title": "Vibration-Induced Property Change in the Melting and Solidifying Process of Metallic Nanoparticles.", "abstract": "Tuning material properties in the 3-D printing process of metallic parts is a challenging task of current interests. Much research has been conducted to understand the effects of controlling parameters such as the particle geometry (size and shape), heating, and cooling ways on the outcome of the printing process. However, nothing has been done to explore the system vibration effect. This letter reports our findings on the vibration-induced property change in the melting and solidifying process of silver nanoparticles with the use of molecular dynamics simulation. We find that the increase of system vibration magnitude would increase the number fraction of disordered atoms, which in turn changes the nanostructure of solidified products. For a given system vibration magnitude, the number fraction of disordered atoms reaches the maximum around the system natural frequency so that the stiffness of solidified products becomes the minimum. Since this trend is not affected by the system size, the above findings reveal a feasible path toward the real-time tuning of material properties for advancing additive manufacturing.", "journal": "Nanoscale research letters", "date": "2017-04-30", "authors": ["YonggangZheng", "LiquanDing", "HongfeiYe", "ZhenChen"], "doi": "10.1186/s11671-017-2085-x\n10.1007/s00170-012-4605-2\n10.1088/0957-4484/18/34/345202\n10.1016/j.actamat.2007.07.040\n10.1021/jp983141k\n10.1021/jp000679t\n10.1063/1.1856139\n10.1016/S0965-9773(98)00120-2\n10.1016/S0921-5093(98)00665-0\n10.1021/jp054667p\n10.1007/s11051-011-0402-3\n10.1088/0022-3727/46/33/335302\n10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2004.03.006\n10.1103/PhysRevB.33.7983\n10.1006/jcph.1995.1039\n10.1063/1.447334\n10.1103/PhysRevA.31.1695\n10.1016/0927-0256(94)90109-0\n10.1021/j100303a014\n10.1016/j.scriptamat.2008.11.039\n10.1177/1056789515574123\n10.1088/0965-0393/18/1/015012\n10.1038/srep13534\n10.1039/C6CP02172G\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2014.12.037"}

{"title": "Solid Freeform Techniques Application in Bone Tissue Engineering for Scaffold Fabrication.", "abstract": "Solid freeform techniques are revolutionising technology with great potential to fabricate highly organized biodegradable scaffolds for damaged tissues and organs. Scaffolds fabricated via Solid freeform (SFF) techniques have more pronounced effect in bone tissue engineering. SFF techniques produce various types of scaffolds from different biomaterials with specific pore size, geometries, orientation, interconnectivity and anatomical shapes. Scaffolds needs to be designed from such biomaterials which can attach directly to natural tissues and mimic its properties, so ideally mechanical properties of scaffolds should be same as that of regenerating tissues for best results. The scaffolds designed without optimized mechanical properties would lead to the reduced nutrition diffusion within tissue engineered constructs (TECs) causing tissue necrosis. These scaffolds are mainly processed from ceramics and polymers like calcium phosphate, polydioxane, \u20ac-polycaprolactone, polylactic and polyglycolic acids etc. While, hydrogel scaffolds provide bridge for encapsulated cells and tissues to integrate with natural ECM. Likewise, 2D images from radiography were not sufficient for the prediction of the brain structure, cranial nerves, vessel and architecture of base of the skull and bones, which became possible using the 3D prototyping technologies. Any misrepresentation can lead to fatal outcomes. Biomodelling from these techniques for spinal surgery and preoperative planning are making its way toward successful treatment of several spinal deformities and spinal tumor.

With the lack of autologous vascular grafts available, engineered grafts offer great potential for patient treatment. However, engineered vascular grafts are generally not easily scalable, requiring manufacture of custom molds or polymer tubes in order to customize to different sizes, constituting a time-consuming and costly practice. Human arteries range in lumen diameter from about 2.0-38 mm and in wall thickness from about 0.5-2.5 mm. We have created a method, termed the \"Ring Stacking Method,\" in which variable size rings of tissue of the desired cell type, demonstrated here with vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), can be created using guides of center posts to control lumen diameter and outer shells to dictate vessel wall thickness. These tissue rings are then stacked to create a tubular construct, mimicking the natural form of a blood vessel. The vessel length can be tailored by simply stacking the number of rings required to constitute the length needed. With our technique, tissues of tubular forms, similar to a blood vessel, can be readily manufactured in a variety of dimensions and lengths to meet the needs of the clinic and patient.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2017-04-28", "authors": ["Cameron BPinnock", "ZhengfanXu", "Mai TLam"], "doi": "10.3791/55322"}

Surgical decompression is commonly used to treat TOLF.\nTo evaluate the clinical outcomes of microsurgical decompression of TOLF via a paraspinal approach, using a percutaneous tubular retractor system.\nFirst, three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction and printed models were made from thin computed tomography scans for each patient. Then, 3D computer-assisted virtual surgery was performed using the 3D reconstruction to calculate the precise location and sizes of the bone window and the angle of insertion of the percutaneous tubular retractor system. In total, 13 patients underwent the surgery through the percutaneous micro channel unilateral vertebral approach under electrophysiological monitoring. Five days after the surgery, increased creatine phosphokinase levels returned to preoperative levels. The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score was improved and computed tomography reconstruction and magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine showed that decompression was achieved without injuries to the spinal cord or nerve root. The stability of the spine was not affected, nor were any deformities of the spine detected. Finally, nerve functional recovery was achieved with minimal injury to the paraspinal muscle, articulum, spinous process and ligament.\nThe mean operative time was 98.23 \u00b119.10 min, and mean blood loss was 19.77 \u00b15.97 ml.

Thus, teaching the procedure to residents to guide them through the learning process as quickly as possible is challenging. Artificial 3D-printed temporal bones are replacing cadaver specimens in many institutions to learn mastoidectomy, but these are not suitable for middle ear surgery training. The goal of this work was to adapt such an artificial temporal bone to aid the teaching of otosclerosis surgery and to evaluate this tool. We have modified a commercially available 3D-printed temporal bone by replacing the incus and stapes of the model with in-house 3D-printed ossicles. The incus could be attached to a 6-axis force sensor. The stapes footplate was fenestrated and attached to a 1-axis force sensor. Six junior surgeons (residents) and seven senior surgeons (fellows or consultants) were enrolled to perform piston prosthesis placement and crimping as performed during otosclerosis surgery. The time required to perform the tasks and the forces applied to the incus and stapes were collected and analyzed. No statistically significant differences were observed between the junior and senior groups for time taken to perform the tasks and the forces applied to the incus during crimping and placement of the prosthesis. However, significantly lower forces were applied to the stapes by the senior surgeons in comparison with the junior surgeons during prosthesis placement (junior vs senior group, 328\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0202.9 vs 80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a099.6\u00a0mN, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and during prosthesis crimping (junior vs senior group, 565\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0233 vs 66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048.6\u00a0mN, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

The permanent shape of a component results from the programmed time evolution of the printed shape upon heating via the design of the architecture and process parameters of a composite consisting of a glassy shape memory polymer and an elastomer that is programmed with a built-in compressive strain during photopolymerization. Upon heating, the shape memory polymer softens, releases the constraint on the strained elastomer, and allows the object to transform into a new permanent shape, which can then be reprogrammed into multiple subsequent shapes.

{"title": "Creation of a novel simulator for minimally invasive neurosurgery: fusion of 3D printing and special effects.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Recent advances in optics and miniaturization have enabled the development of a growing number of minimally invasive procedures, yet innovative training methods for the use of these techniques remain lacking. Conventional teaching models, including cadavers and physical trainers as well as virtual reality platforms, are often expensive and ineffective. Newly developed 3D printing technologies can recreate patient-specific anatomy, but the stiffness of the materials limits fidelity to real-life surgical situations. Hollywood special effects techniques can create ultrarealistic features, including lifelike tactile properties, to enhance accuracy and effectiveness of the surgical models. The authors created a highly realistic model of a pediatric patient with hydrocephalus via a unique combination of 3D printing and special effects techniques and validated the use of this model in training neurosurgery fellows and residents to perform endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), an effective minimally invasive method increasingly used in treating hydrocephalus. METHODS A full-scale reproduction of the head of a 14-year-old adolescent patient with hydrocephalus, including external physical details and internal neuroanatomy, was developed via a unique collaboration of neurosurgeons, simulation engineers, and a group of special effects experts. The model contains \"plug-and-play\" replaceable components for repetitive practice. The appearance of the training model (face validity) and the reproducibility of the ETV training procedure (content validity) were assessed by neurosurgery fellows and residents of different experience levels based on a 14-item Likert-like questionnaire. The usefulness of the training model for evaluating the performance of the trainees at different levels of experience (construct validity) was measured by blinded observers using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scale for the performance of ETV. RESULTS A combination of 3D printing technology and casting processes led to the creation of realistic surgical models that include high-fidelity reproductions of the anatomical features of hydrocephalus and allow for the performance of ETV for training purposes. The models reproduced the pulsations of the basilar artery, ventricles, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), thus simulating the experience of performing ETV on an actual patient. The results of the 14-item questionnaire showed limited variability among participants' scores, and the neurosurgery fellows and residents gave the models consistently high ratings for face and content validity. The mean score for the content validity questions (4.88) was higher than the mean score for face validity (4.69) (p = 0.03). On construct validity scores, the blinded observers rated performance of fellows significantly higher than that of residents, indicating that the model provided a means to distinguish between novice and expert surgical skills. CONCLUSIONS A plug-and-play lifelike ETV training model was developed through a combination of 3D printing and special effects techniques, providing both anatomical and haptic accuracy. Such simulators offer opportunities to accelerate the development of expertise with respect to new and novel procedures as well as iterate new surgical approaches and innovations, thus allowing novice neurosurgeons to gain valuable experience in surgical techniques without exposing patients to risk of harm.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

Precision was assessed through comparisons of the 3D surgical guide to the sterilized 3D-printed guide, determining accuracy to the millimetre level. Reproducibility was assessed in three surgical cases by volumetric comparison to the millimetre level. For the 3D surgical modelling, a difference of less than 0.1mm was observed. Almost no deformations (<0.2mm) were observed post-autoclave sterilization of the 3D-printed surgical guides. In the three surgical cases, the average precision of fibula free flap modelling was between 0.1mm and 0.4mm, and the average precision of the complete reconstructed mandible was less than 1mm.

Effective structural properties of the scaffolds are characterized using a developed multi-level stochastic upscaling process that propagates the quantified uncertainties at strut level to the lattice structure level. To obtain realistic simulation models for the stochastic upscaling process and minimize the experimental cost, high-resolution finite element models of individual struts were reconstructed from the micro-CT scan images of lattice structures which are fabricated by selective laser melting. The upscaling method facilitates the process of determining homogenized strut properties to reduce the computational cost of the detailed simulation model for the scaffold. Bayesian Information Criterion is utilized to quantify the uncertainties with parametric distributions based on the statistical data obtained from the reconstructed strut models. A systematic validation approach that can minimize the experimental cost is also developed to assess the predictive capability of the stochastic upscaling method used at the strut level and lattice structure level.

{"title": "Three-dimensional printing of transparent fused silica glass.", "abstract": "Glass is one of the most important high-performance materials used for scientific research, in industry and in society, mainly owing to its unmatched optical transparency, outstanding mechanical, chemical and thermal resistance as well as its thermal and electrical insulating properties. However, glasses and especially high-purity glasses such as fused silica glass are notoriously difficult to shape, requiring high-temperature melting and casting processes for macroscopic objects or hazardous chemicals for microscopic features. These drawbacks have made glasses inaccessible to modern manufacturing technologies such as three-dimensional printing (3D printing). Using a casting nanocomposite, here we create transparent fused silica glass components using stereolithography 3D printers at resolutions of a few tens of micrometres. The process uses a photocurable silica nanocomposite that is 3D printed and converted to high-quality fused silica glass via heat treatment.

{"title": "Energy harvesting from cerebrospinal fluid pressure fluctuations for self-powered neural implants.", "abstract": "In this paper, a novel method to generate electrical energy by converting available mechanical energy from pressure fluctuations of the cerebrospinal fluid within lateral ventricles of the brain is presented. The generated electrical power can be supplied to the neural implants and either eliminate their battery need or extend the battery lifespan. A diaphragm type harvester comprised of piezoelectric material is utilized to convert the pressure fluctuations to electrical energy. The pressure fluctuations cause the diaphragm to bend, and the strained piezoelectric materials generate electricity. In the framework of this study, an energy harvesting structure having a diameter of 2.5\u00a0mm was designed and fabricated using microfabrication techniques. A 1:1 model of lateral ventricles was 3D-printed from raw MRI images to characterize the harvester. Experimental results show that a maximum power of 0.62 nW can be generated from the harvester under similar physical conditions in lateral ventricles which corresponds to energy density of 12.6 nW/cm", "journal": "Biomedical microdevices", "date": "2017-04-21", "authors": ["LeventBeker", "ArnauBenet", "Ali TayebiMeybodi", "BenEovino", "Albert PPisano", "LiweiLin"], "doi": "10.1007/s10544-017-0176-1"}
{"title": "Recent Advances in Bioink Design for 3D Bioprinting of Tissues and Organs.", "abstract": "There is a growing demand for alternative fabrication approaches to develop tissues and organs as conventional techniques are not capable of fabricating constructs with required structural, mechanical, and biological complexity. 3D bioprinting offers great potential to fabricate highly complex constructs with precise control of structure, mechanics, and biological matter [i.e., cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components]. 3D bioprinting is an additive manufacturing approach that utilizes a \"bioink\" to fabricate devices and scaffolds in a layer-by-layer manner. 3D bioprinting allows printing of a cell suspension into a tissue construct with or without a scaffold support. The most common bioinks are cell-laden hydrogels, decellulerized ECM-based solutions, and cell suspensions. In this mini review, a brief description and comparison of the bioprinting methods, including extrusion-based, droplet-based, and laser-based bioprinting, with particular focus on bioink design requirements are presented.

As the costs of implementing 3D printing have declined, the use of this technology has expanded, especially within surgical specialties. This article explores the types of 3D printing available, highlights the benefits and drawbacks of each methodology, provides examples of how 3D printing has been applied within the field of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, discusses future innovations, and explores the financial impact of these advances. Data Sources Articles were identified from PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE. Review Methods PubMed and Ovid Medline were queried for English articles published between 2011 and 2016, including a few articles prior to this time as relevant examples. Search terms included 3-dimensional printing, 3 D printing, otolaryngology, additive manufacturing, craniofacial, reconstruction, temporal bone, airway, sinus, cost, and anatomic models. Conclusions Three-dimensional printing has been used in recent years in otolaryngology for preoperative planning, education, prostheses, grafting, and reconstruction. Emerging technologies include the printing of tissue scaffolds for the auricle and nose, more realistic training models, and personalized implantable medical devices. Implications for Practice After the up-front costs of 3D printing are accounted for, its utilization in surgical models, patient-specific implants, and custom instruments can reduce operating room time and thus decrease costs.

{"title": "Measurement of Pressure Fluctuations inside a Model Thrust Bearing Using PVDF Sensors.", "abstract": "Thrust bearings play a vital role in propulsion systems. They rely on a thin layer of oil being trapped between rotating surfaces to produce a low friction interface. The \"quality\" of this bearing affects many things from noise transmission to the ultimate catastrophic failure of the bearing itself. As a result, the direct measure of the forces and vibrations within the oil filled interface would be very desirable and would give an indication of the condition of the bearing in situ. The thickness of the oil film is, however, very small and conventional vibration sensors are too cumbersome to use in this confined space. This paper solves this problem by using a piezoelectric polymer film made from Polyvinylidine Fluoride (PVDF). These films are very thin (50 m) and flexible and easy to install in awkward spaces such as the inside of a thrust bearing. A model thrust bearing was constructed using a 3D printer and PVDF films inserted into the base of the bearing. In doing so, it was possible to directly measure the force fluctuations due to the rotating pads and investigate various properties of the thrust bearing itself.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-04-20", "authors": ["AndrewYoussef", "DavidMatthews", "AndrewGuzzomi", "JiePan"], "doi": "10.3390/s17040878\n10.1143/JJAP.8.975\n10.1016/0041-624X(81)90005-6\n10.1109/58.883525\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/4/017\n10.1016/0273-1177(95)00769-B\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.04.002\n10.1007/s003480050262\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2010.01.005"}

{"title": "Stretchable and Soft Electronics using Liquid Metals.", "abstract": "The use of liquid metals based on gallium for soft and stretchable electronics is discussed. This emerging class of electronics is motivated, in part, by the new opportunities that arise from devices that have mechanical properties similar to those encountered in the human experience, such as skin, tissue, textiles, and clothing. These types of electronics (e.g., wearable or implantable electronics, sensors for soft robotics, e-skin) must operate during deformation. Liquid metals are compelling materials for these applications because, in principle, they are infinitely deformable while retaining metallic conductivity. Liquid metals have been used for stretchable wires and interconnects, reconfigurable antennas, soft sensors, self-healing circuits, and conformal electrodes. In contrast to Hg, liquid metals based on gallium have low toxicity and essentially no vapor pressure and are therefore considered safe to handle. Whereas most liquids bead up to minimize surface energy, the presence of a surface oxide on these metals makes it possible to pattern them into useful shapes using a variety of techniques, including fluidic injection and 3D printing. In addition to forming excellent conductors, these metals can be used actively to form memory devices, sensors, and diodes that are completely built from soft materials.

The microstructural properties of the CLAD-deposited alloy were studied with optical microscopy and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis. The conservation of the mechanical properties of the Ti-27.5Nb material after the transformation steps (ingot-powder atomisation-CLAD) were verified with tensile tests and appear to remain close to those of reference material. Cytocompatibility of the material and subsequent cell viability tests showed that no cytotoxic elements are released in the medium and that viable cells proliferated well.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

The as-built Ti-6Al-4V lattices exhibit an out-of-equilibrium microstructure with very fine \u03b1' martensitic laths. When subjected to the heat treatment of 1050\u00b0C for 4h followed by furnace cooling, the lattices show a homogenous and equilibrium lamellar \u03b1+\u03b2 microstructure with less dislocation and crystallographic defects compared with the as-built \u03b1' martensite. The as-built lattices present very rough strut surfaces bonded with plenty of partially melted metal particles. The sand blasting nearly removed all the bonded metal particles, but created many tiny cracks. The HCl etching eliminated these tiny cracks, and subsequent NaOH etching resulted in many small and shallow micro-pits and develops a sodium titanate hydrogel layer on the surfaces of the lattices. When soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF), the Ti-6Al-4V TPMS lattices were covered with a compact and homogeneous biomimetic hydroxyapatite (HA) layer. This work proposes a new method for making Ti-6Al-4V TPMS lattices with a homogenous and equilibrium microstructure and biomimetic HA coating, which show both tough and bioactive characteristics and can be promising materials usable as bone substitutes.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

It is difficult to achieve accurate reconstruction. With the help of 3D printing models and surgical templates, the osteotomy line and the amount of bone grinding can be accurate. Also, by means of the precise repositioning instrument, the repositioning of genioplasty can be accurate and quick. In this study, we present a three-dimensional printing technique and the precise repositioning instrument to guide the osteotomy and repositioning, and illustrate their feasibility and validity.\nEight patients with complex facial asymmetries were studied. A precise 3D printing model was obtained. We made the preoperative design and surgical templates according to it. The surgical templates and precise repositioning instrument were used to obtain an accurate osteotomy and repositioning during the operation. Postoperative measurements were made based on computed tomographic data, including chin point deviation as well as the symmetry of the mandible evaluated by 3D curve functions.\nAll patients obtained satisfactory esthetic results, and no recurrences occurred during follow-up. The results showed that we achieved clinically acceptable precision for the mandible and chin. The mean and SD of ICC between R-Post and L-Post were 0.973\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.007. The mean and SD of chin point deviation 6\u00a0months after the operation were 0.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0mm.\nThe results of this study suggest that the three-dimensional printing technique and the precise repositioning instrument could aid in making better operation designs and more accurate manipulation in orthognathic surgery for complex facial asymmetry.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Bioink should be non-toxic, biocompatible, and printable. To date, alginate has been widely used as a whole or partial component of bioink because it is non-toxic to embedded cells and even it can provide good printability with rapid gelation under calcium ions. However, alginate bioinks do not possess cell-activating ability. To overcome the shortcomings of alginate-based bioinks, a new collagen bioink, which was mixed with human adipose stem cells (hASCs) and crosslinked with a polyphenol (tannic acid), was proposed. The feasibility of the bioink was demonstrated using several in vitro assessments for comparison of the macroscale porous cell-laden collagen/polyphenol structure containing the hASCs with the conventional alginate-based cell-laden structure. The levels of the metabolic activity, including the cell viability and cell proliferation, of the cell-laden collagen structure were significantly higher than those of the control (alginate-based cell-laden structure).

The conduit that consisted of a gelatin cryogel was prepared by molding with 3D-printed moulds. Due to its porous structure and excellent mechanical properties, this conduit could be collapsed by the mechanical force and resumed its original shape after absorption of normal saline. This shape-memory property allowed a simply surgery process for installing the conduits.

The first semester integrated computer-aided drawing (CAD) as preparation for manufacturing of device-related components (hand machining, computer numeric control (CNC), three-dimensional (3D) printing, and plastics molding), followed by an introduction to microcontrollers (MCUs) and printed circuit boards (PCBs) for associated electronics and control systems. In the second semester, the students applied these skills on a unified project, working together to construct and test multiple weighing scales for wheelchair users. In the final semester, the students applied industrial design concepts to four distinct device designs, including user and context reassessment, human factors (functional and aesthetic) design refinement, and advanced visualization for commercialization. The assessment results are described, along with lessons learned and plans for enhancement of the course sequence.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "date": "2017-04-12", "authors": ["Alan WEberhardt", "SheaTillman", "BrandonKirkland", "BrandonSherrod"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4036441\n10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0662\n10.1115/1.4032805\n10.1115/SBC2013-14614\n10.1080/10400435.2016.1201170\n10.3102/00346543075001027\n10.1002/bmb.20204\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2004.11.013"}

Most trainees lack adequate opportunities to develop proficiency in this skill. We hypothesized that 3-dimensional (3D) printing and computer-aided design can be used to create a high-fidelity simulator for developing skills carving costal cartilage grafts for airway reconstruction. The rapid manufacturing and low cost of the simulator allow deployment in locations lacking expert instructors or cadaveric dissection, such as medical missions and Third World countries. In this blinded, prospective observational study, resident trainees completed a physical simulator exercise using a 3D-printed costal cartilage grafting tool. Participant assessment was performed using a Likert scale questionnaire, and airway grafts were assessed by a blinded expert surgeon.

In addition, we also investigated the effect of 3D printing technology on the communication between doctors and patients.\nSeventy two patients with tibial plateau fractures were enrolled in the study from April 2014 to October 2015. They were divided into two groups: 34 cases of 3D model group, 38 cases of traditional surgery group. The individual models were used to simulate the surgical procedures and carry out the surgery according to plan. Operation time, blood loss, and number of intra-operative fluoroscopy were recorded. Through the follow-up, the recovery of patients were observed. Besides, we designed questionnaires to verify the satisfaction for both surgeons and patients.\nThe average operation time, average amount of blood loss, and number of intra-operative fluoroscopy for 3D model group was 85.2\u00b10.9 minutes, 186.3\u00b1 5.5ml, 5.3\u00b1 0.2 times, and for traditional surgery group was 99.2\u00b11.0 minutes, 216.2 \u00b16.9 ml,7.1 \u00b1 0.2 times respectively. There was statistically significant difference between the traditional surgery group and 3D model group (P < 0.05). Via follow-up, we can see that the 3D printing group has a better clinical efficacy.

In vitro tissue models that can provide efficient and accurate drug toxicity screening are highly desired for preclinical drug development and personalized therapy. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of a human cardiac tissue model for high throughput drug toxicity studies. Cardiac tissues were fabricated via cellular self-assembly of human transgene-free induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes in pre-fabricated polydimethylsiloxane molds. The formed tissue constructs expressed cardiomyocyte-specific proteins, exhibited robust production of extracellular matrix components such as laminin, collagen and fibronectin, aligned sarcomeric organization, and stable spontaneous contractions for up to 2 months. Functional characterization revealed that the cardiac cells cultured in 3D tissues exhibited higher contraction speed and rate, and displayed a significantly different drug response compared to cells cultured in age-matched 2D monolayer. A panel of clinically relevant compounds including antibiotic, antidiabetic and anticancer drugs were tested in this study. Compared to conventional viability assays, our functional contractility-based assays were more sensitive in predicting drug-induced cardiotoxic effects, demonstrating good concordance with clinical observations.

{"title": "Blood flow-induced physically based guidewire simulation for vascular intervention training.", "abstract": "A realistic guidewire behavior simulation is a vital component of a virtual vascular intervention system. Such systems are a safe, low-cost means of establishing a training environment to help inexperienced surgeons develop their intervention skills. Previous attempts to simulate the complex movement of a guidewire inside blood vessels have rarely considered the influence of blood flow. In this paper, we address this problem by integrating blood flow analysis and propose a novel guidewire simulation model.\nThe blood flow distribution inside the arterial vasculature was computed by separating the vascular model into discrete cylindrical vessels and modeling the flow in each vessel according to Poiseuille Law. The blood flow computation was then integrated into a robust Kirchhoff elastic model. With hardware acceleration, the guidewire simulation can be run in real time. To evaluate the simulation, an experimental environment with a 3D-printed vascular phantom and an electromagnetic tracking system was set up, with clinically used guidewire sensors applied to trace its motion as the standard for comparison.\nThe virtual guidewire motion trace was assessed by comparing it to the comparison standard. The root-mean-square (RMS) value of the newly proposed guidewire model was 2.14\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.24\u00a0mm, lower than the value of 4.81\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.80\u00a0mm for the previous Kirchhoff model, while maintaining a computation speed of at least 30\u00a0fps.\nThe experimental results revealed that the blood flow-induced model exhibits better performance and physical credibility with a lower and more stable RMS error than the previous Kirchhoff model.", "journal": "International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery", "date": "2017-04-11", "authors": ["JiayinCai", "HongzhiXie", "ShuyangZhang", "LixuGu"], "doi": "10.1007/s11548-017-1583-8"}

Navigated neuroendoscopic solutions are continuously improving.\nWe describe experimentally measured accuracy and our first experience with augmented reality-enhanced navigated neuroendoscopy for intraventricular pathologies.\nAugmented reality-enhanced navigated endoscopy was tested for accuracy in an experimental setting. Therefore, a 3D-printed head model with a right parietal lesion was scanned with a thin-sliced computer tomography. Segmentation of the tumor lesion was performed using Scopis NovaPlan navigation software. An optical reference matrix is used to register the neuroendoscope's geometry and its field of view. The pre-planned ROI and trajectory are superimposed in the endoscopic image. The accuracy of the superimposed contour fitting on endoscopically visualized lesion was acquired by measuring the deviation of both midpoints to one another. The technique was subsequently used in 29 cases with CSF circulation pathologies. Navigation planning included defining the entry points, regions of interests and trajectories, superimposed as augmented reality on the endoscopic video screen\u00a0during intervention. Patients were evaluated for postoperative imaging, reoperations, and possible complications.\nThe experimental setup revealed a deviation of the ROI's midpoint from the real target by 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0mm. The clinical study included 18 cyst fenestrations, ten biopsies, seven endoscopic third ventriculostomies, six stent placements, and two shunt implantations, being eventually combined in some patients.

{"title": "Customized Knee Prosthesis in Treatment of Giant Cell Tumors of the Proximal Tibia: Application of 3-Dimensional Printing Technology in Surgical Design.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND We explored the application of 3-dimensional (3D) printing technology in treating giant cell tumors (GCT) of the proximal tibia. A tibia block was designed and produced through 3D printing technology. We expected that this 3D-printed block would fill the bone defect after en-bloc resection. Importantly, the block, combined with a standard knee joint prosthesis, provided attachments for collateral ligaments of the knee, which can maintain knee stability. MATERIAL AND METHODS A computed tomography (CT) scan was taken of both knee joints in 4 patients with GCT of the proximal tibia. We developed a novel technique - the real-size 3D-printed proximal tibia model - to design preoperative treatment plans. Hence, with the application of 3D printing technology, a customized proximal tibia block could be designed for each patient individually, which fixed the bone defect, combined with standard knee prosthesis. RESULTS In all 4 cases, the 3D-printed block fitted the bone defect precisely. The motion range of the affected knee was 90 degrees on average, and the soft tissue balance and stability of the knee were good. After an average 7-month follow-up, the MSTS score was 19 on average. No sign of prosthesis fracture, loosening, or other relevant complications were detected. CONCLUSIONS This technique can be used to treat GCT of the proximal tibia when it is hard to achieve soft tissue balance after tumor resection. 3D printing technology simplified the design and manufacturing progress of custom-made orthopedic medical instruments. This new surgical technique could be much more widely applied because of 3D printing technology.", "journal": "Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research", "date": "2017-04-08", "authors": ["WenbinLuo", "LanfengHuang", "HeLiu", "WenruiQu", "XinZhao", "ChenyuWang", "ChenLi", "TaoYu", "QingHan", "JinchengWang", "YanguoQin"], "doi": "10.12659/msm.901436"}

The methodology is based on a microfluidic printing head coupled to a co-axial needle extruder for high-resolution 3D bioprinting of hydrogel fibers laden with muscle precursor cells (C2C12). To promote myogenic differentiation, we formulated a tailored bioink with a photocurable semi-synthetic biopolymer (PEG-Fibrinogen) encapsulating cells into 3D constructs composed of aligned hydrogel fibers. After 3-5 days of culture, the encapsulated myoblasts started migrating and fusing, forming multinucleated myotubes within the 3D bioprinted fibers. The obtained myotubes showed high degree of alignment along the direction of hydrogel fiber deposition, further revealing maturation, sarcomerogenesis, and functionality. Following subcutaneous implantation in the back of immunocompromised mice, bioprinted constructs generated organized artificial muscle tissue in\u00a0vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that our microfluidic printing head allows to design three dimensional multi-cellular assemblies with an exquisite compartmentalization of the encapsulated cells.

The final patient education model was developed over several iterations to optimize material properties, anatomical accuracy and overall display.

{"title": "Effect of 3D-Printed Microvascular Network Design on the Self-Healing Behavior of Cross-Linked Polymers.", "abstract": "This article describes the manufacturing procedure and the characterization of self-healing polymers based on embedded microvascular networks. The samples were realized by resin casting into water-soluble PVA molds, fabricated via 3D printing. This technology allowed us to exploit the 3D printers' ability to produce complex structures with high resolution for the creation of independent microchannels networks. The two reacting components of a two-part resin could be stored separately within the microstructure. The materials' self-healing ability resulted from their reaction when severe damage caused the healing liquids to leak out, wetting the sample cross section and diffusing one into the other. The mechanical properties of healed samples were investigated by means of uniaxial tensile tests and compared to those of undamaged samples. The effect of microchannel density and different network designs on self-healing efficiency was determined. The different microstructures used were characterized using computerized X-ray microtomography. The versatility of the fabrication technique presented in this work allows conversion of any water-resistant resin into a fully functional self-healing polymeric composite.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-04-08", "authors": ["GPostiglione", "MAlberini", "SLeigh", "MLevi", "STurri"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b01830"}

The main limitation is poor cell viability in the middle of the scaffold due to poor diffusion of oxygen and nutrients and insufficient vascularization. Layer-by-Layer (LBL) bioassembly is based on \"bottom-up\" approach, which considers assembly of small cellularized blocks. The aim of this work was to evaluate proliferation and differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in two and three dimensions (2D, 3D) using a LBL assembly of polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds fabricated by 3D printing. 2D experiments have shown maintain of cell viability on PLA, especially when a co-cuture system was used, as well as adequate morphology of seeded cells. Early osteoblastic and endothelial differentiations were observed and cell proliferation was increased after 7\u2009days of culture. In 3D, cell migration was observed between layers of LBL constructs, as well as an osteoblastic differentiation. These results indicate that LBL assembly of PLA layers could be suitable for BTE, in order to promote homogenous cell distribution inside the scaffold and gene expression specific to the cells implanted in the case of co-culture system.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

Bone tissue engineering strategies, by combining biomaterials, cells, and signaling factors, are seen as alternatives to conventional bone grafts for repairing or rebuilding bone defects.

Bone biofabrication by additive manufacturing techniques may represent a possible solution, with its intrinsic capability for accuracy, reproducibility, and customization of scaffolds as well as cell and signaling molecule delivery. This review examines the existing research in bone biofabrication and the appropriate cells and factors selection for successful bone regeneration as well as limitations affecting these approaches.

Two bioinks were investigated: NFC with alginate (NFC/A) or hyaluronic acid (NFC/HA). Low proliferation and phenotypic changes away from pluripotency were seen in the case of NFC/HA. However, in the case of the 3D-bioprinted NFC/A (60/40, dry weight % ratio) constructs, pluripotency was initially maintained, and after five weeks, hyaline-like cartilaginous tissue with collagen type II expression and lacking tumorigenic Oct4 expression was observed in 3D -bioprinted NFC/A (60/40, dry weight % relation) constructs. Moreover, a marked increase in cell number within the cartilaginous tissue was detected by 2-photon fluorescence microscopy, indicating the importance of high cell densities in the pursuit of achieving good survival after printing.

Aneurysm volume, surface area, dome height, minimum and maximum ostium diameter were determined for the five models.\nIn all cases, measurements made with the EE kernel most closely matched ground truth values. Differences in values derived from reconstructions displayed with Smooth or Normal image characteristics were small and had only little impact on the geometric parameters considered.\nReconstruction parameters impact the accuracy of measurements made using the aneurysm analysis tool of a commercially available angiographic system.

{"title": "Three-dimensional reconstruction of highly complex microscopic samples using scanning electron microscopy and optical flow estimation.", "abstract": "Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) as one of the major research and industrial equipment for imaging of micro-scale samples and surfaces has gained extensive attention from its emerge. However, the acquired micrographs still remain two-dimensional (2D). In the current work a novel and highly accurate approach is proposed to recover the hidden third-dimension by use of multi-view image acquisition of the microscopic samples combined with pre/post-processing steps including sparse feature-based stereo rectification, nonlocal-based optical flow estimation for dense matching and finally depth estimation. Employing the proposed approach, three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of highly complex microscopic samples were achieved to facilitate the interpretation of topology and geometry of surface/shape attributes of the samples. As a byproduct of the proposed approach, high-definition 3D printed models of the samples can be generated as a tangible means of physical understanding.

Ring electrodes consisting of both an inner disk and an outer ring were used to prevent neutral transmission while maximizing ion transmission. As a stand-alone instrument, the 3D printed IMS is shown to achieve resolving powers of between 24 and 50 in positive ion mode using tetraalkylammonium bromide salts (TAA), benzylamines (mono-, di-, and tri-), and illicit drugs (MA, MDEA, and haloperidol).

{"title": "A compliant and biomimetic three-layered vascular graft for small blood vessels.", "abstract": "Engineering a small diameter vascular graft with mechanical and biological properties comparable to living tissues remains challenging. Often, current devices lead to thrombosis and unsatisfactory long-term patency as a result of poor blood compatibility and a mismatch between the mechanical properties of the living tissue and the implanted biomaterial. Addressing all these requirements is essential to produce scaffolds able to survive throughout the life of the patient. For this purpose, we fabricated a novel three-layered vascular graft by combining electrospinning and braiding. Mirroring the structure of human blood vessels, the proposed device is composed of three layers: the intima, the media, and the adventitia. The intima and media layers were obtained by sequentially electrospinning silk fibroin\u00a0(SF) and poly(L-lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone), with ratios selected to match the mechanical properties of the native tissue. For the outer layer, the adventitia, SF yarns were braided on top of the electrospun tubes to create a structure able to withstand high pressures. Compliance, Young's modulus and deformability of the obtained scaffold were similar to that of human blood vessels. Additionally, cytocompatibility of the two layers, media and intima, was assessed in vitro by analysing cell metabolic activity and proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, respectively. Furthermore, heparin functionalization of the scaffolds led to improved anticoagulant properties upon incubation in whole blood. The obtained results indicate a potential application of the herewith designed three-layered construct as a vascular graft for small diameter blood vessel engineering.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-04-07", "authors": ["YZhang", "X SLi", "A GGuex", "S SLiu", "EM\u00fcller", "R InnocentiMalini", "H JZhao", "MRottmar", "KManiura-Weber", "R MRossi", "FSpano"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa6bae"}

Understanding the physiological contribution of obesity, a major contributor to breast cancer risk and negative prognosis in post-menopausal patients, on cancer cell invasion requires detailed co-culture constructs that reflect mammary microarchitecture. Using laser direct-write, a laser-based CAD/CAM bioprinting technique, we have demonstrated the ability to construct breast cancer cell-laden hydrogel microbeads into spatially defined patterns in hydrogel matrices containing differentiated adipocytes. Z-stack imaging confirmed the three-dimensional nature of the constructs, as well as incorporation of cancer cell-laden microbeads into the adipose matrix. Preliminary data was gathered to support the construct as a potential model for breast cancer cell invasion into adipose tissue. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell invasion was tracked over 2 weeks in an optically transparent hydrogel scaffold in the presence of differentiated adipocytes obtained from normal weight or obese patient tissue.

Recently, fractal structures have been manufactured using a 3D printing technique that involves computer-aided design data. In this study, we confirmed the accuracy of geometrical structures when Koch curve-like fractal structures with zero to three generations were printed using a 3D printer. The fractal dimension was analyzed using a box-counting method. This analysis indicated that the fractal dimension of the third generation hierarchical structure was approximately the same as that of the ideal Koch curve. These findings demonstrate that the design and production of fractal structures can be controlled using a 3D printer.

Many 3D printing systems require large optical elements or nozzles in proximity to the built structure. This prevents their use in applications in which there is no direct access to the area where the objects have to be printed. Here, we demonstrate three-dimensional microfabrication based on two-photon polymerization (TPP) through an ultra-thin printing nozzle of 560 \u00b5m in diameter. Using wavefront shaping, femtosecond infrared pulses are focused and scanned through a multimode optical fiber (MMF) inside a photoresist that polymerizes via two-photon absorption. We show the construction of arbitrary 3D structures built with voxels of diameters down to 400 nm on the other side of the fiber. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of microfabrication through a multimode optical fiber.

The advantages of drop on demand technology include reproducible production of droplets with adjustable sizing and high placement accuracy, which enable production of individualized dosing even for low dose and high potency drugs. Flexible use of different formulations, such as lipid-based formulations, allows enhancement of the solubility of poorly water soluble and highly lipophilic drugs with DAMPP.

{"title": "A Two-Axis Goniometric Sensor for Tracking Finger Motion.", "abstract": "The study of finger kinematics has developed into an important research area. Various hand tracking systems are currently available; however, they all have limited functionality. Generally, the most commonly adopted sensors are limited to measurements with one degree of freedom, i.e., flexion/extension of fingers. More advanced measurements including finger abduction, adduction, and circumduction are much more difficult to achieve. To overcome these limitations, we propose a two-axis 3D printed optical sensor with a compact configuration for tracking finger motion. Based on Malus' law, this sensor detects the angular changes by analyzing the attenuation of light transmitted through polarizing film. The sensor consists of two orthogonal axes each containing two pathways. The two readings from each axis are fused using a weighted average approach, enabling a measurement range up to 180 \u2218 and an improvement in sensitivity. The sensor demonstrates high accuracy (\u00b10.3 \u2218 ), high repeatability, and low hysteresis error. Attaching the sensor to the index finger's metacarpophalangeal joint, real-time movements consisting of flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and circumduction have been successfully recorded.

Glipizide used in the treatment of diabetes was selected as model drug, and was successfully loaded into commercial polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filaments by HME method. The drug-loaded filaments were printed through a dual-nozzle 3D printer, and finally formed a double-chamber device composed by a tablet embedded within a larger tablet (DuoTablet), each chamber contains different contents of glipizide. The drug-loaded 3D printed device was evaluated for drug release under in vitro dissolution condition, and we found the release profile fit Korsmeyer-Peppas release kinetics. With the double-chamber design, it is feasible to design either controlled drug release or delayed drug release behavior by reasonably arranging the concentration distribution of the drug in the device. The characteristics of the external layer performed main influence on the release profile of the internal compartment such as lag-time or rate of release.

Presently, there is no other technology available, which is either superior or even comparable to the conventional CMP. The present study was designed to fabricate ocular prosthesis using computer aided design (CAD) and rapid manufacturing (RM) technology and to compare it with custom made prosthesis (CMP). The ocular prosthesis prepared by CAD was compared with conventional CMP in terms of time taken for fabrication, weight, cosmesis, comfort, and motility. Two eyes of two patients were included. Computerized tomography scan of wax model of socket was converted into three dimensional format using Materialize Interactive Medical Image Control System (MIMICS)software and further refined. This was given as an input to rapid manufacturing machine (Polyjet 3-D printer). The final painting on prototype was done by an ocularist. The average effective time required for fabrication of CAD prosthesis was 2.5 hours; and weight 2.9 grams. The same for CMP were 10 hours; and 4.4 grams. CAD prosthesis was more comfortable for both the patients. The study demonstrates the first ever attempt of fabricating a complete ocular prosthesis using CAD and rapid manufacturing and comparing it with conventional CMP.

Once a hologram is captured from the portable setup, a 3D reconstructed height profile of the cell is created. We extract several morphological cell features from the reconstructed 3D height profiles, including mean physical cell thickness, coefficient of variation, optical volume (OV) of the cell, projected area of the cell (PA), ratio of PA to OV, cell thickness kurtosis, cell thickness skewness, and the dry mass of the cell for identification using the random forest (RF) classifier. The 3D printed prototype can serve as a low-cost alternative for the developing world, where access to laboratory facilities for disease diagnosis are limited. Additionally, a cell phone sensor is used to capture the digital holograms. This enables the user to send the acquired holograms over the internet to a computational device located remotely for cellular identification and classification (analysis).

{"title": "Biofabricated soft network composites for cartilage tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Articular cartilage from a material science point of view is a soft network composite that plays a critical role in load-bearing joints during dynamic loading. Its composite structure, consisting of a collagen fiber network and a hydrated proteoglycan matrix, gives rise to the complex mechanical properties of the tissue including viscoelasticity and stress relaxation. Melt electrospinning writing allows the design and fabrication of medical grade polycaprolactone (mPCL) fibrous networks for the reinforcement of soft hydrogel matrices for cartilage tissue engineering. However, these fiber-reinforced constructs underperformed under dynamic and prolonged loading conditions, suggesting that more targeted design approaches and material selection are required to fully exploit the potential of fibers as reinforcing agents for cartilage tissue engineering. In the present study, we emulated the proteoglycan matrix of articular cartilage by using highly negatively charged star-shaped poly(ethylene glycol)/heparin hydrogel (sPEG/Hep) as the soft matrix. These soft hydrogels combined with mPCL melt electrospun fibrous networks exhibited mechanical anisotropy, nonlinearity, viscoelasticity and morphology analogous to those of their native counterpart, and provided a suitable microenvironment for in vitro human chondrocyte culture and neocartilage formation. In addition, a numerical model using the p-version of the finite element method (p-FEM) was developed in order to gain further insights into the deformation mechanisms of the constructs in silico, as well as to predict compressive moduli.

Colored skull models were produced by 3D printing technology. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to compare the learning efficiency of 3D printed skulls with that of cadaveric skulls and atlas. Seventy-nine medical students, who never studied anatomy, were randomized into three groups by drawing lots, using 3D printed skulls, cadaveric skulls, and atlas, respectively, to study the anatomical structures in skull through an introductory lecture and small group discussions. All students completed identical tests, which composed of a theory test and a lab test, before and after a lecture. Pre-test scores showed no differences between the three groups.

To make this approach suitable for capillaries down to 50\u00a0\u03bcm i.d. the dimension of the in-built slit is the critical element of the printed housing. The spatial orientation of the model for printing was found to significantly impact on the resolution of the structures and voids that can be printed. By designing a housing with a slit positioned in the XY plane in parallel with the print direction, the narrowest void (slit) that could be printed was 70\u00a0\u03bcm. The potential use of the 3D printed slit for photometric detection was characterised using tubing and capillary from 500 down to 50\u00a0\u03bcm i.d, demonstrating a linear response from 632 to 40 mAU. The effective pathlength and stray light varied from 383 to 22\u00a0\u03bcm and 3.8% - 50% for 500- 50\u00a0\u03bcm i.d tubing and capillary. The use of a V-shaped alignment feature allowed for easy and reliable positioning of the tubing inside the detector, as demonstrated by a RSD of 1.9% (n\u00a0=\u00a010) in peak height when repositioning the tubing between measurements using flow injection analysis (FIA). The performance of the 3D printed housing and 70\u00a0\u03bcm slit was benchmarked against a commercially available interface using the CE separation of Zn", "journal": "Analytica chimica acta", "date": "2017-04-04", "authors": ["FarhanCecil", "MinZhang", "Rosanne MGuijt", "AlanHenderson", "Pavel NNesterenko", "BrettPaull", "Michael CBreadmore", "MirekMacka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aca.2017.02.020"}

By patterning paper with hydrophobic barriers, the transport of fluids can be controlled and directed within a layer of paper. Moreover, stacking multiple layers of patterned paper creates sophisticated three-dimensional microfluidic networks that can support the development of analytical and bioanalytical assays. Paper-based microfluidic devices are inexpensive, portable, easy to use, and require no external equipment to operate. As a result, they hold great promise as a platform for point-of-care diagnostics. In order to properly evaluate the utility and analytical performance of paper-based devices, suitable methods must be developed to ensure their manufacture is reproducible and at a scale that is appropriate for laboratory settings. In this manuscript, a method to fabricate a general device architecture that can be used for paper-based immunoassays is described. We use a form of additive manufacturing (multi-layer lamination) to prepare devices that comprise multiple layers of patterned paper and patterned adhesive. In addition to demonstrating the proper use of these three-dimensional paper-based microfluidic devices with an immunoassay for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), errors in the manufacturing process that may result in device failures are discussed.

We design reversible, deployable structures that are fabricated flat, have defined load bearing capacity, and multiple, predictable activated geometries. These structures are designed with a hierarchical framework where the proposed bistable actuator serves as the base building block. The actuator is designed to maximise its stroke length, with the expansion ratio approaching one when serially connected. The activation force of the actuator is parameterised through its joint material and joint length. Simulation and experimental results show that the bistability triggering force can be tuned between 0.5 and 5.0\u2009N. Incorporating this bistable actuator, the first group of hierarchical designs demonstrate the deployment of space frame structures with a tetrahedron module consisting of three active edges, each containing four serially connected actuators. The second group shows the design of flat structures that assume either positive or negative Gaussian curvature once activated. By flipping the initial configuration of the unit actuators, structures such as a dome and an enclosure are demonstrated.

However, bioceramic sphere-based scaffolds fabricated by this method have never been reported. Due to high melting temperature of bioceramic, only limited diffusion rate can be achieved when sintering the bioceramic spheres, which is far from enough to form robust bonding between spheres. In the present study, for the first time we fabricated 3D interconnected \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate ceramic sphere-based (PG/TCP) scaffolds by introducing phosphate-based glass (PG) as sintering additive and placing uniaxial pressure during the sintering process. The sintering mechanism of PG/TCP scaffolds was unveiled. The PG/TCP scaffolds had hierarchical pore structure, which was composed by interconnected macropores (>200 \u03bcm) among spheres, pores (20\u2013120 \u03bcm) in the interior of spheres, and micropores (1\u20133 \u03bcm) among the grains. During the sintering process, partial PG reacted with \u03b2-TCP, forming \u03b2-Ca2P2O7; metal ions from PG substituted to Ca2+ sites of \u03b2-TCP. The mechanical properties (compressive strength 2.8\u201310.6 MPa; compressive modulus 190\u2013620 MPa) and porosity (30%\u201350%) of scaffolds could be tailored by manipulating the sintering temperatures.

{"title": "A multifunctional bioactive material that stimulates osteogenesis and promotes the vascularization bone marrow stem cells and their resistance to bacterial infection.", "abstract": "The main limitation of tissue engineering lies in the inability to stimulate osteogenesis, angiogenesis of stem cells and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. However, the development of multifunctional bioactive materials with these capabilities remains a great challenge. In this study, we prepared mesoporous silica nanoparticles encapsulated with silver nanocrystals (AG-MSN) with uniform sphere size and mesopores. Platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) was effectively loaded in the AG-MSN mesopores (P-AG-MSN). The silicon ions (Si) released by P-AG-MSN stimulate osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) by activating the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of bone-related genes and increasing protein (OCN, RUNX2 and OPN) expression. Ag+ ions could be slowly released from the interior of the shell, highlighting their durable antibacterial activity. The sustained release of PDGF-BB from P-AG-MSN stimulated the angiogenic differentiation of BMSC, as indicated by the enhanced secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), HIF-1\u03b1, HGF and ANG-1 and protein expression. Our results show that P-AG-MSN can clearly promote BMSC osteostimulation and vascularization.

{"title": "Harnessing endogenous signals from hepatocytes using a low volume multi-well plate.", "abstract": "Hepatocytes are highly differentiated epithelial cells that lose their phenotype and function when removed from the in vivo environment. Given the importance of hepatic cultures for drug toxicity, bioartificial liver assist devices and basic biology studies, considerable efforts have been focused on the maintenance of hepatic function in vitro. The methods used to date include co-cultivation of hepatocytes with stromal cells, organizing these cells into spheroids and imbedding them into bioactive gels. Our team has recently demonstrated that primary rat hepatocytes confined to microfluidic channels in the absence of convection maintained the epithelial phenotype through upregulation of endogenous signals including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The objective of the present study was to transition from microfluidic devices, which are somewhat specialized and challenging to use, towards low volume multiwell plates ubiquitous in biology laboratories. Using a combination of 3D printing and micromolding we have constructed inserts that can be placed into standard 12-well plates and can be used to create low volume culture conditions under which primary hepatocytes maintained a differentiated phenotype. This phenotype enhancement was confirmed by hepatic function assays including albumin synthesis and expression. Importantly we confirmed upregulation of HGF inside the low volume culture plates and demonstrated that inhibition of HGF signaling degraded the hepatic phenotype in our cell culture platform. Overall, this study outlines a new cell culture system that leverages the low volume effects of microfluidic channels in a multiwell plate format. Beyond hepatocytes, such a system may be of use in the maintenance of other difficult-to-culture cells including stem cells and primary cancer cells.", "journal": "Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro", "date": "2017-03-30", "authors": ["PanteaGheibi", "Kyung JinSon", "GulnazStybayeva", "AlexanderRevzin"], "doi": "10.1039/c7ib00010c"}

In the case of retinal degeneration and associated photoreceptor cell therapy, polymer scaffolds are critical for cellular survival and integration; however, prior attempts to materialize this concept have been unsuccessful in part due to the materials' inability to guide cell alignment. In this work, we used two-photon polymerization to create 180\u03bcm wide non-degradable prototype photoreceptor scaffolds with varying pore sizes, slicing distances, hatching distances and hatching types. Hatching distance and hatching type were significant factors for the error of vertical pore diameter, while slicing distance and hatching type most affected the integrity and geometry of horizontal pores. We optimized printing parameters in terms of structural integrity and printing time in order to create 1mm wide scaffolds for cell loading studies. We fabricated these larger structures directly on a porous membrane with 3\u00b5m diameter pores and seeded them with human iPSC-derived retinal progenitor cells. After two days in culture, cells nested in and extended neuronal processes parallel to the vertical pores of the scaffolds, with maximum cell loading occurring in 25\u03bcm diameter pores. These results highlight the feasibility of using this technique as part of an autologous stem cell strategy for restoring vision to patients affected with retinal degenerative diseases.\nCell replacement therapy is an important goal for investigators aiming to restore neural function to those suffering from neurodegenerative disease. Cell delivery scaffolds are frequently necessary for the success of such treatments, but traditional biomaterials often fail to facilitate the neuronal orientation and close packing needed to recapitulate the in vivo environment. Here, we use two-photon polymerization to create prototype cell scaffolds with densely packed vertical pores for photoreceptor cell loading and small, interconnected horizontal pores for nutrient diffusion. This study offers a thorough characterization of how two-photon polymerization parameters affect final structural outcomes and printing time. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using two-photon polymerization to create scaffolds that can align neuronal cells in 3D and are large enough to be used for transplantation.

This study addresses the design and fabrication of 3D PCL constructs with different struts alignments at 90\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 with offset. The morphology and the mechanical behavior under uniaxial compressive load were assessed at different strain percentages. The combination of a new compressionCT device and micro computed tomography (micro-CT) allowed understanding the influence of pore geometry under controlled compressive strain in the mechanical and structural behavior of PCL constructs. Finite element analysis (FEA) was applied using the micro-CT data to modulate the mechanical response and compare with the conventional uniaxial compression tests. Scanning electron microscopic analysis showed a very high level of reproducibility and a low error comparing with the theoretical values, confirming that the alignment and the dimensional features of the printed struts are reliable. The mechanical tests showed that the 90\u00b0 architecture presented the highest stiffness. With the compressionCT device was observed that the 90\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 with offset architectures presented similar values of porosity at same strain and similar pore size, contrary to the 45\u00b0 architecture. Thus, pore geometric configurations affected significantly the deformability of the all PCL scaffolds under compression. The prediction of the FEA showed a good agreement to the conventional mechanical tests revealing the areas more affected under compression load.

Particularly, solidification of powder, extrusion, and stereolithography have been applied to the manufacturing of drug products. The main challenge to their exploitation for personalized pharmacologic therapy is likely to be related to the regulatory issues involved and to implementation of production models that may allow to efficiently turn the therapeutic needs of individual patients into small batches of appropriate drug products meeting preset quality requirements.", "journal": "Journal of pharmaceutical sciences", "date": "2017-03-30", "authors": ["LuciaZema", "AliceMelocchi", "AlessandraMaroni", "AndreaGazzaniga"], "doi": "10.1016/j.xphs.2017.03.021"}
{"title": "Rapid and Low-Cost CRP Measurement by Integrating a Paper-Based Microfluidic Immunoassay with Smartphone (CRP-Chip).", "abstract": "Traditional diagnostic tests for chronic diseases are expensive and require a specialized laboratory, therefore limiting their use for point-of-care (PoC) testing. To address this gap, we developed a method for rapid and low-cost C-reactive protein (CRP) detection from blood by integrating a paper-based microfluidic immunoassay with a smartphone (CRP-Chip). We chose CRP for this initial development because it is a strong biomarker of prognosis in chronic heart and kidney disease. The microfluidic immunoassay is realized by lateral flow and gold nanoparticle-based colorimetric detection of the target protein. The test image signal is acquired and analyzed using a commercial smartphone with an attached microlens and a 3D-printed chip-phone interface. The CRP-Chip was validated for detecting CRP in blood samples from chronic kidney disease patients and healthy subjects. The linear detection range of the CRP-Chip is up to 2 \u03bcg/mL and the detection limit is 54 ng/mL. The CRP-Chip test result yields high reproducibility and is consistent with the standard ELISA kit. A single CRP-Chip can perform the test in triplicate on a single chip within 15 min for less than 50 US cents of material cost. This CRP-Chip with attractive features of low-cost, fast test speed, and integrated easy operation with smartphones has the potential to enable future clinical PoC chronic disease diagnosis and risk stratification by parallel measurements of a panel of protein biomarkers.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-03-28", "authors": ["MeiliDong", "JiandongWu", "ZiminMa", "HagitPeretz-Soroka", "MichaelZhang", "PaulKomenda", "NavdeepTangri", "YongLiu", "ClaudioRigatto", "FrancisLin"], "doi": "10.3390/s17040684\n10.1016/j.phr.2004.04.005\n10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9\n10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61696-1\n10.2165/0129784-200808060-00004\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2004.03.023\n10.1053/j.ajkd.2014.07.026\n10.1172/JCI83470\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aac7071\n10.1097/MNH.0b013e32835846e3\n10.1039/c2lc40630f\n10.1007/s00216-014-7756-1\n10.1016/j.addr.2013.09.013\n10.1016/j.aca.2008.01.064\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2005.03.008\n10.1021/ac9013989\n10.1016/j.copbio.2013.09.004\n10.1073/pnas.0810903105\n10.1016/j.ab.2006.12.008\n10.1039/C2LC40690J\n10.1039/c2lc21299d\n10.1002/adhm.201300575\n10.1039/C5LC01524C\n10.1039/c2lc90022j\n10.1021/ac800112r\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.508465\n10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.00455.x\n10.1056/NEJMoa041031\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.964171\n10.1093/ndt/gfp568\n10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61236-2\n10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.08.039\n10.1016/S0272-6386(04)01080-7\n10.1681/ASN.2005091012\n10.1002/adma.201100464\n10.1007/s00216-010-3678-8\n10.1039/C2LC40690J\n10.1039/c2lc21204h\n10.1039/c2lc41016h\n10.1021/acs.analchem.6b01427\n10.1016/j.bios.2013.10.004\n10.1016/S0009-8981(03)00113-X"}

In Japan, three-dimensional (3D) preoperative simulation for liver surgery is becoming increasingly common, and liver 3D modeling and 3D hepatectomy simulation by 3D analysis software for liver surgery have been covered by universal healthcare insurance since 2012. Herein, we review the history of virtual hepatectomy using computer-assisted surgery (CAS) and our research to date, and we discuss the future prospects of CAS. We have used the SYNAPSE VINCENT medical imaging system (Fujifilm Medical, Tokyo, Japan) for 3D visualization and virtual resection of the liver since 2010. We developed a novel fusion imaging technique combining 3D computed tomography (CT) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The fusion image enables us to easily visualize anatomic relationships among the hepatic arteries, portal veins, bile duct, and tumor in the hepatic hilum. In 2013, we developed an original software, called Liversim, which enables real-time deformation of the liver using physical simulation, and a randomized control trial has recently been conducted to evaluate the use of Liversim and SYNAPSE VINCENT for preoperative simulation and planning. Furthermore, we developed a novel hollow 3D-printed liver model whose surface is covered with frames. This model is useful for safe liver resection, has better visibility, and the production cost is reduced to one-third of a previous model. Preoperative simulation and navigation with CAS in liver resection are expected to help planning and conducting a surgery and surgical education. Thus, a novel CAS system will contribute to not only the performance of reliable hepatectomy but also to surgical education.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The biosensors function by recognizing the highly expressed tumor marker CD133, which is located on the surface of liver cancer cells. Detection was achieved by recrystallizing a recombinant S-layer fusion protein (rSbpA/ZZ) on the surface of the sensors. The fused ZZ-domain enables immobilization of the anti-CD133 antibody in a defined manner. These highly accessible anti-CD133 antibodies were employed as a sensing layer, thereby enabling the efficient detection of liver cancer cells (HepG2). The recognition of HepG2 cells was investigated in situ using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), which enabled the label-free, real-time detection of living cells on the modified sensor surface under controlled conditions. Furthermore, the hybrid 3D additive printing strategy for biosensors facilitates both rapid development and small-scale manufacturing. The hybrid strategy of combining 3D-printed parts and more traditionally fabricated parts enables the use of optimal materials: a ceramic substrate with noble metals for the sensing element and 3D-printed capillary channels to guide and constrain the clinical sample. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements confirmed the efficiency of the fabricated sensors. Most importantly, these sensors offer low-cost and disposable detection platforms for real-world applications.

{"title": "3D printing for the design and fabrication of polymer-based gradient scaffolds.", "abstract": "To accurately mimic the native tissue environment, tissue engineered scaffolds often need to have a highly controlled and varied display of three-dimensional (3D) architecture and geometrical cues. Additive manufacturing in tissue engineering has made possible the development of complex scaffolds that mimic the native tissue architectures. As such, architectural details that were previously unattainable or irreproducible can now be incorporated in an ordered and organized approach, further advancing the structural and chemical cues delivered to cells interacting with the scaffold. This control over the environment has given engineers the ability to unlock cellular machinery that is highly dependent upon the intricate heterogeneous environment of native tissue. Recent research into the incorporation of physical and chemical gradients within scaffolds indicates that integrating these features improves the function of a tissue engineered construct. This review covers recent advances on techniques to incorporate gradients into polymer scaffolds through additive manufacturing and evaluate the success of these techniques. As covered here, to best replicate different tissue types, one must be cognizant of the vastly different types of manufacturing techniques available to create these gradient scaffolds. We review the various types of additive manufacturing techniques that can be leveraged to fabricate scaffolds with heterogeneous properties and discuss methods to successfully characterize them.\nAdditive manufacturing techniques have given tissue engineers the ability to precisely recapitulate the native architecture present within tissue. In addition, these techniques can be leveraged to create scaffolds with both physical and chemical gradients. This work offers insight into several techniques that can be used to generate graded scaffolds, depending on the desired gradient. Furthermore, it outlines methods to determine if the designed gradient was achieved.

One important factor often disregarded is the osmotic pressure to which cells are exposed. An in-house microfluidic system was used to prove that addition of an osmotic regulator significantly benefits the generation of viable cell-laden hydrogels under harsh processing conditions. Human adipose-derived stem cells were resuspended in 1.5% alginate and 1% gellan gum (GG; w/v) solutions containing different concentrations (0.12\u00a0m, 0.25\u00a0m and 1.5\u00a0m) of sucrose as osmotic regulator. GG (in water) and alginate (in water or phosphate-buffered saline) solutions were used to vary the conditions under which cells were kept prior processing. Independently of the polymer, addition of sucrose did not affect the processing conditions or the viscosity of the solutions, except at 1.5\u00a0m. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that inclusion of 0.25\u00a0m sucrose during processing of the cell-laden hydrogels allowed to keep cell viability around 80%, in opposition to the 20% observed in its absence, both for GG and alginate-derived hydrogels prepared in water. Impressively, the level of cell viability observed with the inclusion of 0.25\u00a0m sucrose, 76% for GG and 86% for alginate, was similar to that obtained with the standard alginate solution prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (82%).

{"title": "", "abstract": "The ability to noninvasively assess skeletal muscle microstructure, which predicts function and disease, would be of significant clinical value. One method that holds this promise is diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI), which is sensitive to the microscopic diffusion of water within tissues and has become ubiquitous in neuroimaging as a way of assessing neuronal structure and damage. However, its application to the assessment of changes in muscle microstructure associated with injury, pathology, or age remains poorly defined, because it is difficult to precisely control muscle microstructural features in vivo. However, recent advances in additive manufacturing technologies allow precision-engineered diffusion phantoms with histology informed skeletal muscle geometry to be manufactured. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop skeletal muscle phantoms at relevant size scales to relate microstructural features to MRI-based diffusion measurements. A digital light projection based rapid 3D printing method was used to fabricate polyethylene glycol diacrylate based diffusion phantoms with (1) idealized muscle geometry (no geometry; fiber sizes of 30, 50, or 70\u2009\u03bcm or fiber size of 50\u2009\u03bcm with 40% of walls randomly deleted) or (2) histology-based geometry (normal and after 30-days of denervation) containing 20% or 50% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

However, existing bioinks, which are usually composed of polymeric biomaterials, are poorly conductive and delay efficient electrical coupling between adjacent cardiac cells. To solve this problem, we developed a gold nanorod (GNR) incorporated gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-based bioink for printing 3D functional cardiac tissue constructs. The GNR concentration was adjusted to create a proper microenvironment for the spreading and organization of cardiac cells. At optimized concentration of GNR, the nanocomposite bioink had a low viscosity, similar to pristine inks, which allowed for the easy integration of cells at high densities. As a result, rapid deposition of cell-laden fibers at a high resolution was possible, while reducing shear stress on the encapsulated cells. In the printed GNR constructs, cardiac cells showed improved cell adhesion and organization when compared to the constructs without GNRs. Furthermore, the incorporated GNRs bridged the electrically resistant pore walls of polymers, improved the cell-to-cell coupling, and promoted synchronized contraction of the bioprinted constructs. Given its advantageous properties, this gold nanocomposite bioink may find wide application in cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Advanced functional materials", "date": "2017-03-24", "authors": ["KaiZhu", "Su RyonShin", "Timvan Kempen", "Yi-ChenLi", "VidhyaPonraj", "AmirNasajpour", "SerenaMandla", "NingHu", "XiaoLiu", "JeroenLeijten", "Yi-DongLin", "Mohammad AsifHussain", "Yu ShrikeZhang", "AliTamayol", "AliKhademhosseini"], "doi": "10.1002/adfm.201605352"}
{"title": "Magnetically Bioprinted Human Myometrial 3D Cell Rings as A Model for Uterine Contractility.", "abstract": "Deregulation in uterine contractility can cause common pathological disorders of the female reproductive system, including preterm labor, infertility, inappropriate implantation, and irregular menstrual cycle. A better understanding of human myometrium contractility is essential to designing and testing interventions for these important clinical problems. Robust studies on the physiology of human uterine contractions require in vitro models, utilizing a human source. Importantly, uterine contractility is a three-dimensionally (3D)-coordinated phenomenon and should be studied in a 3D environment. Here, we propose and assess for the first time a 3D in vitro model for the evaluation of human uterine contractility. Magnetic 3D bioprinting is applied to pattern human myometrium cells into rings, which are then monitored for contractility over time and as a function of various clinically relevant agents. Commercially available and patient-derived myometrium cells were magnetically bioprinted into rings in 384-well formats for throughput uterine contractility analysis. The bioprinted uterine rings from various cell origins and patients show different patterns of contractility and respond differently to clinically relevant uterine contractility inhibitors, indomethacin and nifedipine.

In the present study, a bilayer deposition of natural biopolymer (silk fibroin) and synthetic polymer (polyvinyl alcohol) solution with 58s bioactive glass sol was done by free liquid surface electrospinning and further stabilized through ethanol washing to fabricate novel nanofibrous composite scaffold. The fabricated composite scaffold possesses superior stiffness, hydrophilicity, bioactivity and superior osteogenic potential. The scaffolds were characterized for its fiber diameter distribution, hydrophilicity, tensile strength and apatite forming ability. Field emission scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope analysis demonstrate the apatite like particle formation over the scaffold after treatment with simulated body fluid, which improved osteogenicity of the developed scaffold. The biocompatibility, biomineralization and osteogenic potential of composite scaffold were evaluated by cell culture study using cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells, proving that the developed composite scaffold is biocompatible and possess excellent osteogenic potential for neo bone tissue regeneration.

The multilayer sensor comprises of an ionic liquid-based piezoresistive intermediate layer in between carbon nanotube (CNT)-based stretchable electrodes. A sensor containing an array of different sensing units was embedded on the inner liner surface of a 3D printed tire to provide with force information at different points of contact between the tire and road.

Icing has traditionally been used to treat such injuries under the premise that it alleviates pain, reduces tissue metabolism, and modifies vascular responses to decrease swelling. Previous research has examined the effects of icing on inflammation and microcirculatory dynamics following muscle injury. However, whether icing influences angiogenesis, collateral vessel growth, or myofiber regeneration remains unknown. We compared the effects of icing vs. a sham treatment on the presence of neutrophils and macrophages; expression of CD34, von Willebrands factor (vWF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and nestin; vessel volume; capillary density; and myofiber regeneration in skeletal after muscle contusion injury in rats. Muscle tissue was collected 1, 3, 7, and 28 d after injury. Compared with uninjured rats, muscles in rats that sustained the contusion injury exhibited major necrosis, inflammation, and increased expression of CD34, vWF, VEGF, and nestin.

{"title": "A comparative study of bio-inspired protective scales using 3D printing and mechanical testing.", "abstract": "Flexible natural armors from fish, alligators or armadillo are attracting an increasing amount of attention for their unique combinations of hardness, flexibility and light weight. The extreme contrast of stiffness between hard scales and surrounding soft tissues gives rise to unusual and attractive mechanisms, which now serve as models for the design of bio-inspired armors. Despite this growing interest, there is little guideline for the choice of materials, optimum thickness, size, shape and arrangement for the protective scales. In this work, we explore how the geometry and arrangement of hard scales can be tailored to promote scale-scale interactions. We use 3D printing to fabricate arrays of scales with increasingly complex geometries and arrangements, from simple squares with no overlap to complex ganoid-scales with overlaps and interlocking features. We performed puncture tests and flexural tests on each of the 3D printed materials, and we report the puncture resistance - compliance characteristics of each design on an Ashby chart. The interactions between the scales can significantly increase the resistance to puncture, and these interactions can be maximized by tuning the geometry and arrangement of the scales. Interestingly, the designs that offer the best combinations of puncture resistance and flexural compliance are similar to the geometry and arrangement of natural teleost and ganoid scales, which suggests that natural evolution has shaped these systems to maximize flexible protection. This study yields new insights into the mechanisms of natural dermal armor, and also suggests new designs for personal protective systems.\nFlexible natural armors from fishes, alligators or armadillos are attracting an increasing amount of attention for their unique and attractive combinations of hardness, flexibility and low weight.

A microfluidic device containing an integrated porous membrane and embedded liquid reagents was made by 3D printing and applied for the analysis of nitrate in soil. The manufacture of the integrated, sealed device was realized as a single print within 30 min. The body of the device was printed in transparent acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and contained a 400 \u03bcm wide structure printed from a commercially available composite filament. The composite filament can be turned into a porous material through dissolution of a water-soluble material. Liquid reagents were integrated by briefly pausing the printing before resuming for sealing the device. The devices were evaluated by the determination of nitrate in a soil slurry containing zinc particles for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite using the Griess reagent. Using a consumer digital camera, the linear range of the detector response ranged from 0 to 60 ppm, covering the normal range of nitrate in soil. To ensure that the sealing of the reagent chamber is maintained, aqueous reagents should be avoided. When using the nonaqueous reagent, the multimaterial device containing the Griess reagent could be stored for over 4 days but increased the detection range to 100-500 ppm.

{"title": "3D bioprint me: a socioethical view of bioprinting human organs and tissues.", "abstract": "In this article, we review the extant social science and ethical literature on three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting. 3D bioprinting has the potential to be a 'game-changer', printing human organs on demand, no longer necessitating the need for living or deceased human donation or animal transplantation. Although the technology is not yet at the level required to bioprint an entire organ, 3D bioprinting may have a variety of other mid-term and short-term benefits that also have positive ethical consequences, for example, creating alternatives to animal testing, filling a therapeutic need for minors and avoiding species boundary crossing. Despite a lack of current socioethical engagement with the consequences of the technology, we outline what we see as some preliminary practical, ethical and regulatory issues that need tackling. These relate to managing public expectations and the continuing reliance on technoscientific solutions to diseases that affect high-income countries. Avoiding prescribing a course of action for the way forward in terms of research agendas, we do briefly outline one possible ethical framework 'Responsible Research Innovation' as an oversight model should 3D bioprinting promises are ever realised. 3D bioprinting has a lot to offer in the course of time should it move beyond a conceptual therapy, but is an area that requires ethical oversight and regulation and debate, in the here and now.

The organ molds were molded with deformable gels made of different mixtures of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and the softener dioctyl terephthalate. Gels with different densities were obtained by a polynomial fitting curve that described the relation between the Hounsfield unit (HU) and PVC-softener blending ratio. The rigid vertebras were constructed by molding of white cement and cellulose pulp. The final abdominal phantom was assembled by arranging all the fabricated organs inside a hollow dummy according to their anatomies, and sealed by deformable gel with averaged HU of muscle and fat. Fiducial landmarks were embedded inside the phantom for spatial accuracy and dose accumulation accuracy studies. Two channels were excavated to facilitate ionization chamber insertion for dosimetric measurements. Phantom properties such as deformable gel elasticity and HU stability were studied. The dosimetric measurement accuracy in the phantom was performed, and the DIR accuracies of three DIR algorithms available in the open source DIR toolkit-DIRART were also validated.\nThe constructed deformable gel showed elastic behavior and was stable in HU values over times, proving to be a practical material for the deformable phantom. The constructed abdominal phantom consisted of realistic anatomies in terms of both anatomical shapes and densities when compared with its reference patient. The dosimetric measurements showed a good agreement with the calculated doses from the treatment planning system. Fiducial-based accuracy analysis conducted on the constructed phantom demonstrated the feasibility of applying the phantom for organ-wise DIR accuracy assessment.\nWe have designed and constructed an anthropomorphic abdominal deformable phantom with satisfactory elastic property, realistic organ density, and anatomy.

{"title": "The case for applying tissue engineering methodologies to instruct human organoid morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) derivatives have become widely used in vitro models for studying development and disease. Their ability to recapitulate facets of normal human development during in vitro morphogenesis produces tissue structures with unprecedented biomimicry. Current organoid derivation protocols primarily rely on spontaneous morphogenesis processes to occur within 3-D spherical cell aggregates with minimal to no exogenous control. This yields organoids containing microscale regions of biomimetic tissues, but at the macroscale (i.e. 100's of microns to millimeters), the organoids' morphology, cytoarchitecture, and cellular composition are non-biomimetic and variable. The current lack of control over in vitro organoid morphogenesis at the microscale induces aberrations at the macroscale, which impedes realization of the technology's potential to reproducibly form anatomically correct human tissue units that could serve as optimal human in vitro models and even transplants. Here, we review tissue engineering methodologies that could be used to develop powerful approaches for instructing multiscale, 3-D human organoid morphogenesis. Such technological mergers are critically needed to harness organoid morphogenesis as a tool for engineering functional human tissues with biomimetic anatomy and physiology.\nHuman PSC-derived 3-D organoids are revolutionizing the biomedical sciences. They enable the study of development and disease within patient-specific genetic backgrounds and unprecedented biomimetic tissue microenvironments. However, their uncontrolled, spontaneous morphogenesis at the microscale yields inconsistences in macroscale organoid morphology, cytoarchitecture, and cellular composition that limits their standardization and application. Integration of tissue engineering methods with organoid derivation protocols could allow us to harness their potential by instructing standardized in vitro morphogenesis to generate organoids with biomimicry at all scales. Such advancements would enable the use of organoids as a basis for 'next-generation' tissue engineering of functional, anatomically mimetic human tissues and potentially novel organ transplants.

To overcome the obstacle of 3D-printed microchips in performing long-term reactions caused by their porousness and gas permeability properties in chip body, we developed a two-step postprocessing method, including paraffin filling and parylene coating, to achieve high sealability and stability. We also developed a simple method especially suitable for controlling the vapor diffusion speed of nanoliter-scale droplets by changing the layer thickness of covering oil. With the above methods, 84 tests of nanoliter-scale protein crystallization under vapor diffusion mode were successfully achieved in the 7 \u00d7 12 droplet array chip with a protein consumption of 10 nL for each test, which is 20-100 times lower than that in the conventional large-volume screening system.

In addition to the laser induced alloying of particulates in the form of micro/nanopowders in ambient atmosphere (which forms the basis of the field of additive manufacturing technology), another interesting problem is the laser-induced alloying of a mixture of single-element nanoparticles in liquids since this process may lead to the direct fabrication of alloyed-nanoparticle colloidal solutions. In this work, bare-surface ligand-free Ag and Pd nanoparticles in solution were prepared by laser ablation of the corresponding bulk target materials, separately in water. The two solutions were mixed and the mixed solution was laser irradiated for different time durations in order to investigate the laser-induced nanoparticles alloying in liquid. Nanoparticles alloying and the formation of AgPd alloyed nanoparticles takes place with a decrease of the intensity of the surface-plasmon resonance peak of the Ag nanoparticles (at \u223c405 nm) with the irradiation time while the low wavelength interband absorption peaks of either Ag or Pd nanoparticles remain unaffected by the irradiation for a time duration even as long as 30 min. The nanoalloys have lattice constants with values between those of the pure metals, which indicates that they consist of Ag and Pd in an approximately 1:1 ratio similar to the atomic composition of the starting mixed-nanoparticle solution. Formation of nanoparticle networks consisting of bimetallic alloyed nanoparticles and nanoparticles that remain as single elements (even after the end of the irradiation), joining together, are also formed. The binding energies of the 3d core electrons of both Ag and Pd nanoparticles shift to lower energies with the irradiation time, which is also a typical characteristic of AgPd alloyed nanoparticles. The mechanisms of nanoparticles alloying and network formation are also discussed.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2017-03-18", "authors": ["N GSemaltianos", "RChassagnon", "VMoutarlier", "VBlondeau-Patissier", "MAssoul", "GMonteil"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/aa6282"}

Recent evidence indicates that adult stem cell therapies involving cardiovascular regeneration represent promising strategies to treat cardiovascular diseases. Owing to their immunomodulatory properties and vascular repair capabilities, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are strong candidate therapeutic stem cells for use in cardiovascular regeneration. However, major limitations must be overcome, including their very low survival rate in ischemic lesion. Various attempts have been made to improve the poor survival and longevity of engrafted MSCs. In order to develop novel therapeutic strategies, it is necessary to first identify stem cell modulators for intracellular signal triggering or niche activation. One promising therapeutic strategy is the priming of therapeutic MSCs with stem cell modulators before transplantation.

While modern medical imaging technologies provide highly accurate patient modeling, there are times when a patient's anatomy cannot be fully captured or there is a lack of easy access to computed tomography (CT) simulation. Here, we provide a practical solution to the surface contour truncation problem by using a handheld stereo depth camera (HSDC) to obtain the missing surface anatomy and a surface-surface image registration to stich the surface data into the CT dataset for treatment planning.\nFor a subject with truncated simulation CT images, a HSDC is used to capture the surface information of the truncated anatomy. A mesh surface model is created using a software tool provided by the camera manufacturer. A surface-to-surface registration technique is used to merge the mesh model with the CT and fill in the missing surface information thereby obtaining a complete surface model of the subject. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach, experiments were performed with the following steps. First, we selected three previously treated patients and fabricated a phantom mimicking each patient using the corresponding CT images and a 3D printer. Second, we removed part of the CT images of each patient to create hypothetical cases with image truncations. Next, a HSDC was used to image the 3D-printed phantoms and the HSDC-derived surface models were registered with the hypothetically truncated CT images. The contours obtained using the approach were then compared with the ground truth contours derived from the original simulation CT without image truncation. The distance between the two contours was calculated in order to evaluate the accuracy of the method. Finally, the dosimetric impact of the approach is assessed by comparing the volume within the 95% isodose line and global maximum dose (D\nA systematic strategy of using a 3D HSDC to compensate for missing surface information caused by the truncation of CT images was established. Our study showed that the proposed technique was able to reliably provide the full contours for treatment planning in the case of severe CT image truncation(s).

The average distance between the two models was 0.4 \u00b1 1.7 mm (mean \u00b1 SD). Maximum deviations occurred in areas of high concavity or when the skin was close to the couch.

Therefore, we proposed a novel scale-down strategy to deconstruct complex biomatrices into elementary building blocks, which were resembled by thin modular substrate and then evaluated separately in miniaturised bioreactors using various conventional microscopes. In order to investigate cell colonisation within porous substrate in this proof-of-concept study, TEM specimen supporters (10-30 \u03bcm thick) with fine controlled open pores (100\u223c600 \u03bcm) were selected as the modular porous substrate and suspended in 3D printed bioreactor systems. Noninvasive imaging of human dermal fibroblasts cultured on these free-standing substrate using optical microscopes illustrated the complicated dynamic processes used by both individual and coordinated cells to bridge and segment porous structures. Further in situ analysis via SEM and TEM provided high-quality micrographs of cell-cell and cell-scaffold interactions at microscale, depicted cytoskeletal structures in stretched and relaxed areas at nanoscale. Thus this novel scaled-down design was able to improve our mechanistic understanding of tissue formation not only at single- and multiple-cell levels, but also at micro- and nanoscales, which could be difficult to obtain using other methods.\nUnderstanding the complex behaviours of cells cultured within three\u2010dimensional (3D) biomaterials still remains a fundamental challenge for tissue engineers. It is especially difficult to assess the complex relationships between the cells and the biomaterials at single\u2010 or multiple\u2010cell level during tissue culture using common optical microscopes due to their limited focus depth, the relative \u2018large\u2019 size and complex structures of 3D biomaterials.

Today, the availability of three-dimensional (3D) desktop printers allows for the cost-effective production of drill guides by dental laboratories. Our investigations show the accuracy of produced guides by eliminating influencing factors that exist in the guided surgery workflow. To investigate this accuracy, a method was developed to evaluate the CAD/CAM production technology apart from sources of error from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans, intraoral scans, software or human error. By using a CAD/CAM-milled idealized reference model, as well as CAD data from a scanned dental model with integrated reference spheres, drill guides with different offset values were designed using the coDiagnostiX\u00ae implant-planning software. The Bone Level Roxolid\u00ae SLActive\u00ae implant system (length 8 mm, diameter 3.3 mm) was chosen. The virtual position in relation to both the drill guide and the reference model was determined based on the planning data and exported STL files, respectively. Virtual and physical measurements were performed through the center coordinates of the used drill sleeves (T-sleeve: 5 mm), by applying a defined reference coordinate system (RCS) of the dental model. Drill guide templates were printed using a FotoDent\u00ae guide on a dental desktop printer (D30), based on a defined digital workflow. After insertion of the respective drill sleeves, surgical guides were secured on the reference models using quadrangular fixation, thus allowing a tactile measurement by applying a coordinate measurement device for determination of physical position relation. Through the central points of the drill sleeves, both the coronal and apical points of the planned implant drilling as well as angular deviation were calculated and reviewed against the CAD measurements. On average, a deviation of 0.25 degrees of the planned implant was detected.", "journal": "International journal of computerized dentistry", "date": "2017-03-16", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9Neumeister", "LindaSchulz", "ChristophGlodecki"], "doi": null}

We previously developed a hydrogel-based cell culture system that can economically produce large numbers of hPSC spheroids. With hPSCs and this culture system, there are two potential methods to biofabricate a desired tissue. In Method 1, hPSC spheroids are first utilized to biofabricate an hPSC tissue that is subsequently differentiated into the desired tissue.

Herein we systematically evaluated the role of side-wall pore architecture in the direct-ink-writing bioceramic scaffolds on mechanical properties and osteogenic capacity in rabbit calvarial defects. The pure calcium silicate (CSi) and dilute Mg-doped CSi (CSi-Mg6) scaffolds with different layer thickness and macropore sizes were prepared by varying the layer deposition mode from single-layer printing (SLP) to double-layer printing (DLP) and then by undergoing one-, or two-step sintering. It was found that the dilute Mg doping and/or two-step sintering schedule was especially beneficial for improving the compressive strength (\u223c25-104 MPa) and flexural strength (\u223c6-18 MPa) of the Ca-silicate scaffolds. The histological analysis for the calvarial bone specimens in vivo revealed that the SLP scaffolds had a high osteoconduction at the early stage (4 weeks) but the DLP scaffolds displayed a higher osteogenic capacity for a long time stage (8-12 weeks). Although the DLP CSi scaffolds displayed somewhat higher osteogenic capacity at 8 and 12 weeks, the DLP CSi-Mg6 scaffolds with excellent fracture resistance also showed appreciable new bone tissue ingrowth.

Recently, smartphones were successfully used in analytical chemistry as a simple detection tool in some applications. This paper focuses on immobilization of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) onto commercially available pH strips with stabilization in the gelatin membrane. AChE degrades acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid which causes color change of acid-base indicator. Smartphone served as a tool for measurement of indicator color change from red to orange while inhibitors blocked this process. AChE inhibitors were measured with limits of detection, 149\u2009nM and 22.3\u2009nM for galanthamine and donepezil, respectively. Organic solvents were measured for method interferences. Measurement procedure was performed on 3D printed holder and digital photography was evaluated using red-green-blue (RGB) channels. The invented assay was validated to the standard Ellman's test and verified on murine plasma samples spiked with inhibitors.

In this approach, partially cross-linked hollow alginate filaments loading fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells were extruded through a coaxial nozzle and then printed along a rotated rod template, and endothelial cells were seeded into the inner wall. Because of the fusion of adjacent hollow filaments, two-level fluidic channels, including a macro-channel in the middle formed from the cylindrical template and a microchannel around the wall resulted from the hollow filaments were formed. By this method, different shapes of vessellike structures of millimeter diameter were printed. The structures printed using 4% alginate exhibited ultimate strength of 0.184 MPa, and L929 mouse fibroblasts encapsulated in the structures showed over 90% survival within 1 week. As a proof of concept, an envisioned load system of both mechanical and chemical stimulation was demonstrated.

However, standard two-dimensional (2D) display methods do not adequately carry the critical spatial information to reflect CHD anatomy. Three-dimensional (3D) models may be useful in improving the understanding of CHD, without requiring a mastery of cardiac imaging. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of 3D models on how pediatric residents understand and learn about tetralogy of Fallot following a teaching session.\nPediatric residents rotating through an inpatient Cardiology rotation were recruited. The sessions were randomized into using either conventional 2D drawings of tetralogy of Fallot or physical 3D models printed from 3D cardiac imaging data sets (cardiac MR, CT, and 3D echocardiogram). Knowledge acquisition was measured by comparing pre-session and post-session knowledge test scores. Learner satisfaction and self-efficacy ratings were measured with questionnaires filled out by the residents after the teaching sessions. Comparisons between the test scores, learner satisfaction and self-efficacy questionnaires for the two groups were assessed with paired t-test.\nThirty-five pediatric residents enrolled into the study, with no significant differences in background characteristics, including previous clinical exposure to tetralogy of Fallot. The 2D image group (n\u2009=\u200917) and 3D model group (n\u2009=\u200918) demonstrated similar knowledge acquisition in post-test scores. Residents who were taught with 3D models gave a higher composite learner satisfaction scores (P\u2009=\u20090.03). The 3D model group also had higher self-efficacy aggregate scores, but the difference was not statistically significant (P\u2009=\u20090.39).\nPhysical 3D models enhance resident education around the topic of tetralogy of Fallot by improving learner satisfaction.

{"title": "Comparing Microfluidic Performance of Three-Dimensional (3D) Printing Platforms.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing has emerged as a potential revolutionary technology for the fabrication of microfluidic devices. A direct experimental comparison of the three 3D printing technologies dominating microfluidics was conducted using a Y-junction microfluidic device, the design of which was optimized for each printer: fused deposition molding (FDM), Polyjet, and digital light processing stereolithography (DLP-SLA). Printer performance was evaluated in terms of feature size, accuracy, and suitability for mass manufacturing; laminar flow was studied to assess their suitability for microfluidics. FDM was suitable for microfabrication with minimum features of 321 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm, and rough surfaces of 10.97 \u03bcm. Microfluidic devices >500 \u03bcm, rapid mixing (71% \u00b1 12% after 5 mm, 100 \u03bcL/min) was observed, indicating a strength in fabricating micromixers. Polyjet fabricated channels with a minimum size of 205 \u00b1 13 \u03bcm, and a surface roughness of 0.99 \u03bcm. Compared with FDM, mixing decreased (27% \u00b1 10%), but Polyjet printing is more suited for microfluidic applications where flow splitting is not required, such as cell culture or droplet generators. DLP-SLA fabricated a minimum channel size of 154 \u00b1 10 \u03bcm, and 94 \u00b1 7 \u03bcm for positive structures such as soft lithography templates, with a roughness of 0.35 \u03bcm. These results, in addition to low mixing (8% \u00b1 1%), showed suitability for microfabrication, and microfluidic applications requiring precise control of flow.

We decided to validate the pre-operative use of 3D-printed anatomical models in patients with solid organs' diseases as a new tool to deliver morphological information.\nFifteen patients scheduled for laparoscopic splenectomy, nephrectomy, or pancreatectomy were selected and, for each, a full-size 3D virtual anatomical object was reconstructed from a contrast-enhanced MDCT (Multiple Detector Computed Tomography) and then prototyped using a 3D printer. After having carefully evaluated-in a random sequence-conventional contrast MDCT scans, virtual 3D reconstructions on a flat monitor, and 3D-printed models of the same anatomy for each selected case, thirty subjects with different expertise in radiological imaging (10 medical students, 10 surgeons and 10 radiologists) were administered a multiple-item questionnaire. Crucial issues for the anatomical understanding and the pre-operative planning of the scheduled procedure were addressed.\nThe visual and tactile inspection of 3D models allowed the best anatomical understanding, with faster and clearer comprehension of the surgical anatomy.

The aim of this study is to investigate the use of 3D bioprinting in a clinically relevant setting to evaluate the potential of this technique for in vivo chondrogenesis.\nThirty-six nude mice (Balb-C, female) received a 5- \u00d7 5- \u00d7 1-mm piece of bioprinted cell-laden nanofibrillated cellulose/alginate construct in a subcutaneous pocket. Four groups of printed constructs were used: (1) human (male) nasal chondrocytes (hNCs), (2) human (female) bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs), (3) coculture of hNCs and hBMSCs in a 20/80 ratio, and (4) Cell-free scaffolds (blank). After 14, 30, and 60 days, the scaffolds were harvested for histological, immunohistochemical, and mechanical analysis.\nThe constructs had good mechanical properties and keep their structural integrity after 60 days of implantation. For both the hNC constructs and the cocultured constructs, a gradual increase of glycosaminoglycan production and hNC proliferation was observed. However, the cocultured group showed a more pronounced cell proliferation and enhanced deposition of human collagen II demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis.\nIn vivo chondrogenesis in a 3D bioprinted human cell-laden hydrogel construct has been demonstrated. The trophic role of the hBMSCs in stimulating hNC proliferation and matrix deposition in the coculture group suggests the potential of 3D bioprinting of human cartilage for future application in reconstructive surgery.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

In this study, a plaque phantom is developed and characterized that provides a platform for establishing a uniform imaging approach for ICAD.\nA patient specific injection mold was 3D printed to construct a geometrically accurate ICAD phantom. Polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel was infused into the core shell mold to form the stenotic artery. The ICAD phantom incorporated materials mimicking a stenotic vessel and plaque components, including fibrous cap and lipid core. Two phantoms were scanned using high resolution cone beam CT and compared with four different 3 T MRI systems across eight different sites over a period of 18\u2005months. Inter-phantom variability was assessed by lumen dimensions and contrast to noise ratio (CNR).\nQuantitative evaluation of the minimum lumen radius in the stenosis showed that the radius was on average 0.80\u2005mm (95% CI 0.77 to 0.82 mm) in model 1 and 0.77\u2005mm (95% CI 0.74 to 0.81 mm) in model 2.

The poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffold is a promising material for meniscal tissue regeneration, but cell-free scaffolds result in relatively poor tissue regeneration and lead to joint degeneration.\nA novel, 3-dimensional (3D)-printed PCL scaffold augmented with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would offer benefits in meniscal regeneration and cartilage protection.\nControlled laboratory study.\nPCL meniscal scaffolds were 3D printed and seeded with bone marrow-derived MSCs. Seventy-two New Zealand White rabbits were included and were divided into 4 groups: cell-seeded scaffold, cell-free scaffold, sham operation, and total meniscectomy alone. The regeneration of the implanted tissue and the degeneration of articular cartilage were assessed by gross and microscopic (histological and scanning electron microscope) analysis at 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively. The mechanical properties of implants were also evaluated (tensile and compressive testing).\nCompared with the cell-free group, the cell-seeded scaffold showed notably better gross appearance, with a shiny white color and a smooth surface. Fibrochondrocytes with extracellular collagen type I, II, and III and proteoglycans were found in both seeded and cell-free scaffold implants at 12 and 24 weeks, while the results were significantly better for the cell-seeded group at week 24. Furthermore, the cell-seeded group presented notably lower cartilage degeneration in both femur and tibia compared with the cell-free or meniscectomy group. Both the tensile and compressive properties of the implants in the cell-seeded group were significantly increased compared with those of the cell-free group.\nSeeding MSCs in the PCL scaffold increased its fibrocartilaginous tissue regeneration and mechanical strength, providing a functional replacement to protect articular cartilage from damage after total meniscectomy.\nThe study suggests the potential of the novel 3D PCL scaffold augmented with MSCs as an alternative meniscal substitution, although this approach requires further improvement before being used in clinical practice.", "journal": "The American journal of sports medicine", "date": "2017-03-10", "authors": ["Zheng-ZhengZhang", "Shao-JieWang", "Ji-YingZhang", "Wen-BoJiang", "Ai-BingHuang", "Yan-SongQi", "Jian-XunDing", "Xue-SiChen", "DongJiang", "Jia-KuoYu"], "doi": "10.1177/0363546517691513"}
{"title": "Development of Liver Decellularized Extracellular Matrix Bioink for Three-Dimensional Cell Printing-Based Liver Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "The liver is an important organ and plays major roles in the human body. Because of the lack of liver donors after liver failure and drug-induced liver injury, much research has focused on developing liver alternatives and liver in vitro models for transplantation and drug screening. Although numerous studies have been conducted, these systems cannot faithfully mimic the complexity of the liver. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) cell printing technology has emerged as one of a number of innovative technologies that may help to overcome this limitation. However, a great deal of work in developing biomaterials optimized for 3D cell printing-based liver tissue engineering remains. Therefore, in this work, we developed a liver decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) bioink for 3D cell printing applications and evaluated its characteristics. The liver dECM bioink retained the major ECM components of the liver while cellular components were effectively removed and further exhibited suitable and adjustable properties for 3D cell printing. We further studied printing parameters with the liver dECM bioink to verify the versatility and fidelity of the printing process. Stem cell differentiation and HepG2 cell functions in the liver dECM bioink in comparison to those of commercial collagen bioink were also evaluated, and the liver dECM bioink was found to induce stem cell differentiation and enhance HepG2 cell function.

The hydrogel network is crosslinked through the hydrogen bond interactions between dual amide motifs in the side chain of N-acryloyl glycinamide.

A simulation study elaborates the changes of hydrogen bond interactions when 1-vinyl-1,2,4-triazole is introduced into the gel network. It is demonstrated that the introduction of 1-vinyl-1,2,4-triazole endowes the supramolecular hydrogels with self-repairability, thermoplasticity, and reprocessability over a lower temperature range for 3D printing of different shapes and patterns under simplified thermomelting extrusion condition.

Drug loaded 3D patches possessed perfectly aligned fibers giving rise to fibrous strut orientation, variable inter-strut pore size and controlled film width (via layering). The effect of operating parameters on fiber deposition and alignment were explored, and the impact of the film structure, composition and drug loading was evaluated. FTIR demonstrated successful TE-HCL encapsulation in aligned fibers. Patches prepared using PVP and TE-HCL displayed enhanced hydrophobicity. Tensile tests exhibited changes to mechanical properties arising from additive effects. Release of antibiotic from PCL-PVP dosage forms was shown over 5 days and was slower compared to pure PCL or PVP. The printed patch void size also influenced antibiotic release behavior.

{"title": "Build Angle: Does It Influence the Accuracy of 3D-Printed Dental Restorations Using Digital Light-Processing Technology?", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the build orientation/build angle on the dimensional accuracy of full-coverage dental restorations manufactured using digital light-processing technology (DLP-AM).\nA full dental crown was digitally designed and 3D-printed using DLP-AM. Nine build angles were used: 90, 120, 135, 150, 180, 210, 225, 240, and 270 degrees. The specimens were digitally scanned using a high-resolution optical surface scanner (IScan D104i, Imetric). Dimensional accuracy was evaluated using the digital subtraction technique. The 3D digital files of the scanned printed crowns (test model) were exported in standard tessellation language (STL) format and superimposed on the STL file of the designed crown [reference model] using Geomagic Studio 2014 (3D Systems). The root mean square estimate (RMSE) values were evaluated, and the deviation patterns on the color maps were further assessed.\nThe build angle influenced the dimensional accuracy of 3D-printed restorations. The lowest RMSE was recorded for the 135-degree and 210-degree build angles. However, the overall deviation pattern on the color map was more favorable with the 135-degree build angle in contrast with the 210-degree build angle where the deviation was observed around the critical marginal area.\nWithin the limitations of this study, the recommended build angle using the current DLP system was 135 degrees. Among the selected build angles, it offers the highest dimensional accuracy and the most favorable deviation pattern. It also offers a self-supporting crown geometry throughout the building process.", "journal": "The International journal of prosthodontics", "date": "2017-03-08", "authors": ["Reham BOsman", "NawalAlharbi", "DanielWismeijer"], "doi": "10.11607/ijp.5117"}

With this respect, paper color-based detection performed by reflectance measurement is the most popular, simple, inexpensive and straightforward method. Despite the large number of scientific publications related to these biosensors, they still suffer from a poor detectability and reproducibility related to inhomogeneity of color development, which leads to low assay reproducibility. To overcome these problems, we propose a smartphone paper-based biosensor, in which all the reagents necessary to complete the analysis are co-entrapped on paper in a \"wafer\"-like bilayer film of polyelectrolytes (Poly (allyl amine hydrochloride/poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate)). Using a 3D printing low-cost technology we fabricated the smartphone-based device that consists in a cover accessory attached to the smartphone and incorporating a light diffuser over the flash to improve the image quality, a mini dark box and a disposable analytical cartridge containing all the reagents necessary for the complete analysis. The biosensor was developed exploiting coupled enzyme reactions for quantifying L-lactate in oral fluid, which is considered a biomarker of poor tissue perfusion, a key element in the management of severe sepsis, septic shock and in sports performance evaluation.

Recent modelling data indicates that 10\u03bcm-sized microparticles show maximum deposition in the olfactory mucosa. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that 10\u03bcm-sized mucoadhesive microparticles would preferentially deposit on, and increase retention of drug on, the olfactory mucosa in a novel 3D-printed human nasal-replica cast under simulated breathing. The naturally occurring mucoadhesive polymer, tamarind seed polysaccharide (TSP) was used to formulate the microparticles using a spray drying technique. Physicochemical properties of microparticles such as size, morphology and mucoadhesiveness was investigated using a combination of laser diffraction, electron microscopy and texture-analysis. Furthermore, FITC-dextrans (5-40kDa) were incorporated in TSP-microparticles as model drugs. Size-dependent permeability of the FITC-dextrans was observed ex vivo using porcine nasal mucosa. Using the human nasal-replica cast, greater deposition of 10\u03bcm TSP-microparticles in the olfactory region was observed compared to TSP-microparticles 2\u03bcm in size.

Iodine-131 is naturally retained in the thyroid and increases the thyroid cancer risk. Since the radiation induced thyroid cancer risk is greater for children than for adults, the thyroid dose to children should be assessed as accurately as possible. For that purpose direct measurements should be carried out with age-specific calibration factors but, currently, there is no age-specific thyroid phantoms allowing a robust measurement protocol. A set of age-specific thyroid phantoms for 5, 10, 15 year old children and for the adult has been designed and 3D printed. A realistic thyroid shape has been selected and material properties taken into account to simulate the attenuation of biological tissues. The thyroid volumes follow ICRP recommendations and the phantoms also include the trachea and a spine model. Several versions, with or without spine, with our without trachea, with or without age-specific neck have been manufactured, in order to study the influence of these elements on calibration factors. The calibration factor obtained with the adult phantom and a reference phantom are in reasonable agreement. In vivo calibration experiments with germanium detectors have shown that the difference in counting efficiency, the inverse of the calibration factor, between the 5 year and adult phantoms is 25% for measurement at contact. It is also experimentally evidenced that the inverse of the calibration factor varies linearly with the thyroid volume.

As bone tissue is based on the crosstalk between osteoblasts and osteoclasts at least, evaluating cell-cell and cell-material interactions is of interest to understand bone remodeling. There is increasing interest in the role of osteoclasts not only considering bone resorption, but also their influence on the proliferation, migration and differentiation of osteoblasts. Osteoid-like, non-mineralized matrix is used here for the 3D cultivation of osteoblast and osteoclast progenitor cells to evaluate interactions in an early stage of bone formation. The AM technology bioplotting was used to tailor a 3D environment with defined properties. These results could be helpful to transfer this approach to the fabrication of bone tissue in regenerative medicine approaches. Gelatin is derived from collagen, which is the main phase of osteoid. Oxidized alginate-gelatin crosslinked hydrogel was used to immobilize osteoblastic (ST2) and osteoclastic (RAW) progenitor cells. Cell viability and number, the expression of different proteins like alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OPN) and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) were investigated. Release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the immobilized cells was analyzed. Microscopy techniques were used to evaluate cell morphology during an incubation period of 21 days. The biofabrication process was compatible with the cells. Cells migrated, proliferated and expressed their specific proteins indicating cell differentiation. The co-culture showed increased OPN concentration, which is a major protein of the osteoid involved in the mineralization process. TRAP activity was increased compared to single culture. ST2 single culture showed higher ALP activity compared to the co-culture. VEGF concentration of the co-culture was strongly increased. The results indicate the importance of using co-cultures to fabricate bone tissue by biofabrication.

As a result, the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software prototype guides a user through the whole workflow to generate an implant. Therefore, the workflow begins with loading and mirroring the patients head for an initial curvature of the implant. Then, the user can perform an additional Laplacian smoothing, followed by a Delaunay triangulation. The result is an aesthetic looking and well-fitting 3D implant, which can be stored in a CAD file format, e.g. STereoLithography (STL), for 3D printing. The 3D printed implant can finally be used for an in-depth pre-surgical evaluation or even as a real implant for the patient.

Here, we created a gelatine scaffold embedded in uniquely shaped, 3D-printed porous titanium parts, which could attract and promote the proliferation of osteoblasts as well as bone regeneration, as the extracellular matrix (ECM) does in vivo. Interestingly, after hybridisation with platelets, the scaffold exhibited a low yet considerable rate of stable, safe and long-term growth factor release. Additionally, a novel ONFH model was constructed and verified. Scaffolds implanted in this model were found to accelerate bone repair. In conclusion, our scaffold successfully simulates the ECM and considerably accelerates bone regeneration, in which platelets play an indispensable role. We believe that platelets should be emphasised as carriers that may be employed to transport drugs, cytokines and other small molecules to target locations in vivo.

{"title": "A test of the nest sanitation hypothesis for the evolution of foreign egg rejection in an avian brood parasite rejecter host species.", "abstract": "Hosts of avian brood parasites have evolved diverse defenses to avoid the costs associated with raising brood parasite nestlings. In egg ejection, the host recognizes and removes foreign eggs laid in its nest. Nest sanitation, a behavior similar in motor pattern to egg ejection, has been proposed repeatedly as a potential pre-adaptation to egg ejection. Here, we separately placed blue 3D-printed, brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) eggs known to elicit interindividual variation in ejection responses and semi-natural leaves into American robins' (Turdus migratorius) nests to test proximate predictions that (1) rejecter hosts should sanitize debris from nests more frequently and consistently than accepter hosts and (2) hosts that sanitize their nests of debris prior to the presentation of a foreign egg will be more likely to eject the foreign egg. Egg ejection responses were highly repeatable within individuals yet variable between them, but were not influenced by prior exposure to debris, nor related to sanitation tendencies as a whole, because nearly all individuals sanitized their nests. Additionally, we collected published data for eight different host species to test for a potential positive correlation between sanitation and egg ejection. We found no significant correlation between nest sanitation and egg ejection rates; however, our comparative analysis was limited to a sample size of 8, and we advise that more data from additional species are necessary to properly address interspecific tests of the pre-adaptation hypothesis. In lack of support for the nest sanitation hypothesis, our study suggests that, within individuals, foreign egg ejection is distinct from nest sanitation tendencies, and sanitation and foreign egg ejection may not correlate across species.", "journal": "Die Naturwissenschaften", "date": "2017-03-03", "authors": ["Alec BLuro", "Mark EHauber"], "doi": "10.1007/s00114-017-1446-8"}

In current study, polyvinylalcohol (PVA)-based tablets were prepared using a fused-deposition-modeling-type 3D printer and the effect of 3D printing conditions on tablet production was investigated. Curcumin, a model drug/fluorescent marker, was loaded into PVA-filament. We found that several printing parameters, such as the rate of extruding PVA (flow rate), can affect the formability of the resulting PVA-tablets. The 3D-printing temperature is controlled by heating the print nozzle and was shown to affect the color of the tablets and their curcumin content. PVA-based infilled tablets with different densities were prepared by changing the fill density as a printing parameter.

Although many studies have contributed to this emerging field of additive manufacturing, which includes material development and computer-aided scaffold design, current quantitative analyses do not correlate material properties, printing parameters, and printing outcomes to a great extent. A model that correlates these properties has tremendous potential to standardize 3D printing for tissue engineering and biomaterial science. In this study, we printed poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) utilizing a direct melt extrusion technique without additional ingredients. We investigated PLGA with various lactic acid:glycolic acid (LA:GA) molecular weight ratios and end caps to demonstrate the dependence of the extrusion process on the polymer composition. Micro-computed tomography was then used to evaluate printed scaffolds containing different LA:GA ratios, composed of different fiber patterns, and processed under different printing conditions. We built a statistical model to reveal the correlation and predominant factors that determine printing precision. Our model showed a strong linear relationship between the actual and predicted precision under different combinations of printing conditions and material compositions. This quantitative examination establishes a significant foreground to 3D print biomaterials following a systematic fabrication procedure. Additionally, our proposed statistical models can be applied to couple specific biomaterials and 3D printing applications for patient implants with particular requirements.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-03-01", "authors": ["TingGuo", "Timothy RHolzberg", "Casey GLim", "FengGao", "AnkitGargava", "Jordan ETrachtenberg", "Antonios GMikos", "John PFisher"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa6370"}

E.\u00a0faecalis biofilms were grown on the apical 3\u00a0mm of the models for 10\u00a0days. A total of 60\u00a0s of 9\u00a0ml of 2.5% NaOCl irrigation using syringe and needle was performed, the irrigant was either left stagnant in the canal or agitated using manual (Gutta-percha), sonic, and ultrasonic methods for 30\u00a0s.

Quantitative measurements can be performed on or off chip to provide time-resolved secretion data, furthering insight into the dynamics of the function of adipose tissue. Buoyancy resulting from the large lipid storage capacity in this tissue presents a unique challenge for culture, and it is important to account for this buoyancy during microdevice design.

Additive manufacturing (AM) is a suitable alternative for creating patient-specific in vitro models for flow measurements using four-dimensional (4D) Flow MRI. These in vitro systems have the potential to serve as validation for computational fluid dynamics (CFD), simulating different physiological conditions. This study investigated three different AM technologies, stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM), to determine differences in hemodynamics when measuring flow using 4D Flow MRI. The models were created using patient-specific MRI data from an extracardiac TCPC. These models were connected to a perfusion pump circulating water at three different flow rates. Data was processed for visualization and quantification of velocity, flow distribution, vorticity and kinetic energy. These results were compared between each model. In addition, the flow distribution obtained in vitro was compared to in vivo. The results showed significant difference in velocities measured at the outlets of the models that required internal support material when printing. Furthermore, an ultrasound flow sensor was used to validate flow measurements at the inlets and outlets of the in vitro models. These results were highly correlated to those measured with 4D Flow MRI. This study showed that commercially available AM technologies can be used to create patient-specific vascular models for in vitro hemodynamic studies at reasonable costs.

We demonstrate theoretically and confirm experimentally that by introducing a defect in the first layer of the Bragg reflector, thereby causing anticrossing between the dispersion relations of the core-guided mode and the defect mode, we can create a sharp transmission dip in the waveguide transmission spectrum. By tracking changes in the spectral position of the narrow transmission dip, one can build a sensor, which is highly sensitive to the optical properties of the defect layer. To calibrate our sensor, we use PMMA layers of various thicknesses deposited onto the waveguide core surface. The measured sensitivity to changes in the defect layer thickness is found to be 0.1 GHz/\u03bcm. Then, we explore THz resonant surface sensing using \u03b1-lactose monohydrate powder as an analyte.

{"title": "Influence of Additive Manufactured Scaffold Architecture on the Distribution of Surface Strains and Fluid Flow Shear Stresses and Expected Osteochondral Cell Differentiation.", "abstract": "Scaffolds for regenerative medicine applications should instruct cells with the appropriate signals, including biophysical stimuli such as stress and strain, to form the desired tissue. Apart from that, scaffolds, especially for load-bearing applications, should be capable of providing mechanical stability. Since both scaffold strength and stress-strain distributions throughout the scaffold depend on the scaffold's internal architecture, it is important to understand how changes in architecture influence these parameters. In this study, four scaffold designs with different architectures were produced using additive manufacturing. The designs varied in fiber orientation, while fiber diameter, spacing, and layer height remained constant. Based on micro-CT (\u03bcCT) scans, finite element models (FEMs) were derived for finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). FEA of scaffold compression was validated using \u03bcCT scan data of compressed scaffolds. Results of the FEA and CFD showed a significant impact of scaffold architecture on fluid shear stress and mechanical strain distribution. The average fluid shear stress ranged from 3.6\u2009mPa for a 0/90 architecture to 6.8\u2009mPa for a 0/90 offset architecture, and the surface shear strain from 0.0096 for a 0/90 offset architecture to 0.0214 for a 0/90 architecture. This subsequently resulted in variations of the predicted cell differentiation stimulus values on the scaffold surface. Fluid shear stress was mainly influenced by pore shape and size, while mechanical strain distribution depended mainly on the presence or absence of supportive columns in the scaffold architecture. Together, these results corroborate that scaffold architecture can be exploited to design scaffolds with regions that guide specific tissue development under compression and perfusion. In conjunction with optimization of stimulation regimes during bioreactor cultures, scaffold architecture optimization can be used to improve scaffold design for tissue engineering purposes.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2017-02-28", "authors": ["Wim JHendrikson", "Anthony JDeegan", "YingYang", "Clemens Avan Blitterswijk", "NicoVerdonschot", "LorenzoMoroni", "JeroenRouwkema"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2017.00006\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.01.018\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.03.020\n10.1016/j.cub.2009.06.054\n10.1242/jcs.041186\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.09.003\n10.1002/jor.1100060517\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.10.044\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.02.074\n10.1016/S0021-9290(98)00153-5\n10.1002/adhm.201600083\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.04.019\n10.1002/bit.25231\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.01.037\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.07.044\n10.1002/jbm.a.32927\n10.1016/S0021-9290(02)00086-6\n10.1007/BF02347690\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2003.12.001\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.04.026\n10.1007/s10237-010-0199-5\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.07.023\n10.1002/jbm.a.30716\n10.3233/CH-151931\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.041\n10.1016/S0021-9290(96)00140-6\n10.1023/A:1013227428530\n10.1007/s10237-010-0256-0\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2007.12.011\n10.1007/s12195-009-0052-z\n10.1039/C4LC01259C\n10.1038/nrm2594\n10.1007/s10237-014-0599-z"}

Tensile and flexural testing in a universal testing machine was used to measure their tensile/flexural elastic modulus and strength. The results showed that the epoxy resin and fibre filled epoxy resin had similar tensile elastic moduli (no statistical significant difference) with lower values observed for the other materials. The fibre filled epoxy resin had a considerably higher flexural elastic modulus and strength, possibly attributed to the presence of fibres. Of the simulants tested, epoxy resin had an elastic modulus and flexural strength close to that of mean human skull values reported in the literature, and thus can be considered as a suitable skull simulant for a skin/skull/brain model for lower impact forces that do not exceed the fracture stress. For higher impact forces a 3D printing filament (PLA) may be a more suitable skull simulant material, due to its closer match to fracture stresses found in human skull bone.

This is particular promising for implants administered at application sites with a high anatomical variability where an individual shape adaption appears reasonable. In this work different polymers (Eudragit\u00aeRS, polycaprolactone (PCL), poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) and ethyl cellulose (EC)) were evaluated with respect to their suitability for FDM of drug loaded implants and their drug release behaviour was evaluated. The fluorescent dye quinine was used as a model drug to visualize drug distribution in filaments and implants. Quinine loaded filaments were produced by solvent casting and subsequent hot melt extrusion (HME) and model implants were printed as hollow cylinders using a standard FDM printer. Parameters were found at which model implants (hollow cylinders, outer diameter 4-5mm, height 3mm) could be produced from all tested polymers. The drug release which was examined by incubation of the printed implants in phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) pH 7.4 was highly dependent on the used polymer. The fastest relative drug release of approximately 76% in 51days was observed for PCL and the lowest for Eudragit\u00aeRS and EC with less than 5% of quinine release in 78 and 100days, respectively. For PCL further filaments were prepared with different quinine loads ranging from 2.5% to 25% and thermal analysis proved the presence of a solid dispersion of quinine in the polymer for all tested concentrations. Increasing the drug load also increased the overall percentage of drug released to the medium since nearly the same absolute amount of quinine remained trapped in PCL at the end of drug release studies.

The drastic enhancement in mechanical properties, which is seen to this degree in 3D-printed samples reported in literature, is attributed to the metastable structure of GO, polymer-nanofiller cross-linking via acid-catalyzed esterification, and removal of intercalated water, thus improving filler-matrix interaction as evidenced by spectroscopy and microscopy analyses.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-02-24", "authors": ["Jill ZManapat", "Joey DaculaMangadlao", "Brylee David BuadaTiu", "Grace CTritchler", "Rigoberto CAdvincula"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b16174"}

This study aims to design and develop cartilage constructs with tunable internal architectures and relevant mechanical properties. More specifically, the potential of methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) added to thermosensitive hydrogels composed of methacrylated poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide mono/dilactate] (pHPMA-lac)/polyethylene glycol (PEG) triblock copolymers, to optimize cartilage-like tissue formation by embedded chondrocytes, and enhance printability was explored. Additionally, co-printing with polycaprolactone (PCL) was performed for mechanical reinforcement. Chondrocyte-laden hydrogels composed of pHPMA-lac-PEG and different concentrations of HAMA (0%-1% w/w) were cultured for 28 d in vitro and subsequently evaluated for the presence of cartilage-like matrix. Young's moduli were determined for hydrogels with the different HAMA concentrations. Additionally, hydrogel/PCL constructs with different internal architectures were co-printed and analyzed for their mechanical properties. The results of this study demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of HAMA concentration on cartilage matrix synthesis by chondrocytes. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen type II content increased with intermediate HAMA concentrations (0.25%-0.5%) compared to HAMA-free controls, while a relatively high HAMA concentration (1%) resulted in increased fibrocartilage formation. Young's moduli of generated hydrogel constructs ranged from 14 to 31 kPa and increased with increasing HAMA concentration. The pHPMA-lac-PEG hydrogels with 0.5% HAMA were found to be optimal for cartilage-like tissue formation. Therefore, this hydrogel system was co-printed with PCL to generate porous or solid constructs with different mesh sizes. Young's moduli of these composite constructs were in the range of native cartilage (3.5-4.6 MPa). Interestingly, the co-printing procedure influenced the mechanical properties of the final constructs. These findings are relevant for future bio-ink development, as they demonstrate the importance of selecting proper HAMA concentrations, as well as appropriate print settings and construct designs for optimal cartilage matrix deposition and final mechanical properties of constructs, respectively.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-02-24", "authors": ["V H MMouser", "AAbbadessa", "RLevato", "W EHennink", "TVermonden", "DGawlitta", "JMalda"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa6265\n10.1177/1947603516665445\n10.1007/978-1-4471-5451-8_110"}

The possibility of generating customizable, controllable, and standardized robotic stimuli has been demonstrated through a number of behavioral assays, involving vertebrates and invertebrates. However, the specific appraisal of the nature of robotic stimuli is currently lacking. Here, we attempt to evaluate this aspect in zebrafish, through a within-subject design in which experimental subjects are faced with three experimental conditions. In the first test, we investigated sociability by measuring zebrafish response to a conspecific separated by a one-way glass. In the second test, we studied zebrafish behavior in response to a 3D-printed zebrafish replica actuated along realistic trajectories through a novel four-degree-of-freedom robotic platform. Last, we investigated fear responses in a shelter-seeking test. In agreement with our expectations, zebrafish exhibited an equivalent preference for live and robotic stimuli, and the degree of preference for the robotic replica correlated negatively with the individual propensity to seek shelter. The equivalent preference for the replica and conspecific suggests that the appraisal of the target stimuli is analogous.

The aim of this work was to develop electrospun bundles mimicking the architecture and mechanical properties of the fascicles of the human Achille tendon. Two different blends of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and collagen (Coll) were tested, PLLA/Coll-75/25 and PLLA/Coll-50/50, and compared with bundles of pure PLLA. First, a complete physico-chemical characterization was performed on non-woven mats made of randomly arranged fibers. The presence of collagen in the fibers was assessed by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and water contact angle measurements. The collagen release in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was evaluated for 14 days: results showed that collagen loss was about 50% for PLLA/Coll-75/25 and 70% for PLLA/Coll-50/50. In the bundles, the individual fibers had a diameter of 0.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14 \u03bcm (PLLA), 0.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 \u03bcm (PLLA/Coll-75/25), 0.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08 \u03bcm (PLLA/Coll-50/50), whereas bundle diameter was in the range 300-500 \u03bcm for all samples. Monotonic tensile tests were performed to measure the mechanical properties of PLLA bundles (as-spun) and of PLLA/Coll-75/25 and PLLA/Coll-50/50 bundles (as-spun, and after 48 h, 7 days and 14 days in PBS). The most promising material was the PLLA/Coll-75/25 blend with a Young modulus of 98.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.4 MPa (as-spun) and 205.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a073.0 MPa (after 14 days in PBS).

Pure PLLA withstood slightly lower stress than the PLLA/Coll-75/25 while PLLA/Coll-50/50 had a brittle behavior. Human-derived tenocytes were used for cellular tests.

{"title": "Biological aspects of axonal damage in glaucoma: A brief review.", "abstract": "Intraocular pressure (IOP) is a critical risk factor in glaucoma, and the available evidence derived from experimental studies in primates and rodents strongly indicates that the site of IOP-induced axonal damage in glaucoma is at the optic nerve head (ONH). However, the mechanisms that cause IOP-induced damage at the ONH are far from understood. A possible sequence of events could originate with IOP-induced stress in the ONH connective tissue elements (peripapillary sclera, scleral canal and lamina cribrosa) that leads to an increase in biomechanical strain. In consequence, molecular signaling cascades might be activated that result in extracellular matrix turnover of the peripapillary sclera, changing its biomechanical properties. Peripapillary sclera strain might induce reactive changes in ONH astrocytes and cause astrogliosis. The biological changes that are associated with ONH astrocyte reactivity could lead to withdrawal of trophic or metabolic support for optic nerve axons and cause their degeneration. Alternatively, the expression of neurotoxic molecules might be induced. Unfortunately, direct experimental in\u00a0vivo evidence for these or other scenarios is currently lacking. The pathogenic processes that cause axonal degeneration at the ONH in glaucoma need to be identified before any regenerative therapy is likely to succeed. Several topics and emerging techniques should be pursued to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that are behind axonal degeneration. Among them are: Advanced imaging techniques, the development of in\u00a0vivo markers to identify axonal injury, the generation of molecular approaches for in\u00a0vivo detection of mechanosensitivity and for molecular manipulation of the ONH, a more complete characterization of retinal ganglion cells, the use of organ cultures, 3D-bioprinting, and the engineering of microdevices that can measure pressure.

These scaffolds were composed of poly(L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), type I collagen, and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) in an attempt to mimic the extracellular matrix of bone. The solvent used for processing the scaffolds was 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. The produced scaffolds were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, microcomputed tomography, thermogravimetric analysis, and unconfined compression test. This study also sought to validate the use of finite-element optimization in COMSOL Multiphysics for scaffold design. Scaffold topology was simplified to three factors: nHA content, strand diameter, and strand spacing. These factors affect the ability of the scaffold to bear mechanical loads and how porous the structure can be. Twenty four scaffolds were constructed according to an I-optimal, split-plot designed experiment (DE) in order to generate experimental models of the factor-response relationships. Within the design region, the DE and COMSOL models agreed in their recommended optimal nHA (30%) and strand diameter (460 \u03bcm). However, the two methods disagreed by more than 30% in strand spacing (908 \u03bcm for DE; 601 \u03bcm for COMSOL). Seven scaffolds were 3D-bioplotted to validate the predictions of DE and COMSOL models (4.5-9.9 MPa measured moduli). The predictions for these scaffolds showed relative agreement for scaffold porosity (mean absolute percentage error of 4% for DE and 13% for COMSOL), but were substantially poorer for scaffold modulus (51% for DE; 21% for COMSOL), partly due to some simplifying assumptions made by the models.

One important group of endocrine diseases is diabetes, which is caused by a deficiency or diminished effectiveness of endogenous insulin. By using a microfluidic perfused 3D cell-culture chip, we developed an 'endocrine system on chip' to potentially be able to screen drugs for the treatment of diabetes by measuring insulin release over time. Insulin-secreting \u03b2-cells are located in the pancreas, while L-cells, located in the small intestines, stimulate insulin secretion. Thus, we constructed a co-culture of intestinal-pancreatic cells to measure the effect of glucose on the production of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the L-cell line (GLUTag) and insulin from the pancreatic \u03b2-cell line (INS-1). After three days of culture, both cell lines formed aggregates, exhibited 3D cell morphology, and showed good viability (>95%). We separately measured the dynamic profile of GLP-1 and insulin release at glucose concentrations of 0.5 and 20 mM, as well as the combined effect of GLP-1 on insulin production at these glucose concentrations. In response to glucose stimuli, GLUTag and INS-1 cells produced higher amounts of GLP-1 and insulin, respectively, compared to a static 2D cell culture. INS-1 combined with GLUTag cells exhibited an even higher insulin production in response to glucose stimulation. At higher glucose concentrations, the diabetes model on chip showed faster saturation of the insulin level.

{"title": "Development of hydrogels for regenerative engineering.", "abstract": "The aim of regenerative engineering is to restore complex tissues and biological systems through convergence in the fields of advanced biomaterials, stem cell science, and developmental biology. Hydrogels are one of the most attractive biomaterials for regenerative engineering, since they can be engineered into tissue mimetic 3D scaffolds to support cell growth due to their similarity to native extracellular matrix. Advanced nano- and micro-technologies have dramatically increased the ability to control properties and functionalities of hydrogel materials by facilitating biomimetic fabrication of more sophisticated compositions and architectures, thus extending our understanding of cell-matrix interactions at the nanoscale. With this perspective, this review discusses the most commonly used hydrogel materials and their fabrication strategies for regenerative engineering.

{"title": "Putting 3D modelling and 3D printing into practice: virtual surgery and preoperative planning to reconstruct complex post-traumatic skeletal deformities and defects.", "abstract": "3D printing technology has revolutionized and gradually transformed manufacturing across a broad spectrum of industries, including healthcare. Nowhere is this more apparent than in orthopaedics with many surgeons already incorporating aspects of 3D modelling and virtual procedures into their routine clinical practice. As a more extreme application, patient-specific 3D printed titanium truss cages represent a novel approach for managing the challenge of segmental bone defects. This review illustrates the potential indications of this innovative technique using 3D printed titanium truss cages in conjunction with the Masquelet technique. These implants are custom designed during a virtual surgical planning session with the combined input of an orthopaedic surgeon, an orthopaedic engineering professional and a biomedical design engineer. The ability to 3D model an identical replica of the original intact bone in a virtual procedure is of vital importance when attempting to precisely reconstruct normal anatomy during the actual procedure. Additionally, other important factors must be considered during the planning procedure, such as the three-dimensional configuration of the implant. Meticulous design is necessary to allow for successful implantation through the planned surgical exposure, while being aware of the constraints imposed by local anatomy and prior implants. This review will attempt to synthesize the current state of the art as well as discuss our personal experience using this promising technique. It will address implant design considerations including the mechanical, anatomical and functional aspects unique to each case.", "journal": "SICOT-J", "date": "2017-02-22", "authors": ["KevinTetsworth", "SteveBlock", "VaidaGlatt"], "doi": "10.1051/sicotj/2016043"}
{"title": "Mechanical metamaterials at the theoretical limit of isotropic elastic stiffness.", "abstract": "A wide variety of high-performance applications require materials for which shape control is maintained under substantial stress, and that have minimal density. Bio-inspired hexagonal and square honeycomb structures and lattice materials based on repeating unit cells composed of webs or trusses, when made from materials of high elastic stiffness and low density, represent some of the lightest, stiffest and strongest materials available today. Recent advances in 3D printing and automated assembly have enabled such complicated material geometries to be fabricated at low (and declining) cost. These mechanical metamaterials have properties that are a function of their mesoscale geometry as well as their constituents, leading to combinations of properties that are unobtainable in solid materials; however, a material geometry that achieves the theoretical upper bounds for isotropic elasticity and strain energy storage (the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bounds) has yet to be identified. Here we evaluate the manner in which strain energy distributes under load in a representative selection of material geometries, to identify the morphological features associated with high elastic performance. Using finite-element models, supported by analytical methods, and a heuristic optimization scheme, we identify a material geometry that achieves the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bounds on isotropic elastic stiffness. Previous work has focused on truss networks and anisotropic honeycombs, neither of which can achieve this theoretical limit. We find that stiff but well distributed networks of plates are required to transfer loads efficiently between neighbouring members. The resulting low-density mechanical metamaterials have many advantageous properties: their mesoscale geometry can facilitate large crushing strains with high energy absorption, optical bandgaps and mechanically tunable acoustic bandgaps, high thermal insulation, buoyancy, and fluid storage and transport. Our relatively simple design can be manufactured using origami-like sheet folding and bonding methods.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2017-02-22", "authors": ["J BBerger", "H N GWadley", "R MMcMeeking"], "doi": "10.1038/nature21075"}
{"title": "Template-Free Growth of Well-Ordered Silver Nano Forest/Ceramic Metamaterial Films with Tunable Optical Responses.", "abstract": "Currently, the limitations of conventional methods for fabricating metamaterials composed of well-aligned nanoscale inclusions either lack the necessary freedom to tune the structural geometry or are difficult for large-area synthesis. In this Communication, the authors propose a fabrication route to create well-ordered silver nano forest/ceramic composite single-layer or multi-layer vertically stacked structures, as a distinctive approach to make large-area nanoscale metamaterials. To take advantage of direct growth, the authors fabricate single-layer nanocomposite films with a well-defined sub-5 nm interwire gap and an average nanowire diameter of \u22483 nm. Further, artificially constructed multilayer metamaterial films are easily fabricated by vertical integration of different single-layer metamaterial films. Based upon the thermodynamics as well as thin film growth dynamics theory, the growth mechanism is presented to elucidate the formation of such structure. Intriguing steady and transient optical properties in these assemblies are demonstrated, owing to their nanoscale structural anisotropy. The studies suggest that the self-organized nanocomposites provide an extensible material platform to manipulate optical response in the region of sub-5 nm scale.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2017-02-22", "authors": ["JunhuaGao", "XingzhiWu", "QiuwuLi", "ShiyuDu", "FengHuang", "LingyanLiang", "HongliangZhang", "FeiZhuge", "HongtaoCao", "YinglinSong"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.201605324"}

Even material blocks with an interconnecting porous system are never completely resorbed. Shell techniques combined with autologous bone chips are therefore the gold standard. Using biopolymers for these techniques is well documented. We applied three-dimensional (3-D) techniques to create an individualized bending model for the adjustment of a plane biopolymer membrane made of polylactide.\nTwo cases with a vertical alveolar ridge defect in the maxilla were chosen. The cone beam computed tomography data were processed with a 3-D slicer and the Autodesk Meshmixer to generate data about the desired augmentation result. STL data were used to print a bending model. A 0.2-mm poly-D, L-lactic acid membrane (KLS Matin Inc., Tuttlingen, Germany) was bended accordingly and placed into the defect via a tunnel approach in both cases. A mesh graft of autologous bone chips and hydroxylapatite material was augmented beneath the shell, which was fixed with osteosynthesis screws.\nThe operative procedure was fast and without peri- or postoperative complications or complaints. The panoramic x-ray showed correct fitting of the material in the location. Bone quality at the time of implant placement was type II, resulting in good primary stability.\nA custom-made 3-D model for bending confectioned biomaterial pieces is an appropriate method for individualized adjustment in shell techniques.

Adolescent CHD patients (n\u2009=\u200920, age 15-18\u00a0years, 15 male) were asked to complete two questionnaires during a cardiology transition clinic at a specialist centre. The first questionnaire was completed just before routine consultation with the cardiologist, the second just after the consultation. During the consultation, each patient was presented with a 3D full heart model realised from their medical imaging data. The model was used by the cardiologist to point to main features of the CHD. Outcome measures included rating of health status, confidence in explaining their condition to others, name and features of their CHD (as a surrogate for CHD knowledge), impact of CHD on their lifestyle, satisfaction with previous/current visits, positive/negative features of the 3D model, and open-ended feedback. Significant improvements were registered in confidence in explaining their condition to others (p\u2009=\u20090.008), knowledge of CHD (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and patients' satisfaction (p\u2009=\u20090.005). Descriptions of CHD and impact on lifestyle were more eloquent after seeing a 3D model. The majority of participants reported that models helped their understanding and improved their visit, with a non-negligible 30% of participants indicating that the model made them feel more anxious about their condition.

{"title": "Evaluation of deformable image registration between external beam radiotherapy and HDR brachytherapy for cervical cancer with a 3D-printed deformable pelvis phantom.", "abstract": "In this study, we developed a 3D-printed deformable pelvis phantom for evaluating spatial DIR accuracy. We then evaluated the spatial DIR accuracies of various DIR settings for cervical cancer.\nA deformable female pelvis phantom was created based on patient CT data using 3D printing. To create the deformable uterus phantom, we first 3D printed both a model of uterus and a model of the internal cavities of the vagina and uterus. We then made a mold using the 3D printed uterus phantom. Finally, urethane was poured into the mold with the model of the internal cavities in place, creating the deformable uterus phantom with a cavity into which an applicator could be inserted. To create the deformable bladder phantom, we first 3D printed models of the bladder and of the same bladder scaled down by 2\u00a0mm. We then made a mold using the larger bladder model. Finally, silicone was poured into the mold with the smaller bladder model in place to create the deformable bladder phantom with a wall thickness of 2\u00a0mm. To emulate the anatomical bladder, water was poured into the created bladder. We acquired phantom image without applicator for EBRT. Then, we inserted the applicator into the phantom to simulate BT. In this situation, we scanned the phantom again to obtain the phantom image for BT. We performed DIR using the two phantom images in two cases: Case A, with full bladder (170\u00a0ml) in both EBRT and BT images; and Case B with full bladder in the BT image and half-full bladder (100\u00a0ml) in the EBRT image. DIR was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) and 31 landmarks for the uterus and 25 landmarks for the bladder. A hybrid intensity and structure DIR algorithm implemented in RayStation with four DIR settings was evaluated.\nOn visual inspection, reasonable agreement in shape of the uterus between the phantom and patient CT images was observed for both EBRT and BT, although some regional disagreements in shape of the bladder and rectum were apparent. The created phantom could reproduce the actual patient's uterus deformation by the applicator. For both Case A and B, large variation was seen in landmark error among the four DIR parameters. In addition, although DSCs were comparable, moderate differences in landmark error existed between the two different DIR parameters selected from the four DIR parameters (i.e., DSC\u00a0=\u00a00.96, landmark error\u00a0=\u00a013.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7 mm vs. DSC\u00a0=\u00a00.97, landmark error\u00a0=\u00a09.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0\u00a0mm). This result suggests that landmark error evaluation might thus be more effective than DSC for evaluating DIR accuracy.\nOur developed phantom enabled the evaluation of spatial DIR accuracy for the female pelvic region for the first time. Although the DSCs are high, the spatial errors can still be significant and our developed phantom facilitates their quantification. Our results showed that optimization is needed to identify suitable DIR settings. For determining suitable DIR settings, our method of evaluating spatial DIR accuracy using the 3D-printed phantom may prove helpful.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2017-02-19", "authors": ["NoriyukiKadoya", "YuyaMiyasaka", "YujiroNakajima", "YoshihiroKuroda", "KengoIto", "MizukiChiba", "KiyokazuSato", "SuguruDobashi", "TakayaYamamoto", "NoriyoshiTakahashi", "MasakiKubozono", "KenTakeda", "KeiichiJingu"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.12168"}
{"title": "Additively manufactured metallic porous biomaterials based on minimal surfaces: A unique combination of topological, mechanical, and mass transport properties.", "abstract": "Porous biomaterials that simultaneously mimic the topological, mechanical, and mass transport properties of bone are in great demand but are rarely found in the literature. In this study, we rationally designed and additively manufactured (AM) porous metallic biomaterials based on four different types of triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) that mimic the properties of bone to an unprecedented level of multi-physics detail. Sixteen different types of porous biomaterials were rationally designed and fabricated using selective laser melting (SLM) from a titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V). The topology, quasi-static mechanical properties, fatigue resistance, and permeability of the developed biomaterials were then characterized. In terms of topology, the biomaterials resembled the morphological properties of trabecular bone including mean surface curvatures close to zero. The biomaterials showed a favorable but rare combination of relatively low elastic properties in the range of those observed for trabecular bone and high yield strengths exceeding those reported for cortical bone. This combination allows for simultaneously avoiding stress shielding, while providing ample mechanical support for bone tissue regeneration and osseointegration. Furthermore, as opposed to other AM porous biomaterials developed to date for which the fatigue endurance limit has been found to be \u224820% of their yield (or plateau) stress, some of the biomaterials developed in the current study show extremely high fatigue resistance with endurance limits up to 60% of their yield stress. It was also found that the permeability values measured for the developed biomaterials were in the range of values reported for trabecular bone. In summary, the developed porous metallic biomaterials based on TPMS mimic the topological, mechanical, and physical properties of trabecular bone to a great degree. These properties make them potential candidates to be applied as parts of orthopedic implants and/or as bone-substituting biomaterials.\nBone-substituting biomaterials aim to mimic bone properties. Although mimicking some of bone properties is feasible, biomaterials that could simultaneously mimic all or most of the relevant bone properties are rare. We used rational design and additive manufacturing to develop porous metallic biomaterials that exhibit an interesting combination of topological, mechanical, and mass transport properties. The topology of the developed biomaterials resembles that of trabecular bone including a mean curvature close to zero. Moreover, the developed biomaterials show an unusual combination of low elastic modulus to avoid stress shielding and high strength to provide mechanical support.

These properties of 3D fabricated constructs mainly depend on the intrinsic characteristics of the materials and fabrication method. In this respect, the current use of hydrogels for musculoskeletal tissue repair is not ideal due to the lack of suitable mechanical properties, as well as the high biomimetic requirement for success. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel functionalized hydrogel with bioactive gold nanoparticles (GNPs), reinforcing a 3D printed microstructure via fused deposition modeling (FDM) for bone tissue regeneration. We used biodegradable thermoplastic polylactic acid (PLA) as the 3D printed microstructure in combination with photo-curable gelatin hydrogels as the encapsulation matrix for the incorporation of cyclic RGD conjugated GNPs (RGNP), and investigated their mechanical properties. In addition, human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were encapsulated within the gelatin hydrogel and examined for viability, morphology, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. The results showed that the stiffness of the composite hydrogel on reinforcing a 3D printed microstructure can be readily modulated to simulate the stiffness of the human mandibular condyle. ADSCs encapsulated in the composite structures remained viable within the hydrogel and showed excellent spreading on the 3D printed PLA microstructure. More importantly, osteogenic differentiation with incorporated RGNPs promoted significantly higher gene expression of osteogenic specific factors.

{"title": "Cellular Mechanisms of Liver Regeneration and Cell-Based Therapies of Liver Diseases.", "abstract": "The emerging field of regenerative medicine offers innovative methods of cell therapy and tissue/organ engineering as a novel approach to liver disease treatment. The ultimate scientific foundation of both cell therapy of liver diseases and liver tissue and organ engineering is delivered by the in-depth studies of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver regeneration. The cellular mechanisms of the homeostatic and injury-induced liver regeneration are unique. Restoration of the mass of liver parenchyma is achieved by compensatory hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the differentiated parenchymal cells, hepatocytes, while expansion and differentiation of the resident stem/progenitor cells play a minor or negligible role. Participation of blood-borne cells of the bone marrow origin in liver parenchyma regeneration has been proven but does not exceed 1-2% of newly formed hepatocytes. Liver regeneration is activated spontaneously after injury and can be further stimulated by cell therapy with hepatocytes, hematopoietic stem cells, or mesenchymal stem cells.

{"title": "Proof of Concept of Integrated Load Measurement in 3D Printed Structures.", "abstract": "Currently, research on structural health monitoring systems is focused on direct integration of the system into a component or structure. The latter results in a so-called smart structure. One example of a smart structure is a component with integrated strain sensing for continuous load monitoring. Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, now also enables such integration of functions inside components. As a proof-of-concept, the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technique was used to integrate a strain sensing element inside polymer (ABS) tensile test samples. The strain sensing element consisted of a closed capillary filled with a fluid and connected to an externally mounted pressure sensor. The volumetric deformation of the integrated capillary resulted in pressure changes in the fluid. The obtained pressure measurements during tensile testing are reported in this paper and compared to state-of-the-art extensometer measurements. The sensitivity of the 3D printed pressure-based strain sensor is primarily a function of the compressibility of the capillary fluid. Air- and watertightness are of critical importance for the proper functioning of the 3D printed pressure-based strain sensor. Therefore, the best after-treatment procedure was selected on basis of a comparative analysis. The obtained pressure measurements are linear with respect to the extensometer readings, and the uncertainty on the strain measurement of a capillary filled with water (incompressible fluid) is \u00b13.1 \u00b5strain, which is approximately three times less sensitive than conventional strain gauges (\u00b11 \u00b5strain), but 32 times more sensitive than the same sensor based on air (compressible fluid) (\u00b1101 \u00b5strain).", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-02-18", "authors": ["Micha\u00eblHinderdael", "Zo\u00e9Jardon", "MargotLison", "DieterDe Baere", "WimDevesse", "MariaStrantza", "PatrickGuillaume"], "doi": "10.3390/s17020328\n10.1617/s11527-016-0863-z\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2014.07.003\n10.1080/00207720050197730\n10.1016/j.sna.2007.05.011\n10.3390/s140712387\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(1994)120:8(1696)\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.144.251\n10.1016/j.measurement.2005.11.011\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/12/125029\n10.1038/micronano.2015.13\n10.1002/admt.201600013\n10.1089/3dp.2015.0003\n10.1002/adma.201400334\n10.1109/JSEN.2012.2226574\n10.1080/17452759.2014.913400\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2012.12.015\n10.1007/s00170-016-9257-1\n10.1016/j.cirp.2010.03.074\n10.1177/1475921715604389\n10.3390/ma9020106"}
{"title": "Open-Source-Based 3D Printing of Thin Silica Gel Layers in Planar Chromatography.", "abstract": "On the basis of open-source packages, 3D printing of thin silica gel layers is demonstrated as proof-of-principle for use in planar chromatography. A slurry doser was designed to replace the plastic extruder of an open-source Prusa i3 printer. The optimal parameters for 3D printing of layers were studied, and the planar chromatographic separations on these printed layers were successfully demonstrated with a mixture of dyes. The layer printing process was fast. For printing a 0.2 mm layer on a 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm format, it took less than 5 min. It was affordable, i.e., the running costs for producing such a plate were less than 0.25 Euro and the investment costs for the modified hardware were 630 Euro. This approach demonstrated not only the potential of the 3D printing environment in planar chromatography but also opened new avenues and new perspectives for tailor-made plates, not only with regard to layer materials and their combinations (gradient plates) but also with regard to different layer shapes and patterns. As such an example, separations on a printed plane layer were compared with those obtained from a printed channeled layer. For the latter, 40 channels were printed in parallel on a 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm format for the separation of 40 samples. For producing such a channeled plate, the running costs were below 0.04 Euro and the printing process took only 2 min. All modifications of the device and software were released open-source to encourage reuse and improvements and to stimulate the users to contribute to this technology. By this proof-of-principle, another asset was demonstrated to be integrated into the Office Chromatography concept, in which all relevant steps for online miniaturized planar chromatography are performed by a single device.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2017-02-18", "authors": ["DimitriFichou", "Gertrud EMorlock"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04813"}

The ES-Ag was synthesized using a single step ball milling process and characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These results confirmed the existence of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) in the interstitial spaces of the eggshell particles. The thin films in this study were prepared using hot melt extrusion and 3D printing for mechanical and antimicrobial testing, respectively. These films were also characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), XRD, tensile testing, and antimicrobial analysis. It was found that the incorporation of ES-Ag (0.5-2.0% content) compromised the tensile properties of the blend, due to poor interaction between the matrix and the ES-Ag in the ternary systems, but thermal analysis revealed improvement in the onset of degradation temperature and char yield at 500 \u00b0C. Though film toughness was better than that of PLA, the strength was lower, yet synergistic to those of PBAT and PLA. In general, the PBAT/PLA/ES-Ag ternary system had properties intermediate to those of the pure polymers. In vitro assessment of the antimicrobial activity of these films conducted on Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis bacteria revealed that the blend composite films possessed bacteriostatic effects, due to the immobilized ES-Ag nanomaterials in the blend matrix. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) analysis of water and food samples exposed to the films showed that Ag NPs were not released in distilled water and chicken breast after 72 and 168 h, respectively.", "journal": "Journal of agricultural and food chemistry", "date": "2017-02-17", "authors": ["Boniface JTiimob", "GregoryMwinyelle", "WoubitAbdela", "TemesgenSamuel", "ShaikJeelani", "Vijaya KRangari"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.jafc.7b00133"}

{"title": "A personalized 3D-printed prosthetic joint replacement for the human temporomandibular joint: From implant design to implantation.", "abstract": "Personalized prosthetic joint replacements have important applications in cases of complex bone and joint conditions where the shape and size of off-the-shelf components may not be adequate. The objective of this study was to design, test and fabricate a personalized 3D-printed prosthesis for a patient requiring total joint replacement surgery of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The new 'Melbourne' prosthetic TMJ design featured a condylar component sized specifically to the patient and fixation screw positions that avoid potential intra-operative damage to the mandibular nerve. The Melbourne prosthetic TMJ was developed for a 58-year-old female recipient with end-stage osteoarthritis of the TMJ. The load response of the prosthesis during chewing and a maximum-force bite was quantified using a personalized musculoskeletal model of the patient's masticatory system developed using medical images. The simulations were then repeated after implantation of the Biomet Microfixation prosthetic TMJ, an established stock device. The maximum condylar stresses, screw stress and mandibular stress at the screw-bone interface were lower in the Melbourne prosthetic TMJ (259.6MPa, 312.9MPa and 198.4MPa, respectively) than those in the Biomet Microfixation device (284.0MPa, 416.0MPa and 262.2MPa, respectively) during the maximum-force bite, with similar trends also observed during the chewing bite. After trialing surgical placement and evaluating prosthetic TMJ stability using cadaveric specimens, the prosthesis was fabricated using 3D printing, sterilized, and implanted into the female recipient. Six months post-operatively, the prosthesis recipient had a normal jaw opening distance (40.0 mm), with no complications identified. The new design features and immediate load response of the Melbourne prosthetic TMJ suggests that it may provide improved clinical and biomechanical joint function compared to a commonly used stock device, and reduce risk of intra-operative nerve damage during placement. The framework presented may be useful for designing and testing customized devices for the treatment of debilitating bone and joint conditions.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2017-02-16", "authors": ["David CAckland", "DaleRobinson", "MichaelRedhead", "Peter Vee SinLee", "AdrianMoskaljuk", "GeorgeDimitroulis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.01.048"}

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the initial mechanical stability of the new porous titanium revision cone system by measuring the micromotion under physiologic loading compared with a widely-used existing porous tantalum metaphyseal cone system.\nThe new cones were designed to precisely fit the femoral and tibial anatomy, and 3D printing technology was used to manufacture these porous titanium cones. The stability of the new titanium cones and the widely-used tantalum cones were compared under physiologic loading conditions in bench top test model.\nThe stability of the new titanium cones was either equivalent or better than the tantalum cones. The new titanium femoral cone construct had significantly less micromotion compared with the traditional femoral cone construct in 5 of the 12 directions measured (P < .05), whereas no statistical difference was found in 7 directions.

{"title": "Surface acoustic waves induced micropatterning of cells in gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels.", "abstract": "Acoustic force patterning is an emerging technology that provides a platform to control the spatial location of cells in a rapid, accurate, yet contactless manner. However, very few studies have been reported on the usage of acoustic force patterning for the rapid arrangement of biological objects, such as cells, in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. In this study, we report on a bio-acoustic force patterning technique, which uses surface acoustic waves (SAWs) for the rapid arrangement of cells within an extracellular matrix-based hydrogel such as gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA). A proof-of-principle was achieved through both simulations and experiments based on the in-house fabricated piezoelectric SAW transducers, which enabled us to explore the effects of various parameters on the performance of the built construct. The SAWs were applied in a fashion that generated standing SAWs (SSAWs) on the substrate, the energy of which subsequently was transferred into the gel, creating a rapid, and contactless alignment of the cells (<10 s, based on the experimental conditions). Following ultraviolet radiation induced photo-crosslinking of the cell encapsulated GelMA pre-polymer solution, the patterned cardiac cells readily spread after alignment in the GelMA hydrogel and demonstrated beating activity in 5-7 days. The described acoustic force assembly method can be utilized not only to control the spatial distribution of the cells inside a 3D construct, but can also preserve the viability and functionality of the patterned cells (e.g. beating rates of cardiac cells).

The development of precise, affordable 3D printing technologies has provided a new platform for novel research to be undertaken in 3D scaffold design and fabrication. In the past, a number of 3D scaffold designs have been fabricated to investigate the potential of a 3D printed scaffold as a construct which could support cellular life. These studies have shown promising results; however, few studies have utilized a low-cost desktop 3D printing technology as a potential rapid manufacturing route for different scaffold designs. Here six scaffold designs were manufactured using a Fused deposition modeling, a \"bottom-up\" solid freeform fabrication approach, to determine optimal scaffold architecture for three-dimensional cell growth. The scaffolds, produced from PLA, are coated using pullulan and hyaluronic acid to assess the coating influence on cell proliferation and metabolic rate. Scaffolds are characterized both pre- and postprocessing using water uptake analysis, mechanical testing, and morphological evaluation to study the inter-relationships between the printing process, scaffold design, and scaffold properties. It was found that there were key differences between each scaffold design in terms of porosity, diffusivity, swellability, and compressive strength. An optimal design was chosen based on these physical measurements which were then weighted in accordance to design importance based on literature and utilizing a design matrix technique. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In conventional culture systems, bovine oviduct epithelial cells (BOEC) undergo a rapid loss of essential differentiated cell properties; we aimed to develop a more physiological in vitro oviduct culture system capable of supporting fertilization. U-shaped chambers were produced using stereo-lithography and mounted with polycarbonate membranes, which were used as culture inserts for primary BOECs. Cells were grown to confluence and cultured at an air-liquid interface for 4 to 6 weeks and subsequently either fixed for immune staining, incubated with sperm cells for live-cell imaging, or used in an oocyte penetration study. Confluent BOEC cultures maintained polarization and differentiation status for at least 6 weeks. When sperm and oocytes were introduced into the system, the BOECs supported oocyte penetration in the absence of artificial sperm capacitation factors while also preventing polyspermy and parthenogenic activation, both of which occur in classical in vitro fertilization systems. Moreover, this \"oviduct-on-a-chip\" allowed live imaging of sperm-oviduct epithelium binding and release. Taken together, we describe for the first time the use of 3D-printing as a step further on bio-mimicking the oviduct, with polarized and differentiated BOECs in a tubular shape that can be perfused or manipulated, which is suitable for live imaging and supports in vitro fertilization.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2017-02-15", "authors": ["Marcia A M MFerraz", "Heiko H WHenning", "Pedro FCosta", "JosMalda", "Ferry PMelchels", "RWubbolts", "Tom A EStout", "Peter L A MVos", "Bart MGadella"], "doi": "10.1039/c6lc01566b"}

The application of 3D printing definitely accelerated the prototyping of microfluidic chips by its versatility and functionality. However, the resolution of existing 3D printing techniques is still far below that of lithography, which makes it difficult to work on the scale of single cells and near impossible for single molecule work. In this paper, we present a facile way to increase the resolution of 3D printed microstructures to minimally 4 \u03bcm by casting-shrinkage cycles of a polyurethane (PU) polymer. A water-PU liquid mixture poured on a 3D printed template quickly solidifies replicating the structures, which then isometrically shrink to half its size after solvent evaporation, downscaling the replicated structures. By repeating the casting-shrinkage cycles, we could downscale the (sub)millimeter structures of 3D printed structures on demand, until the working limit posed by the polymer properties, which we demonstrate by fabricating a micromixer. Moreover, we can even fabricate microfluidic chips from millimeter-scale manually assembled templates, fully independent of any micromachining facilities, significantly reducing the technical barriers and costs, thus opening up the microfluidics field to low-resource areas.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2017-02-15", "authors": ["MiaoSun", "YanboXie", "JihongZhu", "JunLi", "Jan C TEijkel"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.6b05148"}

With the help of the template, in femoral neck fracture cases, three screws could be accurately inserted into the femoral neck to implant the LCP-PHP and stabilize the fracture. The template for DDH includes all operation parameters and steps for proximal femoral varus rotation and shortening osteotomy, which made the surgery much easier to perform. Radiographs taken after surgery showed that the postoperative results closely corresponded to the preoperative computer simulation. The average time taken for LCP-PHP placement was 26.5\u00a0min; radiography was used during surgery only for an average of 6.0 times. Postoperative radiographs showed good results.\nWith the use of CAD and 3D printing technology, accurate placement of individualized navigation template of LCP-PHP can be achieved.

Empirical residence time distribution data were used to derive each tubular design's volume equivalent to a theoretical plate (VETP) values at a various process flow rates. One design, the Jig in a Box (JIB), yielded the lowest VETP, indicating optimal radial mixing and minimal axial dispersion. A minimum residence time (MRT) approach was employed, where the MRT is the minimum time the product spends in the tubular reactor. This incubation time is typically 60 minutes in a batch process. We provide recommendations for combinations of flow rates and device dimensions for operation of the JIB connected in series that will meet a 60-min MRT. The results show that under a wide range of flow rates and corresponding volumes, it takes 75\u2009\u00b1\u20093 min for 99% of the product to exit the reactor while meeting the 60-min MRT criterion and fulfilling the constraint of keeping a differential pressure drop under 5 psi.

{"title": "Development of a novel alginate-polyvinyl alcohol-hydroxyapatite hydrogel for 3D bioprinting bone tissue engineered scaffolds.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional printed biomaterials used as personalized tissue substitutes have the ability to promote and enhance regeneration in areas of defected tissue. The challenge with 3D printing for bone tissue engineering remains the selection of a material with optimal rheological properties for printing in addition to biocompatibility and capacity for uniform cell incorporation. Hydrogel biomaterials may provide sufficient printability to allow cell encapsulation and bioprinting of scaffolds with uniform cell distribution. In this study, a novel alginate-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-hydroxyapatite (HA) hydrogel formulation with optimal rheological properties for 3D bioprinting of mouse calvaria 3T3-E1 (MC3T3) cells into scaffolds of high shape fidelity has been developed. A systematic investigation was conducted to determine the effect of varying concentrations of alginate, phosphate, calcium, and the PVA-HA suspension in the formulation on the resulting viscosity and thus printability of the hydrogel. HA, the main mineral component in natural bone, was incorporated into the hydrogel formulation to create a favorable bone-forming environment due to its excellent osteoconductivity. Degradation studies in \u03b1-MEM cell culture media showed that the 3D printed alginate-PVA-HA scaffolds remained in-tact for 14 days. MC3T3 cells were well distributed and encapsulated throughout the optimal hydrogel formulation and expressed high viability through the completion of the 3D printing process. Thus, the development of this novel, osteoconductive, biodegradable, alginate-PVA-HA formulation and its ability to 3D bioprint tissue engineered scaffolds make it a promising candidate for treating personalized bone defects. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Although PAO provides excellent radiographic and clinical results, it is a technically demanding procedure with a distinct learning curve that requires careful 3D planning and, above all, has a number of potential complications. We therefore developed a pre-operative simulation method for PAO via creation of a new full-scale model.\nThe model was prepared from the patient's Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) formatted data from computed tomography (CT), for construction and assembly using 3D printing technology. A major feature of our model is that it is constructed from salt. In contrast to conventional models, our model provides a more accurate representation, at a lower manufacturing cost, and requires a shorter production time. Furthermore, our model realized simulated operation normally with using a chisel and drill without easy breakage or fissure. We were able to easily simulate the line of osteotomy and confirm acetabular version and coverage after moving to the osteotomized fragment. Additionally, this model allowed a dynamic assessment that avoided anterior impingement following the osteotomy.\nOur models clearly reflected the anatomical shape of the patient's hip. Our models allowed for surgical simulation, making realistic use of the chisel and drill.

Addition of \u03b2-stabilizers, e.g. niobium, can improve the mechanical properties of such titanium alloys further, simultaneously offering excellent biocompatibility. In this in vitro study, human osteoblasts and fibroblasts were cultured on different niobium specimens (Nb Amperit, Nb Ampertec), Nb sheets and Ti-42Nb (sintered and 3D-printed by selective laser melting, SLM) and compared with forged Ti6Al4V specimens. Furthermore, human osteoblasts were incubated with particulates of the Nb and Ti-42Nb specimens in three concentrations over four and seven days to imitate influence of wear debris. Thereby, the specimens with the roughest surfaces, i.e. Ti-42Nb and Nb Ampertec, revealed excellent and similar results for both cell types concerning cell viability and collagen synthesis superior to forged Ti6Al4V. Examinations with particulate debris disclosed a dose-dependent influence of all powders with Nb Ampertec showing the highest decrease of cell viability and collagen synthesis. Furthermore, interleukin synthesis was only slightly increased for all powders.

The presence of a bone-like apatite layer on the composites surface after immersion in simulated body fluid was considered by scanning electron microscopy.

The proliferation and alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin and osteocalcin osteogenesis-related protein expression of the hMSCs on the 1wt% graphene-contained specimens showed better results than on the pure CS.

{"title": "Tubular collagen scaffolds with radial elasticity for hollow organ regeneration.", "abstract": "Tubular collagen scaffolds have been used for the repair of damaged hollow organs in regenerative medicine, but they generally lack the ability to reversibly expand in radial direction, a physiological characteristic seen in many native tubular organs. In this study, tubular collagen scaffolds were prepared that display a shape recovery effect and therefore exhibit radial elasticity. Scaffolds were constructed by compression of fibrillar collagen around a star-shaped mandrel, mimicking folds in a lumen, a typical characteristic of empty tubular hollow organs, such as ureter or urethra. Shape recovery effect was introduced by in situ fixation using a star-shaped mandrel, 3D-printed clamps and cytocompatible carbodiimide crosslinking. Prepared scaffolds expanded upon increase of luminal pressure and closed to the star-shaped conformation after removal of pressure. In this study, we applied this method to construct a scaffold mimicking the dynamics of human urethra. Radial expansion and closure of the scaffold could be iteratively performed for at least 1000 cycles, burst pressure being 132\u00b122mmHg. Scaffolds were seeded with human epithelial cells and cultured in a bioreactor under dynamic conditions mimicking urination (pulse flow of 21s every 2h). Cells adhered and formed a closed luminal layer that resisted flow conditions. In conclusion, a new type of a tubular collagen scaffold has been constructed with radial elastic-like characteristics based on the shape of the scaffold, and enabling the scaffold to reversibly expand upon increase in luminal pressure. These scaffolds may be useful for regenerative medicine of tubular organs.\nIn this paper, a new type I collagen-based tubular scaffold is presented that possesses intrinsic radial elasticity. This characteristic is key to the functioning of a number of tubular organs including blood vessels and organs of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tract. The scaffold was given a star-shaped lumen by physical compression and chemical crosslinking, mimicking the folding pattern observed in many tubular organs. In rest, the lumen is closed but it opens upon increase of luminal pressure, e.g. when fluids pass. Human epithelial cells seeded on the luminal side adhered well and were compatible with voiding dynamics in a bioreactor.

Through composite mesh, the solid tipped TSPs required less force than hollow tipped ones (3.87 \u00b1 0.25 N vs 7.88 \u00b1 0.20 N [ P = 0.00026]). Overall, smaller diameter TSPs required less force than the larger TSPs when passed through ePTFE empty (Gore 2.95 \u00b1 0.83 N vs Carter-Thomason 16.07 \u00b1 2.10 N [ P = .0005]) or with suture (Gore 8.37 \u00b1 2.59 N vs Carter-Thomason 19.12 \u00b1 1.10 N [ P = .003]).\nDiameter plays the greatest role in the force required for TSP penetration. However, when passed through underlay mesh or while holding suture, distal tip shape, the mechanism of suture holding, and shaft diameter all contribute to the forces necessary for penetration. These factors should be considered when choosing a TSP for intraoperative use.", "journal": "Surgical innovation", "date": "2017-02-10", "authors": ["Alexander JShope", "Joshua SWinder", "Jonathan TBliggenstorfer", "Kristen TCrowell", "Randy SHaluck", "Eric MPauli"], "doi": "10.1177/1553350617691709"}

This research proposes a new method to transform the appearance of facial model after complete denture prosthesis. A feature template with few feature points is first constructed according to the facial muscle anatomy and facial deformation after complete denture prosthesis. Next, the traditional as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) method is optimised by clustering based on facial muscles. The optimised ARAP method is then used for real-time and interactive simulations. Finally, by classifying the degrees of elasticity in the model with additional weights, the simulation can be customised to the skin of individual patients. Different degrees of elastic deformation and post-operative models are superimposed for match analysis. Compared with our previous study, the error is reduced by 24.05%.

{"title": "Development of biomimetic micro-patterned device incorporated with neurotrophic gradient and supportive Schwann cells for the applications in neural tissue engineering.", "abstract": "In these years, the artificial nerve guidance conduit (NGC) has been developed as an alternative way to repair peripheral nerve injury. Unlike autologous nerve graft, the artificial NGC without proper stimulating factors and guidance cues still cannot obtain satisfactory prognosis for clinical patients. In this study, a biodegradable polymer-based implantable device has been developed and characterized. By incorporating three stimulating factors: (1) micro-patterned surface that can directionally guide the axon as physical cue; (2) neurotrophic gradient membrane that can continually attract axon outgrowth from the proximal to distal stump as chemical cue; (3) Schwann cells (SCs) that can support the growth of neurite and form myelin sheath around axon as biological cue, we expect that this construct can be used as a promising NGC for peripheral nerve regeneration. The results showed that the micro-patterned surface with specific dimension of channels and chambers can be precisely fabricated by laser ablation. Attachment and directional extension of differentiated neural stem cells (NSCs) were observed in micro-channels. The gradient distribution of nerve growth factor 7S on gelatin membrane was successfully achieved. Significant improvement in neurite length and increase in neuronal gene expressions were also noticed in higher concentration region. When co-culturing with SCs, NSCs can differentiate toward neuronal cells with strong expression of mature neuronal markers: \u03b2III tubulin and microtubule-associated protein-2 (Map 2). Meanwhile, myelin basic protein was also observed, suggesting that SCs can provide biological support to neuronal cells in vitro.

It was desired to see whether or not and to what extent each of the aforementioned parameters affect the mechanical properties of a porous structure. It was seen that the strut cross-section type does not have a considerable effect on the structure Young's modulus while its effect on the structure yield stress is significant. The strut length was not effective on the mechanical properties if the relative density was kept constant. It was also observed that the structure unit cell type and relative density have a considerable effect on the elastic properties. The highest and the lowest stiffness and strength belonged to the cube and diamond unit cell types, respectively. The rhombic dodecahedron structure with circular cross-section had a high yielding strength (second among all the cases) while its Young's modulus was relatively low.

The skull maps range from segmented, homogeneous models, to fully heterogeneous models derived from medical image intensity. In the present work, the impact of uncertainties in the skull properties is examined using a model of transcranial propagation from a single element focused transducer. The impact of changes in bone layer geometry and the sound speed, density, and acoustic absorption values is quantified through a numerical sensitivity analysis. Sound speed is shown to be the most influential acoustic property, and must be defined with less than 4% error to obtain acceptable accuracy in simulated focus pressure, position, and volume. Changes in the skull thickness of as little as 0.1\u2009mm can cause an error in peak intracranial pressure of greater than 5%, while smoothing with a 1 [Formula: see text] kernel to imitate the effect of obtaining skull maps from low resolution images causes an increase of over 50% in peak pressure.

Due to the mild processing conditions compared to other additive manufacturing methods, DIW enables the incorporation of sensitive compounds such as proteins or drugs into the printed structure. Although emulsified oil-in-water systems are commonly used vehicles for such compounds in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic applications, printing of such emulsions into architectured soft materials has not been fully exploited and would open new possibilities for the controlled delivery of sensitive compounds. Here, we 3D print concentrated emulsions into soft materials, whose multiphase architecture allows for site-specific incorporation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds into the same structure. As a model ink, concentrated emulsions stabilized by chitosan-modified silica nanoparticles are studied, because they are sufficiently stable against coalescence during the centrifugation step needed to create a bridging network of droplets. The resulting ink is ideal for 3D printing as it displays high yield stress, storage modulus and elastic recovery, through the formation of networks of droplets as well as of gelled silica nanoparticles in the presence of chitosan. To demonstrate possible architectures, we print biocompatible soft materials with tunable hierarchical porosity containing an encapsulated hydrophobic compound positioned in specific locations of the structure.

It was found that triply periodic minimal surfaces display superior static mechanical properties in comparison to conventional octahedron beam lattice structures at identical volume fractions. Fatigue resistance was also found to be highly geometry dependent due to the effects of AM processing techniques on the surface topography and notch sensitivity. Geometries minimising nodal points and the staircase effect displayed the greatest fatigue resistance when normalized to yield strength. Furthermore oxygen analysis showed a large oxygen uptake during SLM processing which must be altered to meet ASTM medical grade standards and may significantly reduce fatigue life.

The TCP muscles were recently introduced and provided unprecedented strain, mechanical work, and lifecycle (Haines et al 2014 Science 343 868-72). The five-fingered humanoid hand is under-actuated and has 16\u2009degrees of freedom (DOF) in total (15 for fingers and 1 at the palm). In the under-actuated hand designs, a single actuator provides coupled motions at the phalanges of each finger. Two different designs are presented along with the essential elements consisting of actuators, springs, tendons and guide systems. Experiments were conducted to investigate the performance of the TCP muscles in response to the power input (power magnitude, type of wave form such as pulsed or square wave, and pulse duration) and the resulting actuation stroke and force generation. A kinematic model of the flexor tendons was developed to simulate the flexion motion and compare with experimental results. For fast finger movements, short high-power pulses were employed. Finally, we demonstrated the grasping of various objects using the humanoid TCP hand showing an array of functions similar to a natural hand.", "journal": "Bioinspiration & biomimetics", "date": "2017-02-06", "authors": ["LianjunWu", "MonicaJung de Andrade", "Lokesh KumarSaharan", "Richard StevenRome", "Ray HBaughman", "YonasTadesse"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-3190/aa52f8"}

The 3D data of these cadavers were imported to specialized software and used to analyze the region of the recipient sites, and the donor teeth were selected. Subsequently, congruent to the donor teeth, custom surgical tooling and surgical-guided templates were designed and 3D printed. The guided osteotomies were performed and the donor teeth transplanted. To evaluate the planned donor teeth positions compared with the transplanted donor teeth positions, the mandibles were scanned again using the CBCT system, and software matching was applied to measure the accuracy of the procedure.\nThe mean angular deflection of the transplanted donor teeth with the planned donor teeth positions was 5.6 \u00b1 5.4\u00b0. Comparing the 3D positions of the shoulders, a mean deviation of 3.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.16\u00a0mm and a mean apical deviation of 2.61 \u00b1 0.78\u00a0mm were found.\nThe described method of computer-assisted template-guided autotransplantation of teeth with custom 3D designed/printed surgical tooling could potentially provide a relatively accurate alternative for the currently available treatment approaches.

We show that photolithographically fabricated microfluidic devices offer a simple and reliable way to create anatomically inspired complex structures. Furthermore, the use of photo-cross-linkable methacrylated alginate allows modulation of both the mechanical properties and biological activity of the hydrogels for targeted applications. Via this approach, multilayered hollow microfibers were continuously fabricated, which can be easily assembled in situ, using 3D printing, into a larger, tissue-like construct. Importantly, this biomimetic approach promoted the development of phenotypical functions of the target tissue. As a model to engineer a complex tissue construct, osteon-like fiber was biomimetically engineered, and enhanced vasculogenic and osteogenic expression were observed in the encapsulated human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells and osteoblast-like MG63 cells respectively within the osteon fibers.

In this study, the 3D-printed PCL implant for nasal augmentation was further evaluated for its suitability for nasal surgeries such as septoplasty and rhinoplasty.\nTen New Zealand White rabbits were included and divided into study and sham groups (7 and 3, respectively). A lateral incision was made on the nasal dorsum and a pocket formed in the subperichondrial plane between the upper lateral cartilage and nasal septum. Polycaprolactone was fabricated based on 3D printing technology into a 0.8 \u00d7 0.8-cm rectangular shape for use as a nasal implant. The material was inserted as a septal extension graft and sutured with alar cartilage for nasal reshaping. The implants were harvested 4, 8, and 12 weeks after implantation and evaluated by gross morphological assessment and histological examination.\nThe initial shape of the implant was unchanged in all cases, and no definitive postoperative complications were seen over the 3-month period. Gross morphological evaluation confirmed that implants remained in their initial location without migration or extrusion. Histologic evaluations showed that the implant architectures were maintained with excellent fibrovascular ingrowth and minimal inflammatory reactions.\nPolycaprolactone can be used for nasal reconstruction such as nasal augmentation. Polycaprolactone is easy to work with and will avoid the increased operative time and morbidity associated with autograft harvesting.

According to Enneking's classification of bone defects, there were three Type I lesions, 12 Type II+III lesions, five Type I+II lesions, two Type I+II+III lesions, ten type I+II+IV lesions and three type I+II+III+IV lesions. A total of three patients underwent reconstruction using an iliac prosthesis, 12 using a standard hemipelvic prosthesis and 20 using a screw-rod connected hemipelvic prosthesis.\nAll patients had an en bloc resection. Margins were wide in 15 patients, marginal in 14 and intralesional in six. After a mean follow-up of 20.5 months (6 to 30), 25 patients survived without evidence of disease, five were alive with disease and five had died from metastatic disease. Complications included seven patients with delayed wound healing and two with a dislocation of the hip. None had a deep infection. For the 30 surviving patients, the mean Musculoskeletal Society 93 score was 22.7 (20 to 25) for patients with an iliac prosthesis, 19.8 (15 to 26) for those with a standard prosthesis, and 17.7 (9 to 25) for those with a screw-rod connected prosthesis.\nThe application of 3D-printing technology can facilitate the precise matching and osseointegration between implants and the host bone.

{"title": "Three-dimensional interstitial space mediates predator foraging success in different spatial arrangements.", "abstract": "Identifying and quantifying the relevant properties of habitat structure that mediate predator-prey interactions remains a persistent challenge. Most previous studies investigate effects of structural density on trophic interactions and typically quantify refuge quality using one or two-dimensional metrics. Few consider spatial arrangement of components (i.e., orientation and shape) and often neglect to measure the total three-dimensional (3D) space available as refuge. This study tests whether the three-dimensionality of interstitial space, an attribute produced by the spatial arrangement of oyster (Crassostrea virginica) shells, impacts the foraging success of nektonic predators (primary blue crab, Callinectes sapidus) on mud crab prey (Eurypanopeus depressus) in field and mesocosm experiments. Interstices of 3D-printed shell mimics were manipulated by changing either their orientation (angle) or internal shape (crevice or channel). In both field and mesocosm experiments, under conditions of constant structural density, predator foraging success was influenced by 3D aspects of interstitial space. Proportional survivorship of tethered mud crabs differed significantly as 3D interstitial space varied by orientation, displaying decreasing prey survivorship as angle of orientation increased (0\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a00.76, 22.5\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a00.13, 45\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a00.0). Tethered prey survivorship was high when 3D interstitial space of mimics was modified by internal shape (crevice\u00a0survivorship =\u00a00.89, channel\u00a0survivorship =\u00a00.96) and these values did not differ significantly. In mesocosms, foraging success of blue crabs varied with 3D interstitial space as mean proportional survivorship (\u00b1 SE) of mud crabs was significantly lower in 45\u00b0 (0.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06) vs. 0\u00b0 (0.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04) orientations and for crevice (0.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11) vs. channel shapes (0.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02). These results suggest that 3D aspects of interstitial space, which have direct relevance to refuge quality, can strongly influence foraging success in our oyster reef habitat.

The patient underwent subsequent laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy. The entire process is described step-by-step, and only free-to-use and mostly open-source software was used.\nAs a result, a transparent, full-sized liver model with visible vessels and colorectal metastasis was created for under $150, which-taking into account 3D printer prices-is much cheaper than models presented in previous research papers.\nThe increased accessibility of 3D models for physicians before complex laparoscopic surgical procedures such as hepatic resections could lead to beneficial breakthroughs in these sophisticated surgeries, as many reports show that these models reduce operative time and improve short term outcomes.", "journal": "International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery", "date": "2017-02-02", "authors": ["Jan SylwesterWitowski", "Micha\u0142P\u0119dziwiatr", "PiotrMajor", "AndrzejBudzy\u0144ski"], "doi": "10.1007/s11548-017-1527-3\n10.1016/j.surg.2015.12.017\n10.1016/j.jcms.2014.12.016\n10.1016/j.jcms.2013.10.001\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.505-507.1063\n10.1016/j.jsurg.2016.01.003\n10.1002/lt.23729\n10.1007/s40472-016-0088-7\n10.1021/ac4041857\n10.1016/j.jsurg.2013.10.012\n10.1007/s00268-014-2740-7\n10.1007/s11548-010-0476-x\n10.1007/s00268-016-3541-y\n10.3389/fsurg.2015.00025\n10.1007/s00383-015-3709-9\n10.1120/jacmp.v11i2.3037\n10.1148/radiol.2341031801\n10.1105/tpc.114.135061\n10.1097/00000658-199112000-00008"}
{"title": "Update on the Role of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Congenital Heart Disease.", "abstract": "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is an important imaging modality in the evaluation of congenital heart diseases (CHD). CMR has several strengths including good spatial and temporal resolutions, wide field-of-view, and multi-planar imaging capabilities. CMR provides significant advantages for imaging in CHD through its ability to measure function, flow and vessel sizes, create three-dimensional reconstructions, and perform tissue characterization, all in a single imaging study. Thus, CMR is the most comprehensive imaging modality available today for the evaluation of CHD. Newer MRI sequences and post-processing tools will allow further development of quantitative methods of analysis, and opens the door for risk stratification in CHD. CMR also can interface with computer modeling, 3D printing, and other methods of understanding the complex anatomic and physiologic relationships in CHD.", "journal": "Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2017-02-02", "authors": ["PrabhakarRajiah", "AnimeshTandon", "Gerald FGreil", "SuhnyAbbara"], "doi": "10.1007/s11936-017-0504-z"}

{"title": "Patient-specific pediatric silicone heart valve models based on 3D ultrasound.", "abstract": "Patient-specific heart and valve models have shown promise as training and planning tools for heart surgery, but physically realistic valve models remain elusive. Available proprietary, simulation-focused heart valve models are generic adult mitral valves and do not allow for patient-specific modeling as may be needed for rare diseases such as congenitally abnormal valves. We propose creating silicone valve models from a 3D-printed plastic mold as a solution that can be adapted to any individual patient and heart valve at a fraction of the cost of direct 3D-printing using soft materials.\nLeaflets of a pediatric mitral valve, a tricuspid valve in a patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and a complete atrioventricular canal valve were segmented from ultrasound images. A custom software was developed to automatically generate molds for each valve based on the segmentation. These molds were 3D-printed and used to make silicone valve models. The models were designed with cylindrical rims of different sizes surrounding the leaflets, to show the outline of the valve and add rigidity. Pediatric cardiac surgeons practiced suturing on the models and evaluated them for use as surgical planning and training tools.\nFive out of six surgeons reported that the valve models would be very useful as training tools for cardiac surgery. In this first iteration of valve models, leaflets were felt to be unrealistically thick or stiff compared to real pediatric leaflets. A thin tube rim was preferred for valve flexibility.\nThe valve models were well received and considered to be valuable and accessible tools for heart valve surgery training. Further improvements will be made based on surgeons' feedback.", "journal": "Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering", "date": "2017-02-01", "authors": ["AnnaIlina", "AndrasLasso", "Matthew AJolley", "BrittanyWohler", "AlexNguyen", "AdamScanlan", "ZacharyBaum", "FrankMcGowan", "GaborFichtinger"], "doi": "10.1117/12.2255849"}

Here, porous polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber meshes with different nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) concentrations were prepared by electrospinning with stainless steel mesh as the collector, and 3D porous nanofiber scaffolds were fabricated via layer-by-layer assembly with a special binder (18% PCL/DCM solution). The single layer nanofiber mesh possessed very regular morphology with a hollow structure, and the nHA was not only embedded in the nanofiber but also exposed on the surfaces of the fiber, resulting in the improved surface chemical properties. The incorporation of nHA also had a significant effect on cell behaviours and functions. The 3D nanofiber scaffolds possessed hierarchical structures with interconnected micro and macro pores, which allowed cells to migrate between the adjacent layers, even throughout the scaffold. Cells filled the scaffold space and integrated with the nanofiber materials, forming scaffold/cells complexes in vitro. In addition, alendronate was successfully carried on the 3D composite scaffolds because of the high affinity of P-C-P backbone to calcium ions. The composite scaffolds treated with alendronate significantly promote the osteogenesis-related gene expression of human foetal osteoblasts.

Polymeric track-etched membranes, while permeable to small molecules, are far from physiological with respect to physical interactions with co-cultured cells and are not compatible with high-resolution imaging due to light scattering and autofluorescence. Here we report on an optically transparent ultrathin membrane with porosity exceeding 20%. We optimize deposition and annealing conditions to create a tensile and robust porous silicon dioxide membrane that is comparable in thickness to the vascular basement membrane (100-300 nm). We demonstrate that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) spread and proliferate on these membranes similarly to control substrates. Additionally, HUVECs are able to transfer cytoplasmic cargo to adipose-derived stem cells when they are co-cultured on opposite sides of the membrane, demonstrating its thickness supports physiologically relevant cellular interactions. Lastly, we confirm that these porous glass membranes are compatible with lift-off processes yielding membrane sheets with an active area of many square centimeters.

{"title": "Cell-like features imprinted in the physical nano- and micro-topography of the environment modify the responses to anti-cancer drugs of endometrial cancer cells.", "abstract": "Topographical features of cells at nanometre resolution were fabricated in polystyrene. The study investigated the effect of physical topography on the response of cancer cells to the common anticancer drugs, paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Human endometrial cancer cells (Ishikawa) were incubated on substrates containing cell-like features that had been fabricated using our bioimprint methodology to create moulds of cells with positive (convex) and negative (concave) topography. Control cultures were performed on flat substrates. Effects of the drugs on caspase-3 expression, proliferating nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, cell number and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion were determined. Results revealed that the topography influenced the cell responses in a drug-dependent manner i.e. paclitaxel effects were sensitive to topography differently to those of doxorubicin. In addition, function signalling pathways were sensitive to the detailed topography i.e. positive imprint and negative imprint induced distinct response patterns. The results in this study show for the first time that a culture surface with cell-like topography, that has both nano- and micro-resolution, influences endometrial cancer cell responses to chemotherapy drugs. The effects are dependent on the topography and also on the chemotherapy drug. In particular, the platforms described have potential to provide substrates with high physical relevancy on which to undertake preclinical testing of new drugs. The method also allows for use of different cell types to provide cell-specific topography. The results imply that physical architecture of the cancer cell environment may be a suitable prospective target to enhance clinical activity of traditional drugs. Additionally or alternatively we provide compelling support for the notion that understanding the physical component of the nano- and micro-environment may encourage a redirection of drug development. Further, our observation that the cells distinguish between the different cell-like topographies (positive and negative bioimprints) indicates that a realistic topography is advantageous as growth platforms in experiment design.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-02-01", "authors": ["Li HuiTan", "Peter HSykes", "Maan MAlkaisi", "John JEvans"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa5c9a"}

The purpose of this approach was to introduce a new surgical endodontic technique by using a three-dimensional printed template for guided osteotomy and root resection.\nA 38-year-old patient was diagnosed with periapical lesions of teeth #3 and #4 and extruded gutta-percha material. Three-dimensional radiographic and optical scan files were imported into surgical planning software designed for guided implant surgery. Within the adapted software program the periapical lesions and the extruded gutta-percha were visualized and marked. With the aid of virtually positioned surgical pins and piezoelectric instruments, the osteotomy size, the apical resection level, and the bevel angle were defined before treatment. Three-dimensional surgical templates for each tooth were designed within the software program for a guided treatment approach.\nThis approach comprised the treatment of periapical lesions of teeth #3 and #4 with root-end fillings and the detection and complete removal of the extruded gutta-percha material without perforation of sinus membrane.

{"title": "The twisted structure of the Achilles tendon unraveled: A detailed quantitative and qualitative anatomical investigation.", "abstract": "The Achilles tendon (AT) consists of fibers originating from the soleus muscle (SOL), which lies deep, and the medial (GM) and lateral (GL) heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, which lie superficial. As the fibers descend toward the insertion of the AT, the individual subtendons twist around each other. The aim of this study was to investigate the twisted structure of the AT and its individual subtendons. Specimens of the AT, with preserved calcaneal bone and a fragment of the triceps surae muscle, were obtained from 53 fresh-frozen, male cadavers (n=106 lower limbs). The angle of torsion of each of the AT's subtendons was measured using a specially designed and 3D-printed tool. The mean distance between the most distal fibers of the triceps surae muscle and the superior border of the calcaneal bone was 60.77\u00b114.15\u00a0mm. The largest component of the AT at the level of its insertion into the calcaneal bone is the subtendon from the GL (44.43%), followed by the subtendon from SOL (27.89%), and the subtendon from GM (27.68%). The fibers originating from the GM rotate on average 28.17\u00b115.15\u00b0, while the fibers originating from the GL and SOL twist 135.98\u00b133.58\u00b0 and 128.58\u00b129.63\u00b0, respectively. The torsion of superficial fibers (GM) comprising the AT is significantly lower than that of deeper fibers (GL and SOL). The cross-sectional area of the AT is smaller at the level of the musculo-tendinous junction than at the level of its insertion. This study illustrates the three types of the AT with differently twisting subtendons, as well as a generalized model of the AT. Types of AT torsion may potentially alter the biomechanical properties of the tendon, thus possibly influencing the pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to the development of various tendinopathies.", "journal": "Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports", "date": "2017-02-01", "authors": ["P AP\u0119kala", "B MHenry", "AOcha\u0142a", "PKopacz", "GTato\u0144", "AM\u0142yniec", "J AWalocha", "K ATomaszewski"], "doi": "10.1111/sms.12835"}
{"title": "Recent advances in hydrogels for cartilage tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Articular cartilage is a load-bearing tissue that lines the surface of bones in diarthrodial joints. Unfortunately, this avascular tissue has a limited capacity for intrinsic repair. Treatment options for articular cartilage defects include microfracture and arthroplasty; however, these strategies fail to generate tissue that adequately restores damaged cartilage. Limitations of current treatments for cartilage defects have prompted the field of cartilage tissue engineering, which seeks to integrate engineering and biological principles to promote the growth of new cartilage to replace damaged tissue. To date, a wide range of scaffolds and cell sources have emerged with a focus on recapitulating the microenvironments present during development or in adult tissue, in order to induce the formation of cartilaginous constructs with biochemical and mechanical properties of native tissue. Hydrogels have emerged as a promising scaffold due to the wide range of possible properties and the ability to entrap cells within the material. Towards improving cartilage repair, hydrogel design has advanced in recent years to improve their utility. Some of these advances include the development of improved network crosslinking (e.g. double-networks), new techniques to process hydrogels (e.g. 3D printing) and better incorporation of biological signals (e.g. controlled release).

Pilot study.", "abstract": "Treatment of medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis with a high-tibial osteotomy (HTO) is most effective when the optimal angular correction is achieved. However, conventional instrumentation is limited when multiplanar correction is needed.\nUse of patient-specific cutting guides (PSCGs) for HTO provides an accurate correction (difference<2\u00b0) relative to the preoperative planning.\nBetween February\u00a02014 and February\u00a02015, 10\u00a0patients (mean age: 46\u00a0years [range: 31-59]; grade\u00a01 or 2 osteoarthritis in Ahlb\u00e4ck's classification) were included prospectively in this reliability and safety study. All patients were operated using the same medial opening-wedge osteotomy technique. Preoperative planning was based on long-leg radiographs and CT scans with 3D reconstruction. The PSGCs were used to align the osteotomy cut and position the screw holes for the plate. The desired correction was achieved in the three planes when the holes on the plate were aligned with the holes drilled based on the PSCG. Preoperatively, the mean HKA angle was 171.9\u00b0 (range: 166-179\u00b0), the mean proximal tibial angle was 87\u00b0 (86-88\u00b0) and the mean tibial slope was 7.8\u00b0 (1-22\u00b0). The postoperative correction was compared to the planned correction using 3D CT scan transformations. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were assessed at a minimum follow-up of 1\u00a0year.\nThe procedure was successfully carried out in all patients with the PSCGs. On postoperative long-leg radiographs, the mean HKA was 182.3\u00b0 (180-185\u00b0); on the CT scan, the mean tibial mechanical angle was 94\u00b0 (90-98\u00b0) and the mean tibial slope was 7.1\u00b0 (4-11\u00b0). In 19 out of 20\u00a0postoperative HKA and slope measurements, the difference between the planned and achieved correction was <2\u00b0 based on the 3D analysis of the three planes in space; in the other case, the slope was 13\u00b0 instead of the planned 10\u00b0. The intra-class correlation coefficients between the postoperative and planned parameters were 0.98 [0.92-0.99] for the HKA and 0.96 [0.79-0.99] for the tibial slope. There were no surgical site infections; one patient had a postoperative hematoma that resolved spontaneously.\nThe results of this study showed that use of PSCGs in HTO procedures helps to achieve optimal correction in a safe and reliable manner.\nIV - Prospective cohort study.", "journal": "Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR", "date": "2017-02-01", "authors": ["MMunier", "MDonnez", "MOllivier", "XFlecher", "PChabrand", "J-NArgenson", "SParratte"], "doi": "10.1016/j.otsr.2016.11.020"}
{"title": "Gap-free segmentation of vascular networks with automatic image processing pipeline.", "abstract": "Current image processing techniques capture large vessels reliably but often fail to preserve connectivity in bifurcations and small vessels. Imaging artifacts and noise can create gaps and discontinuity of intensity that hinders segmentation of vascular trees. However, topological analysis of vascular trees require proper connectivity without gaps, loops or dangling segments. Proper tree connectivity is also important for high quality rendering of surface meshes for scientific visualization or 3D printing. We present a fully automated vessel enhancement pipeline with automated parameter settings for vessel enhancement of tree-like structures from customary imaging sources, including 3D rotational angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, magnetic resonance venography, and computed tomography angiography. The output of the filter pipeline is a vessel-enhanced image which is ideal for generating anatomical consistent network representations of the cerebral angioarchitecture for further topological or statistical analysis. The filter pipeline combined with computational modeling can potentially improve computer-aided diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases by delivering biometrics and anatomy of the vasculature. It may serve as the first step in fully automatic epidemiological analysis of large clinical datasets. The automatic analysis would enable rigorous statistical comparison of biometrics in subject-specific vascular trees. The robust and accurate image segmentation using a validated filter pipeline would also eliminate operator dependency that has been observed in manual segmentation. Moreover, manual segmentation is time prohibitive given that vascular trees have more than thousands of segments and bifurcations so that interactive segmentation consumes excessive human resources.

In this study, micro-sized flexible ZnO UV photodetectors have been thoroughly prepared by a facile inkjet printing technology and followed with heat treatments. A simple ink recipe of zinc acetate precursor solution was investigated. It is found that the substrate temperature during zinc precursor ink depositing has significant effects on ZnO pattern shape, film morphology, and crystallization. The device fabricated from the additive manufacturing approach has good bendability, Ohmic contact, short response time as low as 0.3 s, and high on/off ratio of 3525. We observed the sensor's dependence of response/decay time by the illuminating UV light intensity. The whole process is based on additive manufacturing which has many benefits such as rapid prototyping, saving material, being environmentally friendly, and being capable of creating high-resolution patterns. In addition, this method can be applied to flexible substrates, which makes the device more applicable for applications requiring flexibility such as wearable devices.

Competitive grain growth, relation between heat flows and grain orientation and the effect of laser scanning speed on final micro structure are discussed with details. Grains structure after laser melting is founded to be columnar with a tilt angle toward the direction of the laser movement. Furthermore, this investigation shows that the grain orientation is a function of conduction heat flux at molten pool boundary. Moreover, using the secondary laser heat source (SLHS) as a new approach to control the grain structure during the laser melting is presented. The results proved that the grain structure can be controlled and improved significantly using SLHS. Using SLHS, the grain orientation and uniformity can be change easily.

This means that room temperature magnetoencephalography (MEG), with a greatly increased flexibility of sensor placement can now be considered. Further, these new sensors can be placed directly on the scalp surface giving, theoretically, a large increase in the magnitude of the measured signal. Here, we present recordings made using a single optically-pumped magnetometer (OPM) in combination with a 3D-printed head-cast designed to accurately locate and orient the sensor relative to brain anatomy. Since our OPM is configured as a magnetometer it is highly sensitive to environmental interference. However, we show that this problem can be ameliorated via the use of simultaneous reference sensor recordings. Using median nerve stimulation, we show that the OPM can detect both evoked (phase-locked) and induced (non-phase-locked oscillatory) changes when placed over sensory cortex, with signals ~4 times larger than equivalent SQUID measurements. Using source modelling, we show that our system allows localisation of the evoked response to somatosensory cortex. Further, source-space modelling shows that, with 13 sequential OPM measurements, source-space signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is comparable to that from a 271-channel SQUID system.

{"title": "Reproducible in vitro model for dystrophic calcification of cardiac valvular interstitial cells: insights into the mechanisms of calcific aortic valvular disease.", "abstract": "Calcific aortic valvular disease (CAVD) is the most prevalent valvular pathology in the United States. Development of a pharmacologic agent to slow, halt, or reverse calcification has proven to be unsuccessful as still much remains unknown about the mechanisms of disease initiation. Although in vitro models of some features of CAVD exist, their utility is limited by the inconsistency of the size and time course of the calcified cell aggregates. In this study, we introduce and verify a highly reproducible in vitro method for studying dystrophic calcification of cardiac valvular interstitial cells, considered to be a key mechanism of clinical CAVD. By utilizing micro-contact printing, we were able to consistently reproduce cell aggregation, myofibroblastic markers, programmed cell death, and calcium accumulation within aggregates of 50-400 \u03bcm in diameter on substrates with moduli from 9.6 to 76.8 kPa. This method is highly repeatable, with 70% of aggregates staining positive for Alizarin Red S after one week in culture. Dense mineralized calcium-positive nanoparticles were found within the valvular interstitial cell aggregates as shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The area of micro-contact printed aggregates staining positive for caspase 3/7 activity increased from 5.9 \u00b1 0.9% to 12.6 \u00b1 4.5% over one week in culture. Z-VAD-FMK reduced aggregates staining positive for Alizarin Red S by 60%. The state of cell stress is hypothesized to play a role in the disease progression; traction force microscopy indicates high substrate stresses along the aggregate periphery which can be modulated by altering the size of the aggregates and the modulus of the substrate. Micro-contact printing is advantageous over the currently used in vitro model as it allows the independent study of how cytokines, substrate modulus, and pharmacologic agents affect calcification. This controlled method for aggregate creation has the potential to be used as an in vitro assay for the screening of promising therapeutics to mitigate CAVD.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2017-01-28", "authors": ["Heather ACirka", "JohanaUribe", "VivianLiang", "Frederick JSchoen", "Kristen LBilliar"], "doi": "10.1039/c6lc01226d"}
{"title": "Design and fabrication of a passive droplet dispenser for portable high resolution imaging system.", "abstract": "Moldless lens manufacturing techniques using standard droplet dispensing technology often require precise control over pressure to initiate fluid flow and control droplet formation. We have determined a series of interfacial fluid parameters optimised using standard 3D printed tools to extract, dispense and capture a single silicone droplet that is then cured to obtain high quality lenses. The dispensing process relies on the recapitulation of liquid dripping action (Rayleigh-Plateau instability) and the capturing method uses the interplay of gravitational force, capillary forces and liquid pinning to control the droplet shape. The key advantage of the passive lens fabrication approach is rapid scale-up using 3D printing by avoiding complex dispensing tools. We characterise the quality of the lenses fabricated using the passive approach by measuring wavefront aberration and high resolution imaging. The fabricated lenses are then integrated into a portable imaging system; a wearable thimble imaging device with a detachable camera housing, that is constructed for field imaging. This paper provides the full exposition of steps, from lens fabrication to imaging platform, necessary to construct a standalone high resolution imaging system.

Here, we propose the development of a novel calcium phosphate cement (CPC)-based scaffold combining the properties of mesoporous silica (MS) with recombinant human bone morphogenic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) to facilitate vascularization and osteogenesis. Specifically, the development of a custom MS/CPC paste allowed the three-dimensional (3D) printing of scaffolds with a defined macroporous structure and optimized silicon (Si) ions release profile to promote the ingrowth of vascular tissue at an early stage after implantation in support of tissue viability and osteogenesis. In addition, the scaffold microstructure allowed the prolonged release of rhBMP-2, which in turn significantly stimulated the osteogenesis of human bone marrow stromal cells in vitro and of bone regeneration in vivo as shown in a rabbit femur defect repair model. Thus, the combination MS/CPC/rhBMP-2 scaffolds might provide a solution to issues of tissue necrosis during the regeneration process and therefore might be able to be readily developed into a useful tool for bone repair in the clinic.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-01-28", "authors": ["CuidiLi", "ChuanJiang", "YuanDeng", "TaoLi", "NingLi", "MingzhengPeng", "JinwuWang"], "doi": "10.1038/srep41331"}

Here, we report that Pyrintegrin (Ptn), a 2,4-disubstituted pyrimidine known to promote embryonic stem cells survival, is robustly adipogenic and induces postnatal adipose tissue formation in vivo of transplanted adipose stem/progenitor cells (ASCs) and recruited endogenous cells. In vitro, Ptn stimulated human adipose tissue derived ASCs to differentiate into lipid-laden adipocytes by upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR\u03b3) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1), with differentiated cells increasingly secreting adiponectin, leptin, glycerol and total triglycerides. Ptn-primed human ASCs seeded in 3D-bioprinted biomaterial scaffolds yielded newly formed adipose tissue that expressed human PPAR\u03b3, when transplanted into the dorsum of athymic mice. Remarkably, Ptn-adsorbed 3D scaffolds implanted in the inguinal fat pad had enhanced adipose tissue formation, suggesting Ptn's ability to induce in situ adipogenesis of endogenous cells. Ptn promoted adipogenesis by upregulating PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 not only in adipogenesis induction medium, but also in chemically defined medium specifically for osteogenesis, and concurrently attenuated Runx2 and Osx via BMP-mediated SMAD1/5 phosphorylation.

The ability to create complex tissues is becoming increasingly relevant in the tissue engineering community. For bone tissue engineering applications, this work demonstrates the ability to use extrusion-based printing techniques to control the spatial deposition of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles in a 3D composite scaffold. In doing so, we combined the benefits of synthetic, degradable polymers, such as poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF), with osteoconductive HA nanoparticles that provide robust compressive mechanical properties. Furthermore, the final 3D printed scaffolds consisted of well-defined layers with interconnected pores, two critical features for a successful bone implant. To demonstrate a controlled gradient of HA, thermogravimetric analysis was carried out to quantify HA on a per-layer basis. Moreover, we non-destructively evaluated the tendency of HA particles to aggregate within PPF using micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT).

{"title": "Collagen/heparin sulfate scaffolds fabricated by a 3D bioprinter improved mechanical properties and neurological function after spinal cord injury in rats.", "abstract": "Effective treatments promoting axonal regeneration and functional recovery for spinal cord injury (SCI) are still in the early stages of development. Most approaches have been focused on providing supportive substrates for guiding neurons and overcoming the physical and chemical barriers to healing that arise after SCI. Although collagen has become a promising natural substrate with good compatibility, its low mechanical properties restrict its potential applications. The mechanical properties mainly rely on the composition and pore structure of scaffolds. For the composition of a scaffold, we used heparin sulfate to react with collagen by crosslinking. For the structure, we adopted a three-dimensional (3D) printing technology to fabricate a scaffold with a uniform pore distributions. We observed that the internal structure of the scaffold printed with a 3D bioprinter was regular and porous. We also found that both the compression modulus and strengths of the scaffold were significantly enhanced by the collagen/heparin sulfate composition compared to a collagen scaffold. Meanwhile, the collagen/heparin sulfate scaffold presented good biocompatibility when it was co-cultured with neural stem cells in vitro. We also demonstrated that heparin sulfate modification significantly improved bFGF immobilization and absorption to the collagen by examining the release kinetics of bFGF from scaffolds. Two months after implantating the scaffold into transection lesions in T10 of the spinal cord in rats, the collagen/heparin sulfate group demonstrated significant recovery of locomotor function and according to electrophysiological examinations. Parallel to functional recovery, collagen/heparin sulfate treatment further ameliorated the pathological process and markedly increased the number of neurofilament (NF) positive cells compared to collagen treatment alone. These data suggested that a collagen/heparin sulfate scaffold fabricated by a 3D bioprinter could enhance the mechanical properties of collagen and provide continuous guidance channels for axons, which would improve the neurological function after SCI. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Intrinsic dependencies of CT radiomic features on voxel size and number of gray levels.", "abstract": "Many radiomics features were originally developed for non-medical imaging applications and therefore original assumptions may need to be reexamined. In this study, we investigated the impact of slice thickness and pixel spacing (or pixel size) on radiomics features extracted from Computed Tomography (CT) phantom images acquired with different scanners as well as different acquisition and reconstruction parameters. The dependence of CT texture features on gray-level discretization was also evaluated.\nA texture phantom composed of 10 different cartridges of different materials was scanned on eight different CT scanners from three different manufacturers. The images were reconstructed for various slice thicknesses. For each slice thickness, the reconstruction Field Of View (FOV) was varied to render pixel sizes ranging from 0.39 to 0.98\u00a0mm. A fixed spherical region of interest (ROI) was contoured on the images of the shredded rubber cartridge and the 3D printed, 20% fill, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic cartridge (ABS20) for all phantom imaging sets. Radiomic features were extracted from the ROIs using an in-house program. Features categories were: shape (10), intensity (16), GLCM (24), GLZSM (11), GLRLM (11), and NGTDM (5), fractal dimensions (8) and first-order wavelets (128), for a total of 213 features. Voxel-size resampling was performed to investigate the usefulness of extracting features using a suitably chosen voxel size. Acquired phantom image sets were resampled to a voxel size of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 mm\nOut of the 213 features extracted, 150 were reproducible across voxel sizes, 42 improved significantly (%COV <30, Group 2) after resampling, and 21 had large variations before and after resampling (Group 1). Ten features improved significantly after definition modification effectively removed their voxel-size dependency. Interscanner comparison indicated that feature variability among scanners nearly vanished for 8 of these 10 features. Furthermore, 17 out of 51 texture features were found to be dependent on the number of gray levels. These features were redefined to include the number of gray levels which greatly reduced this dependency.\nVoxel-size resampling is an appropriate pre-processing step for image datasets acquired with variable voxel sizes to obtain more reproducible CT features. We found that some of the radiomics features were voxel size and gray-level discretization-dependent. The introduction of normalizing factors in their definitions greatly reduced or removed these dependencies.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2017-01-24", "authors": ["MuhammadShafiq-Ul-Hassan", "Geoffrey GZhang", "KujtimLatifi", "GhanimUllah", "Dylan CHunt", "YoganandBalagurunathan", "Mahmoud AbrahemAbdalah", "Matthew BSchabath", "Dmitry GGoldgof", "DennisMackin", "Laurence EdwardCourt", "Robert JamesGillies", "Eduardo GerardoMoros"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.12123"}

We prepared a 3D-printed immobilization device (3DID) consisting of a mask and headrest with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resin developed from the computed tomography data obtained by imaging a HN phantom. For comparison, a CID comprising a thermoplastic mask and headrest was prepared using the same HN phantom. We measured the setup error using the ExacTrac X-ray image system. Furthermore, using the ionization chamber and the water-equivalent phantom, we measured the changes in the dose due to the difference in the immobilization device material from the photon of 4 MV and 6 MV. The positional accuracy of the two devices were almost similar in each direction except in the vertical, lateral, and pitch directions (t-test, p<0.0001), and the maximum difference was 1 mm, and 1\u00b0. The standard deviations were not statistically different in each direction except in the longitudinal (F-test, p=0.034) and roll directions (F-test, p<0.0001). When the thickness was the same, the dose difference was almost similar at a 50 mm depth. At a 1 mm depth, the 3DID-plate had a 2.9-4.2% lower dose than the CID-plate.

The brain models were created using 3D printers via a casting technique. The artery models were made by 3D printing and a lost-wax technique. Four residents and 2 junior neurosurgeons attended the training courses.

A senior neurosurgeon then assessed the trainee's technical skill and explained how to improve his/her performance for the procedure using a video of the actual surgery. Subsequently, the trainee attempted the clipping simulation again, using the same model. After the course, the senior neurosurgeon assessed each trainee's technical skill. The trainee critiqued the usefulness of the model and the effectiveness of the training course.\nTrainees succeeded in performing the simulation in line with an actual surgery.

Images were converted to a 3D surface mesh file for fabrication using a multi-jet 3D printer. A novel construction technique was employed to approximate normal renal tissue texture, printers selectively deposited photopolymer material forming the outer shell of the kidney, and subsequently, an agarose gel solution was injected into the inner cavity recreating the spongier renal parenchyma. We constructed seven models of renal units with suspected malignancies. Partial nephrectomy and renorrhaphy were performed on each of the replicas. Subsequently all patients successfully underwent robotic partial nephrectomy. Average tumor diameter was 4.4\u00a0cm, warm ischemia time was 25\u00a0min, RENAL nephrometry score was 7.4, and surgical margins were negative.

There have been few reports on the use of 3D printing for implants designed to be used in complex spinal surgery. METHODS The authors report 2 cases in which 3D printing was used for surgical planning as a preoperative mold, and for a custom-designed titanium prosthesis: one patient with a C-1/C-2 chordoma who underwent tumor resection and vertebral reconstruction, and another patient with a custom-designed titanium anterior fusion cage for an unusual congenital spinal deformity. RESULTS In both presented cases, the custom-designed and custom-built implants were easily slotted into position, which facilitated the surgery and shortened the procedure time, avoiding further complex reconstruction such as harvesting rib or fibular grafts and fashioning these grafts intraoperatively to fit the defect. Radiological follow-up for both cases demonstrated successful fusion at 9 and 12 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS These cases demonstrate the feasibility of the use of 3D modeling and printing to develop personalized prostheses and can ease the difficulty of complex spinal surgery.

{"title": "Traditional Invasive and Synchrotron-Based Noninvasive Assessments of Three-Dimensional-Printed Hybrid Cartilage Constructs In Situ.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D)-printed constructs made of polycaprolactone and chondrocyte-impregnated alginate hydrogel (hybrid cartilage constructs) can mimic the biphasic nature of articular cartilage, thus offering promise for cartilage tissue engineering applications. Notably, the regulatory pathway for medical device development requires validation of such constructs through in vitro bench tests and in vivo preclinical examinations for premarket approval. For this, noninvasive imaging techniques are required for effective evaluation of the progress of these cartilage constructs, especially when implanted in animal models or human subjects. However, characterization of the individual components of the hybrid cartilage constructs and their associated time-dependent structural changes by currently available noninvasive techniques is challenging as these constructs contain a combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic biomaterials with different refractive indices. In this study, we report the use of a novel synchrotron radiation inline phase contrast imaging computed tomography (SR-inline-PCI-CT) approach for noninvasive (in situ) characterization of 3D-printed hybrid cartilage constructs that has been implanted subcutaneously in mice over a 21-day period. In parallel, traditional invasive assays were used to evaluate the in vivo performance of the implanted hybrid cartilage constructs with respect to their cell viability and secretion of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix over the 21-day period postimplantation in mice. SR-inline-PCI-CT allowed striking visualization of the individual components within the 3D-printed hybrid cartilage constructs, as well as characterization of the time-dependent structural changes after implantation. In addition, the relationship between the implanted constructs and the surrounding tissues was delineated. Furthermore, traditional assays showed that cell viability within the cartilage constructs was at least 70% at all three time points, and secretion of alcian blue- and collagen type 2-positive matrices increased progressively over the 21-day period postimplantation. Overall, these results demonstrate that the 3D-printed hybrid cartilage constructs have good in vivo performance and validate their potential for regeneration of articular cartilage in vivo. In addition, SR-inline-PCI-CT has demonstrated potential for longitudinal and noninvasive monitoring of the functionality of 3D-printed hybrid cartilage constructs in a way that is translatable to other soft tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

This was achieved using a bespoke three-dimensional (3D) inkjet-printing machine, JETx, capable of printing a range of materials and utilizing different post processing procedures to print multilayered 3D structures in a single manufacturing step. Multiple layers of silver were printed from an ink containing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and infrared sintered using a swathe-by-swathe (SS) and layer-by-layer sintering (LS) regime. The differences in the heat profile for the SS and LS was observed to influence the coalescence of the AgNPs. Void percentage of both SS and LS samples was higher toward the top layer than the bottom layer due to relatively less IR exposure in the top than the bottom. The results depicted a homogeneous microstructure for LS of AgNPs and showed less deformation compared to the SS. Electrical resistivity of the LS tracks (13.6 \u00b1 1 \u03bc\u03a9 cm) was lower than the SS tracks (22.5 \u00b1 1 \u03bc\u03a9 cm). This study recommends the use of LS method to sinter the AgNPs to obtain a conductive track in 25% less time than SS method for MFAM.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-01-18", "authors": ["JayasheelanVaithilingam", "MarcoSimonelli", "EhabSaleh", "NicolaSenin", "Ricky DWildman", "Richard J MHague", "Richard KLeach", "Christopher JTuck"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b14787"}

This allowed for the metal valve extracted from a temporary tissue expander to be suspended during irradiation, and removed during optical-CT scanning.\nThe removal of the metal implant and subsequent backfilling of the remaining cavity with optically matched fluid prior to dose evaluation enables accurate optical-CT scanning of the gel dosimeters. Results have shown very good agreement between measured and calculated doses within 2\u00a0mm from the surface of the implant.

Here, we show that when arrested phase separation is coupled to the time scales involved in three-dimensional (3D) printing processes, hydrogels with multiple length scales spanning nanometers to millimeters can be printed with high fidelity. We use an oil-in-water nanoemulsion-based ink with rheological and photoreactive properties that satisfy the requirements of stereolithographic 3D printing. This ink is thermoresponsive and consists of poly(dimethyl siloxane) droplets suspended in an aqueous phase containing the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate and the cross-linker poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate. Control of the hydrogel microstructure can be achieved in the printing process due to the rapid structural recovery of the nanoemulsions after large strain-rate yielding, as well as the shear thinning behavior that allows the ink to conform to the build platform of the printer. Wiper operations are used to ensure even spreading of the yield stress ink on the optical window between successive print steps. Post-processing of the printed samples is used to generate mesoporous hydrogels that serve as size-selective membranes.

A recent, image-based study found that these surfaces can be approximated by a saddle-shaped, skewed, truncated cone with its apex oriented laterally. The goal of this study was to establish a reliable experimental technique to study the relationship between the geometry of the articular surfaces of the ankle and its mobility and stability characteristics and to use this technique to determine if morphological approximations of the ankle surfaces based on recent discoveries, produce close to normal behavior. The study was performed on ten cadavers. For each specimen, a process based on medical imaging, modeling and 3D printing was used to produce two subject specific artificial implantable sets of the ankle surfaces. One set was a replica of the natural surfaces. The second approximated the ankle surfaces as an original saddle-shaped truncated cone with apex oriented laterally. Testing under cyclic loading conditions was then performed on each specimen following a previously established technique to determine its mobility and stability characteristics under three different conditions: natural surfaces; artificial surfaces replicating the natural surface morphology; and artificial approximation based on the saddle-shaped truncated cone concept. A repeated measure analysis of variance was then used to compare between the three conditions. The results show that (1): the artificial surfaces replicating natural morphology produce close to natural mobility and stability behavior thus establishing the reliability of the technique; and (2): the approximated surfaces based on saddle-shaped truncated cone concept produce mobility and stability behavior close to the ankle with natural surfaces.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2017-01-18", "authors": ["ClaudioBelvedere", "SorinSiegler", "AndreaEnsini", "JasonToy", "PaoloCaravaggi", "RamyaNamani", "GiuliaGiannini", "StefanoDurante", "AlbertoLeardini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2017.01.002"}

However, few studies have reported the fabrication of large-volume cell-printed constructs (LCCs). To create LCCs, appropriate fabrication conditions should be established: Factors involved include fabrication time, residence time, and temperature control of the cell-laden hydrogel in the syringe to ensure high cell viability and functionality. The prolonged time required for 3D printing of LCCs can reduce cell viability and result in insufficient functionality of the construct, because the cells are exposed to a harsh environment during the printing process. In this regard, we present an advanced 3D cell-printing system composed of a clean air workstation, a humidifier, and a Peltier system, which provides a suitable printing environment for the production of LCCs with high cell viability. We confirmed that the advanced 3D cell-printing system was capable of providing enhanced printability of hydrogels and fabricating an ear-shaped LCC with high cell viability. In vivo results for the ear-shaped LCC also showed that printed chondrocytes proliferated sufficiently and differentiated into cartilage tissue.

In this emerging application, bioink is crucial for fabrication and functionality of constructed tissue. The use of cell spheroids as bioink can enhance the cell-cell interaction and subsequently the growth and differentiation of cells in the 3D printed construct with the minimum amount of other biomaterials. However, the conventional methods of preparing the cell spheroids have several limitations, such as long culture time, low-throughput, and medium modification. In this study, the formation of cell spheroids by SSAW was evaluated both numerically and experimentally in order to overcome the aforementioned limitations. The effects of excitation frequencies on the cell accumulation time, diameter of the formed cell spheroids, and subsequently, the growth and viability of cell spheroids in the culture medium over time were studied. Using the high-frequency (23.8 MHz) excitation, cell accumulation time to the pressure nodes could be reduced in comparison to that of the low-frequency (10.4 MHz) excitation, but in a smaller spheroid size. SSAW excitation at both frequencies does not affect the cell viability up to 7 days, > 90% with no statistical difference compared with the control group.

{"title": "Controlling the 3D architecture of Self-Lifting Auto-generated Tissue Equivalents (SLATEs) for optimized corneal graft composition and stability.", "abstract": "Ideally, biomaterials designed to play specific physical and physiological roles in\u00a0vivo should comprise components and microarchitectures analogous to those of the native tissues they intend to replace. For that, implantable biomaterials need to be carefully designed to have the correct structural and compositional properties, which consequently impart their bio-function. In this study, we showed that the control of such properties can be defined from the bottom-up, using smart surface templates to modulate the structure, composition, and bio-mechanics of human transplantable tissues. Using multi-functional peptide amphiphile-coated surfaces with different anisotropies, we were able to control the phenotype of corneal stromal cells and instruct them to fabricate self-lifting tissues that closely emulated the native stromal lamellae of the human cornea. The type and arrangement of the extracellular matrix comprising these corneal stromal Self-Lifting Analogous Tissue Equivalents (SLATEs) were then evaluated in detail, and was shown to correlate with tissue function. Specifically, SLATEs comprising aligned collagen fibrils were shown to be significantly thicker, denser, and more resistant to proteolytic degradation compared to SLATEs formed with randomly-oriented constituents. In addition, SLATEs were highly transparent while providing increased absorption to near-UV radiation. Importantly, corneal stromal SLATEs were capable of constituting tissues with a higher-order complexity, either by creating thicker tissues through stacking or by serving as substrate to support a fully-differentiated, stratified corneal epithelium. SLATEs were also deemed safe as implants in a rabbit corneal model, being capable of integrating with the surrounding host tissue without provoking inflammation, neo-vascularization, or any other signs of rejection after a 9-months follow-up.

In this work, we demonstrate microscale patterning of antibodies on a glass coverslip in a single step photolithography process. The microscale features of the photoresist were generated on the coverslip using photolithography, and the antibody solution was incubated. Acetone lift-off of the antibody incubated photoresist, and subsequent washing by isopropanol (IPA), produced a micro-array of antibodies. The functionality of patterned primary antibody was confirmed using the corresponding antigen and strict controls. One of the striking features of this method of patterning is that the process steps and chemicals inherently improve the adhesion between the\u00a0antibodies and glass without the need to functionalize the glass surface. We performed an ultrasonication test, detergent washing test, and Scotch\u00a0tape test to show improved adhesion.

Although optoelectrofluidic technology has numerous advantages for programmable and on-demand patterning and the feasibility of manipulating single microparticles, practical applications using existing laboratory infrastructure in biological and clinical research fields have been strictly restricted due to the impossibility of recovering the final patterned product. In order to address these harvesting limitations, PEGDA was employed to utilize optoelectrofluidic printing. The Clausius-Mossotti factor was calculated to investigate the dielectrophoretic mobility of the microparticle and the cell in the PEGDA precursor solution. As a proof of concept, three basic controllabilities of the optoelectrofluidic printing system were characterized: the number of microparticles, the distance between the microparticle columns, and the ratio of two different microparticles. Furthermore, the optoelectrofluidic patterning and printing of human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) were demonstrated in 5 min with a single-cell level of resolution. The appropriate ranges of frequency were experimentally defined based on the calculated result of the dielectrophoretic mobility of HepG2 cells.

Fabricated specimens were scanned using a dental scanner and then compared by overlapping reference data. The results were statistically analyzed using a 1-way analysis of variance (\u03b1=.05). Additionally, the surface morphology of 1 randomly (the first of each specimen) selected specimen from each group was evaluated using a digital microscope.\nThe results of the overlap analysis of the dental restorations indicated that the root mean square (RMS) deviation observed in the restorations fabricated using the additive manufacturing methods were significantly different from those fabricated using the subtractive methods (P<.05). However, no significant differences were found between restorations fabricated using stereolithography apparatus and selective laser sintering, the additive manufacturing methods (P=.466).

The review is structured as introducing the scope of bioprinting in tissue engineering applications, key vascular anatomical features and then a thorough coverage of 3D bioprinting using extrusion-, droplet- and laser-based bioprinting for fabrication of vascular tissue constructs. The review then provides the reader with the use of bioprinting for obtaining thick vascularized tissues using sacrificial bioink materials. Current challenges are discussed, a comparative evaluation of different bioprinting modalities is presented and future prospects are provided to the reader.\nBiofabrication of living tissues and organs at the clinically-relevant volumes vitally depends on the integration of vascular network.

{"title": "Structural and congenital heart disease interventions: the role of three-dimensional printing.", "abstract": "Advances in catheter-based interventions in structural and congenital heart disease have mandated an increased demand for three-dimensional (3D) visualisation of complex cardiac anatomy. Despite progress in 3D imaging modalities, the pre- and periprocedural visualisation of spatial anatomy is relegated to two-dimensional flat screen representations. 3D printing is an evolving technology based on the concept of additive manufacturing, where computerised digital surface renders are converted into physical models. Printed models replicate complex structures in tangible forms that cardiovascular physicians and surgeons can use for education, preprocedural planning and device testing. In this review we discuss the different steps of the 3D printing process, which include image acquisition, segmentation, printing methods and materials. We also examine the expanded applications of 3D printing in the catheter-based treatment of adult patients with structural and congenital heart disease while highlighting the current limitations of this technology in terms of segmentation, model accuracy and dynamic capabilities.

We sought to utilize the rapidly expanding field of 3D technology to create freely available, interactive educational materials for spine procedures. Our secondary goal was to convey lessons learned about 3D modeling and printing. This project involved two parallel processes: the creation of 3D-printed physical models and interactive digital models. We segmented illustrative CT studies of the lumbar and cervical spine to create 3D models and then printed them using a consumer 3D printer and a professional 3D printing service. We also included downloadable versions of the models in an interactive eBook and platform-independent web viewer. We then provided these educational materials to residents with a pretest and posttest to assess efficacy. The \"Spine Procedures in 3D\" eBook has been downloaded 71 times as of October 5, 2016. All models used in the book are available for download and printing. Regarding test results, the mean exam score improved from 70 to 86%, with the most dramatic improvement seen in the least experienced trainees. Participants reported increased confidence in performing lumbar punctures after exposure to the material. We demonstrate the value of 3D models, both digital and printed, in learning spine procedures.

{"title": "Three-Dimension-Printed Porous Poly(Propylene Fumarate) Scaffolds with Delayed rhBMP-2 Release for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Graft Fixation.", "abstract": "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures reconstructed with tendon grafts are commonly fixed with bioabsorbable implants, which are frequently complicated by incomplete bone filling upon degradation. Bone regeneration after ACL reconstruction could be enhanced by utilizing tissue engineering techniques and three-dimensional (3D) printing to create a porous bioabsorbable scaffold with delayed delivery of recombinant-human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2). The first aim of this study was to design a 3D poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) porous scaffold that maintained suitable pullout strength for future testing in a rabbit ACL reconstruction model. Our second aim was to determine the release kinetics of rhBMP-2 from PPF scaffolds that utilized both calcium-phosphate coatings and growth factor delivery on microspheres, both of which have been shown to decrease the initial burst release of rhBMP-2 and increase bone regeneration. To determine the degree of scaffold porosity that maintained suitable pullout strength, tapered scaffolds were fabricated with increasing porosity (0%, 20%, 35%, and 44%) and pullout testing was performed in a cadaveric rabbit ACL reconstruction model. Scaffolds were coated with carbonate hydroxyapatite (synthetic bone mineral [SBM]), and radiolabeled rhBMP-2 was delivered in four different experimental groups as follows: Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres only, microspheres and collagen (50:50), collagen only, and saline solution only. rhBMP-2 release was measured at day 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. The microsphere delivery groups had a smaller burst release and released a smaller percentage of rhBMP-2 over the 32 days than the collagen and saline only groups. In conclusion, a porous bioabsorbable scaffold with suitable strength for a rabbit ACL reconstruction was developed. Combining a synthetic bone mineral coating with microspheres had an additive effect, decreasing the initial burst release and cumulative release of rhBMP-2. Future studies need to evaluate this scaffold's fixation strength and bone filling capabilities in vivo compared to traditional bioabsorbable implants.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The phantom consists of a 48\u2009mm thick breast-shaped polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) container filled with water and PMMA spheres of different diameters. Three-dimensionally (3D) printed spiculated masses (diameter range: 3.8-9.7\u2009mm) and non-spiculated masses (1.6-6.2\u2009mm) along with microcalcifications (90-250 \u00b5m) were inserted as targets. Reproducibility of the phantom application was studied on a single system using 30 acquisitions. Next, the phantom was evaluated on five different combined FFDM & DBT systems and target detection was compared for FFDM and DBT modes. Ten phantom images in both FFDM and DBT modes were acquired on these 5 systems using automatic exposure control. Five readers evaluated target detectability. Images were read with the four-alternative forced-choice (4-AFC) paradigm, with always one segment including a target and 3 normal background segments. The percentage of correct responses (PC) was assessed based on 10 trials of each reader for each object type, size and imaging modality. Additionally, detection threshold diameters at 62.5 PC were assessed via non-linear regression fitting of the psychometric curve. The reproducibility study showed no significant differences in PC values. Evaluation of target detection in FFDM showed that microcalcification detection thresholds ranged between 110 and 118 \u00b5m and were similar compared to the detection in DBT (range of 106-158 \u00b5m). In DBT, detection of both mass types increased significantly (p\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.0001 and p\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090.0002 for non-spiculated and spiculated masses respectively) compared to FFDM, achieving almost 100% detection for all spiculated mass diameters. In conclusion, a structured phantom with inserted targets was able to show evidence for detectability differences between FFDM and DBT modes for five commercial systems.

There is also a risk of systemic side effects with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used for pain relief. Microneedle-assisted transdermal drug delivery offers an attractive alternative for local delivery of NSAIDs. However, traditional microneedle arrays fabricated on flat surfaces are unable to deliver drugs effectively across the undulating skin surface of affected finger(s). In this study, using 3D printing, a dual-function microneedle array has been fabricated on personalized curved surfaces (microneedle splint) for drug delivery and splinting of the affected finger. The novel microneedle splint was assessed for its physical characteristics and the microneedles were shown to withstand up to twice the average thumb force without fracturing. An average skin penetration efficiency of 64% on dermatomed human cadaver skin was achieved and the final microneedle splint showed biocompatibility with human dermal cell lines. A significantly higher amount of diclofenac permeated through the skin by 0.5 h with the use of the microneedle splint as compared to intact skin.

{"title": "3D bioprinting of GelMA scaffolds triggers mineral deposition by primary human osteoblasts.", "abstract": "Due to its relatively low level of antigenicity and high durability, titanium has successfully been used as the major material for biological implants. However, because the typical interface between titanium and tissue precludes adequate transmission of load into the surrounding bone, over time, load-bearing implants tend to loosen and revision surgeries are required. Osseointegration of titanium implants requires presentation of both biological and mechanical cues that promote attachment of and trigger mineral deposition by osteoblasts. While many factors contribute to differentiation, the relative importance of the various cues is unclear. To substantially improve osseointegration of titanium implants, we generated a gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) scaffold, using an extrusion-based 3D bioprinter, which can be directly printed on and grafted to the titanium implant surface. We demonstrate that this scaffold is able to trigger mineral deposition of both MG63 osteoblasts and primary normal human osteoblasts in the absence of any exogenous osteogenic factors. Films of the same formulation failed to promote mineral deposition suggesting that the three dimensional scaffold was able to tip the balance in favor of differentiation despite other potentially unfavorable differentiation cues of the material. We further show that these GelMA lattices can be directly grafted to titanium alloy and are secure in vitro over a period of seven weeks. When grafted within a groove system, the GelMA hydrogel is protected from shearing forces in a marrow implantation model. This prepares the way for osteogenic coatings to be directly manufactured on the implant surface and packaged for surgery.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-01-11", "authors": ["ChristineMcBeth", "JasminLauer", "MichaelOttersbach", "JenniferCampbell", "AndreSharon", "Alexis FSauer-Budge"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa53bd"}

The results showed that friction and wear performance of Ti6Al4V cellular structures is influenced by the structure open-cell size.

{"title": "Particle Accumulation in a Microchannel and Its Reduction by a Standing Surface Acoustic Wave (SSAW).", "abstract": "Accumulation of particles in a high concentration on a microchannel wall is a common phenomenon in a colloidal fluid. Gradual accumulation/deposition of particles can eventually obstruct the fluid flow and lead to clogging, which seriously affects the accuracy and reliability of nozzle-based printing and causes damage to the nozzle. Particle accumulation in a 100 \u03bcm microchannel was investigated by light microscopy, and its area growth in an exponential format was used to quantify this phenomenon. The effects of the constriction angle and alginate concentration on particle accumulation were also studied. In order to reduce the clogging problem, an acoustic method was proposed and evaluated here. Numerical simulation was first conducted to predict the acoustic radiation force on the particles in the fluid with different viscosities. Interdigital transducers (IDTs) were fabricated on the LiNbO\u2083 wafer to produce standing surface acoustic waves (SSAW) in the microchannel.

{"title": "3D bioprinting: improving in vitro models of metastasis with heterogeneous tumor microenvironments.", "abstract": "Even with many advances in treatment over the past decades, cancer still remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Despite the recognized relationship between metastasis and increased mortality rate, surprisingly little is known about the exact mechanism of metastatic progression. Currently available in vitro models cannot replicate the three-dimensionality and heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment sufficiently to recapitulate many of the known characteristics of tumors in vivo Our understanding of metastatic progression would thus be boosted by the development of in vitro models that could more completely capture the salient features of cancer biology. Bioengineering groups have been working for over two decades to create in vitro microenvironments for application in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Over this time, advances in 3D printing technology and biomaterials research have jointly led to the creation of 3D bioprinting, which has improved our ability to develop in vitro models with complexity approaching that of the in vivo tumor microenvironment. In this Review, we give an overview of 3D bioprinting methods developed for tissue engineering, which can be directly applied to constructing in vitro models of heterogeneous tumor microenvironments. We discuss considerations and limitations associated with 3D printing and highlight how these advances could be harnessed to better model metastasis and potentially guide the development of anti-cancer strategies.", "journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "date": "2017-01-10", "authors": ["Jacob LAlbritton", "Jordan SMiller"], "doi": "10.1242/dmm.025049\n10.1038/424870a\n10.1038/nmeth873\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.12.005\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(19980315)39:4<539::AID-JBM6>3.0.CO;2-K\n10.1039/C4LC00030G\n10.1126/sciadv.1500655\n10.1038/nm.2328\n10.1038/35094059\n10.1084/jem.115.3.453\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.124\n10.1098/rsta.2010.0002\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0591\n10.1038/35025220\n10.1126/science.1203543\n10.1038/nrc865\n10.1038/ncomms7365\n10.1063/1.2191569\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.007\n10.1038/nature01322\n10.1126/science.1232227\n10.1038/nchem.1174\n10.1002/anie.201106463\n10.1021/cm101391y\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.09.021\n10.1039/b807560c\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0168\n10.1038/309552a0\n10.1016/j.gde.2004.12.001\n10.1039/C5TB01468A\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1053/sonc.2002.37263\n10.1038/nrc1075\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.01.010\n10.1126/science.277.5323.225\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2013.09.029\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-0895\n10.1038/nature10762\n10.1038/nrm1858\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.025\n10.1002/adma.201501729\n10.1242/dmm.015974\n10.1089/ten.tec.2010.0359\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.055\n10.1002/adma.201203261\n10.1021/mp400573g\n10.1016/j.copbio.2013.03.009\n10.1016/j.tcb.2015.06.003\n10.1016/j.ccr.2012.02.022\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00343-0\n10.1126/sciadv.1500758\n10.1039/C3LC50634G\n10.1038/nmat2238\n10.1038/nmat2619\n10.1126/science.1176009\n10.1172/JCI23424\n10.1200/JCO.2012.46.3653\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.02.035\n10.1038/nrc1877\n10.1038/nbt.3413\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-12-0307\n10.1039/c0ib00055h\n10.1371/journal.pone.0147399\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2005.05.004\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.06.007\n10.1002/adma.201305506\n10.1073/pnas.0603247103\n10.1155/2014/149185\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.10.027\n10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70130-X\n10.1002/anie.201411383\n10.1038/nmat3361\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.06.009\n10.1038/nprot.2016.037\n10.1038/nmat1092\n10.1038/nbt1055\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65628-3\n10.1242/jcs.01000\n10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00196-4\n10.1038/nature17038\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.04.050\n10.1038/nrc2013\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1001882\n10.1002/bit.20809\n10.1038/nmat3357\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.012\n10.1039/C4BM00262H\n10.1038/nrm3902\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1002/bit.25494\n10.1126/science.959840\n10.4161/cc.5.15.3112\n10.1088/1758-5082/2/1/014104\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.01.027\n10.1152/ajpcell.00389.2001\n10.1016/j.ccr.2005.08.010\n10.1038/ncomms4935\n10.1016/B978-0-12-800972-7.00007-4\n10.1073/pnas.89.19.9064\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1073/pnas.1103581108\n10.1186/1741-7015-6-11\n10.1038/nm.3394\n10.1529/biophysj.104.050682\n10.1038/nm.1941\n10.1016/j.bpj.2014.10.035\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2007.01.006\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.10.026\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.12.1.697\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1706\n10.1089/ten.teb.2015.0464\n10.1039/c3bm60274e\n10.1088/0960-1317/22/8/085014\n10.1088/1468-6996/16/3/033502\n10.3322/caac.21254\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.05.003\n10.1089/ten.tec.2015.0239\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2003.10.006\n10.1038/nmat4544\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.10.005\n10.1002/bit.22361\n10.3322/caac.21262\n10.1002/jbm.a.34587\n10.1152/physrev.00041.2008\n10.1038/nrm3620\n10.1083/jcb.137.1.231\n10.1002/adma.201004625\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1449\n10.1146/annurev.matsci.28.1.153\n10.1039/C5CS00278H\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.006\n10.1016/j.ceb.2005.08.002\n10.1039/b909900j\n10.1016/j.tcb.2010.08.015\n10.1073/pnas.0604460103\n10.1016/S0142-9612(01)00232-0\n10.1073/pnas.1210182109\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.02.044"}

{"title": "Macroporous Hydrogel Scaffolds for Three-Dimensional Cell Culture and Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Hydrogels have been promising candidate scaffolds for cell delivery and tissue engineering due to their tissue-like physical properties and capability for homogeneous cell loading. However, the encapsulated cells are generally entrapped and constrained in the submicron- or nanosized gel networks, seriously limiting cell growth and tissue formation. Meanwhile, the spatially confined settlement inhibits attachment and spreading of anchorage-dependent cells, leading to their apoptosis. In recent years, macroporous hydrogels have attracted increasing attention in use as cell delivery vehicles and tissue engineering scaffolds. The introduction of macropores within gel scaffolds not only improves their permeability for better nutrient transport but also creates space/interface for cell adhesion, proliferation, and extracellular matrix deposition. Herein, we will first review the development of macroporous gel scaffolds and outline the impact of macropores on cell behaviors. In the first part, the advantages and challenges of hydrogels as three-dimensional (3D) cell culture scaffolds will be described. In the second part, the fabrication of various macroporous hydrogels will be presented. Third, the enhancement of cell activities within macroporous gel scaffolds will be discussed.

Current implantable graft monitoring sensors require graft modification and direct bloodstream contact. We propose a new class of piezoresistive flexible pulsation sensors which can be wrapped around the graft to measure wall movement. These sensors must be highly flexible to prevent graft constriction; typical strain sensors are too rigid and the strain sensing range is too limited for this application. We describe a novel additive manufacturing (AM) method for printing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with an internal porous structure, such that material compliance may be tuned anisotropically for a given sensor geometry.

A 3D post-contrast fat-suppressed gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence was used to generate 3D printed models. The cases were evaluated by three experienced urologic oncology surgeons in a randomized fashion using (1) imaging data on PACS alone and (2) 3D printed model in addition to the imaging data. A questionnaire regarding surgical approach and planning was administered. The presumed pre-operative approaches with and without the model were compared. Any change between the presumed approaches and the actual surgical intervention was recorded.\nThere was a change in planned approach with the 3D printed model for all ten cases with the largest impact seen regarding decisions on transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach and clamping, with changes seen in 30%-50% of cases.

Laparoscopic approach is beneficial to these patients because of its minimally invasive approach. However, these operations are both difficult and require plenty of experience and extended training. Some stages of the operation are limited by permissible time of transient ischemia. We applied three-dimensional (3D) printing technology to create individual silicone models of kidney to be used for training in laparoscopic procedures before the actual surgeries.\nThree patients who qualified for laparoscopic partial nephrectomy were selected. Digital models of their kidneys with tumors were designed based on computed tomography scans, followed by creation of silicone models. These were cast into the forms printed in 3D. The proper surgery was preceded by an operation carried out in a silicone model of laparoscopic simulator in which the tumor was excised and lodged after tumorectomy was filled.\nAverage time of the live kidney tumor operation was slightly shorter than that of the silicone model (16 versus 17 minutes). Relatively short period of ischemia did not exceed 9 minutes. One patient underwent surgery without closing the vascular pedicle.\nExperience gained during training with these silicone models improved the actual surgery and can reduce the need for/duration of intraoperative renal ischemia. We believe this training method can be successfully used in other procedures.", "journal": "Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

{"title": "Separation control over a grooved surface inspired by dolphin skin.", "abstract": "Over many decades the biological surfaces of aquatic swimmers have been studied for their potential as drag reducing surfaces. The hydrodynamic benefit of riblets, or grooves embedded parallel to the flow which appear on surfaces such as shark skin, have been well documented. However the skin of dolphins is embedded with sinusoidal grooves that run perpendicular or transverse to the flow over their bodies. It is theorized that the transverse grooves present on dolphin skin trap vortices between them, creating a partial slip condition over the surface and inducing turbulence augmentation in the boundary layer, thus acting as a potential mechanism to reduce flow separation and thus pressure drag. In an attempt to test this hypothesis and study these effects, an adverse pressure gradient was induced above a flat plate resulting in a controlled region of flow separation occurring within a tripped, turbulent boundary layer. Small transverse grooves of both rectangular and sinusoidal shape were 3D printed and mounted to the plate to measure their effect on the boundary layer flow. The results were compared to a flat plate without grooves using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The strength of the adverse pressure gradient was varied, and the observed control in flow separation and other effects upon the boundary layer are discussed.", "journal": "Bioinspiration & biomimetics", "date": "2017-01-07", "authors": ["Amy WLang", "Emily MJones", "FarhanaAfroz"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-3190/aa5770"}

An acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) plastic mold for polymer casting was made through additive manufacturing. Stereolithography was used for fabrication of the mechanism that controlled pore size of the polymeric auxetic film. A laminate arrangement of the film and the mechanism was devised, through which movement of the mechanism controlled stretching of the auxetic film underneath.\nResults were analyzed through image processing. It was observed that a 2-dimensional increase (in length and width) of the auxetic film took place that corresponded to an increase in pore size of the film. Several mathematical correlations were drawn up.\nIt may be concluded that the first factor controlling drug release kinetics is the pore size of the film.

Selecting the von Mises stress as the criterion for discriminating regions for elastic modulus difference, a stiffness minimization method was employed by varying the elastic modulus distribution in custom implant stem. The stiffness minimization problem is formulated as material distribution problem without explicitly penalizing partial volume elements.

Comparisons were made at an urban pediatric otolaryngology practice among patients who had previously undergone pediatric craniofacial reconstruction with use of a commercially produced medical model for surgical planning. Each vendor model had been produced using computed tomographic imaging data. With the use of this same data source, in-house models were printed in polylactic acid using a commercially available printer. Data were collected from November 1 to December 30, 2015.\nModels created from these 2 methods of production were assessed for fidelity of surface anatomy, resilience to manipulation and plate bending, cost of production, speed of production, sterilizability, virtual surgical planning options, and alveolar nerve canal and tooth root visibility in mandibles.\nFor the quantitative comparisons between in-house models (1 neonatal, 1 pediatric, and 1 adult model) and their commercial counterparts, the mean value of 7 independent measurements was analyzed from each of 3 model pairs. Caliper measurements from models produced through entry-level, in-house manufacturing were comparable to those taken from commercially produced counterparts, suggesting an acceptable degree of accuracy (0.54 mm; 95% CI, 0.36-0.72 mm). Fixed costs for in-house production included acquiring an entry-level printer (retail $2899) and an annual software subscription ($699 per year). After purchase of these initial assets, the printing cost for an in-house mandible was approximately $90, with 98% of that cost related to labor. Physical qualities of entry-level, in-house models such as nerve canal visibility, tooth root visibility, and sterilizability were inferior compared with commercially-produced stereolithic renderings.\nThis low-cost method of in-house, entry-level 3-D printing of straightforward, skeletal models may suit a general otolaryngology practice that performs maxillofacial reconstruction. Although commercial modeling offers several unique features, such as sterilizable materials and advanced virtual planning, in-house modeling also produces renderings with high fidelity, which may be used as tools for education and surgical planning, including preoperative plate bending.\n4.", "journal": "JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery", "date": "2017-01-06", "authors": ["Alex TLegocki", "AndrewDuffy-Peter", "Andrew RScott"], "doi": "10.1001/jamaoto.2016.3673"}
{"title": "A Novel Two-Compartment Model for Calculating Bone Volume Fractions and Bone Mineral Densities From Computed Tomography Images.", "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by a degradation of bone structures. Various methods have been developed to diagnose osteoporosis by measuring bone mineral density (BMD) of patients. However, BMDs from these methods were not equivalent and were incomparable. In addition, partial volume effect introduces errors in estimating bone volume from computed tomography (CT) images using image segmentation. In this study, a two-compartment model (TCM) was proposed to calculate bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and BMD from CT images. The TCM considers bones to be composed of two sub-materials. Various equivalent BV/TV and BMD can be calculated by applying corresponding sub-material pairs in the TCM. In contrast to image segmentation, the TCM prevented the influence of the partial volume effect by calculating the volume percentage of sub-material in each image voxel. Validations of the TCM were performed using bone-equivalent uniform phantoms, a 3D-printed trabecular-structural phantom, a temporal bone flap, and abdominal CT images. By using the TCM, the calculated BV/TVs of the uniform phantoms were within percent errors of \u00b12%; the percent errors of the structural volumes with various CT slice thickness were below 9%; the volume of the temporal bone flap was close to that from micro-CT images with a percent error of 4.1%.

{"title": "Additive Manufacturing of Metal Structures at the Micrometer Scale.", "abstract": "Currently, the focus of additive manufacturing (AM) is shifting from simple prototyping to actual production. One driving factor of this process is the ability of AM to build geometries that are not accessible by subtractive fabrication techniques. While these techniques often call for a geometry that is easiest to manufacture, AM enables the geometry required for best performance to be built by freeing the design process from restrictions imposed by traditional machining. At the micrometer scale, the design limitations of standard fabrication techniques are even more severe. Microscale AM thus holds great potential, as confirmed by the rapid success of commercial micro-stereolithography tools as an enabling technology for a broad range of scientific applications. For metals, however, there is still no established AM solution at small scales. To tackle the limited resolution of standard metal AM methods (a few tens of micrometers at best), various new techniques aimed at the micrometer scale and below are presently under development. Here, we review these recent efforts. Specifically, we feature the techniques of direct ink writing, electrohydrodynamic printing, laser-assisted electrophoretic deposition, laser-induced forward transfer, local electroplating methods, laser-induced photoreduction and focused electron or ion beam induced deposition. Although these methods have proven to facilitate the AM of metals with feature sizes in the range of 0.1-10 \u00b5m, they are still in a prototype stage and their potential is not fully explored yet.

This paper presents a candidate laminated open-cell framework, which is an anisotropic material that shows remarkable mechanical performance. Using additive manufacturing, artificial frameworks are fabricated by lamination of in-plane orthotropic microstructures made of elbowed beam and column members; this fabricated structure features orthogonal anisotropy in three-dimensional space. Uniaxial loading tests reveal strong auxeticity (high negative Poisson's ratios) in the out-of-plane direction, which is retained reproducibly up to the nonlinear elastic region, and is equal under tensile and compressive loading. Finite element simulations support the observed auxetic behaviors for a unit cell in the periodic framework, which preserve the theoretical elastic properties of an orthogonal solid. These findings open the possibility of conceptual materials design based on geometry.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-01-05", "authors": ["HiroTanaka", "KaitoSuga", "NaokiIwata", "YojiShibutani"], "doi": "10.1038/srep39816\n10.1038/srep00035\n10.1038/srep08395\n10.1038/srep18306\n10.1038/srep18373"}

Its efficacy was tested on two children with facial burns resulting hypertrophic scars.\nThis study adopted a longitudinal case follow up research design. Two children with facial burns were recruited in the study upon consent.

The transparent facemask was directly printed out on the transparent biocompatible material followed by adding the medical grade silicone gel to provide extra pressure on the scar site. The facemasks were fitted to the patients with elastic straps connecting the printed anchoring bolts. Both children and family were instructed to wear the facemask for at least 20h per day and they were assessed before treatment, one month and three months after treatment on the facial scar conditions.\nAt the one-month and three-month assessments after treatment, a decrease in average scar thickness was shown and the facial appearance was satisfactory.

Despite significant advances in recent decades, traditional rigid exoskeletons are constrained by limited portability, safety, ergonomics, autonomy and, most of all, cost. In this study, we present the design and control of a soft, textile-based exosuit for assisting elbow flexion/extension and hand open/close. We describe a model-based design, characterisation and testing of two independent actuator modules for the elbow and hand, respectively. Both actuators drive a set of artificial tendons, routed through the exosuit along specific load paths, that apply torques to the human joints by means of anchor points. Key features in our design are under-actuation and the use of electromagnetic clutches to unload the motors during static posture. These two aspects, along with the use of 3D printed components and off-the-shelf fabric materials, contribute to cut down the power requirements, mass and overall cost of the system, making it a more likely candidate for daily use and enlarging its target population. Low-level control is accomplished by a computationally efficient machine learning algorithm that derives the system's model from sensory data, ensuring high tracking accuracy despite the uncertainties deriving from its soft architecture.

An acrylic denture apparatus (Kilgore Typodent, Kilgore International, Coldwater, MI) was set in a 20\u00a0cm water phantom and scanned on a single-source CT scanner with gantry tilting capacity (SOMATOM Edge, Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany) under 5 scenerios: (1) Baseline acquisition at 120\u00a0kV with no gantry tilt, no jaw spacer, (2) acquisition at 140\u00a0kV, (3) acquisition with a gantry tilt at 15\u00b0, (4) acquisition with a non-radiopaque jaw spacer and (5) acquisition with a jaw spacer and a gantry tilt at 15\u00b0. All acquisitions were reconstructed both with and without a dedicated iterative metal artifact reduction algorithm (MAR). Patients referred for a head-and-neck exam were included into the study. Acquisitions were performed on the same scanner with 120\u00a0kV and the images were reconstructed with and without iterative MAR. Segmentation was performed on a dedicated workstation (Materialise Interactive Medical Image Control Systems; Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium) to quantify volume of metal artifact and segmentation time.\nIn the phantom study, the use of gantry tilt, jaw spacer and increased tube voltage showed no benefit in time or artifact volume reduction. However the jaw spacer allowed easier separation of the upper and lower jaw and a better display of the teeth. The use of dedicated iterative MAR significantly reduced the metal artifact volume and processing time. Same observations were made for the four patients included into the study.\nThe use of dedicated iterative MAR and jaw spacer substantially reduced metal artifacts in the head-and-neck CT acquisitions, hence allowing a faster 3D segmentation workflow.", "journal": "3D printing in medicine", "date": "2017-01-01", "authors": ["Roy PMarcus", "Jonathan MMorris", "Jane MMatsumoto", "Amy EAlexander", "Ahmed FHalaweish", "James AKelly", "Joel GFletcher", "Cynthia HMcCollough", "ShuaiLeng"], "doi": "10.1186/s41205-017-0013-4\n10.1016/j.jacr.2016.03.025\n10.1148/rg.2015140320\n10.1002/ase.1573\n10.1001/jama.2014.9542\n10.1067/j.cpradiol.2015.07.009\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3010825\n10.1056/NEJMc1206319\n10.1117/1.JMI.3.3.033501\n10.1148/rg.2015140260\n10.1148/rg.273065087\n10.1259/dmfr.20120105\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000191\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2011.07.009\n10.3174/ajnr.A4416\n10.1007/s00330-011-2062-1\n10.1097/01.rli.0000086495.96457.54\n10.1097/RLI.0b013e31824c86a3\n10.1016/S0266435602002498\n10.1007/s00256-014-1987-2"}
{"title": "Medical 3D printing: methods to standardize terminology and report trends.", "abstract": "Medical 3D printing is expanding exponentially, with tremendous potential yet to be realized in nearly all facets of medicine. Unfortunately, multiple informal subdomain-specific isolated terminological 'silos' where disparate terminology is used for similar concepts are also arising as rapidly. It is imperative to formalize the foundational terminology at this early stage to facilitate future knowledge integration, collaborative research, and appropriate reimbursement. The purpose of this work is to develop objective, literature-based consensus-building methodology for the medical 3D printing domain to support expert consensus.\nWe first quantitatively survey the temporal, conceptual, and geographic diversity of all existing published applications within medical 3D printing literature and establish the existence of self-isolating research clusters. We then demonstrate an automated objective methodology to aid in establishing a terminological consensus for the field based on objective analysis of the existing literature. The resultant analysis provides a rich overview of the 3D printing literature, including publication statistics and trends globally, chronologically, technologically, and within each major medical discipline. The proposed methodology is used to objectively establish the dominance of the term \"3D printing\" to represent a collection of technologies that produce physical models in the medical setting. We demonstrate that specific domains do not use this term in line with objective consensus and call for its universal adoption.\nOur methodology can be applied to the entirety of medical 3D printing literature to obtain a complete, validated, and objective set of recommended and synonymous definitions to aid expert bodies in building ontological consensus.", "journal": "3D printing in medicine", "date": "2017-01-01", "authors": ["LeonidChepelev", "AndreasGiannopoulos", "AnjiTang", "DimitriosMitsouras", "Frank JRybicki"], "doi": "10.1186/s41205-017-0012-5\n10.1148/rg.2015140320\n10.3928/01477447-20151016-05\n10.1097/01.prs.0000479977.37428.8e\n10.1089/ten.teb.2014.0168\n10.2196/medinform.5275\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1000247\n10.1186/s13326-016-0079-8\n10.1002/asi.22715\n10.1007/s11192-009-0146-3"}

{"title": "Surgical reconstruction of the ossicular chain with custom 3D printed ossicular prosthesis.", "abstract": "Conductive hearing loss due to ossicular abnormalities occurs from many causes, including trauma, infection, cholesteatoma, surgery and congenital anomalies. Surgical reconstruction of the ossicular chain is a well-established procedure for repair of ossicular defects, but is still plagued by high failure rates. Underlying disease and proper sizing of prostheses are two challenges that lead to component failure. Three-dimensional (3D) printing has been used successfully to solve a number of medical prosthesis problems. Custom 3D printing an individualized ossicular prosthesis would be a potential solution for the wide range of anatomic variation encountered in the pathological middle ear, and could decrease the rate of post-operative prosthesis displacement by increasing the likelihood of a proper fit, in addition to decreasing surgical time.In this study, the incus was removed from three formalin-fixed cadaveric human temporal bones with no macro- or microscopic evidence of pathology. Imaging of the cadaveric bone was obtained using a standard temporal bone CT protocol. A custom prosthesis for each cadaveric human temporal bone was designed using the Mimics Innovation Suite software (Materialise, Belgium) and fabricated on a Form2 3D printer (FormLabs, Somerville, Massachusetts). Four surgeons then performed insertion of each prosthesis into each middle ear, blinded to the bone from and for which each was designed. The surgeons were asked to match each prosthesis to its correct parent bone.\nEach prosthesis had unique measurements. Each of the four surgeons was able to correctly match the prosthesis model to its intended temporal bone. The chances of this occurring randomly are 1:1296.\nA custom 3D printed ossicular prosthesis is a viable solution for conductive hearing loss due to ossicular chain defects.

Patients are applied 3D-printed casts we developed. Orthopaedic surgeons carried out a six-week follow-up to examine clinical outcomes. Two questionnaires were developed for the assessment of clinical efficacy and patients' satisfaction. These questionnaires are completed by physicians and participating patients.\nA 3D-printed cast creates a custom-fitted design to maintain the fractured bone alignment. No loss of reduction is found in all patients. Compartment syndrome and pressure sores are not present. Patient comfort gets positive scores on the questionnaire. All (100%) of the patients opt for the 3D-printed cast instead of the conventional plaster cast.\nA patient-specific, 3D-printed cast offers a proper fit to immobilise an injured arm and holds the fracture reduction appropriately. A custom-fitted structure reduces the risk of pressure-related complications due to the high and concentrated local stress. The ventilated and lightweight design minimises interference with a patient's daily activities and reduces the risk of cutaneous complications. Patients express a strong preference for using a 3D-printed cast instead of a plaster cast. Limitations of the novel cast include a slight odour after heavy sweating and the relatively high cost due to the limitations of current 3D printing technologies.\nThis pioneering study is the first clinical trial on the application of a 3D-printed cast for the treatment of forearm fractures. The novel casting technology heals the fracture effectively without casting complications. The 3D-printed cast is patient-specific and ventilated as well as lightweight, and it features both increased patient comfort and satisfaction.", "journal": "3D printing in medicine", "date": "2017-01-01", "authors": ["Yan-JunChen", "HuiLin", "XiaodongZhang", "WenhuaHuang", "LinShi", "DefengWang"], "doi": "10.1186/s41205-017-0019-y\n10.1503/cmaj.100119\n10.1007/s10140-015-1363-0\n10.1016/j.hcl.2009.11.002\n10.4103/0019-5413.80322\n10.1017/S1481803500012239\n10.1302/0301-620X.95B9.30666\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2006.05.008\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2011.10.041\n10.2106/JBJS.I.00968\n10.1097/PEC.0b013e31828e56fb\n10.1016/j.jemermed.2010.05.031\n10.5435/00124635-201003000-00007\n10.5435/00124635-200801000-00005\n10.1111/j.1532-849X.2012.00888.x\n10.1007/s12206-015-1115-9\n10.1016/j.injury.2012.11.018\n10.1186/1745-6215-11-2\n10.1302/2046-3758.35.2000264\n10.1186/1748-7161-10-S1-O71"}

New entrants attempting to penetrate it via the commercialization of a new technological innovation could face high uncertainty and constraints. The capability to innovate through collaboration and to identify suitable strategies and innovative business models (BMs) can be particularly important for bringing a technological innovation to this market. However, although the potential for these capabilities has been advocated, we still lack a complete understanding of how new ventures could support the technology commercialization process via the development of BMs. The paper aims to discuss these issues.\nTo address this gap, this paper builds a conceptual framework that knits together the different bodies of extant literature (i.e. entrepreneurship, strategy and innovation) to analyze the BM innovation processes associated with the exploitation of emerging technologies; determines the suitability of the framework using data from the exploratory case study of IT IS 3D - a firm which has started to exploit 3D printing in the food industry; and improves the initial conceptual framework with the findings that emerged in the case study.\nFrom this analysis it emerged that: companies could use more than one BM at a time; hence, BM innovation processes could co-exist and be run in parallel; the facing of high uncertainty might lead firms to choose a closed and/or a familiar BM, while explorative strategies could be pursued with open BMs; significant changes in strategies during the technology commercialization process are not necessarily reflected in a radical change in the BM; and firms could deliberately adopt interim strategies and BMs as means to identify the more suitable ones to reach the market.\nThis case study illustrates how firms could innovate the processes of their BM development to face the uncertainties linked with the entry into a mature and highly conservative industry (food).", "journal": "British food journal (Croydon, England)", "date": "2017-01-01", "authors": ["SerenaFlammini", "GabriellaArcese", "Maria ClaudiaLucchetti", "LetiziaMortara"], "doi": "10.1108/BFJ-03-2017-0125"}

To provide the most useful comparisons, a phantom would ideally mimic tissue as closely as possible, including the geometry of static and dynamic scatterers. A branching design that keeps the capillary cross section constant ensures that the same flow velocity is found throughout the phantom while allowing for single input and output fittings to feed all of the capillaries simultaneously. The direction of each capillary is randomized every few millimeters by randomly allocating 2 by 2 \"twisting\" squares within each layer. These squares swap the locations of four adjacent artificial capillaries either clockwise or counterclockwise. Numerical simulations were used to verify the random walk-like behavior of the capillary paths resulting from this pattern. This is a step toward replicating the randomly varying directionality of actual capillaries.

{"title": "DeepScope: Nonintrusive Whole Slide Saliency Annotation and Prediction from Pathologists at the Microscope.", "abstract": "Modern digital pathology departments have grown to produce whole-slide image data at petabyte scale, an unprecedented treasure chest for medical machine learning tasks. Unfortunately, most digital slides are not annotated at the image level, hindering large-scale application of supervised learning. Manual labeling is prohibitive, requiring pathologists with decades of training and outstanding clinical service responsibilities. This problem is further aggravated by the United States Food and Drug Administration's ruling that primary diagnosis must come from a glass slide rather than a digital image. We present the first end-to-end framework to overcome this problem, gathering annotations in a nonintrusive manner during a pathologist's routine clinical work: (i) microscope-specific 3D-printed commodity camera mounts are used to video record the glass-slide-based clinical diagnosis process; (ii) after routine scanning of the whole slide, the video frames are registered to the digital slide; (iii) motion and observation time are estimated to generate a spatial and temporal saliency map of the whole slide. Demonstrating the utility of these annotations, we train a convolutional neural network that detects diagnosis-relevant salient regions, then report accuracy of 85.15% in bladder and 91.40% in prostate, with 75.00% accuracy when training on prostate but predicting in bladder, despite different pathologists examining the different tissues. When training on one patient but testing on another, AUROC in bladder is 0.79\u00b10.11 and in prostate is 0.96\u00b10.04.

On the other hand, additive manufacturing has high flexibility of structure design which can significantly expand the application of materials in many fields. This study demonstrates the fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing of TPU/PLA/GO nanocomposites and its potential application as biocompatible materials. Nanocomposites are prepared by solvent-based mixing process and extruded into filaments for FDM printing. The addition of GO largely enhanced the mechanical property and thermal stability of the nanocomposites. Interestingly, we found that the mechanical response is highly dependent on printing orientation.

Coordinates representing the annulus and the leaflets were imported into MeshLab (Visual Computing Lab ISTICNR) to develop solid models to be converted to stereolithographic file format and 3D print. Measurements of the TV annulus antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) diameters, perimeter (P), and TV tenting height (H) and volume (V) obtained from the 3D echo data set were compared with those performed on the 3D models using a caliper, a syringe and a millimeter tape.

To date, there has not been reported TM regeneration using bioprinted scaffold. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of bioprinted polycaprolactone/collagen/alginate-mesenchymal stem cell (PCAMSC) scaffolds for the regeneration of subacute TM perforation. Sprague-Dawley rats were used in an animal model of subacute TM perforation. In the experimental group (n=7), bioprinted 3D PCAMSC scaffold was placed on the perforation. The control group (n=7) were treated with polycaprolactone/collagen/alginate (PCA) scaffold. Healing time, acoustic-mechanical properties, and morphological analysis were performed by otoendoscopy, auditory brainstem response (ABR), single-point laser doppler vibrometer (LDV), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and light microscopic evaluation. The closure of the TM perforation was achieved in 100% of the experimental group vs. 72% of the control group, and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). The ABR threshold at all frequencies of the experimental group was recovered to the normal level compared to the control group. TM vibration velocity in the experimental group recovered similar to the normal control level. The difference are very small and they are not statistically significant below 1kHz (p=0.074). By OCT and light microscopic examination, regenerated TM of the experimental group showed thickened fibrous and mucosal layer. In contrast, the control group showed well regenerated but less thickened than experimental group. From these results, the cell-laden PCAMSC scaffold offers a significant advantage in the TM regeneration in a rat subacute TM perforation model.

{"title": "Evolution of design considerations in complex craniofacial reconstruction using patient-specific implants.", "abstract": "Previously published evidence has established major clinical benefits from using computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, and additive manufacturing to produce patient-specific devices. These include cutting guides, drilling guides, positioning guides, and implants. However, custom devices produced using these methods are still not in routine use, particularly by the UK National Health Service. Oft-cited reasons for this slow uptake include the following: a higher up-front cost than conventionally fabricated devices, material-choice uncertainty, and a lack of long-term follow-up due to their relatively recent introduction. This article identifies a further gap in current knowledge - that of design rules, or key specification considerations for complex computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing/additive manufacturing devices. This research begins to address the gap by combining a detailed review of the literature with first-hand experience of interdisciplinary collaboration on five craniofacial patient case studies. In each patient case, bony lesions in the orbito-temporal region were segmented, excised, and reconstructed in the virtual environment. Three cases translated these digital plans into theatre via polymer surgical guides. Four cases utilised additive manufacturing to fabricate titanium implants. One implant was machined from polyether ether ketone. From the literature, articles with relevant abstracts were analysed to extract design considerations. In all, 19 frequently recurring design considerations were extracted from previous publications. Nine new design considerations were extracted from the case studies - on the basis of subjective clinical evaluation. These were synthesised to produce a design considerations framework to assist clinicians with prescribing and design engineers with modelling.

Stem cell-based approaches for the generation of renal-like cells and tissues would be most attractive, but such methods were not available until recently. This situation has drastically changed since 2013, and various protocols for the generation of renal-like cells and precursors from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) have been established.

{"title": "Endosteal-like extracellular matrix expression on melt electrospun written scaffolds.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering technology platforms constitute a unique opportunity to integrate cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins into scaffolds and matrices that mimic the natural microenvironment in vitro. The development of tissue-engineered 3D models that mimic the endosteal microenvironment enables researchers to discover the causes and improve treatments for blood and immune-related diseases. The aim of this study was to establish a physiologically relevant in vitro model using 3D printed scaffolds to assess the contribution of human cells to the formation of a construct that mimics human endosteum. Melt electrospun written scaffolds were used to compare the suitability of primary human osteoblasts (hOBs) and placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (plMSCs) in (non-)osteogenic conditions and with different surface treatments. Using osteogenic conditions, hOBs secreted a dense ECM with enhanced deposition of endosteal proteins, such as fibronectin and vitronectin, and osteogenic markers, such as osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase, compared to plMSCs. The expression patterns of these proteins were reproducibly identified in hOBs derived from three individual donors. Calcium phosphate-coated scaffolds induced the expression of osteocalcin by hOBs when maintained in osteogenic conditions. The tissue-engineered endosteal microenvironment supported the growth and migration of primary human haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) when compared to HSCs maintained using tissue culture plastic. This 3D testing platform represents an endosteal bone-like tissue and warrants future investigation for the maintenance and expansion of human HSCs.\nThis work is motivated by the recent interest in melt electrospinning writing, a 3D printing technique used to produce porous scaffolds for biomedical applications in regenerative medicine. Our team has been among the pioneers in building a new class of melt electrospinning devices for scaffold-based tissue engineering. These scaffolds allow structural support for various cell types to invade and deposit their own ECM, mimicking a characteristic 3D microenvironment for experimental studies.

Three-point bending and hardness tests were performed to determine the mechanical properties of the filaments and tablets. 3D-printed tablets, directly compressed mill-extruded tablets, and tablets prepared from a physical mixture were evaluated for drug release rates using a USP-II dissolution apparatus. The surface and cross-sectional morphology of the 3D-printed tablets were assessed by scanning electron microscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis were used to characterize the crystal states and thermal properties of materials, respectively. The 3D-printed tablets had smooth surfaces and tight structures; therefore, they showed better extended drug release rates than the directly compressed tablets did.

In this paper, a type of epoxy-acrylate hybrid photopolymer was synthesized and applied to fabricate shape memory polymers through a stereolithography 3D printing technique. The glass-to-rubbery modulus ratio of the printed sample determined by dynamic mechanical analysis is as high as 600, indicating that it may possess good shape memory properties. Fold-deploy and shape memory cycle tests were applied to evaluate its shape memory performance. The shape fixity ratio and the shape recovery ratio in ten cycles of fold-deploy tests are about 99 and 100%, respectively. The shape recovery process takes less than 20 s, indicating its rapid shape recovery rate. The shape fixity ratio and shape recovery ratio during 18 consecutive shape memory cycles are 97.44 \u00b1 0.08 and 100.02 \u00b1 0.05%, respectively, showing that the printed sample has high shape fixity ratio, shape recovery ratio, and excellent cycling stability. A tensile test at 62 \u00b0C demonstrates that the printed samples combine a relatively large break strain of 38% with a large recovery stress of 4.7 MPa.

{"title": "Investigation of foam flow in a 3D printed porous medium in the presence of oil.", "abstract": "Foams demonstrate great potential for displacing fluids in porous media which is applicable to a variety of subsurface operations such as the enhanced oil recovery and soil remediation. The application of foam in these processes is due to its unique ability to reduce gas mobility by increasing its effective viscosity and to divert gas to un-swept low permeability zones in porous media. The presence of oil in porous media is detrimental to the stability of foams which can influence its success as a displacing fluid. In the present work, we have conducted a systematic series of experiments using a well-characterised porous medium manufactured by 3D printing technique to evaluate the influence of oil on the dynamics of foam displacement under different boundary conditions. The effects of the type of oil, foam quality and foam flow rate were investigated. Our results reveal that generation of stable foam is delayed in the presence of light oil in the porous medium compared to heavy oil. Additionally, it was observed that the dynamics of oil entrapment was dictated by the stability of foam in the presence of oil. Furthermore, foams with high gas fraction appeared to be less stable in the presence of oil lowering its recovery efficiency. Pore-scale inspection of foam-oil dynamics during displacement revealed formation of a less stable front as the foam quality increased, leading to less oil recovery.

In this study, we used additive manufacturing (selective laser melting) to develop multifunctional porous nitinol that combines superelasticity with a rationally designed microarchitecture and biofunctionalized surface. The rational design based on triply periodic minimal surfaces aimed to properly adjust the pore size, increase the surface area (thereby amplifying the effects of surface biofunctionalization), and resemble the curvature characteristics of trabecular bone. The surface of additively manufactured (AM) porous nitinol was biofunctionalized using polydopamine-immobilized rhBMP2 for better control of the release kinetics. The actual morphological properties of porous nitinol measured by microcomputed tomography (e.g., open/close porosity, and surface area) closely matched the design values. The superelasticity originated from the austenite phase formed in the nitinol porous structure at room temperature. Polydopamine and rhBMP2 signature peaks were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy tests. The release of rhBMP2 continued until 28 days. The early time and long-term release profiles were found to be adjustable independent of each other. In vitro cell culture showed improved cell attachment, cell proliferation, cell morphology (spreading, spindle-like shape), and cell coverage as well as elevated levels of ALP activity and increased calcium content for biofunctionalized surfaces as compared to as-manufactured specimens.

For a better understanding of tumor metastasis, a reliable 3D in vitro model bridging the gap between 2D cultures and in vivo animal model studies is essential. Our study is focused on two key points: (i) designing a 3D microenvironment for studying metastasis and (ii) simulating the metastasis milieu by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). An electrospun gelatin nanofiber matrix (EGNF) was fabricated using electrospinning and further dip coated with different concentrations of collagen to obtain surface complexity and mechanical properties, similar to connective tissues. Nanofiber matrices were physically characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The FTIR, AFM, and FESEM results indicated the crosslinking and confirmed the presence of pores in the nanofiber matrices. Comparative studies on biocompatibility, cell attachment, and the proliferation of MCF-7 cells on EGNF and collagen coated gelatin nanofibrous matrix (CCGM) revealed higher cellular attachment and proliferation in CCGM. CCGM with human metastatic breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was taken to study breast cancer metastasis using estrogen (induces EMT) and progesterone (induces MET) hormones for 24 h. Quantitative real-time PCR was used for quantifying the expression of metastasis related genes, and fluorescence microscopy for verifying the invasion of cells to the matrices.

Such customized 3D printed constructs can be used for the regeneration of complex tissues such as cartilage, vessels, and nerves. However, the 3D printing techniques often offer limited control over the resolution and compromised mechanical properties due to short selection of printable inks. To address these limitations, we combined stereolithography and electrospinning techniques to fabricate a novel 3D biomimetic neural scaffold with a tunable porous structure and embedded aligned fibers. By employing two different types of biofabrication methods, we successfully utilized both synthetic and natural materials with varying chemical composition as bioink to enhance biocompatibilities and mechanical properties of the scaffold. The resulting microfibers composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer and PCL mixed with gelatin were embedded in 3D printed hydrogel scaffold. Our results showed that 3D printed scaffolds with electrospun fibers significantly improve neural stem cell adhesion when compared to those without the fibers. Furthermore, 3D scaffolds embedded with aligned fibers showed an enhancement in cell proliferation relative to bare control scaffolds. More importantly, confocal microscopy images illustrated that the scaffold with PCL/gelatin fibers greatly increased the average neurite length and directed neurite extension of primary cortical neurons along the fiber. The results of this study demonstrate the potential to create unique 3D neural tissue constructs by combining 3D bioprinting and electrospinning techniques.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The ability to alternate any of the 16 channels from input to output, and vice versa, provides for high experimental flexibility without the need to alter microchannel designs. 3D-printed interface templates were custom designed to sculpt the above-channel polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in microdevices, creating millimeter scale reservoirs and confinement chambers to interface primary murine islets and adipose tissue explants to the \u03bcMUX sampling channels.

Training could especially benefit from dedicated study models. The currently available devices lack sufficient anatomical representation and realistic soft tissue properties. Hence, we developed a 3D-printed simulation device for orbital surgery with tactual (haptic) correct simulation of all relevant anatomical structures.\nBased on computed tomography scans collected from patients treated in a third referral center, the hard and soft tissue were segmented and virtually processed to generate a 3D-model of the orbit. Hard tissue was then physically realized by 3D-printing. The soft tissue was manufactured by a composite silicone model of the nucleus and the surrounding tissue over a negative mold model also generated by 3D-printing. The final model was evaluated by a group of 5 trainees in oral and maxillofacial surgery (1) and a group of 5 consultants (2). All participants were asked to reconstruct an isolated orbital floor defect with a titanium implant. A stereotactic navigation system was available to all participants. Their experience was evaluated for haptic realism, correct representation of surgical approach, general handling of model, insertion of implant into the orbit, placement and fixation of implant, and usability of navigated control.

{"title": "Making the cut: Innovative methods for optimizing perfusion-based migration assays.", "abstract": "Application of fluid shear stress to adherent cells dramatically influences their cytoskeletal makeup and differentially regulates their migratory phenotype. Because cytoskeletal rearrangements are necessary for cell motility and migration, preserving these adaptations under in vitro conditions and in the presence of fluid flow are physiologically essential. With this in mind, parallel plate flow chambers and microchannels are often used to conduct in vitro perfusion experiments. However, both of these systems currently lack capacity to accurately study cell migration in the same location where cells were perfused. The most common perfusion/migration assays involve cell perfusion followed by trypsinization which can compromise adaptive cytoskeletal geometry and lead to misleading phenotypic conclusions. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively highlight some limitations commonly found with currently used cell migration approaches and to introduce two new advances which use additive manufacturing (3D printing) or laser capture microdissection (LCM) technology. The residue-free 3D printed insert allows accurate cell seeding within defined areas, increases cell yield for downstream analyses, and more closely resembles the reported levels of fluid shear stress calculated with computational fluid dynamics as compared to other residue-free cell seeding techniques. The LCM approach uses an ultraviolet laser for \"touchless technology\" to rapidly and accurately introduce a custom-sized wound area in otherwise inaccessible perfusion microchannels. The wound area introduced by LCM elicits comparable migration characteristics compared to traditional pipette tip-induced injuries. When used in perfusion experiments, both of these newly characterized tools were effective in yielding similar results yet without the limitations of the traditional modalities. These innovative methods provide valuable tools for exploring mechanisms of clinically important aspects of cell migration fundamental to the pathogenesis of many flow-mediated disorders and are applicable to other perfusion-based models where migration is of central importance. \u00a9 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.", "journal": "Cytometry.

{"title": "Quantitative Chemical Imaging of Nonplanar Microfluidics.", "abstract": "Confocal and multiphoton optical imaging techniques have been powerful tools for evaluating the performance of and monitoring experiments within microfluidic devices, but this application suffers from two pitfalls. The first is that obtaining the necessary imaging contrast often requires the introduction of an optical label which can potentially change the behavior of the system. The emerging analytical technique stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy promises a solution, as it can rapidly measure 3D concentration maps based on vibrational spectra, label-free; however, when using any optical imaging technique, including SRS, there is an additional problem of optical aberration due to refractive index mismatch between the fluid and the device walls. New approaches such as 3D printing are extending the range of materials from which microfluidic devices can be fabricated; thus, the problem of aberration can be obviated simply by selecting a chip material that matches the refractive index of the desired fluid. To demonstrate complete chemical imaging of a geometrically complex device, we first use sacrificial molding of a freeform 3D printed template to create a round-channel, 3D helical micromixer in a low-refractive-index polymer. We then use SRS to image the mixing of aqueous glucose and salt solutions throughout the entire helix volume.

The deep regions of these scaffolds, or scaffolds implanted subcutaneously in live animals, are typically difficult to measure by confocal Raman spectroscopy techniques because of the limited depth penetration of light caused by the high level of light scattering. Layered samples consisting of bioactive glass foams (IEIC16), three-dimensional (3D)-printed biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffolds (PLGA), and hydroxyapatite powder (HA) were used to mimic nondestructive detection of biomineralization for intact real-size 3D tissue engineering constructs. SORS spectra were measured with a new SORS instrument using a digital micromirror device (DMD) to allow software selection of the spatial offsets. The results show that HA can be reliably detected at depths of 0-2.3 mm, which corresponds to the maximum accessible spatial offset of the current instrument. The intensity ratio of Raman bands associated with the scaffolds and HA with the spatial offset depended on the depth at which HA was located. Furthermore, we show the feasibility for in vivo monitoring mineralization of scaffold implanted subcutaneously by demonstrating the ability to measure transcutaneously Raman signals of the scaffolds and HA (fresh chicken skin used as a top layer). The ability to measure spectral depth profiles at high speed (5 s acquisition time) and the ease of implementation make SORS a promising approach for noninvasive characterization of cell/tissue development in vitro, and for long-term in vivo monitoring the mineralization in 3D scaffolds subcutaneously implanted in small animals.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2016-12-17", "authors": ["ZhiyuLiao", "FarisSinjab", "AmyNommeots-Nomm", "JulianJones", "LauraRuiz-Cantu", "JingYang", "FelicityRose", "IoanNotingher"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03785"}

{"title": "Strength and Performance Enhancement of Bonded Joints by Spatial Tailoring of Adhesive Compliance via 3D Printing.", "abstract": "Adhesive bonding continues to emerge as a preferred route for joining materials with broad applications including advanced structures, microelectronics, biomedical systems, and consumer goods. Here, we study the mechanics of deformation and failure of tensile-loaded single-lap joints with a compliance-tailored adhesive. Tailoring of the adhesive compliance redistributes stresses and strains to reduce both shear and peel concentrations at the ends of the adhesive that determine failure of the joint. Utilizing 3D printing, the modulus of the adhesive is spatially varied along the bondlength. Experimental strength testing, including optical strain mapping, reveals that the strain redistribution results in a greater than 100% increase in strength and toughness concomitant with a 50% increase in strain-to-break while maintaining joint stiffness. The tailoring demonstrated here is immediately realizable in a broad array of 3D printing applications, and the level of performance enhancement suggests that compliance tailoring of the adhesive is a generalizable route for achieving superior performance of joints in other applications, such as advanced structural composites.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-12-15", "authors": ["SKumar", "Brian LWardle", "Muhamad FArif"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b13038"}

The aim of this study was to explore facilities for the semi-automated delineation of breast cancer tumors and to assess the feasibility of 3D printing of breast cancer tumors.\nIn a case series of five patients, different 3D imaging methods-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and 3D ultrasound-were used to capture 3D data for breast cancer tumors. The volumes of the breast tumors were calculated to assess the comparability of the breast tumor models, and the MRI information was used to render models on a commercially available 3D printer to materialize the tumors.\nThe tumor volumes calculated from the different 3D methods appeared to be comparable. Tumor models with volumes between 325\u2009mm\n3D printing (rapid prototyping) appears to be feasible. Scenarios for the clinical use of the technology might include presenting the model to the surgeon to provide a better understanding of the tumor's spatial characteristics in the breast, in order to improve decision-making in relation to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or surgical approaches.

They can, however, be difficult to manufacture, particularly if there is a lack of experience in superficial high-dose-rate brachytherapy techniques or with limited resources.\nWe present a novel method of manufacturing superficial brachytherapy applicators utilizing three-dimensional (3D)-printing techniques. We describe the treatment planning process and the process of applicator manufacture.\nThe treatment planning process, with the introduction of a pre-plan, allows for an \"ideal\" catheter arrangement within an applicator to be determined, exploiting varying catheter orientations, heights, and curvatures if required. The pre-plan arrangement is then 3D printed to the exact specifications of the pre-plan applicator design. This results in improved target volume coverage and improved sparing of organs at risk.\nUsing a pre-plan technique for ideal catheter placement followed by automated 3D-printed applicator manufacture has greatly improved the entire process of superficial high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment.

All samples were scanned twice (i.e., before and after resin embedding), using fast, low-resolution scans (Skyscan 1172; Bruker micro-CT, Kontich, Belgium), and were analysed by 2D and 3D morphometry. The main questions posed were: (i) Can low resolution, fast scans provide morphometric data of bone formed inside (and around) metal implants with a complex, open-pore architecture?, (ii) Can micro-CT be used to accurately quantify both the bone area (BA) and bone-implant contact (BIC)?, (iii) What degree of error is introduced in the quantitative data by varying the threshold values?, and (iv) Does resin embedding influence the accuracy of the analysis? To validate the accuracy of micro-CT measurements, each data set was correlated with a corresponding centrally cut histological section. The results show that quantitative histomorphometry corresponds strongly with 3D measurements made by micro-CT, where a high correlation exists between the two techniques for bone area/volume measurements around and inside the porous network. On the contrary, the direct bone-implant contact is challenging to estimate accurately or reproducibly. Large errors may be introduced in micro-CT measurements when segmentation is performed without calibrating the data set against a corresponding histological section. Generally, the bone area measurement is strongly influenced by the lower threshold limit, while the upper threshold limit has little or no effect. Resin embedding does not compromise the accuracy of micro-CT measurements, although there is a change in the contrast distributions and optimisation of the threshold ranges is required.", "journal": "Micron (Oxford, England : 1993)", "date": "2016-12-14", "authors": ["AndersPalmquist", "Furqan AShah", "LenaEmanuelsson", "OmarOmar", "FeliciaSuska"], "doi": "10.1016/j.micron.2016.11.009"}

The aim of this study was to develop a \u03bcPIV approach to allow the extraction of velocity fields from a 3D additive manufacturing scaffold using a conventional 2D \u03bcPIV system. The \u03bc-computed tomography scaffold geometry was included in a CFD model where perfusion conditions were simulated. Good agreement was found between velocity profiles from measurements and computational results. Maximum velocities were found at the centre of the pore using both techniques with a difference of 12% which was expected according to the accuracy of the \u03bcPIV system. However, significant differences in terms of velocity magnitude were found near scaffold substrate due to scaffold brightness which affected the \u03bcPIV measurements. As a result, the limitations of the \u03bcPIV system only permits a partial validation of the CFD model.

This work aims to fabricate gastric-resistant 3D printed tablets using dual FDM 3D printing.\nThe gastric-resistant tablets were engineered by employing a range of shell-core designs using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and methacrylic acid co-polymer for core and shell structures respectively. Filaments for both core and shell were compounded using a twin-screw hot-melt extruder (HME). CAD software was utilized to design a capsule-shaped core with a complementary shell of increasing thicknesses (0.17, 0.35, 0.52, 0.70 or 0.87\u00a0mm). The physical form of the drug and its integrity following an FDM 3D printing were assessed using x-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD), thermal analysis and HPLC.\nA shell thickness \u22650.52\u00a0mm was deemed necessary in order to achieve sufficient core protection in the acid medium. The technology proved viable for incorporating different drug candidates; theophylline, budesonide and diclofenac sodium. XRPD indicated the presence of theophylline crystals whilst budesonide and diclofenac sodium remained amorphous in the PVP matrix of the filaments and 3D printed tablets. Fabricated tablets demonstrated gastric resistant properties and a pH responsive drug release pattern in both phosphate and bicarbonate buffers.\nDespite its relatively limited resolution, FDM 3D printing proved to be a suitable platform for a single-process fabrication of delayed release tablets.

The secondary goal was to determine whether it is possible to share the aiming device with the surgical community.\nA HEEF was implanted in cadavers with either the aiming device (n\u00a0=\u00a06) or the conventional pin technique (n\u00a0=\u00a06). For both techniques the duration of the procedure, the radiation exposure as well as the offset and angular divergence between the HEEF's and flexion-extension's axis were compared. To achieve the secondary goal, two surgeons used aiming devices 3D-printed from files sent by email in order to implant HEEF on cadaveric specimens (n\u00a0=\u00a06).\nDuration of the procedure was not significantly different between both techniques.

Currently, common methods often sandwich commercially available membranes in multi-layer devices, or use photopolymerization or temperature-induced gelation to fabricate membrane structures in one-layer devices. Biofabrication offers an alternative to forming membrane structures with biomimetic materials and mechanisms in mild conditions. We have recently developed a biofabrication strategy to form parallel biopolymer membranes in gas-permeable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices, which used positive pressure to dissipate air bubbles through PDMS to initiate membrane formation but required careful pressure balancing between two flows. Here, we report a technical innovation by simply placing as needed an add-on PDMS vacuum layer on PDMS microfluidic devices to dissipate air bubbles and guide the biofabrication of biopolymer membranes. Vacuuming through PDMS was simply achieved by either withdrawing a syringe or releasing a squeezed nasal aspirator. Upon vacuuming, air bubbles dissipated within minutes, membranes were effortlessly formed, and the add-on vacuum layer can be removed. Subsequent membrane growth could be robustly controlled with the flows and pH of solutions. This new process is user-friendly and has achieved a 100% success rate in more than 200 trials in membrane biofabrication.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2016-12-13", "authors": ["PhuPham", "ThanhVo", "XiaolongLuo"], "doi": "10.1039/c6lc01362g"}

The traditional tissue engineering of urethra involves scaffold design, fabrication and processing of multiple cell types.\nIn this study, we have used 3D bioprinting technology to fabricate cell-laden urethra in vitro with different polymer types and structural characteristics. We hypothesized that use of PCL and PLCL polymers with a spiral scaffold design could mimic the structure and mechanical properties of natural urethra of rabbits, and cell-laden fibrin hydrogel could give a better microenvironment for cell growth. With using an integrated bioprinting system, tubular scaffold was formed with the biomaterials; meanwhile, urothelial cells (UCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were delivered evenly into inner and outer layers of the scaffold separately within the cell-laden hydrogel.\nThe PCL/PLCL (50:50) spiral scaffold demonstrated mechanical properties equivalent to the native urethra in rabbit. Evaluation of the cell bioactivity in the bioprinted urethra revealed that UCs and SMCs maintained more than 80% viability even at 7days after printing. Both cell types also showed active proliferation and maintained the specific biomarkers in the cell-laden hydrogel.\nThese results provided a foundation for further studies in 3D bioprinting of urethral constructs that mimic the natural urethral tissue in mechanical properties and cell bioactivity, as well a possibility of using the bioprinted construct for in vivo study of urethral implantation in animal model.\nThe 3D bioprinting is a new technique to replace traditional tissue engineering.

Through optimization of the powder composition and processing parameters, we were able to generate stainless steel molds with superior material properties (density and surface finish) than previously reported 3D printed metal parts. Molds were used to fabricate poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) replicas which exhibited good feature integrity and replication quality. Microchannels fabricated using these replicas exhibited leak-free operation and comparable flow performance as those fabricated from CNC milled molds.

The photoinitiator-free scaffolds are superior compared to their counterparts fabricated by using photoinitiator molecules, showing a higher level of biocompatibility.

In contrast, no toxic release is found from the photoinitiator-free scaffolds, resulting in the very same level of cell proliferation as the control sample.

Preoperatively, the models demonstrated the extent of temporal lobe retraction necessary to visualize the proposed defects in the lateral skull base. Also preoperatively, Silastic sheeting was arranged across the modeled tegmen, marked, and cut to cover all of the proposed defect sites. The Silastic sheeting was then sterilized and subsequently served as a precise intraoperative template for a synthetic dural replacement graft. Of note, these grafts were customized without needing to retract the temporal lobe.\nFive patients underwent the middle cranial fossa approach assisted by 3D-printed temporal bone models to repair tegmen defects and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks. No complications were encountered. The prefabricated dural repair grafts were easily placed and fit precisely onto the middle fossa floor without any additional modifications. All defects were covered as predicted by the 3D temporal bone models. At their postoperative visits, all five patients maintained resolution of their spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks.\nInexpensive 3D-printed temporal bone models of tegmen defects can serve as beneficial adjuncts during lateral skull base repair. The models provide a panoramic preoperative view of all tegmen defects and allow for custom templating of dural grafts without temporal lobe retraction.\n4 Laryngoscope, 127:2347-2351, 2017.", "journal": "The Laryngoscope", "date": "2016-12-10", "authors": ["SameerAhmed", "Kyle KVanKoevering", "StephanieKline", "Glenn EGreen", "H AlexanderArts"], "doi": "10.1002/lary.26438"}

To enhance cellular function in response to the implant surface, micro- and nano-scale topography have been suggested as essential. In this study, we present bone implants based on 3D-printed titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), with a unique dual topography composed of micron-sized spherical particles and vertically aligned titania nanotubes. The implants were prepared by combination of 3D-printing and anodization processes, which are scalable, simple and cost-effective. The osseointegration properties of fabricated implants, examined using human osteoblasts, showed enhanced adhesion of osteoblasts compared with titanium materials commonly used as orthopaedic implants. Gene expression studies at early (day 7) and late (day 21) stages of culture were consistent with the Ti substrates inducing an osteoblast phenotype conducive to effective osseointegration. These implants with the unique combination of micro- and nano-scale topography are proposed as the new generation of multi-functional bone implants, suitable for addressing many orthopaedic challenges, including implant rejection, poor osseointegration, inflammation, drug delivery and bone healing.

The objective of this study was to design a MCS replicating the pulmonary arterial circulation, incorporating an anatomically representative arterial model suitable for testing clinically relevant scenarios. A second objective of the study was to ensure the system's compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for additional measurements. A latex pulmonary arterial model with two generations of bifurcations was manufactured starting from a 3D-printed mold reconstructed from patient data. The model was incorporated into a MCS for in vitro hydrodynamic measurements. The setup was tested under physiological pulsatile flow conditions and results were evaluated using wave intensity analysis (WIA) to investigate waves traveling in the arterial system. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (IPVR) was simulated as an example of one pathological scenario. Flow split between right and left pulmonary artery was found to be realistic (54 and 46%, respectively). No substantial difference in pressure waveform was observed throughout the various generations of bifurcations. Based on WIA, three main waves were identified in the main pulmonary artery (MPA), that is, forward compression wave, backward compression wave, and forward expansion wave. For IPVR, a rise in mean pressure was recorded in the MPA, within the clinical range of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The feasibility of using the MCS in the MRI scanner was demonstrated with the MCS running 2 h consecutively while acquiring preliminary MRI data. This study shows the development and verification of a pulmonary MCS, including an anatomically correct, compliant latex phantom. The setup can be useful to explore a wide range of hemodynamic questions, including the development of patient- and pathology-specific models, considering the ease and low cost of producing rapid prototyping molds, and the versatility of the setup for invasive and noninvasive (i.e., MRI) measurements.", "journal": "Artificial organs", "date": "2016-12-08", "authors": ["Paul G MKnoops", "GiovanniBiglino", "Alun DHughes", "Kim HParker", "LinzhangXu", "SilviaSchievano", "RyoTorii"], "doi": "10.1111/aor.12809\n10.3389/fped.00107"}

However, after more than a decade of incubation and many proofs of concept, the field is still in its infancy. The current stagnation is the consequence of its early success: the first bioprinters, and most of those that followed, were modified versions of the three-dimensional printers used in additive manufacturing, redesigned for layer-by-layer dispersion of biomaterials. In all variants (inkjet, microextrusion, or laser assisted), this approach is material (\"scaffold\") dependent and energy intensive, making it hardly compatible with some of the intended biological applications. Instead, the future of bioprinting may benefit from the use of gentler scaffold-free bioassembling methods. A substantial body of evidence has accumulated, indicating this is possible by use of preformed cell spheroids, which have been assembled in cartilage, bone, and cardiac muscle-like constructs. However, a commercial instrument capable to directly and precisely \"print\" spheroids has not been available until the invention of the microneedles-based (\"Kenzan\") spheroid assembling and the launching in Japan of a bioprinter based on this method. This robotic platform laces spheroids into predesigned contiguous structures with micron-level precision, using stainless steel microneedles (\"kenzans\") as temporary support.

The interconnected porous architecture contributed to the distribution of cells from the large pore size (G1) to the small pore size (G3), with consequent synthesis of extracellular matrix and calcium precipitation. The gradient mesh structure significantly impacted cell adhesion and influenced the proliferation stage, such that there was high distribution of cells on struts of the gradient mesh structure. Actin and vinculin showed a significant difference in normalized expression level of protein per cell, which was absent in the case of fibronectin. Osteoblasts present on mesh struts formed a confluent sheet, bridging the pores through numerous cytoplasmic extensions. The gradient mesh structure fabricated by electron beam melting was explored to obtain fundamental insights on cellular activity with respect to osteoblast functions.", "journal": "Colloids and surfaces.

{"title": "Flexible head-casts for high spatial precision MEG.", "abstract": "In combination with magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data, accurate knowledge of the brain's structure and location provide a principled way of reconstructing neural activity with high temporal resolution. However, measuring the brain's location is compromised by head movement during scanning, and by fiducial-based co-registration with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The uncertainty from these two factors introduces errors into the forward model and limit the spatial resolution of the data.\nWe present a method for stabilizing and reliably repositioning the head during scanning, and for co-registering MRI and MEG data with low error.\nUsing this new flexible and comfortable subject-specific head-cast prototype, we find within-session movements of <0.25mm and between-session repositioning errors around 1mm.\nThis method is an improvement over existing methods for stabilizing the head or correcting for location shifts on- or off-line, which still introduce approximately 5mm of uncertainty at best (Adjamian et al., 2004; Stolk et al., 2013; Whalen et al., 2008). Further, the head-cast design presented here is more comfortable, safer, and easier to use than the earlier 3D printed prototype, and give slightly lower co-registration errors (Troebinger et al., 2014b).\nWe provide an empirical example of how these head-casts impact on source level reproducibility.

In this regard, we have combined the attributes of a new alloy design and the concept of additive manufacturing to fabricate 3D scaffolds with an interconnected porous structure. The new alloy is a \u03b2-type Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn (Ti2448) alloy with significantly reduced modulus. In the present study, we explore the biological response of electron beam melted low modulus Ti2448 alloy porous mesh structure through the elucidation of bioactivity and osteoblast functions. The cellular activity was explored in terms of cell-to-cell communication involving proliferation, spreading, synthesis of extracellular and intracellular proteins, differentiation, and mineralization. The formation of fine apatite-like crystals on the surface during immersion test in simulated body fluid confirmed the bioactivity of the scaffold surface, which provided the favorable osteogenic microenvironment for cell-material interaction. The combination of unique surface chemistry and interconnected porous architecture provided the desired pathway for supply of nutrients and oxygen to cells and a favorable osteogenic micro-environment for incorporation (on-growth and in-growth) of osteoblasts.

{"title": "Inverted orientation improves decellularization of whole porcine hearts.", "abstract": "In structurally heterogeneous organs, such as heart, it is challenging to retain extracellular matrix integrity in the thinnest regions (eg, valves) during perfusion decellularization and completely remove cellular debris from thicker areas. The high inflow rates necessary to maintain physiologic pressure can distend or damage thin tissues, but lower pressures prolong the process and increase the likelihood of contamination. We examined two novel retrograde decellularization methods for porcine hearts: inverting the heart or venting the apex to decrease inflow rate. We measured flow dynamics through the aorta (Ao) and pulmonary artery (PA) at different Ao pressures and assessed the heart's appearance, turbidity of the outflow solutions, and coronary perfusion efficiency. We used rectangle image fitting of decellularized heart images to obtain a heart shape index. Using nonlinear optical microscopy, we determined the microstructure of collagen and elastin fibers of the aortic valve cusps. DNA, glycosaminoglycan, and residual detergent levels were compared. The inverted method was superior to the vented method, as shown by a higher coronary perfusion efficiency, more cell debris outflow, higher collagen and elastin content inside the aortic valve, lower DNA content, and better retention of the heart shape after decellularization. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use flow dynamics in a whole heart throughout the decellularization procedure to provide real-time information about the success of the process and the integrity of the vulnerable regions of the matrix. Heart orientation was important in optimizing decellularization efficiency and maintaining extracellular matrix integrity.\nThe use of decellularized tissue as a suitable scaffold for engineered tissue has emerged over the past decade as one of the most promising biofabrication platforms. The decellularization process removes all native cells, leaving the natural biopolymers, extracellular matrix materials and native architecture intact. This manuscript describes heart orientation as important in optimizing decellularization efficiency and maintaining extracellular matrix integrity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess flow dynamics in a whole heart throughout the decellularization procedure.

In the three patients with CMVSD, one underwent successful endovascular device closure following a prior failed attempt at transcatheter closure, and the other two underwent successful primary surgical closure with the aid of 3D models. In all three cases of DORV, the models provided better anatomic delineation and additional information that altered or confirmed the surgical plan.

The distances measured were the intercanine width, the intermolar width, and the dental arch length. Sixty-four scans were taken with each of the desktop scanners R900 and R700 (3Shape), the intraoral scanner TRIOS Color Pod (3Shape), and the Promax 3D Mid cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) unit (Planmeca). All scans were measured with measuring software. One scan was selected and printed 37 times on the D35 stereolithographic 3D printer (Innovation MediTech). The printed models were measured again using the coordinate measuring instrument.\nThe most accurate results were obtained by the R900. The R700 and the TRIOS intraoral scanner showed comparable results. CBCT-3D-rendering with the Promax 3D Mid CBCT unit revealed significantly higher accuracy with regard to dental casts than dental impressions. 3D printing offered a significantly higher level of deviation than digitalization with desktop scanners or an intraoral scanner. The chairside time required for digital impressions was 27% longer than for conventional impressions.\nConventional impressions, model casting, and optional digitization with desktop scanners remains the recommended workflow process. For orthodontic demands, intraoral scanners are a useful alternative for full-arch scans. For prosthodontic use, the scanning scope should be less than one quadrant and three additional teeth.", "journal": "Quintessence international (Berlin, Germany : 1985)", "date": "2016-11-12", "authors": ["ChristianWesemann", "JonasMuallah", "JamesMah", "AxelBumann"], "doi": "10.3290/j.qi.a37130"}

There is a substantial demand for in vitro organ phantoms, especially in urological surgery. Animal models and existing simulator systems poorly mimic the detailed morphology and the physical properties of human organs. In this paper, we report a novel fabrication process to make a human kidney phantom with realistic anatomical structures and physical properties. The detailed anatomical structure was directly acquired from high resolution CT data sets of human cadaveric kidneys. The soft phantoms were constructed using a novel technique that combines 3D wax printing and polymer molding. Anatomical details and material properties of the phantoms were validated in detail by CT scan, ultrasound, and endoscopy. CT reconstruction, ultrasound examination, and endoscopy showed that the designed phantom mimics a real kidney's detailed anatomy and correctly corresponds to the targeted human cadaver's upper urinary tract. Soft materials with a tensile modulus of 0.8-1.5\u00a0MPa as well as biocompatible hydrogels were used to mimic human kidney tissues.

{"title": "Modifying the strength and strain concentration profile within collagen scaffolds using customizable arrays of poly-lactic acid fibers.", "abstract": "The tendon-to-bone junction is a highly specialized tissue which dissipates stress concentrations between mechanically dissimilar tendon and bone. Upon injury, the local heterogeneities across this insertion are not regenerated, leading to poor functional outcomes such as formation of scar tissue at the insertion and re-failure rates exceeding 90%. Although current tissue engineering methods are moving towards the development of spatially-graded biomaterials to begin to address these injuries, significant opportunities remain to engineer the often complex local mechanical behavior of such biomaterials to enhance their bioactivity. Here, we describe the use of three-dimensional printing techniques to create customizable arrays of poly-lactic acid (PLA) fibers that can be incorporated into a collagen scaffold under development for tendon bone junction repair. Notably, we use additive manufacturing concepts to generate arrays of spatially-graded fibers from biodegradable PLA that are incorporated into collagen scaffolds to create a collagen-PLA composite. We demonstrate the ability to tune the mechanical performance of the fiber-scaffold composite at the bulk scale. We also demonstrate the incorporation of spatially-heterogeneous fiber designs to establish non-uniform local mechanical performance of the composite biomaterial under tensile load, a critical element in the design of multi-compartment biomaterials for tendon-to-bone regeneration applications.

In this paper, we studied the effects of tissue regeneration on the static and fatigue behavior of selective laser melted porous titanium structures with three different porosities (i.e. 77, 81, and 85%). The porous structures were filled with four different polymeric materials with mechanical properties in the range of those observed for de novo bone (0.7GPa<E<1.5GPa) to simulate bone tissue regeneration into their pores. The static mechanical properties and fatigue behavior (S-N curves) of as-manufactured and filled porous structures were then determined. The static mechanical properties and fatigue life (including endurance limit) of the porous structures were found to increase by factors 2-7, even when they were filled with polymeric materials with relatively low mechanical properties. The relative increase in the mechanical properties was much higher for the porous structures with lower porosities. Moreover, the increase in the fatigue life was more notable as compared to the increase in the static mechanical properties. Such large values of increase in the mechanical properties with the progress of bone tissue regeneration have implications in terms of mechanical stimulus for bone tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2016-11-05", "authors": ["RHedayati", "SJanbaz", "MSadighi", "MMohammadi-Aghdam", "A AZadpoor"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.10.003"}

The main drivers for this growth are easing the workflow of dentists and increasing the comfort of patients. Therefore, remarkable research projects have been conducted and are currently underway to develop improved or new dental materials with enhanced properties or that can be processed using advanced technologies, such as CAD/CAM or 3D printing. Among these materials, zirconia, glass or polymer-infiltrated ceramics, and glass-ceramics (GCs) are of great importance. Dental glass-ceramics are highly attractive because they are easy to process and have outstanding esthetics, translucency, low thermal conductivity, high strength, chemical durability, biocompatibility, wear resistance, and hardness similar to that of natural teeth, and, in certain cases, these materials are bioactive. In this review article, we divide dental GCs into the following two groups: restorative and bioactive. Most restorative dental glass-ceramics (RDGCs) are inert and biocompatible and are used in the restoration and reconstruction of teeth. Bioactive dental glass-ceramics (BDGCs) display bone-bonding ability and stimulate positive biological reactions at the material/tissue interface. BDGCs are suggested for dentin hypersensitivity treatment, implant coating, bone regeneration and periodontal therapy. Throughout this paper, we elaborate on the history, processing, properties and applications of RDGCs and BDGCs.

{"title": "Multi and mixed 3D-printing of graphene-hydroxyapatite hybrid materials for complex tissue engineering.", "abstract": "With the emergence of three-dimensional (3D)-printing (3DP) as a vital tool in tissue engineering and medicine, there is an ever growing need to develop new biomaterials that can be 3D-printed and also emulate the compositional, structural, and functional complexities of human tissues and organs. In this work, we probe the 3D-printable biomaterials spectrum by combining two recently established functional 3D-printable particle-laden biomaterial inks: one that contains hydroxyapatite microspheres (hyperelastic bone, HB) and another that contains graphene nanoflakes (3D-graphene, 3DG). We demonstrate that not only can these distinct, osteogenic, and neurogenic inks be co-3D-printed to create complex, multimaterial constructs, but that composite inks of HB and 3DG can also be synthesized. Specifically, the printability, microstructural, mechanical, electrical, and biological properties of a hybrid material comprised of 1:1 HA:graphene by volume is investigated. The resulting HB-3DG hybrid exhibits mixed characteristics of the two distinct systems, while maintaining 3D-printability, electrical conductivity, and flexibility. In vitro assessment of HB-3DG using mesenchymal stem cells demonstrates the hybrid material supports cell viability and proliferation, as well as significantly upregulates both osteogenic and neurogenic gene expression over 14 days. This work ultimately demonstrates a significant step forward towards being able to 3D-print graded, multicompositional, and multifunctional constructs from hybrid inks for complex composite tissue engineering. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We measured the in-vivo skin doses while both conventional and 3D-printed boluses were placed on the chest wall and compared the mean doses delivered to the ipsilateral lung and the heart. The homogeneity and conformity of the dose distribution in the chest wall for both types of boluses were also evaluated. The uniformity index on the chest skin was improved when the 3D-printed boluses were used, with the overall average skin dose being closer to the prescribed one in the former case (-0.47% versus -4.43%). On comparing the dose-volume histogram (DVH), it was found that the 3D-printed boluses resulted in a reduction in the mean dose to the ipsilateral lung by up to 20%. The precision of dose delivery was improved by 3% with the 3D-printed boluses; in contrast, the conventional step bolus resulted in a precision level of 5%. In conclusion, the use of the 3D-printed boluses resulted in better dose homogeneity and conformity to the chest wall as well as the sparing of the normal organs, especially the lung. This suggested that their routine use on the chest wall as a therapeutic approach during post-mastectomy radiation therapy offers numerous advantages over conventional step boluses.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-10-27", "authors": ["KwangwooPark", "SungjinPark", "Mi-JinJeon", "JinhyunChoi", "Jun WonKim", "Yoon JinCho", "Won-SeokJang", "Yo SupKeum", "Ik JaeLee"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.12829"}

{"title": "Resorbable bone fixation alloys, forming, and post-fabrication treatments.", "abstract": "Metallic alloys have been introduced as biodegradable metals for various biomedical applications over the last decade owing to their gradual corrosion in the body, biocompatibility and superior strength compared to biodegradable polymers. Mg alloys possess advantageous properties that make them the most extensively studied biodegradable metallic material for orthopedic applications such as their low density, modulus of elasticity, close to that of the bone, and resorbability. Early resorption (i.e., <3months) and relatively inadequate strength are the main challenges that hinder the use of Mg alloys for bone fixation applications. The development of resorbable Mg-based bone fixation hardware with superior mechanical and corrosion performance requires a thorough understanding of the physical and mechanical properties of Mg alloys. This paper discusses the characteristics of successful Mg-based skeletal fixation hardware and the possible ways to improve its properties using different methods such as mechanical and heat treatment processes. We also review the most recent work pertaining to Mg alloys and surface coatings.

While addressing such twin requirements, the present study demonstrates a low temperature additive manufacturing based processing strategy to fabricate Ti-6Al-4V scaffolds with designed porosity using inkjet-based 3D powder printing (3DPP). A novel starch-based aqueous binder was prepared and the physico-chemical parameters such as pH, viscosity, and surface tension were optimized for drop-on-demand (DOD) based thermal inkjet printing. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) of sintered scaffolds revealed a 57% total porosity in homogeneously porous scaffold and 45% in the gradient porous scaffold with 99% interconnectivity among the micropores. Under uniaxial compression testing, the strength of homogeneously porous and gradient porous scaffolds were ~47MPa and ~90MPa, respectively. The progressive failure in homogeneously porous scaffold was recorded. In parallel to experimental measurements, finite element (FE) analyses have been performed to study the stress distribution globally and also locally around the designed pores. Consistent with FE analyses, a higher elastic modulus was recorded with gradient porous scaffolds (~3GPa) than the homogenously porous scaffolds (~2GPa). While comparing with the existing literature reports, the present work, for the first time, establishes 'direct powder printing methodology' of Ti-6Al-4V porous scaffolds with biomedically relevant microstructural and mechanical properties. Also, a new FE analysis approach, based on the critical understanding of the porous architecture using micro-CT results, is presented to realistically predict the compression response of porous scaffolds.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

Measured frequency response and operating performance of the welder under no load is used to identify model parameters. Using this model and in-situ measurements, shear force and welder efficiency are estimated to be near 2000N and 80% when welding Al 6061-H18 weld foil, respectively.

High-quality simulation education relies on the availability, accessibility, and reliability of models. The objective of this work was to describe a practical pediatric laryngeal model for use in otolaryngology residency training. Ideally, this model would be low-cost, have tactile properties resembling human tissue, and be reliably reproducible.\nPediatric laryngeal models were developed using two manufacturing methods: direct three-dimensional (3D) printing of anatomical models and casted anatomical models using 3D-printed molds. Polylactic acid, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) were used for the directly printed models, whereas a silicone elastomer (SE) was used for the casted models.\nThe models were evaluated for anatomic quality, ease of manipulation, hardness, and cost of production. A tissue likeness scale was created to validate the simulation model. Fleiss' Kappa rating was performed to evaluate interrater agreement, and analysis of variance was performed to evaluate differences among the materials.\nThe SE provided the most anatomically accurate models, with the tactile properties allowing for surgical manipulation of the larynx. Direct 3D printing was more cost-effective than the SE casting method but did not possess the material properties and tissue likeness necessary for surgical simulation.\nThe SE models of the pediatric larynx created from a casting method demonstrated high quality anatomy, tactile properties comparable to human tissue, and easy manipulation with standard surgical instruments.

Four medical engineers manually thresholded the bony structures on all CT images. The lowest and highest selected mean threshold values and the default threshold value were used to generate skull STL models. Geometric variations between all manually thresholded STL models were calculated. Furthermore, in order to calculate the accuracy of the manually and default thresholded STL models, all STL models were superimposed on an optical scan of the dry female and male skulls (\"gold standard\").\nThe intra- and inter-observer variability of the manual threshold selection was good (intra-class correlation coefficients >0.9). All engineers selected grey values closer to soft tissue to compensate for bone voids. Geometric variations between the manually thresholded STL models were 0.13 mm (multi-detector row CT), 0.59 mm (dual-energy CT), and 0.55 mm (cone-beam CT).

{"title": "Improving the fatigue performance of porous metallic biomaterials produced by Selective Laser Melting.", "abstract": "This paper provides new insights into the fatigue properties of porous metallic biomaterials produced by additive manufacturing. Cylindrical porous samples with diamond unit cells were produced from Ti6Al4V powder using Selective Laser Melting (SLM). After measuring all morphological and quasi-static properties, compression-compression fatigue tests were performed to determine fatigue strength and to identify important fatigue influencing factors. In a next step, post-SLM treatments were used to improve the fatigue life of these biomaterials by changing the microstructure and by reducing stress concentrators and surface roughness. In particular, the influence of stress relieving, hot isostatic pressing and chemical etching was studied. Analytical and numerical techniques were developed to calculate the maximum local tensile stress in the struts as function of the strut diameter and load. With this method, the variability in the relative density between all samples was taken into account. The local stress in the struts was then used to quantify the exact influence of the applied post-SLM treatments on the fatigue life. A significant improvement of the fatigue life was achieved. Also, the post-SLM treatments, procedures and calculation methods can be applied to different types of porous metallic structures and hence this paper provides useful tools for improving fatigue performance of metallic biomaterials.\nAdditive Manufacturing (AM) techniques such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) are increasingly being used for producing customized porous metallic biomaterials. These biomaterials are regularly used for biomedical implants and hence a long lifetime is required. In this paper, a set of post-built surface and heat treatments is presented that can be used to significantly improve the fatigue life of porous SLM-Ti6Al4V samples.

Multicellular aggregates made out of at least two cell types from fibroblast, endothelial and smooth muscle cells are prepared and optimized. A novel bioprinting approach is proposed in order to continuously extrude cylindrical multicellular aggregates through the bioprinter's glass microcapillaries. The multicellular aggregates are first aspirated into a capillary and then compressed to form a continuous cylindrical multicellular bioink. To overcome surface tension-driven droplet formation, the required compression ratio is calculated. Based on the developed bioprinting strategies, multicellular aggregates and their support structures are bioprinted to form 3D tissue constructs with predefined shapes. The effect of the bioprinting process was examined for fusion, cell viability at different compression ratios, and f-actin cytoskeletal organization.

CHD represent an attractive field for the application of 3D printed models, with consistent progress made in the past decade. Current 3D models are able to reproduce complex cardiac and extra-cardiac anatomy including small details with very limited range of errors (<1\u00a0mm), so this tool could be of value in the planning of surgical or percutaneous treatments for selected cases of CHD. However, the steps involved in the building of 3D models, consisting of image acquisition and selection, segmentation, and printing are highly operator dependent. Current 3D models may be rigid or flexible, but unable to reproduce the physiologic variations during the cardiac cycle. Furthermore, high costs and long average segmentation and printing times (18-24\u00a0h) limit a more extensive use. There is a need for better standardization of the procedure employed for collection of the images, the segmentation methods and processes, the phase of cardiac cycle used, and in the materials employed for printing.

{"title": "Fully porous 3D printed titanium femoral stem to reduce stress-shielding following total hip arthroplasty.", "abstract": "Current hip replacement femoral implants are made of fully solid materials which all have stiffness considerably higher than that of bone. This mechanical mismatch can cause significant bone resorption secondary to stress shielding, which can lead to serious complications such as peri-prosthetic fracture during or after revision surgery. In this work, a high strength fully porous material with tunable mechanical properties is introduced for use in hip replacement design. The implant macro geometry is based off of a short stem taper-wedge implant compatible with minimally invasive hip replacement surgery. The implant micro-architecture is fine-tuned to locally mimic bone tissue properties which results in minimum bone resorption secondary to stress shielding. We present a systematic approach for the design of a 3D printed fully porous hip implant that encompasses the whole activity spectrum of implant development, from concept generation, multiscale mechanics of porous materials, material architecture tailoring, to additive manufacturing, and performance assessment via in vitro experiments in composite femurs. We show that the fully porous implant with an optimized material micro-structure can reduce the amount of bone loss secondary to stress shielding by 75% compared to a fully solid implant. This result also agrees with those of the in vitro quasi-physiological experimental model and the corresponding finite element model for both the optimized fully porous and fully solid implant. These studies demonstrate the merit and the potential of tuning material architecture to achieve a substantial reduction of bone resorption secondary to stress shielding. \u00a9 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Research on material for use in additive manufacturing is ongoing, and a wide variety of materials are being used or developed for use in dentistry. Some materials, however, such as cobalt chromium, still lack sufficient research to allow definite conclusions about the suitability of their use in clinical dental practice. Despite this, due to the wide variety of machines that use additive manufacturing, there is much more flexibility in the build material and geometry when building structures compared with subtractive manufacturing. Overall additive manufacturing produces little material waste and is energy efficient when compared to subtractive manufacturing, due to passivity and the additive layering nature of the build process. Such features make the technique suitable to be used with fabricating structures out of hard to handle materials such as cobalt chromium.

{"title": "Finite Element Model and Validation of Nasal Tip Deformation.", "abstract": "Nasal tip mechanical stability is important for functional and cosmetic nasal airway surgery. Palpation of the nasal tip provides information on tip strength to the surgeon, though it is a purely subjective assessment. Providing a means to simulate nasal tip deformation with a validated model can offer a more objective approach in understanding the mechanics and nuances of the nasal tip support and eventual nasal mechanics as a whole. Herein we present validation of a finite element (FE) model of the nose using physical measurements recorded using an ABS plastic-silicone nasal phantom. Three-dimensional photogrammetry was used to capture the geometry of the phantom at rest and while under steady state load. The silicone used to make the phantom was mechanically tested and characterized using a linear elastic constitutive model. Surface point clouds of the silicone and FE model were compared for both the loaded and unloaded state. The average Hausdorff\u00a0distance between actual measurements and FE simulations across the nose were 0.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.04\u00a0mm and deviated up to 2\u00a0mm at the outermost boundaries of the model.

Results showed that, in the hybrid construct, the cell population in the collagen component dropped by day 7 but then increased by day 14. Also, cells migrated onto the struts of the scaffold component, proliferated over time, and formed networks on the thinner struts (i.e., 200\u00b5m). Also, the thinner struts resulted in formation of long linear cellular cords structures within the pores. Finite element simulation demonstrated principal stress patterns similar to the observed cell-network pattern. It is probable that the scaffold component modulated patterns of principal stresses in the collagen component as biomechanical cues for reorganization of cell network patterns. Also, the scaffold component significantly improved the mechanical integrity of hydrogel component in the hybrid construct for weight-bearing applications.

A three-dimensional finite element model (3D FEM) of the TTA system was first created to evaluate the mechanical environment at cage domain during different stages of the dog walk. The cage microstructure was then optimized using a topology optimization tool, which addresses the accessed local mechanical requirements, and at same time ensures the maximum permeability to allow nutrient and oxygen supply to the implant core. The designed cage was then biofabricated by a 3D powder printing of tricalcium phosphate cement. This work demonstrates that the combination of a 3D FEM with a topology optimization approach enabled the design of a novel cage for TTA application with tailored permeability and mechanical properties, that can be successfully 3D printed in a biodegradable bioceramic material.

{"title": "Retrospective 4D MR image construction from free-breathing slice Acquisitions: A novel graph-based approach.", "abstract": "Dynamic or 4D imaging of the thorax has many applications. Both prospective and retrospective respiratory gating and tracking techniques have been developed for 4D imaging via CT and MRI. For pediatric imaging, due to radiation concerns, MRI becomes the de facto modality of choice. In thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS), patients often suffer from extreme malformations of the chest wall, diaphragm, and/or spine with inability of the thorax to support normal respiration or lung growth (Campbell et\u00a0al., 2003, Campbell and Smith, 2007), as such patient cooperation needed by some of the gating and tracking techniques are difficult to realize without causing patient discomfort and interference with the breathing mechanism itself. Therefore (ventilator-supported) free-breathing MRI acquisition is currently the best choice for imaging these patients. This, however, raises a question of how to create a consistent 4D image from such acquisitions. This paper presents a novel graph-based technique for compiling the best 4D image volume representing the thorax over one respiratory cycle from slice images acquired during unencumbered natural tidal-breathing of pediatric TIS patients.\nIn our approach, for each coronal (or sagittal) slice position, images are acquired at a rate of about 200-300ms/slice over several natural breathing cycles which yields over 2000 slices. A weighted graph is formed where each acquired slice constitutes a node and the weight of the arc between two nodes defines the degree of contiguity in space and time of the two slices. For each respiratory phase, an optimal 3D spatial image is constructed by finding the best path in the graph in the spatial direction. The set of all such 3D images for a given respiratory cycle constitutes a 4D image. Subsequently, the best 4D image among all such constructed images is found over all imaged respiratory cycles. Two types of evaluation studies are carried out to understand the behavior of this algorithm and in comparison to a method called Random Stacking - a 4D phantom study and 10 4D MRI acquisitions from TIS patients and normal subjects. The 4D phantom was constructed by 3D printing the pleural spaces of an adult thorax, which were segmented in a breath-held MRI acquisition.\nQualitative visual inspection via cine display of the slices in space and time and in 3D rendered form showed smooth variation for all data sets constructed by the proposed method. Quantitative evaluation was carried out to measure spatial and temporal contiguity of the slices via segmented pleural spaces. The optimal method showed smooth variation of the pleural space as compared to Random Stacking whose behavior was erratic. The volumes of the pleural spaces at the respiratory phase corresponding to end inspiration and end expiration were compared to volumes obtained from breath-hold acquisitions at roughly the same phase. The mean difference was found to be roughly 3%.\nThe proposed method is purely image-based and post-hoc and does not need breath holding or external surrogates or instruments to record respiratory motion or tidal volume. This is important and practically warranted for pediatric patients. The constructed 4D images portray spatial and temporal smoothness that should be expected in a consistent 4D volume.

Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has been used to mimic tissues and organs suitable for transplantation, but applications for the liver have been rare.\nA 3D bioprinting system was used to construct 3D printed hepatic structures using alginate. HepG2 cells were cultured on these 3D structures for 3 weeks and examined by fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry.

Each end of an ex vivo trachea was sealed with a custom-designed and 3D-printed cap; a transducer was placed through one end to measure the pressure inside the trachea. Although the negative pressure was applied to the tracheal lumen, the tracheal wall collapse was measured externally and internally using a bronchoscope. Each group had at least three recorded trials. Tracheal diameter was evaluated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and was averaged between two raters.\nAverage tracheal occlusion percentage was compared using Student t test. The average occlusion was 31% for group 1, 87.4% for group 2, and 20% for group 3. Significant differences were found between the control and tracheomalacia groups (P < 0.01) and the tracheomalacia and splinted tracheomalacia groups (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between the control and splinted tracheomalacia groups (P = 0.13). Applied pressure was plotted against occlusion and regression line slope differed between the tracheomalacia (0.91) and control (0.12) or splinted tracheomalacia (0.39) groups.\nWe demonstrate the potential for an ex vivo tracheomalacia model to reproduce airway collapse and show that this collapse can be treated successfully with a 3D-printed external splint.

The influence of this new biofabrication technology on biology of living cells, however, is still being evaluated. Recently we have identified a mitogenic hydrogel system based on alginate sulfate which potently supports chondrocyte phenotype, but is not printable due to its rheological properties (no yield point). To convert alginate sulfate to a printable bioink, it was combined with nanocellulose, which has been shown to possess very good printability. The alginate sulfate/nanocellulose ink showed good printing properties and the non-printed bioink material promoted cell spreading, proliferation, and collagen II synthesis by the encapsulated cells. When the bioink was printed, the biological performance of the cells was highly dependent on the nozzle geometry. Cell spreading properties were maintained with the lowest extrusion pressure and shear stress.

Nevertheless, printed models of soft tissue organs are still challenging to reproduce. This study adopts open source packages and a low-cost desktop 3D printer to convert multiple modalities of medical images to digital resources (volume rendering images and digital models) and lifelike printed models, which are useful to enhance our understanding of the geometric structure and complex spatial nature of anatomical organs.\nNeuroimaging technologies such as CT, CTA, MRI, and TOF-MRA collect serial medical images. The procedures for producing digital resources can be divided into volume rendering and medical image reconstruction. To verify the accuracy of reconstruction, this study presents qualitative and quantitative assessments. Subsequently, digital models are archived as stereolithography format files and imported to the bundled software of the 3D printer. The printed models are produced using polylactide filament materials.\nWe have successfully converted multiple modalities of medical images to digital resources and printed models for both hard organs (cranial base and tooth) and soft tissue organs (brain, blood vessels of the brain, the heart chambers and vessel lumen, and pituitary tumor). Multiple digital resources and printed models were provided to illustrate the anatomical relationship between organs and complicated surrounding structures. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is a powerful tool to produce lifelike and tangible models.\nWe present an available and cost-effective method for producing both digital resources and printed models.

{"title": "Conferring biological activity to native spider silk: A biofunctionalized protein-based microfiber.", "abstract": "Spider silk is an extraordinary material with physical properties comparable to the best scaffolding/structural materials, and as a fiber it can be manipulated with ease into a variety of configurations. Our work here demonstrates that natural spider silk fibers can also be used to organize biological components on and in devices through rapid and simple means. Micron scale spider silk fibers (5-10\u2009\u03bcm in diameter) were surface modified with a variety of biological entities engineered with pentaglutamine tags via microbial transglutaminase (mTG). Enzymes, enzyme pathways, antibodies, and fluorescent proteins were all assembled onto spider silk fibers using this biomolecular engineering/biofabrication process. Additionally, arrangement of biofunctionalized fiber should in of itself generate a secondary level of biomolecular organization. Toward this end, as proofs of principle, spatially defined arrangement of biofunctionalized spider silk fiber was shown to generate effects specific to silk position in two cases. In one instance, arrangement perpendicular to a flow produced selective head and neck carcinoma cell capture on silk with antibodies complexed to conjugated protein G. In a second scenario, asymmetric bacterial chemotaxis arose from asymmetric conjugation of enzymes to arranged silk. Overall, the biofabrication processes used here were rapid, required no complex chemistries, were biologically benign, and also the resulting engineered silk microfibers were flexible, readily manipulated and functionally active. Deployed here in microfluidic environments, biofunctional spider silk fiber provides a means to convey complex biological functions over a range of scales, further extending its potential as a biomaterial in biotechnological settings.

Two key aspects of the applied changes are the integration of up-to-date teaching methods and the promotion of interdisciplinarity. To support these efforts, an approach to fabricating individualised simulation models for hands-on courses employing 3D printing is presented. The models are based on real patients, thus providing students a more realistic preparation for real clinical situations. As a wide variety of dental procedures can be implemented, the simulation models can also contribute to a more interdisciplinary dental education. The data used for the construction of the models were acquired by 3D surface scanning. The data were further processed with 3D modelling software. Afterwards, the models were fabricated by 3D printing with the PolyJet technique. Three models serve as examples: a prosthodontic model for training veneer preparation, a conservative model for practicing dental bonding and an interdisciplinary model featuring carious teeth and an insufficient crown. The third model was evaluated in a hands-on course with 22 fourth-year dental students. The students answered a questionnaire and gave their personal opinion. Whilst the concept of the model received very positive feedback, some aspects of the implementation were criticised.

Today, the surgical planning is based mainly on visual judgment and the individual skills and experience of the surgeons.

These standard meshes were transformed with defined mesh modifications toward each individual mandible surface to allow for further statistical evaluations. The data were used to capture the inter-individual shape variations that were considered as random field variations and mathematically evaluated with principal component analysis. With this information of the mandibular shape variations, an algorithm was developed that proposes shapes for reconstruction planning based on given residual mandible geometry parts.\nThe accuracy of the novel method was evaluated on six different virtually defined continuity defects that were each created on three mandibles that were not part of the initial database. Virtual reconstructions showed sufficient accuracy of the algorithm for the planning of surgical reconstructions, with average deviations toward the actual geometry of [Formula: see text]\u00a0mm for small missing parts and 5\u00a0mm for large hemi-lateral defects.\nThe presented algorithm may be a valuable tool for the planning of mandibular reconstructions.

Versatile printing technologies such as extrusion-based 3D plotting allow in addition the incorporation of biological components increasing the capability to restore functional tissues. We have recently described the fabrication of calcium phosphate cement (CPC) scaffolds by 3D plotting of an oil-based CPC paste under mild conditions. In the present study, we have developed a strategy for growth factor loading based on multichannel plotting: a biphasic scaffold design was realised combining CPC with VEGF-laden, highly concentrated hydrogel strands. As hydrogel component, alginate and an alginate-gellan gum blend were evaluated; the blend exhibited a more favourable VEGF release profile and was chosen for biphasic scaffold fabrication. After plotting, two-step post-processing was performed for both, hydrogel crosslinking and CPC setting, which was shown to be compatible with both materials. Finally, a scaffold was designed and fabricated which can be applied for testing in a rat critical size femur defect. Optimization of CPC plotting enabled the fabrication of highly resolved structures with strand diameters of only 200\u00a0\u00b5m. Micro-computed tomography revealed a precise strand arrangement and an interconnected pore space within the biphasic scaffold even in swollen state of the hydrogel strands.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2016-07-08", "authors": ["TilmanAhlfeld", "Ashwini RahulAkkineni", "YvonneF\u00f6rster", "TinoK\u00f6hler", "SvenKnaack", "MichaelGelinsky", "AnjaLode"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-016-1685-4"}

{"title": "A tunable hydrogel system for long-term release of cell-secreted cytokines and bioprinted in situ wound cell delivery.", "abstract": "For many cellular therapies being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials, the mechanisms behind their therapeutic effects appear to be the secretion of growth factors and cytokines, also known as paracrine activity. Often, delivered cells are transient, and half-lives of the growth factors that they secrete are short, limiting their long-term effectiveness. The goal of this study was to optimize a hydrogel system capable of in situ cell delivery that could sequester and release growth factors secreted from those cells after the cells were no longer present. Here, we demonstrate the use of a fast photocross-linkable heparin-conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA-HP) hydrogel as a cell delivery vehicle for sustained growth factor release, which extends paracrine activity. The hydrogel could be modulated through cross-linking geometries and heparinization to support sustained release proteins and heparin-binding growth factors. To test the hydrogel in vivo, we used it to deliver amniotic fluid-derived stem (AFS) cells, which are known to secrete cytokines and growth factors, in full thickness skin wounds in a nu/nu murine model. Despite transience of the AFS cells in vivo, the HA-HP hydrogel with AFS cells improved wound closure and reepithelialization and increased vascularization and production of extracellular matrix in vivo. These results suggest that HA-HP hydrogel has the potential to prolong the paracrine activity of cells, thereby increasing their therapeutic effectiveness in wound healing. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our aim with this investigation was to combine the technologies of high-spatial resolution cardiac imaging, image processing software, and fused multi-material 3D printing, to demonstrate that patient-specific models of the mitral valve apparatus could be created to facilitate functional evaluation of novel trans-catheter mitral valve repair strategies. Clinical 3D transesophageal echocardiography and computed tomography images were acquired for three patients being evaluated for a catheter-based mitral valve repair. Target anatomies were identified, segmented and reconstructed into 3D patient-specific digital models. For each patient, the mitral valve apparatus was digitally reconstructed from a single or fused imaging data set. Using multi-material 3D printing methods, patient-specific anatomic replicas of the mitral valve were created. 3D print materials were selected based on the mechanical testing of elastomeric TangoPlus materials (Stratasys, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA) and were compared to freshly harvested porcine leaflet tissue. The effective bending modulus of healthy porcine MV tissue was significantly less than the bending modulus of TangoPlus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). All TangoPlus varieties were less stiff than the maximum tensile elastic modulus of mitral valve tissue (3697.2 \u00b1 385.8\u00a0kPa anterior leaflet; 2582.1 \u00b1 374.2\u00a0kPa posterior leaflet) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

This paper focuses on Selective Laser Melting of porous microarchitecture and proposes a compensation scheme that reduces the morphology mismatch between as-designed and as-manufactured geometry, in particular that of the pore. A spider web analog is introduced, built out of Ti-6Al-4V powder via SLM, and morphologically characterized. Results from error analysis of strut thickness are used to generate thickness compensation relations expressed as a function of the angle each strut formed with the build plane. The scheme is applied to fabricate a set of three-dimensional porous biomaterials, which are morphologically and mechanically characterized via micro Computed Tomography, mechanically tested and numerically analyzed. For strut thickness, the results show the largest mismatch (60% from the design) occurring for horizontal members, reduces to 3.1% upon application of the compensation.

In addition, 3D bioprinting by stereolithography allows fabrication of internal pores and defined macroscopic shapes. In this study, we formulated a hybrid biocompatible resin using natural and synthetic polymers (chitosan and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), respectively) by controlling molecular weight of chitosan, feed-ratios, and photo-initiator concentration. Ear-shaped, hybrid scaffolds were fabricated by a stereolithographic method using a 405\u00a0nm laser. Hybrid hydrogel scaffolds of chitosan (50-190\u00a0kDa) and PEGDA (575\u00a0Da) were mixed at varying feed-ratios. Some of the cationic, amino groups of chitosan were neutralized by dialysis in acidic solution containing chitosan in excess of sodium acetate solution to inhibit quenching of newly formed photoradicals. A feed-ratio of 1:7.5 was found to be the most appropriate of the formulations considered in this study in terms of mechanical properties, cell adhesion, and printability. The biofabricated hybrid scaffold showed interconnected, homogeneous pores with a nominal pore size of 50\u00a0\u00b5m and an elastic modulus of\u00a0~400\u00a0kPa. Moreover, long-term cell viability and cell spreading was observed via actin filament staining. Printability of the biocompatible resin was confirmed by printing thresholded MR images of an ear and the feed ratio of 1:7.5 provided the most faithful reproduction of the shape.

An activity index that compared extent of daily activity with tissue formation showed differences in the extent and quality of new tissue with the most active animal having the most new tissue formation. Shear loads were highest early and decreased with time indicating that cartilage tissue formation begins while tissues experience high shear loads and continues as the loads decrease toward normal physiological levels. Scaffolds with biomimetic support pegs facilitated the most rapid bone ingrowth and were noted to have more cartilage formation with better quality cartilage as measured using both indentation testing and histology.

However, certain limitations have also arisen, primarily associated with the available, rather limited range of materials suitable for processing. To overcome these limitations, several research groups have been exploring novel methodologies through which a construct, generated via SFF, is applied as a sacrificial mould for production of the final construct. The technique combines the benefits of SFF techniques in terms of controlled, patient-specific design with a large freedom in material selection associated with conventional scaffold production techniques. Consequently, well-defined 3D scaffolds can be generated in a straightforward manner from previously difficult to print and even \"unprintable\" materials due to thermomechanical properties that do not match the often strict temperature and pressure requirements for direct rapid prototyping. These include several biomaterials, thermally degradable materials, ceramics and composites. Since it can be combined with conventional pore forming techniques, indirect rapid prototyping (iRP) enables the creation of a hierarchical porosity in the final scaffold with micropores inside the struts. Consequently, scaffolds and implants for applications in both soft and hard tissue regeneration have been reported.

{"title": "Modular Tissue Assembly Strategies for Biofabrication of Engineered Cartilage.", "abstract": "This review describes the prospects of applying modular assembly techniques and strategies for fabrication of advanced tissue engineered cartilage constructs. Articular cartilage is a tissue that has important functions in preserving and enabling locomotion. However, its limited intrinsic repair capacity and lack of current long-term clinical solutions makes it a candidate for repair or regeneration via tissue engineering strategies. Key advances in biofabrication and 3D bioprinting techniques allowing the specific placement of cells and tissues enable novel strategies to be adopted with increased chances of success. In particular, modular assembly, where separate biological components such as microtissue units, cellular building blocks or spheroids are combined with structural scaffold components to create a functional whole, offers potential as a new strategy for engineering of articular cartilage. Various modular assembly or bottom-up fabrication strategies have been investigated or applied for engineering of a range of tissues and cell types, however, modular approaches to cartilage engineering have been limited thus far. The integrative nature of many current approaches to engineering of articular cartilage means optimization of separate components (such as the scaffold and cells) is challenging, resulting in strategies which are less amenable to clinical scale-up or modification. In addition, current tissue engineering strategies may not replicate the function and complex structure of native tissue. This review outlines recent developments in fabrication of cellular or tissue modules as well as scaffold design where it impacts modular biofabrication, and discusses existing modular approaches applicable to articular cartilage regeneration and repair. Modular tissue assembly approaches allow complex hybrid constructs to be fabricated with direct control over both structural and cellular organization of pre-formed tissue units.

Computer-aided design (CAD) models were designed in the form of a triangular prism with a height of 15\u00a0mm and with varying angles of 60\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 20\u00b0, 10\u00b0, and 5\u00b0. From the CAD designs, additive manufacturing (AM) models were printed in three different directions by each of the three printers. To investigate the global fidelity of the 3D printers, the height and surface outlines of the AM model cross sections were measured. The fidelity of the AM models with increasingly acute angles was not accurately reproduced when 3D printed, and the surface outlines of the AM model cross sections were different in each direction of printing for each device. Printing technology and printing direction need to be considered if accurate reproduction of acute angles in fine AM structures in medical models is a necessity.", "journal": "Odontology", "date": "2016-03-21", "authors": ["YoshiakiIde", "SureshNayar", "HeatherLogan", "BrendanGallagher", "JohanWolfaardt"], "doi": "10.1007/s10266-016-0239-4"}

The 3D data of this cadaver were imported in specialized software and used to analyse the region of a missing tooth. Based on the functional and anatomical parameters, an individual implant with congruent surgical tooling and surgical guided template was designed and 3D-printed. The guided osteotomy was performed, and the custom implant inserted. To evaluate the planned implant position in comparison with the placed implant position, the mandible with implant was scanned again with the CBCT system and software matching was applied to measure the accuracy of the procedure.\nThe angular deflection with the planned implant position was 0.40\u00b0. When comparing the 3D positions of the shoulder, there is a deviation of 0.72\u00a0mm resulting in an apical deviation of 0.72\u00a0mm.\nWith the use of currently available technology, it is very well feasible to create in a virtual simulation a custom implant with congruent custom surgical tooling and to transfer this to a clinical setting.

To achieve this goal, nine types of water-based binder solutions were prepared with 10, 12.5, and 15 wt % GLY liquid-binding agent, mixed, respectively, with 0, 0.75, and 1.5 wt % ethylene glycol diacetate (EGD) flow enhancer. The print quality of each of the solutions was established quantitatively using an image processing algorithm. The print quality analysis narrowed down the solutions to three batches containing 1.5 wt % EGD and variable amount of GLY. These solutions were used to manufacture porous CPP bone substitute samples, which were characterized physically to determine shrinkage, porosity, microstructure, and compression strength. The 12.5 wt % GLY, 1.5 wt % EGD solution resulted in the highest mechanical strength after sintering (34.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 MPa), illustrating similar mechanical properties when compared to previous studies (33.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.3 MPa) of additively manufactured CPP bone substitutes using a commercially available binder. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

CT confirmed a confined mass, and an ultrasound-guided biopsy was obtained in each circumstance. An orbitotomy was tentatively planned for each case, and a 3D print of each head with the associated globe and mass was created to assist in surgical planning.\nIn case 1, the mass was located in the cranioventral aspect of the right orbit, and the histopathologic diagnosis was adenoma. In case 2, the mass was located within the lateral masseter muscle, ventral to the right orbit between the zygomatic arch and the ramus of the mandible. The histopathologic diagnosis in case 2 was consistent with a lipoma. In case 3, the mass was located in the ventral orbit, and the histopathologic diagnosis was histiocytic cellular infiltrate.\nThree-dimensional printing in cases with orbital and peri-orbital masses has exceptional potential for improved surgical planning and provides another modality for visualization to help veterinarians, students, and owners understand distribution of disease.

For chronic radial head dislocation, we have designed a graphic overlay approach that employs selected 3D computer images and widely available software to simplify the process of osteotomy site selection.\nWe studied 5 patients (2 traumatic and 3 congenital) with unilateral radial head dislocation. These patients were treated with surgery based on traditional radiographs, but they also had full sets of 3D CT imaging done both before and after their surgery: these 3D CT images form the basis for this study. From the 3D CT images, each patient generated 3 sets of 3D-printed bone models: 2 copies of the preoperative condition, and 1 copy of the postoperative condition. One set of the preoperative models was then actually osteotomized and fixed in the manner suggested by our graphic technique. Arcs of rotation of the 3 sets of 3D-printed bone models were then compared.\nArcs of rotation of the 3 groups of bone models were significantly different, with the models osteotomized accordingly to our graphic technique having the widest arcs.\nFor chronic radial head dislocation, our graphic overlay approach simplifies the selection of the osteotomy site(s).

{"title": "Genipin diffusion and reaction into a gelatin matrix for tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "Genipin is a natural low-toxic cross-linker for molecules with primary amino groups, and its use with collagen and gelatin has shown a great potential in tissue engineering applications. The fabrication of scaffolds with a well-organized micro and macro topology using additive manufacturing systems requires an accurate control of working parameters, such as reaction rate, gelling time, and diffusion constant. A polymeric system of 5% w/v gelatin in PBS with 2\u00a0mg/mL collagen solutions in a 1:1 weight ratio was used as template to perform measurements varying genipin concentration in a range of 0.1-1.5% w/w with respect to gelatin. In the first part of this work, the reaction rate of the polymeric system was estimated using a new colorimetric analysis of the reaction. Then its workability time, closely related to the gelling time, was evaluated thanks to rheological analysis: finally, the quantification of static and dynamic diffusion constants of genipin across nonreacting and reacting membranes, made respectively by agarose and gelatin, was performed. It was shown that the colorimetric analysis is a good indicator of the reaction progress. The gelling time depends on the genipin concentration, but a workability window of 40 min guaranteed up to 0.5% w/w genipin. The dynamic diffusion constant of genipin in the proposed polymeric system is in the order of magnitude of 10", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

In this study, the manufacture of poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate] (or PHBHHx) scaffolds, by means of an additive manufacturing technique based on a computer-controlled wet-spinning system, was investigated. By optimizing the processing parameters, three-dimensional scaffolds with different internal architectures were fabricated, based on a layer-by-layer approach. The resulting scaffolds were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, which showed good control over the fibre alignment and a fully interconnected porous network, with porosity in the range 79-88%, fibre diameter 47-76\u2009\u00b5m and pore size 123-789\u2009\u00b5m. Moreover, the resulting fibres presented an internal porosity connected to the external fibre surface as a consequence of the phase-inversion process governing the solidification of the polymer solution. Scaffold compressive modulus and yield stress and strain could be varied in a certain range by changing the architectural parameters. Cell-culture experiments employing the MC3T3-E1 murine pre-osteoblast cell line showed good cell proliferation after 21\u2009days of culture.
