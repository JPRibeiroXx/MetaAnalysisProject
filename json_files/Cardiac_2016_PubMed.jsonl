Various biomaterials including hydrogels and scaffolds have been developed to prepare cells (particularly stem cells) and tissues under 3D conditions for TERM applications. Although these biomaterials are usually homogeneous in early studies, effort has been made recently to generate biomaterials with the spatiotemporal complexities present in the native milieu of the specific cells and tissues under investigation. In this communication, the microfluidic and coaxial electrospray approaches that we used for generating microscale biomaterials with the spatial complexity of both pre-hatching embryos and ovary in the female reproductive system were introduced.

DOX treatment led to significant decreases in the ratio of heart weight to body weight and heart rate, and increases in blood pressure and the serum level of lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of cardiotoxicity, were recovered by yam extracts, especially in water extracts of D. alata. Yam extracts also decreased the cardiac levels of thiobarbituric acid relative substances, reactive oxygen species, and inflammatory factors, as well as the expression of nuclear factor kappa B, while ethanol extracts of D. japonica Thunb. and D. purpurea were shown to be more potent. Moreover, yam extracts had a role in increasing the activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, thus improving the DOX-induced alterations in oxidative status in the heart tissue of DOX-treated mice. All ethanol extracts of yam exhibited their antiapoptotic abilities on caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction, and ethanol extracts of D. alata still exerted a superior effect.

Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury model was induced by ligaturing the left anterior descending artery for 30 min followed reperfusion for 4 h after TFE was taken by intragastric administration for 4 days. The degree of myocardial infarct was observed by N-BT staining. The concentrations of MDA and activities of SOD and T-AOC in cardiac tissue were measured by colorimetry. Serum TnI concentrations were checked by ELISA. HE stain was used to observe myocardium structure under light microscope. Expressions of SIRT1 and Nrf2 in cardiac tissue were evaluated by immunohistochemistry method and Western blot, respectively. Compared with the model group, the degree of myocardial infarct, MDA concentration in cardiac tissue and the levels of TnI in serum significantly decreased in the diltiazem group and flavonoids of Epimedium low and high doses groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01); flavonoids of Epimedium low and high doses groups and the diltiazem group also showed improvements in myocardium structure under ischemia/reperfusion injury. TFE significantly increased the activity of SOD and T-AOC and the expression of SIRT1 and Nrf2 in cardiac tissue when compared with the model group (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

We show that biowires chronically treated with either isoproterenol, endothelin-1, or angiotensin II have disrupted myofibril alignment and significantly reduced force of contraction. Isoproterenol-treated biowires have upregulated brain natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide gene expression. Endothelin-1 and angiotensin II-treated biowires demonstrated a significantly increased cell size. Endothelin-1-treated biowires exhibited increased cardiac troponin secretion into the culture media.

Producing cardiac tissues directly from pluripotent stem cells rather than assembling tissues using pre-differentiated cells can eliminate multiple cell-handling steps that otherwise limit the potential for process automation and production scale-up. Here we asked whether our process for forming 3D developing human engineered cardiac tissues using poly(ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen hydrogels can be extended to widely used and printable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels. We demonstrate that low-density GelMA hydrogels can be formed rapidly using visible light (<1 min) and successfully employed to encapsulate human induced pluripotent stem cells while maintaining high cell viability. Resulting constructs had an initial stiffness of approximately 220 Pa, supported tissue growth and dynamic remodeling, and facilitated high-efficiency cardiac differentiation (>70%) to produce spontaneously contracting GelMA human engineered cardiac tissues (GEhECTs). GEhECTs initiated spontaneous contractions on day 8 of differentiation, with synchronicity, frequency, and velocity of contraction increasing over time, and displayed developmentally appropriate temporal changes in cardiac gene expression. GEhECT-dissociated cardiomyocytes displayed well-defined and aligned sarcomeres spaced at 1.85 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcm and responded appropriately to drug treatments, including the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and antagonist propranolol, as well as to outside pacing up to 3.0 Hz.

Notably, a number of cardiovascular disorders have been linked to alterations in epigenetic mechanisms. Here we aimed to determine the contribution of Nup153 to the epigenetic alterations occurring in cardiomyopathy of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice (C57BL/10ScSn-Dmd mdx /J).\nNup153 was lysine-acetylated and its expression was significantly increased at protein level in mdx hearts compared with controls. Accordingly, lysine acetyl transferase (KAT) activity associated with Nup153 was higher in mdx hearts paralleling increased binding with the lysine acetylases P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and p300. Interestingly, Nup153 silencing in mdx organotypic heart tissue slices caused a reduction in PCAF- and p300-specific activities. Remarkably, the level of nitric oxide (NO), which is reduced in mdx mice, was important for KAT-dependent regulation of Nup153. In fact, treatment of mdx heart tissue with an NO donor or the KAT inhibitor anacardic acid normalized Nup153 protein expression. Nup153 was recruited to chromatin and regulated the transcription of genes involved in cardiac remodelling, including the actin-binding protein nexilin. Accordingly, nexilin protein expression was abrogated by Nup153 silencing in mdx organotypic cultures. Electrophysiological and molecular experiments revealed that Nup153 overexpression in normal cardiomyocytes increases Ca v 1.2 calcium channel expression and function.

Treatment with irbesartan improved the heart architecture and attenuated high glucose-induced inflammation in the diabetic mice.\nTreatment with irbesartan attenuates cardiac inflammation in type 2 diabetic db/db mice, and this effect was probably associated with the suppression of cardiac angiotensin II and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.\n\u63a2\u8ba8\u8840\u7ba1\u7d27\u5f20\u7d20\u2161\u53d7\u4f53\u963b\u6ede\u5242\uff08ARB\uff09\u5384\u8d1d\u6c99\u5766\u5bf92\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5db/db\u5c0f\u9f20\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u708e\u75c7\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5fc3\u810f\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002\n10\u5468\u9f84db/db\u5c0f\u9f20\u968f\u673a\u5206\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u3001\u5384\u8d1d\u6c99\u5766\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec450 mg/\uff08kg\u00b7d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u7a9d\u51fa\u751f\u768410\u5468\u9f84\u975e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5db/+\u5c0f\u9f20\u5145\u5f53\u6b63\u5e38\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u3002\u6b63\u5e38\u7ec4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u704c\u670d\u7b49\u4f53\u79ef\u751f\u7406\u76d0\u6c34\uff0c\u5384\u8d1d\u6c99\u5766\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u704c\u670d\u5384\u8d1d\u6c99\u5766\uff08\u6eb6\u4e8e\u751f\u7406\u76d0\u6c34\uff09\uff0c\u836f\u7269\u5e72\u988416\u5468\u540e\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u5fc3\u810f\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6d4b\u5b9a\u7a7a\u8179\u8840\u7cd6\u3001\u8840\u7518\u6cb9\u4e09\u916f\u3001\u8840\u603b\u80c6\u56fa\u9187\u542b\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u5fc3\u810f\u884cHE\u67d3\u8272\u3001Western blot\u3001\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u5316\u548cqPCR\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\n\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u7ec4db/+\u5c0f\u9f20\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4db/db\u5c0f\u9f20\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u80a5\u80d6\u3001\u9ad8\u8840\u7cd6\u3001\u9ad8\u8840\u8102\uff08\n\u5384\u8d1d\u6c99\u5766\u6539\u5584\u4e862\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5db/db\u5c0f\u9f20\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u708e\u75c7\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5176\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u6291\u5236\u5fc3\u810f\u8840\u7ba1\u7d27\u5f20\u7d20\u2161\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548cNF-\u043aB\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u6709\u5173\u3002", "journal": "Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University", "date": "2017-04-28", "authors": ["Xian-LangYe", "Wei-ChangHuang", "Yan-TaoZheng", "YingLiang", "Wang-QiuGong", "Chong-MiaoYang", "BinLiu"], "doi": "10.3969/j.issn.1673-4254.2017.04.14\n10.1016/j.cbi.2016.03.015\n10.1038/nature05485\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.09.071\n10.1152/ajpheart.00340.2014\n10.1016/j.mce.2016.03.025\n10.1093/cvr/cvx011\n10.1210/en.2014-1718\n10.1186/s12933-014-0149-0\n10.1016/j.tem.2005.02.003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.08.002\n10.1038/hr.2013.119\n10.2174/138161207781662984\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e3281e66653\n10.1038/hr.2014.136\n10.1007/s10557-012-6392-2\n10.1016/j.phrs.2015.01.001\n10.1016/j.taap.2015.07.009\n10.3109/08923973.2012.712138\n10.1038/hr.2015.141\n10.1186/1475-2840-12-50\n10.1126/science.1079331\n10.1186/s12967-014-0364-1\n10.2337/db06-1163\n10.1007/s00125-006-0385-2\n10.2337/db06-1662\n10.1152/ajpheart.91493.2007"}

{"title": "Clinical problems due to encephalomyocarditis virus infections in two pig herds.", "abstract": "Infections with encephalomyocarditis virus may cause myocarditis and sudden death in young pigs and reproduction disorders in sows. The presence of encephalomyocarditis virus infected rodents is considered a major risk factor for transmission of the virus to pigs. There is currently no effective treatment. Tightening up biosecurity, applying effective rodent control and reducing stress are the main control measures.\nTwo farrow-to-finish herds suffering from problems with sudden death are presented. In herd A, suckling piglets from 3 to 12\u00a0days old were dying acutely whereas in herd B, piglets at the end of the nursery period (8-10 weeks) were showing identical problems. A presumptive diagnosis of encephalomyocarditis virus infection was made because typical lesions were observed in some of the affected pigs. These lesions were not always present in pigs dying acutely or in some cases the lesions were very subtle. Therefore other causes had to be ruled out based upon clinical history, clinical signs and diagnostic tests. A conclusive diagnosis was finally established by showing encephalomyocarditis virus in heart tissue using conventional gel-based polymerase chain reaction tests. The real-time PCR test that gave initially negative result was further optimized to avoid false negative results.\nTypical lesions are not always present in piglets infected with encephalomyocarditis virus, indicating the importance of examining multiple animals. Problems in suckling piglets may occur in affected herds without reproductive problems in sows. Transmission routes of EMCV in swine are not fully understood.

No other cardiac abnormalities were apparent. Approximately 2 wk after the initial presentation, the macaque was again bradycardic and exhibited a regularly irregular arrhythmia on a prestudy examination. ECG, echocardiography, blood pressure measurement, SpO2 assessment, and a CBC analysis were performed. The echocardiogram and bloodwork were normal, but the infant was hypotensive at the time of echocardiogram. The ECG revealed ventricular parasystole. Ventricular parasystole is considered a benign arrhythmia caused by an ectopic pacemaker that is insulated from impulses from the sinus node. Given this abnormality, the macaque was transferred to a short-term study protocol, according to veterinary recommendation. On the final veterinary exam, a grade 3 systolic murmur and a decrease in arrhythmia frequency were noted. Gross cardiac lesions were not identified at necropsy the following day. Cardiac tissue sections were essentially normal on microscopic examination. This infant did not display signs of cardiovascular insufficiency, and a review of the medical record indicated normal growth, feed intake and activity levels. This case demonstrates the importance of appropriate screening of potential neonatal and juvenile research candidates for occult cardiovascular abnormalities. Whether the arrhythmia diagnosed in this case was truly innocuous is unclear, given the documented hypotension and the development of a systolic heart murmur.", "journal": "Comparative medicine", "date": "2017-03-18", "authors": ["Dalis ECollins", "Brandy LDozier", "Jeffrey JStanton", "Lois MaColgin", "RhondaMacAllister"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Electrocardiogram reconstruction from high resolution voltage optical mapping.", "abstract": "Electrocardiogram recordings during opucal mapping experiments in heart tissue are commonly used tu monitor the health of the preparation and to obtain dominant frequencies during arrhythmic and defibrillatory studies. However the use of ECG reconstructed from optical mapping is seldom used and to date it has not been strictly validated. In this manuscript we present the first detailed validation and comparison of Optical Mapping ECG, or OM-ECG, with standard ECG recordings by calculating the electrostatic potential in space as a function of the voltage measured optically and describe the different approximations that can be used to obtain unipolar or bipolar ECG recordings. We found that in small/medium hearts, such as rabbits, leads that are aligned apex to base only require activation recording from one surface (anterior or posterior) for the OM-ECG to match the ECG while leads aligned left to right may require both an anterior and posterior optical mapping recording. The discrepancy between leads is due to symmetries in the ventricular activations. In the case of ischemic hearts where activations even-out more, the match between the OM-ECG and standard ECG may require only one surface recording for both left-right and base-apex leads. We believe that this methodology has two main and direct applications in the study of cardiac dynamics. The first is during studies of defibrillation where information after the shock may be crucial in the development of new strategies, OM-ECGs do not suffer the current artifacts of standard ECGs during shocks and can be calculated during the entire activation. We present examples in rabbit ventricles where even low amplitude pacing artifacts are captured by the ECG but do not appear in the OM-ECG. The second use of this technique is for reconstructions of intramural dynamics in larger hearts where differences between the ECG and OM-ECG obtained from anterior and posterior recordings can be used to derive the intramural activation.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Here, we study the problem of the CV estimation in sequential mapping without using any independent electrogram as a time alignment reference. We assume that the IEGMs are sequentially recorded from several sites, where at each site, at least two of the catheter's electrodes are in contact with the cardiac tissue. We consider the planar wavefront with stable CV that propagates within the recording sites throughout our data collection period. Assuming the zero-mean Gaussian AT estimation error, we derive the maximum likelihood estimations of the CV and AT at a desired location on the cardiac shell. The CV is estimated when the variance of the AT estimation error and the time delay between the sequential recordings are unknown variables. Our simulation results show that the proposed method can precisely estimate the CV of the planar wavefront.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

This study was designed to investigate the possible effect of cerebrolysin against apoptosis triggered by oxidative cell stress in myocardial ischemia induced by isoproterenol in rat. Rats were pretreated with cerebrolysin 5\u00a0mL/kg intraperitoneally for 7\u00a0days and intoxicated with isoproterenol (ISO, 85\u00a0mg/kg, sc) on the last 2\u00a0days. Hearts were excised and stained to detect the infarction size. Serum levels of cardiotoxicity indices as creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and troponin I (cTnI) as well as the cardiac oxidative stress parameters as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and superoxide dismutase were estimated. The expression of prodeath gene p53 and antideath gene Bcl-2 was also assessed from the excised heart tissues. Leakage of cardiac enzymes, elevated oxidative stress markers, and apoptotic indices confirmed the MI occurring as a consequence of isoproterenol-induced ischemia. Cerebrolysin pretreatment caused significant attenuation of the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in the ischemic myocardial tissue.

This study investigated the impact of crocin combined with voluntary exercise on heart oxidative stress indicator in high-fat diet-induced type 2 diabetic rats. Materials and methods Rats were divided into four groups: diabetes, diabetic-crocin, diabetic-voluntary exercise, diabetic-crocin-voluntary exercise. Type 2 diabetes was induced by high-fat diet (4 weeks) and injection of streptozotocin (intraperitoneally, 35\u00a0mg/kg). Animals received crocin orally (50\u00a0mg/kg); voluntary exercise was performed alone or combined with crocin treatment for 8 weeks. Finally, malondialdehyde (MDA), activity of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) were measured spectrophotometrically. Results Treatment of diabetic rats with crocin and exercise significantly decreased the levels of MDA (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and increased the activity of SOD, GPx, and CAT compared with the untreated diabetic group. In addition, combination of exercise and crocin amplified their effect on antioxidant levels in the heart tissue of type 2 diabetic rats.

{"title": "Neural Crest Stem Cells Can Differentiate to a Cardiomyogenic Lineage with an Ability to Contract in Response to Pulsed Infrared Stimulation.", "abstract": "Cellular cardiomyoplasty has rapidly risen to prominence in the clinic following a myocardial infarction; however, low engraftment of transplanted cells limits the therapeutic benefit to these procedures. Recently, lineage-specific stem cells differentiated into cardiomyocytes have gained much attention to assist in the repair of an injured heart tissue; however, questions regarding the ideal cell source remain. In the present study, we have identified a source that is easy to extract stem cells from and show that the cells present have a high plasticity toward the cardiomyogenic lineage. We focused on the recently discovered neural crest stem cells residing in the periodontal ligament that can be easily obtained through dental procedures.\nNeural crest stem cells were obtained from human excised third molars and differentiated in culture using a protocol for directed differentiation into cardiomyocytes. Differentiation of cells was assessed through gene expression and immunostaining studies. Optical stimulation using pulsed infrared radiation (IR) (\u03bb\u2009=\u20091863\u2009nm) was delivered to cell aggregates to study their contractile ability.\nWe show that neural crest stem cells can be differentiated to a cardiomyogenic lineage, which was verified through immunostaining and gene expression. We observed a significant increase in cardiomyocyte-specific markers, NK2 homeobox 5 (NKX2.5) and troponin T type 2 (TNNT2), with positive changes in tropomyosin I (TPM1), gap junction protein alpha 1/Cx43 (GJA1/Cx43), and myocyte enhancement factor 2C (MEF2C). Furthermore, we were able to elicit and maintain pulse-by-pulse contractile responses in the derived cells, including in cardiospheres, with pulsed IR delivered at various radiant energies. The contractility in responses to IR could be maintained at different frequencies (0.25-2\u2009Hz) and up to 10-min durations. While these cells did not maintain their contractility following cessation of IR, these cells demonstrated responses to the optical stimuli that are consistent with previous reports. We also found no evidence for irreversible mitochondrial depolarization in these cells following the long duration of infrared stimulation, suggesting the robustness of these cells.\nOverall, these results suggest the merit of neural crest-derived stem cells for cardiomyogenic applications and a potential cell source for repair that should contribute to efforts to translate cell-based strategies to the clinic.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Decellularized zebrafish cardiac extracellular matrix induces mammalian heart regeneration.", "abstract": "Heart attack is a global health problem that leads to significant morbidity, mortality, and health care burden. Adult human hearts have very limited regenerative capability after injury. However, evolutionarily primitive species generally have higher regenerative capacity than mammals. The extracellular matrix (ECM) may contribute to this difference. Mammalian cardiac ECM may not be optimally inductive for cardiac regeneration because of the fibrotic, instead of regenerative, responses in injured adult mammalian hearts. Given the high regenerative capacity of adult zebrafish hearts, we hypothesize that decellularized zebrafish cardiac ECM (zECM) made from normal or healing hearts can induce mammalian heart regeneration. Using zebrafish and mice as representative species of lower vertebrates and mammals, we show that a single administration of zECM, particularly the healing variety, enables cardiac functional recovery and regeneration of adult mouse heart tissues after acute myocardial infarction. zECM-treated groups exhibit proliferation of the remaining cardiomyocytes and multiple cardiac precursor cell populations and reactivation of ErbB2 expression in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, zECM exhibits pro-proliferative and chemotactic effects on human cardiac precursor cell populations in vitro. These contribute to the structural preservation and correlate with significantly higher cardiac contractile function, notably less left ventricular dilatation, and substantially more elastic myocardium in zECM-treated hearts than control animals treated with saline or decellularized adult mouse cardiac ECM. Inhibition of ErbB2 activity abrogates beneficial effects of zECM administration, indicating the possible involvement of ErbB2 signaling in zECM-mediated regeneration. This study departs from conventional focuses on mammalian ECM and introduces a new approach for cardiac tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2017-02-01", "authors": ["William C WChen", "ZhouguangWang", "Maria AzzurraMissinato", "Dae WooPark", "Daniel WardLong", "Heng-JuiLiu", "XuemeiZeng", "Nathan AYates", "KangKim", "YadongWang"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.1600844"}

Group II: sham-control rats stayed in restrainer without EMR and DMSO (10mg/kg/day i.p.). Group III: rats exposed to 2450 MHz EMR. Group IV: treated group rats exposed to 2450 MHz EMR+melatonin (MLT) (10mg/kg/day i.p.).\nIn the blood tissue, there was no significant difference between the groups in respect of erythrocytes GSH, GSH-Px activity, plasma LP level and vitamin A concentration (p > 0.05). However, in the Group IV, erythrocytes' LP levels (p < 0.05) were observed to be significantly decreased while plasma vitamin C, and vitamin E concentrations (p < 0.05) were found to be increased when compared to Group III. In the heart tissues, MDA and NO levels significantly increased in group III compared with groups I and II (p < 0.05). Contrary to these oxidant levels, CAT and SOD enzyme activities decreased significantly in group III compared with groups I and II (p 0.05). Besides, MLT treatment lowered the MDA and NO levels compared with group III.\nIn conclusion, these results demonstrated that contrary to its effect on the heart, the wireless (2450 MHz) devices cause slight oxidative-antioxidative changes in the blood of rats, and a moderate melatonin supplementation may play an important role in the antioxidant system (plasma vitamin C and vitamin E).

{"title": "Light-chain cardiac amyloidosis.", "abstract": "Cardiac amyloidosis is an underrecognized condition, in which delays to diagnosis have great implications on management options, prognosis, and morbidity. Once cardiac tissue is infiltrated by amyloid fibrils, there is a cascade of pathologic changes that can display an array of clinical manifestations, from impaired relaxation of the ventricular myocardium to severe restrictive disease or even progressive systolic heart failure. Management is guided not only by recognizing the subtype of amyloidosis (primary, hereditary, and wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis), but also the clinical stage of the disease. It is important for those managing such patients to understand and differentiate disease associated with fibrils composed of transthyretin vs light-chain proteins. Kappa- and lambda-light chains of primary amyloidosis are particularly toxic to myocytes, leading to accelerated clinical illness in the face of intolerance to treatment and poor survival. Limitations to treatment of primary cardiac amyloidosis are related to multiorgan dysfunction and the inability to tolerate appropriate chemotherapy. Bortezomib, a selective protease inhibitor, has been shown to be and an effective and tolerable option for those with myocardial amyloid infiltration. Standard goal-directed optimal medical management for cardiomyopathy (such as beta-blockers and ace inhibitors) does not offer a survival benefit with cardiac amyloidosis, and often is associated with adverse effects. Despite advances in treatment of advanced heart failure therapy, end-stage cardiomyopathy in the setting of amyloidosis is not well stabilized by inotropes or mechanical circulatory support, and offers restricted candidacy for heart transplantation.

Lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, and the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured. Apoptotic-related gene (p53, bax and caspase 3) mRNA expression was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Caspase 3 activity was also measured in all the groups. The results demonstrated that selenium significantly reduced the levels of malondialdehyde. The levels of glutathione, SOD, LDH and catalase significantly increased following selenium treatment. Relative mRNA expression (p53, bax and caspase 3) was significantly reduced in the cisplatin-treated rats, but it significantly increased following selenium treatment.

The present study investigated the effects of crocin and insulin treatments (alone or in combination) on cardiac function and pathology in diabetic rats.\nDiabetes was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg). Thereafter, crocin (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of insulin (4 IU/kg) and their combination were administered for eight weeks. Blood glucose level and whole heart and body weights were measured. Electrocardiography (ECG) was carried out using the lead II. Serum concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB), and the heart tissue malodialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents were determined. The heart lesions were evaluated by light microscopy.\nSTZ decreased body weight and increased whole heart weight/body weight ratio. It also decreased heart rate, and increased RR and QT intervals and T wave amplitude. STZ increased blood glucose, serum LDH and CK-MB levels, augmented heart tissue MDA content, decreased SOD content of heart tissue, and produced hemorrhages, degeneration, interstitial edema, and fibroblastic proliferation in the heart tissue. Crocin (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.), insulin (4 IU/kg, s.c.) and their combination (5 mg/kg of crocin with 4 IU/kg of insulin) treatments recovered the ECG, biochemical and histopathological changes induced by STZ.\nThe results showed cardioprotective effects of crocin and insulin in STZ-induced diabetic rats.

{"title": "Trimethylamine N-oxide impairs pyruvate and fatty acid oxidation in cardiac mitochondria.", "abstract": "Increased plasma concentration of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a proatherogenic metabolite, has been linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes; however, it remains unclear whether TMAO is a biomarker or whether it induces direct detrimental cardiovascular effects. Because altered cardiac energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction play crucial roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases, we hypothesized that increased TMAO concentration may alter mitochondrial energy metabolism. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of TMAO on cardiac mitochondrial energy metabolism. Acute exposure of cardiac fibers to TMAO decreased LEAK (substrate-dependent) and OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation-dependent) mitochondrial respiration with pyruvate and impaired substrate flux via pyruvate dehydrogenase. The administration of TMAO at a dose of 120mg/kg for 8 weeks increased TMAO concentration in plasma and cardiac tissues 22-23 times to about 15\u03bcM and 11nmol/g, respectively. Long-term TMAO administration decreased mitochondrial LEAK state respiration with pyruvate by 30% without affecting OXPHOS state respiration. However, no significant changes in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production were observed after acute exposure of cardiac fibers to TMAO under physiological conditions. In addition, both long-term TMAO administration and acute exposure to TMAO decreased respiration with palmitoyl-CoA indicating impaired \u03b2-oxidation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that increased TMAO concentration impairs pyruvate and fatty acid oxidation in cardiac mitochondria. Thus, the accumulation of TMAO in cardiac tissues leads to disturbances in energy metabolism that can increase the severity of cardiovascular events.", "journal": "Toxicology letters", "date": "2017-01-04", "authors": ["MarinaMakrecka-Kuka", "KristineVolska", "UnigundeAntone", "ReinisVilskersts", "SolveigaGrinberga", "DaceBandere", "EdgarsLiepinsh", "MaijaDambrova"], "doi": "10.1016/j.toxlet.2016.12.017"}

The current study was designed to assess the potential protective effect of parsley oil (PO) against CDDP-induced hepato-cardiotoxicity. For this purpose, 25 adult male rats were assigned into five groups, each containing five animals. Group I (control) was administered saline solution. Group II was administered PO at a dosage of 0.42ml/kg BW. Group III were administered CDDP at a dosage of 5mg/kg BW. Group IV was administered PO in addition to CDDP. Group V was administered saline solution in addition to CDDP, after which they were administered PO for five days. Oral administration of either saline solution or PO was performed each day for 10days, while administration of CDDP was via a single intraperitoneal injection five days following the commencement of the experiment. The recorded results revealed that CDDP induced obvious hepatic and cardiac injuries that were indicated by biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical alterations, including elevation of serum hepatic and cardiac injury markers as well as proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, CDDP induced an increase in the level of hepatic and cardiac injury biomarkers, decreases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, a decrease in GSH concentration, and an increase in MDA concentration.

In reaction-diffusion models of cardiac tissue, heterogeneities in action potential duration (APD) can be created by locally modifying an intrinsic membrane kinetics parameter. Electrotonic coupling, however, acts as a confounding factor that modulates APD dispersion.\nWe developed an algorithm based on a quasi-Newton method that iteratively adjusts the spatial distribution of a membrane parameter to reproduce a pre-defined target APD map in a coupled tissue. The method assumes that the relation between the adjustable parameter and APD is bijective in an isolated cell. Each iteration of the algorithm involved simulating the cardiac reaction-diffusion system with the updated parameter profile for one beat and extracting the APD map. The algorithm was extended to simultaneous estimation of two parameter profiles based on two APD maps at different repolarization thresholds.\nThe method was validated in 1D, 2D and 3D atrial tissues using synthetic target APD maps with controllable total variation and maximum APD gradient. The adjustable parameter was local acetylcholine concentration. The iterations converged provided that APD gradients were not too steep. Convergence was found to be faster 2-5 iterations) when the maximal gradient was less steep, when APD range was smaller and when tissue conductivity was reduced.\nThis algorithm provides a tool to automatically generate arrhythmogenic substrates with controllable repolarization gradients and possibly incorporate experimental APD maps into computer models.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2016-12-25", "authors": ["Akshay KotaAswath Kumar", "AngelinaDrahi", "VincentJacquemet"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.12.008"}

The mechanisms implicated in the development of diabetic heart disease, commonly termed diabetic cardiomyopathy, are complex, but much of the impact of diabetes on the heart can be attributed to impaired glucose handling. It has been shown that the maladaptive nutrient-sensing hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) contributes to diabetic complications in many non-cardiac tissues. Glucose metabolism by the HBP leads to enzymatically-regulated, O-linked attachment of a sugar moiety molecule, \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), to proteins, affecting their biological activity (similar to phosphorylation). In normal physiology, transient activation of HBP/O-GlcNAc mechanisms is an adaptive, protective means to enhance cell survival; interventions that acutely suppress this pathway decrease tolerance to stress. Conversely, chronic dysregulation of HBP/O-GlcNAc mechanisms has been shown to be detrimental in certain pathological settings, including diabetes and cancer. Most of our understanding of the impact of sustained maladaptive HBP and O-GlcNAc protein modifications has been derived from adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and other non-cardiac tissues, as a contributing mechanism to insulin resistance and progression of diabetic complications.

Five years later, he returned to the ED with abdominal pain and shortness of breath. Troponin was elevated and showed no signs of downtrend on repeat every 6 h. ECG was unchanged from 5 years before. He was discharged with a follow-up cardiac computed tomography (CT). Troponin was measured on the day of his scan and remained elevated; he was asymptomatic. Cardiac CT showed unremarkable coronaries and bypass grafts. Given persistently positive troponin in the setting of minimal to no symptoms, he was thought to have falsely elevated troponins.

This study was designed to investigate whether down-regulation of CD47 using RNA interference (RNAi) technology can relieve inhibition of nitric oxide signaling and attenuate myocardial damage in a rat model of I/R.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 40) were randomly allocated to four groups and pre-treated either with saline (Sham and I/R groups), or adenovirus expressing either control (Ad-EGFP-N) or CD47-targeting (Ad-EGFP-CD47) RNAi. After four days, the rat MIRI model was established by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min, followed by reperfusion for 3 h.

Down-regulation of CD47 was significantly associated with reduced infarct size and serum levels of myocardial enzymes, increased activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, increased levels of nitric oxide, and decreased levels of oxidative stress.\nThese data indicate that down-regulation of CD47 exerts a protective effect against MIRI, which may be attributable to attenuation of oxidative stress via activation of the eNOS/NO signaling pathway.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2016-12-14", "authors": ["Hui-BoWang", "JunYang", "Jia-WangDing", "Li-HuaChen", "SongLi", "Xiao-WenLiu", "Chao-JunYang", "Zhi-XinFan", "JianYang"], "doi": "10.1159/000453170"}

The heart tissues were harvested for hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson trichrome staining to compare the extent of inflammatory cellular infiltration and fibrin deposition among groups and for scanning transmission electron microscopic examinations to see the ultrastructural changes after CME.\nSurvival analysis demonstrated that the cumulative survival rate of the 17 \u03bcm/500,000 group was significantly lower than that of the sham group (0/6 vs. 6/6, P = 0.001). The cumulative survival rate of the 17 \u03bcm/200,000 group was lower than those of the sham and 9 \u03bcm groups with no statistical difference (cumulative survival rate of the 17 \u03bcm/200,000, 9 \u03bcm/800,000, 9 \u03bcm/500,000, and sham groups was 4/6, 5/6, 6/6, and 6/6, respectively). The pathological alterations were similar between the 9 \u03bcm/500,000 and 9 \u03bcm/800,000 groups. The extent of inflammatory cellular infiltration and fibrin deposition was more severe in the 17 \u03bcm/200,000 group than in the 9 \u03bcm/500,000 and 9 \u03bcm/800,000 groups 3 and 10 days after the surgery. Scanning transmission electron microscopic examinations revealed platelet aggregation and adhesion, microthrombi formation, and changes in cardiomyocytes.\nThe injection of 500,000 polystyrene microspheres at an average diameter of 9 \u03bcm is proved to be appropriate for the mouse model of CME based on the general conditions, postoperative survival rates, and pathological changes.", "journal": "Chinese medical journal", "date": "2016-12-14", "authors": ["Yuan-YuanCao", "Zhang-WeiChen", "Jian-GuoJia", "AoChen", "YouZhou", "YongYe", "Yan-HuaGao", "YanXia", "Shu-FuChang", "Jian-YingMa", "Ju-YingQian", "Jun-BoGe"], "doi": "10.4103/0366-6999.195469"}
{"title": "Biohybrid cardiac ECM-based hydrogels improve long term cardiac function post myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Injectable scaffolds for cardiac tissue regeneration are a promising therapeutic approach for progressive heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI). Their major advantage lies in their delivery modality that is considered minimally invasive due to their direct injection into the myocardium. Biomaterials comprising such scaffolds should mimic the cardiac tissue in terms of composition, structure, mechanical support, and most importantly, bioactivity. Nonetheless, natural biomaterial-based gels may suffer from limited mechanical strength, which often fail to provide the long-term support required by the heart for contraction and relaxation. Here we present newly-developed injectable scaffolds, which are based on solubilized decellularized porcine cardiac extracellular matrix (pcECM) cross-linked with genipin alone or engineered with different amounts of chitosan to better control the gel's mechanical properties while still leveraging the ECM biological activity. We demonstrate that these new biohybrid materials are naturally remodeled by mesenchymal stem cells, while supporting high viabilities and affecting cell morphology and organization. They exhibit neither in vitro nor in vivo immunogenicity. Most importantly, their application in treating acute and long term chronic MI in rat models clearly demonstrates the significant therapeutic potential of these gels in the long-term (12weeks post MI). The pcECM-based gels enable not only preservation, but also improvement in cardiac function eight weeks post treatment, as measured using echocardiography as well as hemodynamics. Infiltration of progenitor cells into the gels highlights the possible biological remodeling properties of the ECM-based platform.\nThis work describes the development of new injectable scaffolds for cardiac tissue regeneration that are based on solubilized porcine cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM), combined with natural biomaterials: genipin, and chitosan. The design of such scaffolds aims at leveraging the natural bioactivity and unique structure of cardiac ECM, while overcoming its limited mechanical strength, which may fail to provide the long-term support required for heart contraction and relaxation. Here, we present a biocompatible gel-platform with custom-tailored mechanical properties that significantly improve cardiac function when injected into rat hearts following acute and chronic myocardial infarction.

The inflammatory reaction in the host aims at eliminating this parasite, can lead to cell destruction, fibrosis and hypoxia. Local hypoxia is well-defined stimulus to the production of angiogenesis mediators. Assuming that different genetic T. cruzi populations induce distinct inflammation and disease patterns, the current study aims to investigate whether the production of inflammatory and angiogenic mediators is a parasite strain-dependent condition. C57BL/6 mice were infected with the Y and Colombian strains of T. cruzi and euthanized at the 12th and 32nd days, respectively. The blood and heart tissue were processed in immune assays and/or qPCR (TNF, IL-17, IL-10, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCR2, CCR5 and angiogenic factors VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2) and in histological assays. The T. cruzi increased the inflammatory and angiogenic mediators in the infected mice when they were compared to non-infected animals. However, the Colombian strain has led to higher (i) leukocyte infiltration, (ii) cardiac TNF and CCL5 production/expression, (iii) cardiac tissue parasitism, and to higher (iv) ratio between heart/body weights. On the other hand, the Colombian strain has caused lower production and expression VEGF, Ang-1 and Ang-2, when it was compared to the Y strain of the parasite. The present study highlights that the T. cruzi-genetic population defines the pattern of angiogenic/inflammatory mediators in the heart tissue, and that it may contribute to the magnitude of the cardiac pathogenesis.

Given the flexibility, electrical conductance, and contractility of native cardiac tissues, it is desirable that polymeric scaffolds for cardiac tissue regeneration exhibit elasticity and high electrical conductivity. Herein, we developed a facile approach to introduce carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into poly(octamethylene maleate (anhydride) 1,2,4-butanetricarboxylate) (124 polymer), and developed an elastomeric scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering that provides electrical conductivity and structural integrity to 124 polymer. 124 polymer-CNT materials were developed by first dispersing CNTs in poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether porogen and mixing with 124 prepolymer for molding into shapes and crosslinking under ultraviolet light. 124 polymers with 0.5% and 0.1% CNT content (wt) exhibited improved conductivity against pristine 124 polymer. With increasing the CNT content, surface moduli of hybrid polymers were increased, while their bulk moduli were decreased. Furthermore, increased swelling of hybrid 124 polymer-CNT materials was observed, suggesting their improved structural support in an aqueous environment. Finally, functional characterization of engineered cardiac tissues using the 124 polymer-CNT scaffolds demonstrated improved excitation threshold in materials with 0.5% CNT content (3.6\u00b10.8V/cm) compared to materials with 0% (5.1\u00b10.8V/cm) and 0.1% (5.0\u00b10.7V/cm), suggesting greater tissue maturity. 124 polymer-CNT materials build on the advantages of 124 polymer elastomer to give a versatile biomaterial for cardiac tissue engineering applications.\nAchieving a high elasticity and a high conductivity in a single cardiac tissue engineering material remains a challenge. We report the use of CNTs in making electrically conductive and mechanically strong polymeric scaffolds in cardiac tissue regeneration. CNTs were incorporated in elastomeric polymers in a facile and reproducible approach. Polymer-CNT materials were able to construct complicated scaffold structures by injecting the prepolymer into a mold and crosslinking the prepolymer under ultraviolet light.

{"title": "Characterisation of Development and Electrophysiological Mechanisms Underlying Rhythmicity of the Avian Lymph Heart.", "abstract": "Despite significant advances in tissue engineering such as the use of scaffolds, bioreactors and pluripotent stem cells, effective cardiac tissue engineering for therapeutic purposes has remained a largely intractable challenge. For this area to capitalise on such advances, a novel approach may be to unravel the physiological mechanisms underlying the development of tissues that exhibit rhythmic contraction yet do not originate from the cardiac lineage. Considerable attention has been focused on the physiology of the avian lymph heart, a discrete organ with skeletal muscle origins yet which displays pacemaker properties normally only found in the heart. A functional lymph heart is essential for avian survival and growth in ovo. The histological nature of the lymph heart is similar to skeletal muscle although molecular and bioelectrical characterisation during development to assess mechanisms that contribute towards lymph heart contractile rhythmicity have not been undertaken. A better understanding of these processes may provide exploitable insights for therapeutic rhythmically contractile tissue engineering approaches in this area of significant unmet clinical need. Here, using molecular and electrophysiological approaches, we describe the molecular development of the lymph heart to understand how this skeletal muscle becomes fully functional during discrete in ovo stages of development. Our results show that the lymph heart does not follow the normal transitional programme of myogenesis as documented in most skeletal muscle, but instead develops through a concurrent programme of precursor expansion, commitment to myogenesis and functional differentiation which offers a mechanistic explanation for its rapid development. Extracellular electrophysiological field potential recordings revealed that the peak-to-peak amplitude of electrically evoked local field potentials elicited from isolated lymph heart were significantly reduced by treatment with carbachol; an effect that could be fully reversed by atropine. Moreover, nifedipine and cyclopiazonic acid both significantly reduced peak-to-peak local field potential amplitude. Optical recordings of lymph heart showed that the organ's rhythmicity can be blocked by the HCN channel blocker, ZD7288; an effect also associated with a significant reduction in peak-to-peak local field potential amplitude. Additionally, we also show that isoforms of HCN channels are expressed in avian lymph heart.

NOX4 is interrelated with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Spliced X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1s) is a key mediator of ERS while its role in cardiac hypertrophy is still poorly understood. Recently, receptor interacting protein kinase 1(RIPK1) has been increasingly reported to be associated with ERS. Therefore, we aimed to test the hypothesis that Xbp1s mediates NOX4-triggered cardiac hypertrophy via RIPK1 signaling. In the heart tissue of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) rats and in primary cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes(NCMs) treated with angiotensinII(AngII) or isoproterenol (ISO), NOX4 expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and expression of Xbp1s as well as RIPK1-related phosphorylation of P65 subunit of NF-\u03baB were elevated. Gene silencing of NOX4 by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly blocked the upregulation of NOX4, generation of ROS, splicing of Xbp1 and activation of the RIPK1-related NF-\u03baB signaling, meanwhile attenuated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In addition, ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-L-cysteine, NAC) and NOX4 inhibitor GKT137831 reduced ROS generation and alleviated activation of Xbp1 and RIPK1-related NF-\u03baB signaling. Furthermore, splicing of Xbp1 was responsible for the increase in RIPK1 expression in AngII or ISO-treated NCMs. Upregulated RIPK1 in turn activates NF-\u03baB signaling in a kinase activity-independent manner. These findings suggest that Xbp1s plays an important role in NOX4-triggered cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via activating its downstream effector RIPK1, which may prove significant for the development of future therapeutic strategies.", "journal": "Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)", "date": "2016-12-09", "authors": ["LiChen", "MingyueZhao", "JunliLi", "YuWang", "QinxueBao", "SiyuanWu", "XueqinDeng", "XiaojuTang", "WenchaoWu", "XiaojingLiu"], "doi": "10.1080/15384101.2016.1260210\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.013894\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.048.\n10.1089/ars.2009.2625.\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.02.002.\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-030212-183707.\n10.1097/hjh.0000000000000597.\n10.1038/nrm3270.\n10.1089/dna.2014.2552.\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2015.04.010.\n10.1111/acel.12460\n10.1016/j.tcb.2015.01.001\n10.1002/embr.201337970.\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.011195.\n10.1093/cvr/cvu146.\n10.1038/nm.4017.\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1049800.\n10.1038/cddis.2014.523.\n10.1155/2016/1451676.\n10.1073/pnas.1002178107\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.12.018.\n10.1242/jcs.153643.\n10.1128/MCB.01445-09.\n10.15252/embj.201592394.\n10.1128/mcb.24.24.10703-10717.2004.\n10.1161/circresaha.112.279760.\n10.1161/01.res.0000099504.30207.f5.\n10.1016/j.cjca.2013.04.026.\n10.1161/circulationaha.114.011079.\n10.1161/circresaha.109.213116.\n10.1161/01.RES.0000233317.70421.03\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.014.\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.12.018.\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.07.021.\n10.1053/j.gastro.2011.06.045.\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.11.006.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0107135."}

To clarify the role of miR-33 in remodeling hearts, we investigated the responses to pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction in miR-33-deficient (knockout [KO]) mice. When mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction, miR-33 expression levels were significantly upregulated in wild-type left ventricles. There was no difference in hypertrophic responses between wild-type and miR-33KO hearts, whereas cardiac fibrosis was ameliorated in miR-33KO hearts compared with wild-type hearts. Despite the ameliorated cardiac fibrosis, miR-33KO mice showed impaired systolic function after transverse aortic constriction.

RHD is one of the most common acquired heart diseases causing permanent damage to heart valves which ultimately leads to heart failure. In RHD, heart valve lesions are formed which are mediated by autoimmune reaction between streptococcal antigens (M protein and group A carbohydrate epitope GlcNAc) and heart tissues. On the other hand, inflammatory response generated by cytokines promotes chronicity of the disease. Varying concentrations of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in patients and controls are reported and are also found to be associated with IL-10 gene polymorphism in RF/RHD patients. Although the effect of IL-10 gene polymorphism on the functionality of IL-10 is unknown, many investigations suggest an important role of IL-10 and its polymorphism in immune regulation and progression of disease in RF/RHD.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is analyzed by measuring consecutive beat-to-beat intervals. This variability can contain information about the factors regulating cardiac activity under normal and pathological conditions, but the information obtained from such analyses is not yet fully understood. In this article, HRV in zebrafish larvae was evaluated under normal conditions and under the effect of substances that modify intrinsic cardiac activity and cardiac activity modulated by the nervous system. We found that the factors affecting intrinsic activity have negative chronotropic and arrhythmogenic effects at this stage of development, whereas neural modulatory factors have a lesser impact. The results suggest that cardiac activity largely depends on the intrinsic properties of the heart tissue in the early stages of development and, to a lesser extent, in the maturing nervous system. We also report, for the first time, the influence of the neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid on HRV.

{"title": "New Developments in Cardiac Regeneration.", "abstract": "Numerous pharmacological and device therapies have improved adverse cardiac remodelling and mortality in heart failure. However, none are able to regenerate damaged cardiac tissue. Stem cell based therapies using multipotent (adult) stem cells and pluripotent stem cells are new approaches that could potentially achieve the elusive goal of true cardiac regeneration. Over the past two decades, various stem cell based approaches have been shown to improve left ventricular function in pre-clinical animal models. Promising results rapidly led to clinical trials, initially using bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, then mesenchymal stromal cell populations and, more recently, progenitor cells from the adult heart itself. These have been shown to be safe and have advanced our understanding of potential suitable recipients, cell delivery routes, and possible mechanisms of action. However, efficacy in these trials has been inconsistent. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are another potential source of stem cells for cardiac regeneration. They could theoretically provide an unlimited source of cardiomyocytes or cardiac progenitors. Pre-clinical studies in both small and large animal models have shown robust engraftment and improvements in cardiac function. The first clinical trial using hPSC-derived cardiac derivatives has now commenced and others are imminent.

They have attracted increasing attention from the scientists attributing to their essential physiological functions. However, their quantification have long been challenged by the low abundance, high structure similarity, poor stability and limited ionization efficiency. In this paper, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatograph coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) strategy was developed for the comprehensive profiling of more than 60 eicosanoids based on an efficient derivatization reagent 2,4-bis(diethylamino)-6-hydrazino-1,3,5-triazine (T3) and general multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) parameters.

Limits of quantitation (LOQs) for derivatized eicosanoids varied from 0.05 to 50\u00a0pg depending on their structures. The sensitivities of derivatized eicosanoids were enhanced by 10- to 5000-folds compared to free eicosanoids. Stabilities of T3 modified eicosanoids were also highly improved compared to free eicosanoids.

Lack of growth in prosthetic grafts is especially detrimental in pediatric surgery. Cell seeded biodegradable tissue engineered grafts are a novel solution to this problem. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of seeding human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) onto a biodegradable cardiac patch.\nThe hiPS-CMs were cultured on a biodegradable patch composed of a polyglycolic acid (PGA) and a 50:50 poly (l-lactic-co-\u03b5-caprolactone) copolymer (PLCL) for 1\u00a0week. Male athymic rats were randomly divided into 2 groups of 10 animals each: 1. hiPS-CM seeded group, and 2. Unseeded group. After culture, the cardiac patch was implanted to repair a defect with a diameter of 2\u00a0mm created in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) wall. Hearts were explanted at 4 (n\u2009=\u20092), 8 (n\u2009=\u20092), and 16 (n\u2009=\u20096) weeks after patch implantation. Explanted patches were assessed immunohistochemically.\nSeeded patch explants did not stain positive for \u03b1-actinin (marker of cardiomyocytes) at the 4\u00a0week time point, suggesting that the cultured hiPS-CMs evacuated the patch in the early phase of tissue remodeling. However, after 16\u00a0weeks implantation, the area fraction of positively stained \u03b1-actinin cells was significantly higher in the seeded group than in the unseeded group (Seeded group: 6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8% vs. Unseeded group: 0.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.50%, p\u2009=\u20090.004), suggesting cell seeding promoted regenerative proliferation of host cardiomyocytes.\nSeeded hiPS-CMs were not present in the patch after 4\u00a0weeks.

To probe the underlying mechanism, metabolic features were evaluated in a rat model of acute myocardial ischemia induced by isoproterenol (ISO) and administrated with CDDP using a metabolomics platform. Our data revealed that the ISO-induced animal model showed obvious myocardial injury, decreased energy production, and a marked change in metabolomic patterns in plasma and heart tissue. CDDP pretreatment increased energy production, ameliorated biochemical indices, modulated the changes and metabolomic pattern induced by ISO, especially in heart tissue. For the first time, we found that ISO induced myocardial ischemia was accomplished with a reduced fatty acids metabolism and an elevated glycolysis for energy supply upon the ischemic stress; while CDDP pretreatment prevented the tendency induced by ISO and enhanced a metabolic shift towards fatty acids metabolism that conventionally dominates energy supply to cardiac muscle cells. These data suggested that the underlying mechanism of CDDP involved regulating the dominant energy production mode and enhancing a metabolic shift toward fatty acids metabolism in ischemic heart.

{"title": "Human fetal and adult epicardial-derived cells: a novel model to study their activation.", "abstract": "The epicardium, a cell layer covering the heart, plays an important role during cardiogenesis providing cardiovascular cell types and instructive signals, but becomes quiescent during adulthood. Upon cardiac injury the epicardium is activated, which includes induction of a developmental gene program, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration. However, the response of the adult epicardium is suboptimal compared to the active contribution of the fetal epicardium to heart development. To understand the therapeutic value of epicardial-derived cells (EPDCs), a direct comparison of fetal and adult sources is paramount. Such analysis has been hampered by the lack of appropriate culture systems.\nHuman fetal and adult EPDCs were isolated from cardiac specimens obtained after informed consent. EPDCs were cultured in the presence of an inhibitor of the TGF\u03b2 receptor ALK5. EMT was induced by stimulation with 1\u00a0ng/ml TGF\u03b2. PCR, immunofluorescent staining, scratch assay, tube formation assay and RT\nIn this study, a novel protocol is presented that allows efficient isolation of human EPDCs from fetal and adult heart tissue. In vitro, EPDCs maintain epithelial characteristics and undergo EMT upon TGF\u03b2 stimulation. Although similar in several aspects, we observed important differences between fetal and adult EPDCs. Fetal and adult cells display equal migration abilities in their epithelial state. However, while TGF\u03b2 stimulation enhanced adult EPDC migration, it resulted in a reduced migration in fetal EPDCs. Matrigel assays revealed the ability of adult EPDCs to form tube-like structures, which was absent in fetal cells. Furthermore, we observed that fetal cells progress through EMT faster and undergo spontaneous EMT when TGF\u03b2 signaling is not suppressed, indicating that fetal EPDCs more rapidly respond to environmental changes.\nOur data suggest that fetal and adult EPDCs are in a different state of activation and that their phenotypic plasticity is determined by this activation state.

{"title": "RNA Contaminates Glycosaminoglycans Extracted from Cells and Tissues.", "abstract": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear negatively charged polysaccharides and important components of extracellular matrices and cell surface glycan layers such as the endothelial glycocalyx. The GAG family includes sulfated heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), dermatan sulfate (DS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), keratan sulfate, and non-sulfated hyaluronan. Because relative expression of GAGs is dependent on cell-type and niche, isolating GAGs from cell cultures and tissues may provide insight into cell- and tissue-specific GAG structure and functions. In our objective to obtain structural information about the GAGs expressed on a specialized mouse glomerular endothelial cell culture (mGEnC-1) we adapted a recently published GAG isolation protocol, based on cell lysis, proteinase K and DNase I digestion. Analysis of the GAGs contributing to the mGEnC-1 glycocalyx indicated a large HS and a minor CS content on barium acetate gel. However, isolated GAGs appeared resistant to enzymatic digestion by heparinases. We found that these GAG extracts were heavily contaminated with RNA, which co-migrated with HS in barium acetate gel electrophoresis and interfered with 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assays, resulting in an overestimation of GAG yields. We hypothesized that RNA may be contaminating GAG extracts from other cell cultures and possibly tissue, and therefore investigated potential RNA contaminations in GAG extracts from two additional cell lines, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and retinal pigmental epithelial cells, and mouse kidney, liver, spleen and heart tissue. GAG extracts from all examined cell lines and tissues contained varying amounts of contaminating RNA, which interfered with GAG quantification using DMMB assays and characterization of GAGs by barium acetate gel electrophoresis.

To gain insight into the transcriptional regulatory networks of SCN5A, we surveyed the promoter and first intronic regions of the SCN5A gene, predicting the presence of several binding sites for GATA transcription factors (TFs). Consistent with this prediction, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequential ChIP (Re-ChIP) assays show co-occupancy of cardiac GATA TFs GATA4 and GATA5 on promoter and intron 1 SCN5A regions in fresh-frozen human left ventricle samples. Gene reporter experiments show GATA4 and GATA5 synergism in the activation of the SCN5A promoter, and its dependence on predicted GATA binding sites. GATA4 and GATA6 mRNAs are robustly expressed in fresh-frozen human left ventricle samples as measured by highly sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). GATA5 mRNA is marginally but still clearly detected in the same samples. Importantly, GATA4 mRNA levels are strongly and positively correlated with SCN5A transcript levels in the human heart. Together, our findings uncover a novel mechanism of GATA TFs in the regulation of the SCN5A gene in human heart tissue.

F. (Family: Asparagaceae) rhizome has been claimed to possess antidiabetic activity in the ethno-medicinal literature in India. Therefore, present experiments were carried out to explore the protective role of edible (aqueous) extract of S. roxburghiana rhizome (SR) against experimentally induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its associated cardiomyopathy in Wistar rats.\nSR was chemically characterized by GC-MS analysis. Antidiabetic activity of SR (50 and 100 mg/kg, orally) was measured in high fat diets (ad libitum) + low-single dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) induced type 2 diabetic (T2D) rat. Fasting blood glucose level was measured at specific intermissions. Serum biochemical and inflammatory markers were estimated after sacrificing the animals. Besides, myocardial redox status, expressions of signal proteins (NF-\u03baB and PKCs), histological and ultrastructural studies of heart were performed in the controls and SR treated T2D rats.\nPhytochemical screening of the crude extract revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, sugar alcohols, sterols, amino acids, saturated fatty acids within SR. T2D rats exhibited significantly (p < 0.01) higher fasting blood glucose level with respect to control. Alteration in serum lipid profile (p < 0.01) and increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.01) and creatine kinase (p < 0.01) in the sera revealed the occurrence of hyperlipidemia and cell destruction in T2D rats. T2DM caused significant (p < 0.05-0.01) alteration in the biochemical markers in the sera. T2DM altered the redox status (p < 0.05-0.01), decreased (p < 0.01) the intracellular NAD and ATP concentrations in the myocardial tissues of experimental rats. While investigating the molecular mechanism, activation PKC isoforms was observed in the selected tissues. T2D rats also exhibited an up-regulation in nuclear NF-\u03baB (p65) in the cardiac tissues. So, oral administration of SR (50 and 500 mg/kg) could reduce hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, membrane disintegration, oxidative stress, vascular inflammation and prevented the activation of oxidative stress induced signaling cascades leading to cell death. Histological and ultra-structural studies of cardiac tissues supported the protective characteristics of SR.\nFrom the present findings it can be concluded that, SR could offer protection against T2DM and its associated cardio-toxicity via multiple mechanisms viz. hypoglycemic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-11-29", "authors": ["NiloyBhattacharjee", "RituKhanra", "Tarun KDua", "SusmitaDas", "BratatiDe", "MZia-Ul-Haq", "VincenzoDe Feo", "SaikatDewanjee"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0167131\n10.5001/omj.2012.68\n10.1186/s12967-014-0364-1\n10.1016/j.biochi.2011.11.010\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.08.022\n10.1016/S1470-2045(05)01736-5\n10.1053/meta.2000.17721\n10.1016/j.phrs.2005.05.004\n10.1016/j.fct.2009.07.038\n10.1371/journal.pone.0139831\n10.1016/j.jep.2016.01.009\n10.1016/j.jtemb.2008.10.001\n10.1006/bbrc.1996.5897\n10.1016/j.mex.2015.11.001\n10.1186/s12967-015-0430-3\n10.1371/journal.pone.0148757\n10.1179/1351000215Y.0000000021\n10.1016/j.jep.2016.02.002\n10.1002/mnfr.201400016\n10.1016/j.jep.2011.12.025\n10.1038/nature02520\n10.1126/science.1088949\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.01.063\n10.1186/s12967-015-0598-6\n10.1016/j.taap.2012.12.005\n10.1139/apnm-2015-0002\n10.1124/jpet.106.105163\n10.1080/10715760400016139\n10.1186/1476-511X-8-25\n10.1155/2015/691594\n10.1371/journal.pone.0132117\n10.1055/s-2004-832642\n10.4103/0974-8490.89743\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.07.001\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.12.013"}

Maximum peak load, elastic modulus and hardness increases with increasing CNT content. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies reveal the thermal and crystalline behaviour of PCL and its CNT composites. Biodegradation studies are performed in Pseudomonas Lipase enzymatic media, showing its specificity and effect on degradation rate.

{"title": "Effects of different doses of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid-modified Fe", "abstract": "Although iron oxide nanoparticles (IRONs) were applied in clinical magnetic resonance imaging in vivo and magnetic tissue engineering in vitro widely, the underlying effects of IRONs on the development of cardiomyocytes especially the intercellular junctions, intercalated discs (IDs), remain an unknown issue. Given the critical role of three-dimensional (3D) engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) in evaluation of nanoparticles toxicology, it remained necessary to understand the effects of IRONs on IDs assembly of cardiomyocytes in 3D environment. In this study, we first reconstituted collagen/Matrigel based ECTs in vitro and prepared IRONs with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA-IRONs). We found that the internalization of DMSA-IRONs by cardiac cells in dose-dependent manner was not associated with the cell distribution in 3D environment by determination of Prussian blue staining and transmission electronic microscopy. Significantly, through determination of western blotting and immunofluorescence of connexin 43, N-cadherin, desmoplakin, and plakoglobin, DMSA-IRONs enhanced the assembly of gap junctions, decreased mechanical junctions (adherens junctions and desmosomes) of cardiac cells but not in dose-dependent manner in ECTs at seventh day. In addition, DMSA-IRONs increased the vesicles secretion of cardiac cells in ECTs apparently compared to control groups. Overall, we conclude that the internalization of DMSA-IRONs by cardiac cells in dose-dependent manner enhanced the assembly of electrochemical junctions and decreased the mechanical related microstructures. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Inhibition of Angiotensin-II Production Increases Susceptibility to Acute Ischemia/Reperfusion Arrhythmia.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion lead to impairment of electrolyte balance and, eventually, lethal arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) production on heart tissue with ischemia-reperfusion damage, arrhythmia, and oxidative stress. MATERIAL AND METHODS Rats were divided into 4 groups: only ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R), captopril (CAP), aliskiren (AL), and CAP+AL. The drugs were given by gavage 30 min before anesthesia. Blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG) were recorded during MI/R procedures. The heart tissue and plasma was kept so as to evaluate the total oxidant (TOS), antioxidant status (TAS), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). RESULTS Creatine kinase-MB was not different among the groups. Although TAS was not affected by inhibition of Ang-II production, TOS was significantly lower in the CAP and/or AL groups than in the MI/R group. Furthermore, oxidative stress index was significantly attenuated in the CAP and/or AL groups. Captopril significantly increased the duration of VT during ischemia; however, it did not have any effect on the incidence of arrhythmias. During reperfusion periods, aliskiren and its combinations with captopril significantly reduced the incidence of other types of arrhythmias. Captopril alone had no effect on the incidence of arrhythmias, but significantly increased arrhythmias score and durations of arrhythmias during reperfusion. MAP and heart rate did not show changes in any groups during ischemic and reperfusion periods. CONCLUSIONS Angiotensin-II production appears to be associated with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, but Ang-II inhibitions increases arrhythmia, mainly by initiating ventricular ectopic beats.", "journal": "Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research", "date": "2016-11-28", "authors": ["EylemTaskin", "Kadir AliTuncer", "CelalGuven", "Salih TuncKaya", "NurcanDursun"], "doi": "10.12659/msm.896350"}

{"title": "Reentry and Ectopic Pacemakers Emerge in a Three-Dimensional Model for a Slab of Cardiac Tissue with Diffuse Microfibrosis near the Percolation Threshold.", "abstract": "Arrhythmias in cardiac tissue are generally associated with irregular electrical wave propagation in the heart. Cardiac tissue is formed by a discrete cell network, which is often heterogeneous. Recently, it was shown in simulations of two-dimensional (2D) discrete models of cardiac tissue that a wave crossing a fibrotic, heterogeneous region may produce reentry and transient or persistent ectopic activity provided the fraction of conducting connections is just above the percolation threshold. Here, we investigate the occurrence of these phenomena in three-dimensions by simulations of a discrete model representing a thin slab of cardiac tissue. This is motivated (i) by the necessity to study the relevance and properties of the percolation-related mechanism for the emergence of microreentries in three dimensions and (ii) by the fact that atrial tissue is quite thin in comparison with ventricular tissue. Here, we simplify the model by neglecting details of tissue anatomy, e. g. geometries of atria or ventricles and the anisotropy in the conductivity. Hence, our modeling study is confined to the investigation of the effect of the tissue thickness as well as to the comparison of the dynamics of electrical excitation in a 2D layer with the one in a 3D slab.

Main cause for this unfavourable outcome is the unphysiological hemodynamic of the Fontan circulation, such as subnormal systemic cardiac output and increased systemic-venous pressure. To overcome this limitation, we are developing the concept of a contractile extracardiac Fontan-tunnel. In this study, we evaluated the survival and structural development of a tissue-engineered conduit under in vivo conditions. Engineered heart tissue was generated from ventricular heart cells of neonatal Wistar rats, fibrinogen and thrombin. Engineered heart tissues started beating around day 8 in vitro and remained contractile in vivo throughout the experiment. After culture for 14 days constructs were implanted around the right superior vena cava of Wistar rats (n = 12). Animals were euthanized after 7, 14, 28 and 56 days postoperatively. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed cardiomyocytes arranged in thick bundles within the engineered heart tissue-conduit. Immunostaining of sarcomeric actin, alpha-actin and connexin 43 revealed a well -developed cardiac myocyte structure. Magnetic resonance imaging (d14, n = 3) revealed no constriction or stenosis of the superior vena cava by the constructs. Engineered heart tissues survive and contract for extended periods after implantation around the superior vena cava of rats.

Exosomes were isolated from the culture-conditioned media and delivered to athymic rats after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Echocardiography at day 3 post-myocardial infarction suggested statistically improved function in neonatal hypoxic and neonatal normoxic groups compared with saline-treated controls. At 28 days post-myocardial infarction, exosomes derived from neonatal normoxia, neonatal hypoxia, infant hypoxia, and child hypoxia significantly improved cardiac function compared with those from saline-treated controls.

Many cell types have been used (skeletal myoblasts, hematopoietic, endothelial or mesenchymal progenitors, cardiac cells\u2026), most often in the indication of post-ischemic heart failure rather than in the indication of genetic dilated cardiomyopathy. It is easier, indeed, to target a restricted area than the whole myocardium. Several clinical trials have reported slight but encouraging functional benefits, but their interpretations were frequently limited by the small sizes of cohorts, and by the biological variabilities inherent to the patients status and to the biology of the cells. These trials also shed light on unexpected mechanisms of action of the cells, which are changing the concepts and methodologies of the studies. The functional benefits observed would be due, indeed, to the secretion of trophic factors by the cells, instead of their true structural and mechanical integration within the myocardial tissue. Accordingly, the new generations of clinical trials aim at improving the size and homogeneity of the patient cohorts to increase the statistical power. On the other hand, several studies are associating or conditionning cells with biomaterials or cocktails of cytokines to improve their survival and their biological efficacy. In parallel, bio-engineering investigates several ways to support cells in vitro and in vivo, to sustain the architectural structure of the failing myocardium, to produce ex vivo some true substitutive cardiac tissue, or to purely replace the cells by their active secreted products.

The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the influences of periodontitis on levels of cardiac oxidative stress.\nTwenty rats were separated into two groups: control and experimental periodontitis (EP). Periodontitis was induced by placing a 3.0 silk suture in the cervix of the left and right mandibular first molar teeth for 5 wk. At the end of the experiment, the animals were killed and blood samples and mandibular and ventricular cardiac tissue samples were collected. Levels of alveolar bone loss were determined using measurements performed on histological slices and radiographies. Left ventricular tissue 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, malonylaldehyde, glutathione peroxidase, total oxidant status, total antioxidant status (TAS) levels and serum paraoxonase-1 activity were evaluated biochemically.\nMeasurements performed on the histological slices and radiographies demonstrated that applying the ligature caused obvious alveolar bone loss. Oxidative damage markers (malonylaldehyde, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, oxidative stress index: total oxidant status/TAS) were significantly higher, and antioxidant markers (glutathione peroxidase, TAS) were statistically insignificantly higher, in the hearts of rats with EP when compared to the controls. In addition, reduced serum paraoxonase-1 activity was also detected in the EP group.\nThe pronounced increase in cardiac oxidative stress caused by periodontitis was due to an excessive increase in the production of reactive oxygen species, rather than due to decreased antioxidant capacity.

Puerarin is wildly used for treatment of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease in China, and recently some studies have shown its anti-cardiac fibrotic effect on myocardial hypertrophy. The purpose of our study was to determine whether puerarin has an anti-cardiac fibrotic effect after MI and find the potential mechanism. A mouse model of MI was established by standard LAD coronary artery ligation, and cardiac fibrosis was confirmed by Masson's staining and the expression of collagen I, III and \u03b1-SMA. The expression level of F4/80 (macrophage/monocyte marker in mouse), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and TGF-\u03b21 in cardiac tissue treated with or without puerarin was evaluated by immunohistochemistry analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The downstream protein phospho-Smad (small mother against decapentaplegic) 2/3 was evaluated by westernblot. The results displayed that puerarin could inhibit the recruitment and activation of monocytes/macrophages, decrease the expression of TGF-\u03b21 in the cardiac tissues, and consequently significantly attenuated cardiac fibrosis after MI. Our results also displayed a strong positive correlation between MCP-1 and TGF-\u03b21 expression in MI. Thus, this study revealed the mechanism by which prevented cardiac fibrosis after MI through a decrease in MCP-1 expression and an inhibition TGF-\u03b21 pathway, and indicated puerarin could be a potential agent in attenuating MI-induced cardiac fibrosis.", "journal": "American journal of translational research", "date": "2016-11-11", "authors": ["ZhiwenTao", "YingbinGe", "NingtianZhou", "YunleWang", "WeiliCheng", "ZhijianYang"], "doi": null}

The primary objective of a scaffold used in tissue engineering is the recreation of the natural 3D environment most suitable for an adequate tissue growth. An important aspect of this commitment is to mimic the fibrillar structure of the extracellular matrix, which provides essential guidance for cell organization, survival, and function. Recent advances in nanotechnology have significantly improved our capacities to mimic the extracellular matrix. Among them, electrospinning is well known for being easy to process and cost effective. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly popular for biomedical applications and it is most definitely the cutting edge technique to make scaffolds that mimic the extracellular matrix for industrial applications.

Currently, most measurements of ECTC contractility are either made isometrically, with fixed length and without control of the applied force, or auxotonically against a variable force, with the length changing during the contraction. The \"I-Wire\" platform addresses the unmet need to control the force applied to ECTCs while interrogating their passive and active mechanical and electrical characteristics. A six-well plate with inserted PDMS casting molds containing neonatal rat cardiomyocytes cultured with fibrin for 13-15days is mounted on the motorized mechanical stage of an inverted microscope equipped with a fast sCMOS camera. A calibrated flexible probe provides strain load of the ECTC via lateral displacement, and the microscope detects the deflections of both the probe and the ECTC. The ECTCs exhibited longitudinally aligned cardiomyocytes with well-developed sarcomeric structure, recapitulated the Frank-Starling force-tension relationship, and demonstrated expected transmembrane action potentials, electrical and mechanical restitutions, and responses to both \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation and blebbistatin. The I-Wire platform enables creation and mechanical and electrical characterization of ECTCs, and hence can be valuable in the study of cardiac diseases, drug screening, drug development, and the qualification of cells for tissue-engineered regenerative medicine.\nThere is a growing interest in creating engineered heart tissue constructs for basic cardiac research, applied research in cardiac pharmacology, and repair of damaged hearts. We address an unmet need to characterize fully the performance of these tissues with our simple \"I-Wire\" assay that allows application of controlled forces to three-dimensional cardiac fiber constructs and measurement of both the electrical and mechanical properties of the construct. The advantage of I-Wire over other approaches is that the constructs being measured are truly three-dimensional, rather than a single layer of cells grown within a microfluidic device.

The I-Wire engineered cardiac tissue construct (ECTC) is a novel experimental platform to investigate cardiac cell mechanics during auxotonic contraction. Whereas passive biomaterials often exhibit nonlinear and dissipative behavior, active tissue equivalents, such as ECTCs, also expend metabolic energy to perform mechanical work that presents additional challenges in quantifying their properties. The I-Wire model uses the passive mechanical response to increasing applied tension to measure the inherent stress and resistance to stretch of the construct before, during, and after treatments. Both blebbistatin and isoproterenol reduced prestress and construct stiffness; however, blebbistatin treatment abolished subsequent force-generating potential while isoproterenol enhanced this property. We demonstrate that the described model can replicate the response of these constructs to intrinsic changes in force-generating potential in response to both increasing frequency of stimulation and decreasing starting length. This analysis provides a useful mathematical model of the I-Wire platform, increases the number of parameters that can be derived from the device, and serves as a demonstration of quantitative characterization of nonlinear, active biomaterials. We anticipate that this quantitative analysis of I-Wire constructs will prove useful for qualifying patient-specific cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts prior to their utilization for cardiac regenerative medicine.\nPassive biomaterials may have non-linear elasticity and losses, but engineered muscle tissue also exhibits time- and force-dependent contractions. Historically, mathematical muscle models include series-elastic, parallel-elastic, contractile, and viscous elements. While hearts-on-a-chip can demonstrate in vitro the contractile properties of engineered cardiac constructs and their response to drugs, most of these use cellular monolayers that cannot be readily probed with controlled forces. The I-Wire platform described in the preceding paper by Sidorov et al. addresses these limitations with three-dimensional tissue constructs to which controlled forces can be applied.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 81 MHP, 9-12 weeks of age, from 10 municipalities in Yucatan, Mexico. The prevalence was estimated by the detection of T. gondii IgG antibodies via an indirect ELISA assay. The parasite burden was also determined by testing genomic DNA from sampled tissues using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), which amplified a 62bp product from the B1 gene of T. gondii. The seroprevalence was 53% (43/81), ranging from 0 to 100% seropositivity rate depending on the municipalitie of origin. The qPCR allowed detection of T. gondii in 5.3% (9/168) of the tissue samples, with an average of 2.5\u00b12.71 parasites per gram (0.17\u00b10.18 parasite equivalent) for the leg muscle tissue, 0.26\u00b10.39 (0.01\u00b10.02 parasite equivalent) for the heart tissue and 0.31\u00b10.37 (0.021\u00b10.025 parasite equivalent) for the tongue tissue.

Twenty-eight days after transplantation, the hearts repaired with hEHT strips exhibited, within the scar, human heart muscle grafts, which had remuscularized 12% of the infarct area. These grafts showed cardiomyocyte proliferation, vascularization, and evidence for electrical coupling to the intact heart tissue in a subset of engrafted hearts. hEHT strips improved left ventricular function by 31% compared to that before implantation, whereas the hEET or cell-free patches had no effect.

Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in strain energy storage between anterior and posterior portions of each chamber, except for the right ventricle where strain energy storage in the posterior specimens were higher than the anterior specimens. Additionally, all chambers from the left side of the heart had significantly higher strain energy storage than the corresponding chambers on the right side.

The present study was aimed to investigate the effects and the possible mechanisms of the Dendrobium officinale extracts (DOE) on diabetic cardiomyopathy in mice. The diabetic model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin at the dose of 50mg/kg body weight for 5 consecutive days. After 8 weeks treatment of DOE, mice were sacrificed, blood sample and heart tissues were collected. Our results showed that Streptozotocin-induced diabetic model was effectively achieved and serum CK and LDH levels were significantly increased in mice with diabetic cardiomyopathy. Pretreatment with DOE decreased the heart-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW) and showed an evident hypoglycemic effect. DOE pretreatment significantly decreased CK, LDH, TC and TG levels, limited the production of MDA and increased the activities of T-SOD. The histological analysis of Oil red O staining and Sirius red staining showed an obvious amelioration of cardiac injury, inhibition of cardiac lipid accumulation and deposition of collagen when pretreatment with DOE. In addition, Western blot detection and analysis showed that DOE down-regulated the expression of TGF-\u03b2, collegan-1, fibronectin, NF-\u03baB, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we examined the potential molecular mechanisms of cardiac damage caused by mitochondrial tRNA mutation with high-salt stimulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Unanesthetized, 44-wk-old, male, SHR were divided into four groups: SHR, SHR with high-salt stimulation for 8 wk (SHR + NaCl), SHR carrying tRNA mutations (SHR + M), and SHR + M with high-salt stimulation for 8 wk (SHR + M + NaCl). Healthy Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls. Left ventricular mass and interventricular septum were highest in the SHR + M + NaCl group (P < 0.05), while ejection fraction was lowest in the SHR + M + NaCl group (P < 0.05). Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed myocardial cell hypertrophy with interstitial fibrosis and localized inflammatory cell infiltration, in the hypertensive groups, particularly in the SHR + M + NaCl group. Electron microscopy showed different degrees of mitochondrial cavitation in heart tissue of the hypertensive groups, which was highest in the SHR + M + NaCl group. In hypertensive animals, levels of reactive oxygen species were highest in the SHR + M + NaCl group (P < 0.05). Expression of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and the apoptosis regulator Bax were highest in the SHR + M + NaCl group (P < 0.05), which also showed evidence of VDAC and Bax colocalization (P < 0.05).

Longitudinal, transverse and radial strain, and strain rate were assessed from six basal and six mid-ventricular segments of the left ventricle, as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography.\nLeft ventricular wall thickness, systolic and diastolic diameters, left ventricular diameters normalised to body surface area, end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, cardiac output and cardiac index values were within normal limits and statistically similar in the patient and control groups (p > 0.05). Global strain and strain rate: the patient group had a statistically significant lower peak A longitudinal velocity of the left basal point and peak E longitudinal velocity of the left basal (VAbasR) point, and higher global peak A longitudinal/circumferential strain rate (GSRa) compared to the corresponding values of the control group (p < 0.05).

Unfortunately, while high-quality regeneration can be performed in amphibians and zebrafish hearts, mammalian hearts do not respond in kind. Indeed, a long-term loss of proliferative capacity in mammalian adult cardiomyocytes in combination with dysregulated induction of tissue fibrosis impairs mammalian endogenous heart regenerative capacity, leading to deleterious cardiac remodeling at the end stage of heart failure. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that cardiomyocyte proliferation capacity is retained in mammals very soon after birth, and cardiac regeneration potential is correspondingly preserved in some preadolescent vertebrates after myocardial infarction. There is therefore great interest in uncovering the molecular mechanisms that may allow heart regeneration during adult stages.

The DH-SPIO NPs had a mean particle size of 125\u00b110 nm and a zeta potential of \u201335\u00b13 mV. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, and MTT assay were used to investigate the properties of DH-SPIO NPs. The internalization of DH-SPIO NPs into A549 tumor cells was examined using fluorescence microscopy and quantified by flow cytometry. Prussian blue staining, total iron assay, in vitro MRI and transmission electron microscopy showed that DH-SPIO NPs had high superparamagnetic clustering effect. In vivo therapy of A549 human lung carcinoma, DHSPIO NPs displayed a higher efficacy than Dox in inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging the survival of mice bearing tumors. Meanwhile, the pathological damage to the cardiac tissue in mice treated with DH-SPIO NPs was significantly less severe than that of mice treated with free Dox at the same dosage. These results show that DH-SPIO NPs are promising biomaterials for combined drug therapy and clinical imaging.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical nanotechnology", "date": "2016-11-01", "authors": ["YiYang", "QingFaGuo", "JinRongPeng", "JingSu", "XiaoLingLu", "YongXiangZhao", "ZhiYongQian"], "doi": "10.1166/jbn.2016.2298"}
{"title": "Telocytes in Cardiac Tissue Architecture and Development.", "abstract": "The heart is a paradigm of organ provided with unique three-dimensional tissue architecture that is molded during complex organogenesis processes and is required for the heart's physiological function. The cardiac stroma plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of the normal heart architecture, as well as of its changes occurring in cardiac diseases. Recent studies have shown that the cardiac stroma, including the epicardium, myocardial interstitium, and endocardium, contains typical telocytes: these cells establish complex spatial relationships with cardiomyocytes and cardiac stem cells suggestive for a regulatory role over three-dimensional organization of heart tissues. Telocytes appear early during prenatal heart development and represent a major stromal cell population in the adult heart. Numerous studies have highlighted that telocytes, through juxtacrine and paracrine mechanisms, can behave as nursing cells for cardiac muscle stem cells modulating their growth and differentiation. On these grounds, a possible role of telocytes in cardiac regeneration can be postulated: this hypothesis is supported by recent experimental findings that reduction of cardiac telocytes due to hypoxia may concur to explain the negligible regenerative ability of the post-infarcted heart, while grafting of telocytes in the injured myocardium improves adverse heart remodeling. The increasing knowledge on the properties of cardiac telocytes is orienting the research toward their role as key regulators of the three-dimensional architecture of the heart and new promising targets for cardiac regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2016-11-01", "authors": ["DanieleBani"], "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-1061-3_8"}

Here, we introduce a facile route for fabricating a new class of instrumented cardiac microphysiological devices via multimaterial three-dimensional (3D) printing.

We validated that these embedded sensors provide non-invasive, electronic readouts of tissue contractile stresses inside cell incubator environments.

Recently, cell sheet technology has been investigated for its potential applicability in cardiac injury. However, a detailed comparison of the functional recovery in the injured myocardium between cell sheets and conventional cell injection has not been adequately examined. ADSCs were isolated from the inguinal fat tissue of ICR mice. Three groups of AMI induction only (sham), intramyocardial injection of ADSCs (imADSC), and ADSC sheet transplantation (shADSC) were compared by using rat AMI models. Engraftment of ADSCs was better sustained through 28 days in the shADSC group compared with the imADSC group. Ejection fraction was improved in both imADSC and shADSC groups compared with the sham group. Ventricular wall thickness in the infarct zone was higher in the shADSC group compared with both imADSC and sham groups. Growth factor and cytokine expression in the implanted heart tissue were higher in the shADSC group compared with both imADSC and sham groups. Furthermore, only the shADSC group showed donor-derived vessels at the peri-infarct zone.

However, its mechanism is still not clear. The aim of the present study was to confirm the therapeutic effects of phytoestrogen genistein on PAH in monocrotaline-induced rat model and to explore its mechanism.\nSprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group (n=8), PAH group (n=8), genistein treament group with three different doses (n=8 in each dose group) and group of PI3K inhibitor LY294002. The rat model of PAH was induced by monocrotaline (MCT). The situation of survival of rats was observed. Pathological studies of lung and heart tissues were performed. Western-blot detection of P-Akt and P-eNOS expression levels in lung tissue was carried out. Nitrate reductase analysis was used to measure nitric oxide (NO) in lung tissue.\nGenistein treatment resulted in significant improvement in the speed of tricuspid regurgitation, diameter of pulmonary artery, mean pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy index. Genistein treatment also resulted in significant improvement in the stenosis of pulmonary artery, proliferation of smooth muscle, right ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial hypertrophy. These therapeutic effects were more obvious with increasing dose of genistein. After genistein treatment, amelioration in survival rates of PAH rats was observed. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could block these therapeutic effects. In rat lung tissue, P-Akt, P-eNOS and NO expressions were increased significantly in genistein treatment group when compared with PAH group (p<0.05, respectively). The increase in expression level of P-Akt, P-eNOS and NO was correlated with genistein dose. P-Akt, P-eNOS and NO expressions in lung tissue increased slightly in the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 group when compared with PAH group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05).\nWe confirmed that genistein could relax pulmonary vascular resistance, reduce pulmonary artery pressure, improve right heart function and ameliorate survival rate in the rat model of PAH.

{"title": "Immune Modulation of Cardiac Repair and Regeneration: The Art of Mending Broken Hearts.", "abstract": "The accumulation of immune cells is among the earliest responses that manifest in the cardiac tissue after injury. Both innate and adaptive immunity coordinate distinct and mutually non-exclusive events governing cardiac repair, including elimination of the cellular debris, compensatory growth of the remaining cardiac tissue, activation of resident or circulating precursor cells, quantitative and qualitative modifications of the vascular network, and formation of a fibrotic scar. The present review summarizes the mounting evidence suggesting that the inflammatory response also guides the regenerative process following cardiac damage. In particular, recent literature has reinforced the central role of monocytes/macrophages in poising the refreshment of cardiomyocytes in myocardial infarction- or apical resection-induced cardiac insult. Macrophages dictate cardiac myocyte renewal through stimulation of preexisting cardiomyocyte proliferation and/or neovascularization. Nevertheless, substantial efforts are required to identify the nature of these macrophage-derived factors as well as the molecular mechanisms engendered by the distinct subsets of macrophages pertaining in the cardiac tissue. Among the growing inflammatory intermediaries that have been recognized as essential player in heart regeneration, we will focus on the role of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-13. Finally, it is likely that within the mayhem of the injured cardiac tissue, additional types of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, will enter the dance to ignite and refresh the broken heart. However, the protective and detrimental inflammatory pathways have been mainly deciphered in animal models.

Established and validated metabolomics assays of the lungs, hearts. and blood of young adult male rats following 1, 3, 8, and 21 days of exposure to ETS along with day-matched sham control rats (n = 8) were performed using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry, BinBase database processing, multivariate statistical modeling, and MetaMapp biochemical mapping. A total of 489 metabolites were measured in the lung, heart, and blood, of which 142 metabolites were identified using a standardized metabolite annotation pipeline. Acute and repeated subchronic exposure to ETS was associated with significant metabolic changes in the lung related to energy metabolism, defense against reactive oxygen species, substrate uptake and transport, nucleotide metabolism, and substrates for structural components of collagen and membrane lipids. Metabolic changes were least prevalent in heart tissues but abundant in blood under repeated subchronic ETS exposure. Our analyses revealed that ETS causes alterations in metabolic networks, especially those associated with lung structure and function and found as systemic signals in the blood.

The structural proteins of caveolae, caveolins, regulate effector pathways in anaesthetic-induced cardioprotection, including the RISK pathway. Helium (He) postconditioning (HePoc) is known to mimic anaesthetic conditioning and to prevent damage from myocardial infarction. We hypothesize that HePoc regulates caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 (Cav-1 and Cav-3) expression in the rat heart and activates the RISK pathway. Male Wistar rats (n=8, each group) were subjected to 25min of cardiac ischaemia followed by reperfusion (I/R) for 5, 15 or 30min (I/R 5/15/30). The HePoc groups underwent I/R with 70% helium ventilation during reperfusion (IR+He 5/15/30min). Sham animals received surgical treatment without I/R.

{"title": "Multiscale Characterization of Engineered Cardiac Tissue Architecture.", "abstract": "In a properly contracting cardiac muscle, many different subcellular structures are organized into an intricate architecture. While it has been observed that this organization is altered in pathological conditions, the relationship between length-scales and architecture has not been properly explored. In this work, we utilize a variety of architecture metrics to quantify organization and consistency of single structures over multiple scales, from subcellular to tissue scale as well as correlation of organization of multiple structures. Specifically, as the best way to characterize cardiac tissues, we chose the orientational and co-orientational order parameters (COOPs). Similarly, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were selected for their consistent architectural behavior. The engineered cells and tissues were stained for four architectural structures: actin, tubulin, sarcomeric z-lines, and nuclei. We applied the orientational metrics to cardiac cells of various shapes, isotropic cardiac tissues, and anisotropic globally aligned tissues. With these novel tools, we discovered: (1) the relationship between cellular shape and consistency of self-assembly; (2) the length-scales at which unguided tissues self-organize; and (3) the correlation or lack thereof between organization of actin fibrils, sarcomeric z-lines, tubulin fibrils, and nuclei. All of these together elucidate some of the current mysteries in the relationship between force production and architecture, while raising more questions about the effect of guidance cues on self-assembly function.

{"title": "Patient-Specific Computational Analysis of Ventricular Mechanics in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.", "abstract": "Patient-specific biventricular computational models associated with a normal subject and a pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patient were developed to investigate the disease effects on ventricular mechanics. These models were developed using geometry reconstructed from magnetic resonance (MR) images, and constitutive descriptors of passive and active mechanics in cardiac tissues. Model parameter values associated with ventricular mechanical properties and myofiber architecture were obtained by fitting the models with measured pressure-volume loops and circumferential strain calculated from MR images using a hyperelastic warping method. Results show that the peak right ventricle (RV) pressure was substantially higher in the PAH patient (65\u2009mmHg versus 20\u2009mmHg), who also has a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF) in both ventricles (left ventricle (LV): 39% versus 66% and RV: 18% versus 64%). Peak systolic circumferential strain was comparatively lower in both the left ventricle (LV) and RV free wall (RVFW) of the PAH patient (LV: -6.8% versus -13.2% and RVFW: -2.1% versus -9.4%). Passive stiffness, contractility, and myofiber stress in the PAH patient were all found to be substantially increased in both ventricles, whereas septum wall in the PAH patient possessed a smaller curvature than that in the LV free wall. Simulations using the PAH model revealed an approximately linear relationship between the septum curvature and the transseptal pressure gradient at both early-diastole and end-systole. These findings suggest that PAH can induce LV remodeling, and septum curvature measurements may be useful in quantifying transseptal pressure gradient in PAH patients.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "date": "2016-10-28", "authors": ["CeXi", "CandaceLatnie", "XiaodanZhao", "Ju LeTan", "Samuel TWall", "MartinGenet", "LiangZhong", "Lik ChuanLee"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4034559"}

To visualize enterovirus infection with a diagnostic intent, many studies have applied a commercially available antibody (anti-CVB5 VP1, clone 5-D8/1, Dako, Hamburg, Germany) that identifies VP1 of different enteroviral serotypes. Many antibodies, however, have been found to bind non-specifically to proteins of cardiomyocytes and in the interstitial space, resulting in non-specific staining in immunohistochemistry. In this paper we show that the anti-CVB5 VP1 antibody, recognizing VP1 of coxsackieviruses and widely used in diagnostics and research, shows strong cross-reactivity with cellular proteins in the heart (and pancreas) of humans and mice, which calls for a more specific antibody to be used for diagnostic purposes. We observed by Western blot analyses of lysates from human heart tissue samples and HeLa cells two cross-reactive bands when using clone 5-D8/1. Peptide mass fingerprinting (MALDI-TOF) identified these proteins as creatine kinase (B-type) and tubulin, confirming that this mAb detects cellular proteins in addition to viral VP1. In order to overcome the problems of false positive VP1 staining we generated a new highly specific and sensitive monoclonal antibody (Cox mAB 31A2) that recognizes VP1 from CVB3.

While pharmacological treatments can reduce progression to heart failure following myocardial infarction, there still exists a need for new therapies that promote better healing postinjury for a more functional cardiac repair and methods to understand how the changes to tissue mechanical properties influence cell phenotype and function following injury. To address this need, we have optimized a silk-based hydrogel platform containing cardiac tissue-derived extracellular matrix (cECM). These silk-cECM hydrogels have tunable mechanical properties, as well as rate-controllable hydrogel stiffening over time. In vitro, silk-cECM scaffolds led to enhanced cardiac fibroblast (CF) cell growth and viability with culture time. cECM incorporation improved expression of integrin an focal adhesion proteins, suggesting that CFs were able to interact with the cECM in the hydrogel. Subcutaneous injection of silk hydrogels in rats demonstrated that addition of the cECM led to endogenous cell infiltration and promoted endothelial cell ingrowth after 4\u00a0weeks in vivo. This naturally derived silk fibroin platform is applicable to the development of more physiologically relevant constructs that replicate healthy and diseased tissue in vitro and has the potential to be used as an injectable therapeutic for cardiac repair. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Although the absolute risk of cardiotoxicity can be reduced with modern irradiation techniques, cardiotoxic chemotherapy increases the risk of late damage.

This study evaluated the influence of different amplitudes of inspiration breath hold (IBH) during simulated left-sided breast irradiation on cardiac doses compared to free breathing (FB).\nCT data of 11\u00a0lung cancer patients were retrospectively used as left-sided pseudo-breast cancer cases. Two CT scans were used, one during IBH and one during FB, and two treatment plans were generated. Relevant heart, lung, and left anterior descending artery (LAD) parameters were derived from dose-volume histograms.

Particularly, the effects of ACEis on plasma and cardiac metabolites of the \"classical\" and \"alternative\" renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in HTx patients are unknown.\nThis cross-sectional study used a novel mass spectrometry-based approach to analyze plasma and tissue RAS regulation in homogenates of heart biopsy specimens from 10 stable HTx patients without RAS blockade and in 15 patients with ACEi therapy. Angiotensin (Ang) levels in plasma and Ang formation rates in biopsy tissue homogenates were measured.\nPlasma Ang II formation is exclusively ACE dependent, whereas cardiac Ang II formation is primarily chymase dependent in HTx patients. ACEi therapy substantially increased plasma Ang-(1-7), the key effector of the alternative RAS, leaving plasma Ang II largely intact. Importantly, neprilysin and prolyl-carboxypeptidase but not angiotensin converting enzyme 2 are essential for cardiac tissue Ang-(1-7) formation.\nACE is the key enzyme for the generation of plasma Ang II, whereas chymase is responsible for cardiac tissue production of Ang II. Furthermore, our findings reveal that neprilysin and prolyl-carboxypeptidase are the essential cardiac enzymes for the alternative RAS after HTx.

It is a complex process involving numerous mechanisms occurring in the intracellular and extracellular environments, and it is mediated in part by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The imbalance between the cellular formation of free radicals and cells' capacity to defend against them can cause cardiac tissue injuries. In this context, ROS play an essential role in both the organ injury and repair processes. After reperfusion, infiltration into the myocardium of inflammatory leucocytes, such as macrophages and neutrophils, causes further ROS production beyond the initiation of the inflammatory cascade. In this case, ROS overproduction is crucial in cardiac injury, and it can increase the complications related to cardiac reperfusion. In myocardial tissue, ROS can be produced from several sources, such as xanthine oxidase, cytochrome oxidase, cyclooxygenase, mediated unsaturated fatty acid oxidation, oxidation of catecholamines, mitochondrial oxidation, activation of leukocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, iron release, and reduction-oxidation reaction cycling; all of these sources reduce molecular oxygen in the reperfused myocardium.

Glucolipotoxicity causes cardiomyocyte injury by increasing energy insufficiency, impairing proteasomal-mediated protein degradation and inducing apoptosis. Proteasome-evading proteins are degraded by autophagy in the lysosome, whose metabolism and function are regulated by master regulator transcription factor EB (TFEB). Limited studies have examined the impact of glucolipotoxicity on intra-lysosomal signaling proteins and their regulators. By utilizing a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, type-1 diabetes (Akita) and ex-vivo model of glucolipotoxicity (H9C2 cells and NRCM, neonatal rat cardiomyocyte), we examined whether glucolipotoxicity negatively targets TFEB and lysosomal proteins to dysregulate autophagy and cause cardiac injury. Despite differential effects of obesity and diabetes on LC3B-II, expression of proteins facilitating autophagosomal clearance such as TFEB, LAMP-2A, Hsc70 and Hsp90 were decreased in the obese and diabetic heart. In-vivo data was recapitulated in H9C2 and NRCM cells, which exhibited impaired autophagic flux and reduced TFEB content when exposed to a glucolipotoxic milieu. Notably, overloading myocytes with a saturated fatty acid (palmitate) but not an unsaturated fatty acid (oleate) depleted cellular TFEB and suppressed autophagy, suggesting a fatty acid specific regulation of TFEB and autophagy in the cardiomyocyte. The effect of glucolipotoxicity to reduce TFEB content was also confirmed in heart tissue from patients with Class-I obesity.

Macrophages from mice were cultured with CDCs-conditioned medium or with fibroblasts-conditioned medium as a control. Immunostaining showed that CDCs-conditioned medium significantly enhanced the expression of CD206 (a marker for M2 macrophages), but decreased the expression of CD86 (a marker for M1 macrophages) 3 days after culture. For animal studies, we used an acute myocardial infarction model of mice. We injected CDCs, fibroblasts, or saline only into the border zone of infarction.

Exacerbation of such heterogeneities or the emergence of dynamic factors can produce repolarization alternans, which are beat-to-beat alternations in the action potential time course. Traditionally, this was explained by restitution, but additional factors, such as cardiac memory, calcium handling dynamics, refractory period restitution, and mechano-electric feedback, are increasingly recognized as the underlying causes. The aim of this article is to review the mechanisms that generate cardiac repolarization alternans and convert spatially concordant alternans to the more arrhythmogenic spatially discordant alternans.

The mechanisms controlling desmosome assembly and remodeling in epithelial and cardiac tissue are poorly understood. We recently identified protein palmitoylation as a mechanism regulating desmosome dynamics. In this study, we have focused on the palmitoylation of the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-2 (Dsg2) and characterized the role that palmitoylation of Dsg2 plays in its localization and stability in cultured cells. We identified two cysteine residues in the juxtamembrane (intracellular anchor) domain of Dsg2 that, when mutated, eliminate its palmitoylation. These cysteine residues are conserved in all four desmoglein family members. Although mutant Dsg2 localizes to endogenous desmosomes, there is a significant delay in its incorporation into junctions, and the mutant is also present in a cytoplasmic pool. Triton X-100 solubility assays demonstrate that mutant Dsg2 is more soluble than wild-type protein. Interestingly, trafficking of the mutant Dsg2 to the cell surface was delayed, and a pool of the non-palmitoylated Dsg2 co-localized with lysosomal markers. Taken together, these data suggest that palmitoylation of Dsg2 regulates protein transport to the plasma membrane.

{"title": "Regulation of fibronectin gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts by scleraxis.", "abstract": "The glycoprotein fibronectin is a key component of the extracellular matrix. By interacting with numerous matrix and cell surface proteins, fibronectin plays important roles in cell adhesion, migration and intracellular signaling. Up-regulation of fibronectin occurs in tissue fibrosis, and previous studies have identified the pro-fibrotic factor TGF\u03b2 as an inducer of fibronectin expression, although the mechanism responsible remains unknown. We have previously shown that a key downstream effector of TGF\u03b2 signaling in cardiac fibroblasts is the transcription factor scleraxis, which in turn regulates the expression of a wide variety of extracellular matrix genes. We noted that fibronectin expression tracked closely with scleraxis expression, but it was unclear whether scleraxis directly regulated the fibronectin gene. Here, we report that scleraxis acts via two E-box binding sites in the proximal human fibronectin promoter to govern fibronectin expression, with the second E-box being both sufficient and necessary for scleraxis-mediated fibronectin expression to occur. A combination of electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that scleraxis interacted to a greater degree with the second E-box. Over-expression or knockdown of scleraxis resulted in increased or decreased fibronectin expression, respectively, and scleraxis null mice presented with dramatically decreased immunolabeling for fibronectin in cardiac tissue sections compared to wild-type controls. Furthermore, scleraxis was required for TGF\u03b2-induced fibronectin expression: TGF\u03b2 lost its ability to induce fibronectin expression following scleraxis knockdown. Together, these results demonstrate a novel and required role for scleraxis in the regulation of cardiac fibroblast fibronectin gene expression basally or in response to TGF\u03b2.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2016-10-21", "authors": ["Rushita ABagchi", "JustinLin", "RyanWang", "Michael PCzubryt"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-016-2439-1"}

{"title": "Studying the pathophysiologic connection between cardiovascular and nervous systems using stem cells.", "abstract": "The cardiovascular and nervous systems are deeply connected during development, health, and disease. Both systems affect and regulate the development of each other during embryogenesis and the early postnatal period. Specialized neural crest cells contribute to cardiac structures, and a number of growth factors released from the cardiac tissue (e.g., glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, neurturin, nerve growth factor, Neurotrophin-3) ensure proper maturation of the incoming parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons. Physiologically, the cardiovascular and nervous systems operate in harmony to adapt to various physical and emotional conditions to maintain homeostasis through sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Moreover, neurocardiac regulation involves a neuroaxis consisting of cortex, amygdala, and other subcortical structures, which have the ability to modify lower-level neurons in the hierarchy. Given the interconnectivity of cardiac and neural systems, when one undergoes pathological changes, the other is affected to a certain extent. In addition, there are specific neurocardiac diseases that affect both systems simultaneously, such as Huntington disease, Lewy body diseases, Friedreich ataxia, congenital heart diseases, Danon disease, and Timothy syndrome. Over the last decade, in vitro modeling of neurocardiac diseases using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has provided an invaluable opportunity to elevate our knowledge about the brain-heart connection, since previously primary cardiomyocytes and neurons had been extremely difficult to maintain long-term in vitro.

Ranolazine can reduce lethal arrhythmias by inhibiting late INa. However, little is known regarding its role in regulating the distribution of Nav1.5 during I/R. Therefore, we investigated the roles of ranolazine in post-I/R Nav1.5 expression and distribution in myocardium. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups: sham, I/R, Ran Pre, and Ran Delay. Electrocardiogram and arterial pressure were recorded during the procedure. Nav1.5 mRNA and protein levels in peri-infarct cardiac tissue were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. To further confirm the regulation of ranolazine on Nav1.5, GS967, another late INa inhibitor was used. Both pre- and delayed ranolazine treatments significantly reduced the incidence of severe ventricular arrhythmias, along with shortened corrected QT interval by 29.55% and QRS duration by 18.38% during I/R. The protein level of Nav1.5 decreased by 31.63% after I/R. Ranolazine and GS967 remained Nav1.5 protein expression and Nav1.5 redistribution on intercalated discs and lateral membranes, without affecting Nav1.5 mRNA level. In conclusion, upregulating Nav1.5 expression and redistribution on the intercalated discs and lateral membranes of cardiomyocytes may underlie the antiarrhythmic effects of ranolazine in I/R rats.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2016-10-18", "authors": ["XinWei", "AfangZhu", "YaliZhang", "ShanglongYao", "WeikeMao"], "doi": "10.1097/FJC.0000000000000412"}

Meyer, has been demonstrated to inhibit the cardiac hypertrophy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition remain poorly understood. Activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) mediated by tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) gets involved in the cardiac hypertrophy. This study is designed to investigate the effects and the potential mechanism of Rg1 on the abdominal aorta coarctation (AAC)-induced cardiac hypertrophy with focus on TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. The results showed that oral administration of Rg1 dose-dependently improved the pathological changes, decreased the ratios of left ventricular weight/body weight (LVW/BW) and heart weight/BW (HW/BW), corrected the dysfunction of the cardiac hemodynamics by decreasing the left ventricular systolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and increasing the maximal rate of left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressure (\u00b1dp/dtmax) compared with the AAC alone. Rg1 also downregulated the atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA expression and decreased the mRNA and protein expression of TNF-\u03b1 in the heart tissue of rats compared with the AAC alone. In addition, Rg1 and BAY, the specific inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, decreased the protein content and downregulated the mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic peptide in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes treated with TNF-\u03b1. Furthermore, Rg1 increased the protein expression of p65, the subunit of NF-\u03baB, in cytoplasm and decreased the expression p65 in nucleus of the heart tissue of rats undergoing the AAC and of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes treated with TNF-\u03b1.

In order to evaluate the protective effects of Corchorus olitorius leaves, twenty Wistar albino rats were divided into four different groups. The control group (Group-I) was supplied with normal laboratory pellets while groups II, III, and IV received normal laboratory pellets supplemented with arsenic contaminated rice, C. olitorius leaf powder (4\u00a0%), arsenic contaminated rice plus C. olitorius leaf powder (4\u00a0%) respectively. Different haematological parameters and serum indices were analyzed to evaluate the protective effects of Corchorus olitorius leaves against arsenic intoxication. To gather more supportive evidences of Corchorus olitorius potentiality against arsenic intoxication, histopathological analysis of liver, kidney, spleen and heart tissues was also performed.\nFrom the pot experiment, we have found a significant (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) increase of arsenic accumulation in different parts of rice with the increase of arsenic concentrations in irrigation water and the trend of accumulation was found as root\u2009>\u2009straw\u2009>\u2009husk\u2009>\u2009grain.

{"title": "Pulmonary Microwave Ablation Near the Heart: Antenna Positioning Can Mitigate Cardiac Complications in a Porcine Model.", "abstract": "Purpose To determine how close to the heart pulmonary microwave ablation can be performed without causing cardiac tissue injury or significant arrhythmia. Materials and Methods The study was performed with approval from the institutional animal care and use committee. Computed tomographic fluoroscopically guided microwave ablation of the lung was performed in 12 swine. Antennas were randomized to either parallel (180\u00b0 \u00b1 20\u00b0) or perpendicular (90\u00b0 \u00b1 20\u00b0) orientation relative to the heart surface and to distances of 0-10 mm from the heart. Ablations were performed at 65 W for 5 minutes or until a significant arrhythmia (asystole, heart block, bradycardia, supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia) developed. Heart tissue was evaluated with vital staining and histologic examination. Data were analyzed with mixed effects logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curves, and the Fisher exact test. Results Thirty-four pulmonary microwave ablations were performed with the antenna a median distance of 4 mm from the heart in both perpendicular (n = 17) and parallel (n = 17) orientation. Significant arrhythmias developed during six (18%) ablations. Cardiac tissue injury occurred with 17 ablations (50%). Risk of arrhythmia and tissue injury decreased with increasing antenna distance from the heart with both antenna orientations. No cardiac complication occurred with a distance of greater than or equal to 4.4 mm from the heart. The ablation zone extended to the pleural surface adjacent to the heart in 71% of parallel and 17% of perpendicular ablations performed 5-10 mm from the heart.

Previous studies by our group have shown that cardiomyocytes generate maximum contractile force when cultured on a substrate with a stiffness approximating native cardiac tissue. However, effects of substrate stiffness on the electrophysiology and ion currents in cardiomyocytes have not been fully characterized. In this study, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were cultured on the surface of flat polyacrylamide hydrogels with elastic moduli ranging from 1 to 25\u2009kPa. Using whole-cell patch clamping, action potentials and L-type calcium currents were recorded. Cardiomyocytes cultured on hydrogels with a 9\u2009kPa elastic modulus, similar to that of native myocardium, had the longest action potential duration. Additionally, the voltage at maximum calcium flux significantly decreased in cardiomyocytes on hydrogels with an elastic modulus higher than 9\u2009kPa, and the mean inactivation voltage decreased with increasing stiffness. Interestingly, the expression of the L-type calcium channel subunit \u03b1 gene and channel localization did not change with stiffness. Substrate stiffness significantly affects action potential length and calcium flux in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in a manner that may be unrelated to calcium channel expression. These results may explain functional differences in cardiomyocytes resulting from changes in the elastic modulus of the extracellular matrix, as observed during embryonic development, in ischemic regions of the heart after myocardial infarction, and during dilated cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Cell biochemistry and biophysics", "date": "2016-10-11", "authors": ["Sean DBoothe", "Jackson DMyers", "SeokwonPok", "JunpingSun", "YutaoXi", "Raymond MNieto", "JieCheng", "Jeffrey GJacot"], "doi": "10.1007/s12013-016-0758-1"}

Three unrelated male patients aged 34 to 52\u00a0years with cardiomyopathy and abnormal glycogen storage on endomyocardial biopsy were homozygous for the missense mutation p.Asp102His in GYG1. The mutated glycogenin-1 protein was expressed in cardiac tissue but had lost its ability to autoglucosylate as demonstrated by an in vitro assay and western blot analysis. It was therefore unable to form the primer for normal glycogen synthesis. Two of the patients showed similar patterns of heart dilatation, reduced ejection fraction and extensive late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. These two patients were severely affected, necessitating cardiac transplantation. The cardiomyocyte storage material was characterized by large inclusions of periodic acid and Schiff positive material that was partly resistant to alpha-amylase treatment consistent with polyglucosan. The storage material had, unlike normal glycogen, a partly fibrillar structure by electron microscopy. None of the patients showed signs or symptoms of muscle weakness but a skeletal muscle biopsy in one case revealed muscle fibres with abnormal glycogen storage. Glycogenin-1 deficiency is known as a rare cause of skeletal muscle glycogen storage disease, usually without cardiomyopathy. We demonstrate that it may also be the cause of severe cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure without skeletal muscle weakness.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in wild-type C57BL/6J mice was induced by transient ligation of the left anterior descending artery. GLA or vehicle (solvent) was administrated intraperitoneally to the mice before reperfusion started. After 24 h of myocardial reperfusion, ischemic size was revealed by Evans blue/TTC staining. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and microvascular thrombosis was assessed by immunofluorescence staining of affected heart tissue. We also measured the phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, P-GSK-3\u03b2, and cleaved caspase 3 in the myocardium. RESULTS Compared to the solvent-treated control group, GLA administration significantly reduced infarct size (GLA 13.85\u00b12.08% vs. Control 18.95\u00b10.97%, p<0.05) and improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (GLA 53.13\u00b11.11% vs. Control 49.99\u00b11.25%, p<0.05) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) (28.34\u00b10.71% vs. Control 25.11\u00b10.74%, p<0.05) in mice subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion. GLA also attenuated microvascular thrombosis (P<0.05) and increased the phosphorylation of pro-survival kinase AKT (P<0.05) and GSK-3\u03b2 (P<0.05) in the myocardium upon reperfusion injury.

We investigated the effects of exposure to 900 MHz EMF during adolescence on male adult rats. Twenty-four 21-day-old male rats were divided into three equal groups: control (Cont-Gr), sham (Shm-Gr) and EMF-exposed (EMF-Gr). EMF-Gr rats were placed in an EMF exposure cage (Plexiglas cage) for 1 h/day between postnatal days 21 and 59 and exposed to 900 MHz EMF. Shm-Gr rats were placed inside the Plexiglas cage under the same conditions and for the same duration, but were not exposed to EMF. All animals were sacrificed on postnatal day 60 and the hearts were extracted for microscopic and biochemical analyses. Biochemical analysis showed increased levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase, and reduced glutathione and catalase levels in EMF-Gr compared to Cont-Gr animals. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections from EMF-Gr animals exhibited structural changes and capillary congestion in the myocardium. The percentage of apoptotic myocardial cells in EMF-Gr was higher than in either Shm-Gr or Cont-Gr animals. Transmission electron microscopy of myocardial cells of EMF-Gr animals showed altered structure of Z bands, decreased myofilaments and pronounced vacuolization.

The need of integrating blood vessels brings additional complexity, limiting the available approaches that are suitable to produce integrated cardiovascular organoids. In this work we propose a novel hybrid strategy based on 3D bioprinting, to fabricate endothelialized myocardium. Enabled by the use of our composite bioink, endothelial cells directly bioprinted within microfibrous hydrogel scaffolds gradually migrated towards the peripheries of the microfibers to form a layer of confluent endothelium. Together with controlled anisotropy, this 3D endothelial bed was then seeded with cardiomyocytes to generate aligned myocardium capable of spontaneous and synchronous contraction. We further embedded the organoids into a specially designed microfluidic perfusion bioreactor to complete the endothelialized-myocardium-on-a-chip platform for cardiovascular toxicity evaluation. Finally, we demonstrated that such a technique could be translated to human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to construct endothelialized human myocardium.

Rats in the fifth and sixth groups received respective Se doses (0.5 or 1\u00a0mg/kg) for 6\u00a0days and then a single dose of CP administered on the sixth day. On day 7, the animals were sacrificed; blood samples were collected to measure malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels. Heart tissues were processed routinely and tissue sections were stained with H\u00a0+\u00a0E for light microscopic examination.

Both toxin classes are worldwide distributed, and food safety authorities have regulated their content in shellfish in many countries. Recently, YTXs and AZAs have been described as compounds with subacute cardiotoxic potential in rats owed to alterations of the cardiovascular function and ultrastructural heart damage. These molecules are also well known in vitro inducers of cell death. The aim of this study was to explore the presence of cardiomyocyte death after repeated subacute exposure of rats to AZA-1 and YTX for 15\u00a0days. Because autophagy and apoptosis are often found in dying cardiomyocytes, several autophagic and apoptotic markers were determined by western blot in heart tissues of these rats. The results showed that hearts from YTX-treated rats presented increased levels of the autophagic markers microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and beclin-1, nevertheless AZA-1-treated hearts evidenced increased levels of the apoptosis markers cleaved caspase-3 and -8, cleaved PARP and Fas ligand. Therefore, while YTX-induced damage to the heart triggers autophagic processes, apoptosis activation occurs in the case of AZA-1.

{"title": "Involvement of Macrophages in the Pathogenesis of Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy and Efficacy of Human iPS Cell-Derived Macrophages in Its Treatment.", "abstract": "We hypothesized that tissue-resident macrophages in familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) patients will exhibit qualitative or quantitative abnormalities, that may accelerate transthyretin (TTR)-derived amyloid deposition. To evaluate this, we examined the number and subset of tissue-resident macrophages in heart tissue from amyloid-deposited FAP and control patients. In both FAP and control patients, tissue-resident macrophages in heart tissue were all Iba+/CD163+/CD206+ macrophages. However, the number of macrophages was significantly decreased in FAP patients compared with control patients. Furthermore, the proportion of intracellular TTR in CD14+ monocytes was reduced in peripheral blood compared with healthy donors. Based on these results, we next examined degradation and endocytosis of TTR in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived myeloid lineage cells (MLs), which function like macrophages. iPS-MLs express CD163 and CD206, and belong to the inhibitory macrophage category. In addition, iPS-MLs degrade both native and aggregated TTR in a cell-dependent manner in vitro. Further, iPS-MLs endocytose aggregated, and especially polymerized, TTR. These results suggest that decreased tissue-localized macrophages disrupt clearance of TTR-derived amyloid deposits, leading to progression of a pathological condition in FAP patients. To improve this situation, clinical application of pluripotent stem cell-derived MLs may be useful as an approach for FAP therapy.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-10-04", "authors": ["GenkiSuenaga", "TokunoriIkeda", "YoshihiroKomohara", "KoutaroTakamatsu", "TatsuyukiKakuma", "MasayoshiTasaki", "YoheiMisumi", "MitsuharuUeda", "TakaakiIto", "SatoruSenju", "YukioAndo"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0163944\n10.1002/mus.20821\n10.2174/092986712800269317\n10.1136/jmg.31.5.351\n10.1136/jmg.31.4.293\n10.2183/pjab.86.694\n10.3109/07853890.2015.1068949\n10.1016/0304-3940(86)90037-6\n10.1021/bi00173a029\n10.1016/j.exer.2005.02.003\n10.1097/MPA.0b013e318249926a\n10.1210/endo-63-2-256\n10.1172/JCI105889\n10.1110/ps.8901\n10.1038/nature02265\n10.1007/s40120-015-0031-3\n10.1002/mus.23521\n10.1136/bcr-2012-006593\n10.1002/lt.21395\n10.1136/jnnp-2013-305973\n10.1097/TP.0000000000000574\n10.1038/nature12034\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00683\n10.4049/jimmunol.181.6.3733\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2015.06.001\n10.1152/ajpregu.00735.2009\n10.1038/nri978\n10.1080/07853890410033171\n10.1371/journal.pone.0067567\n10.1038/gt.2011.22\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.10.001\n10.1021/bi981876\n10.1111/cas.12015\n10.1097/00008480-200106000-00004\n10.1006/bbrc.1996.1112\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00514\n10.1182/blood-2010-02-258558\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.078915\n10.1016/0046-8177(91)90227-g\n10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01173.x\n10.1002/lt.500040303\n10.4049/jimmunol.177.8.5517\n10.1159/000337007\n10.1038/labinvest.2013.83\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00620\n10.5603/fhc.2011.0052\n10.1016/j.clim.2008.09.011\n10.1182/blood-2008-08-174466\n10.3109/13506129.2014.927759\n10.1002/art.39178"}

The number and diversity of mouse models is increasing rapidly through genetic engineering strategies, but detailed characterization of these models is still challenging because most phenotypic information is derived from time-consuming histological and biochemical analyses. To expand the biochemists' toolkit, we generated a set of targeted proteomic assays for mouse plasma and heart tissue, utilizing bottom-up LC/MRM-MS with isotope-labeled peptides as internal standards. Protein quantitation was performed using reverse standard curves, with LC-MS platform and curve performance evaluated by quality control standards. The assays comprising the final panel (101 peptides for 81 proteins in plasma; 227 peptides for 159 proteins in heart tissue) have been rigorously developed under a fit-for-purpose approach and utilize stable-isotope labeled peptides for every analyte to provide high-quality, precise relative quantitation. In addition, the peptides have been tested to be interference-free and the assay is highly multiplexed, with reproducibly determined protein concentrations spanning >4 orders of magnitude.

For possibly producing human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell microtissues (hBMSCMT) on an elastic silk fibroin (SF)-poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) based patches is hereby designed. After an elastic SF-PCL (SP) patch is fabricated, hyaluronic acid (HA)/SF-PCL(HSP) and HA-GRGD/SF-PCL(HGSP) patches are fabricated by photochemically grafting HA and HA-GRGD onto SP surfaces. The results show that the proliferations of hBMSC on HGSP patches significantly exceed those on the other patches, as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay.

The suitability of hiPSC-CM critically depends on how closely they share physiological properties of human adult cardiomyocytes (CM). Here we investigated whether a 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) culture format favors maturation and addressed the L-type Ca(2+)-current (ICa,L) as a readout. The results were compared with hiPSC-CM cultured in conventional monolayer (ML) and to our previous data from human adult atrial and ventricular CM obtained when identical patch-clamp protocols were used. HiPSC-CM were two- to three-fold smaller than adult CM, independently of culture format [capacitance ML 45 \u00b1 1 pF (n = 289), EHT 45 \u00b1 1 pF (n = 460), atrial CM 87 \u00b1 3 pF (n = 196), ventricular CM 126 \u00b1 8 pF (n = 50)]. Only 88% of ML cells showed ICa, but all EHT. Basal ICa density was 10 \u00b1 1 pA/pF (n = 207) for ML and 12 \u00b1 1 pA/pF (n = 361) for EHT and was larger than in adult CM [7 \u00b1 1 pA/pF (p < 0.05, n = 196) for atrial CM and 6 \u00b1 1 pA/pF (p < 0.05, n = 47) for ventricular CM].

While (-)-Bay K 8644, that activates ICa,L directly, increased ICa,Lto the same extent in ML and EHT, \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenoceptor effects were marginal in ML, but of same size as (-)-Bay K 8644 in EHT. The opposite was true for serotonin receptors. Sensitivity to \u03b21 and \u03b22-adrenoceptor stimulation was the same in EHT as in adult CM (-logEC50: 5.9 and 6.1 for norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi), respectively), but very low concentrations of Rp-8-Br-cAMPS were sufficient to suppress effects (-logEC50: 5.3 and 5.3 respectively for NE and Epi).

Male SD rats treated with isoproterenol (1\u00a0mg/kg/day via osmotic pump) received vehicle or saxagliptin (17.5\u00a0mg/kg via drinking water) for 2 weeks. In situ cardiac DPP-4 activity was measured by a colorimetric assay. Cardiac gene expressions were examined and an echocardiographic analysis was performed. Saxagliptin treatment significantly inhibited in situ cardiac DPP-4 activity and suppressed isoproterenol-induced myocardial remodeling and the expression of related genes without altering the blood glucose levels. Saxagliptin also significantly ameliorated cardiac diastolic dysfunction in isoproterenol-treated rats. In conclusion, the inhibition of DPP-4 activity in cardiac tissue by saxagliptin was associated with suppression of myocardial remodeling and cardiac diastolic dysfunction independently of its glucose-lowering action in isoproterenol-treated rats. Cardiac DPP-4 activity may contribute to myocardial remodeling in the development of heart failure.", "journal": "Journal of pharmacological sciences", "date": "2016-09-27", "authors": ["JunichiIkeda", "NaoyaKimoto", "TetsuyaKitayama", "ShunjiKunori"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jphs.2016.08.008"}
{"title": "Swimming exercise reverses aging-related contractile abnormalities of female heart by improving structural alterations.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the effect of swimming exercise on aging-related Ca2+ handling alterations and structural abnormalities of female rat heart.\nFor this purpose, 4-month and 24-month old female rats were used and divided into three following groups: sedentary young (SY), sedentary old (SO), and exercised old (Ex-O). Swimming exercise was performed for 8 weeks (60 min/day, 5 days/week). Myocyte shortening, L-type Ca2+ currents and associated Ca2+ transients were measured from ventricular myocytes at 36 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. NOX-4 levels, aconitase activity, glutathione measurements and ultrastructural examination by electron microscopy were conducted in heart tissue.\nSwimming exercise reversed the reduced shortening and slowed kinetics of aged cardiomyocytes. Although the current density was similar for all groups, Ca2+ transients were higher in SO and Ex-O myocytes with respect to the SY group. Caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients and the integrated NCX current were lower in cardiomyocytes of SY rats compared with other groups, suggesting an increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content in an aged heart. Aging led to upregulated cardiac NOX-4 along with declined aconitase activity. Although it did not reverse these oxidative parameters, swimming exercise achieved a significant increase in glutathione levels and improved structural alterations of old rats' hearts.\nWe conclude that swimming exercise upregulates antioxidant defense capacity and improves structural abnormalities of senescent female rat heart, although it does not change Ca2+ handling alterations further. Thereby, it improves contractile function of aged myocardium by mitigating detrimental effects of oxidative stress.", "journal": "Cardiology journal", "date": "2016-09-27", "authors": ["NihalOzturk", "YusufOlgar", "HakanEr", "MurathanKucuk", "SemirOzdemir"], "doi": "10.5603/CJ.a2016.0069"}
{"title": "Exogenous apelin changes alpha and beta myosin heavy chain mRNA expression and improves cardiac function in PTU-induced hypothyroid rats.", "abstract": "The most important conditions associated with hypothyroidism is the cardiac dysfunction. Apelin is an endogenous ligand, involved in energy storage and metabolism which improves cardiac contractility. This study was done to evaluate the effects of apelin, l-Thyroxin (T4) or a combination of both, on cardiac function and mRNA expression of two contractile proteins, \u03b1 and \u03b2 myosin heavy chain (\u03b1-MHC and \u03b2-MHC), in 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroid rats. Forty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into five groups: Ctrl (Control), and 4 hypothyroid groups (H, HA, HT, and HAT). The Hypothyroid (H) group received 0.05% PTU in the drinking water for six weeks; the next 3 groups, along with PTU, received apelin (HA, 200\u03bcg/kg/day, ip), T4 (HT, 20\u03bcg/kg/day, gavage), or a combination of both drugs (HAT) for the last 2weeks (weeks 5 and 6). TSH and T4 were measured using ELISA kit. Isolated hearts of animals were perfused in Langendorff apparatus and left ventricular developed pressure, cardiac contractility, heart rate, rate pressure product and perfusion pressure were assessed using PowerLab ADInstruments. In addition \u03b1-MHC and \u03b2-MHC mRNA expression were evaluated by RT-PCR method in heart tissue. Apelin alone or accompanied by T4 significantly increased cardiac contractility and performance as compared to hypothyroid group. Apelin also significantly increased the alpha-MHC mRNA expression and in the presence of T4 significantly decreased beta-MHC mRNA expression. It seems that apelin alone may improve cardiac function in hypothyroid rats via genomic pathways.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2016-09-25", "authors": ["FarzanehFaraji Shahrivar", "MohammadBadavi", "MahinDianat", "AliMard", "AkramAhangarpour", "AlirezaSamarbaf-Zadeh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gene.2016.09.025"}

Myocardial depolarization leading to cardiac muscle contraction is reflected by the amplitude and duration of the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Abnormal QRS amplitude or duration reflect changes in myocardial mass and conduction, and are associated with increased risk of heart failure and death.\nThis meta-analysis sought to gain insights into the genetic determinants of myocardial mass.\nWe carried out a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 4 QRS traits in up to 73,518 individuals of European ancestry, followed by extensive biological and functional assessment.\nWe identified 52 genomic loci, of which 32 are novel, that are reliably associated with 1 or more QRS phenotypes at p\u00a0< 1\u00a0\u00d7 10(-8). These loci are enriched in regions of open chromatin, histone modifications, and transcription factor binding, suggesting that they represent regions of the genome that are actively transcribed in the human heart. Pathway analyses provided evidence that these loci play a role in cardiac hypertrophy. We further highlighted 67\u00a0candidate genes at the identified loci that are preferentially expressed in cardiac tissue and associated with cardiac abnormalities in Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus. We validated the regulatory function of a novel variant in the SCN5A/SCN10A locus in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo.\nTaken together, our findings provide new insights into genes and biological pathways controlling myocardial mass and may help identify novel therapeutic targets.", "journal": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "date": "2016-09-24", "authors": ["Pimvan der Harst", "Jessicavan Setten", "NiekVerweij", "GeorgVogler", "LudeFranke", "Matthew TMaurano", "XinchenWang", "IreneMateo Leach", "MarkEijgelsheim", "NonaSotoodehnia", "CarolineHayward", "RossellaSorice", "OsorioMeirelles", "Leo-PekkaLyytik\u00e4inen", "OzrenPola\u0161ek", "ToshikoTanaka", "Dan EArking", "SheilaUlivi", "StellaTrompet", "MartinaM\u00fcller-Nurasyid", "Albert VSmith", "MarcusD\u00f6rr", "Kathleen FKerr", "Jared WMagnani", "FabiolaDel Greco M", "WeihuaZhang", "Ilja MNolte", "Claudia TSilva", "SandoshPadmanabhan", "ViniciusTragante", "T\u00f5nuEsko", "Gon\u00e7alo RAbecasis", "Michiel EAdriaens", "KarlAndersen", "PhilBarnett", "Joshua CBis", "RolfBodmer", "Brendan MBuckley", "HarryCampbell", "Megan VCannon", "AravindaChakravarti", "Lin YChen", "AlessandroDelitala", "Richard BDevereux", "Pieter ADoevendans", "Anna FDominiczak", "LuigiFerrucci", "IanFord", "ChristianGieger", "Tamara BHarris", "EricHaugen", "MatthiasHeinig", "Dena GHernandez", "Hans LHillege", "Joel NHirschhorn", "AlbertHofman", "NorbertHubner", "Shih-JenHwang", "AnnamariaIorio", "MikaK\u00e4h\u00f6nen", "ManolisKellis", "IvanaKolcic", "Ishminder KKooner", "Jaspal SKooner", "Jan AKors", "Edward GLakatta", "KasperLage", "Lenore JLauner", "DanielLevy", "AliciaLundby", "Peter WMacfarlane", "DalitMay", "ThomasMeitinger", "AndresMetspalu", "StefaniaNappo", "SilviaNaitza", "ShaneNeph", "Alex SNord", "TeresaNutile", "Peter MOkin", "Jesper VOlsen", "Ben AOostra", "Josef MPenninger", "Len APennacchio", "Tune HPers", "SiegfriedPerz", "AnnettePeters", "Yigal MPinto", "ArnePfeufer", "Maria GraziaPilia", "Peter PPramstaller", "Bram PPrins", "Olli TRaitakari", "SoumyaRaychaudhuri", "Ken MRice", "Elizabeth JRossin", "Jerome IRotter", "SebastianSchafer", "DavidSchlessinger", "Carsten OSchmidt", "JobanpreetSehmi", "Herman H WSillj\u00e9", "GianfrancoSinagra", "Moritz FSinner", "KamilSlowikowski", "Elsayed ZSoliman", "Timothy DSpector", "WilkoSpiering", "John AStamatoyannopoulos", "Ronald PStolk", "KonstantinStrauch", "Sian-TsungTan", "Kirill VTarasov", "BoscoTrinh", "Andre GUitterlinden", "Malouvan den Boogaard", "Cornelia Mvan Duijn", "Wiek Hvan Gilst", "Jorma SViikari", "Peter MVisscher", "VeroniqueVitart", "UweV\u00f6lker", "MelanieWaldenberger", "Christian XWeichenberger", "Harm-JanWestra", "CiscaWijmenga", "Bruce HWolffenbuttel", "JianYang", "Connie RBezzina", "Patricia BMunroe", "HaroldSnieder", "Alan FWright", "IgorRudan", "Laurie ABoyer", "Folkert WAsselbergs", "Dirk Jvan Veldhuisen", "Bruno HStricker", "Bruce MPsaty", "MarinaCiullo", "SerenaSanna", "TerhoLehtim\u00e4ki", "James FWilson", "StefaniaBandinelli", "AlvaroAlonso", "PaoloGasparini", "J WouterJukema", "StefanK\u00e4\u00e4b", "VilmundurGudnason", "Stephan BFelix", "Susan RHeckbert", "Rudolf Ade Boer", "ChristopherNewton-Cheh", "Andrew AHicks", "John CChambers", "YaldaJamshidi", "AxelVisel", "Vincent MChristoffels", "AaronIsaacs", "Nilesh JSamani", "Paul I Wde Bakker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jacc.2016.07.729"}

ISO-induced myocardial damage was indicated by the elevated levels of marker enzymes such as creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and troponin T and I (cTnT, cTnI) in the serum. In addition, the levels of lipid peroxidation products such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), conjugated dienes (CD) and lipid hydroperoxides (LHPs) were significantly increased in the plasma and heart tissue. Activities of enzymic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and the non enzymic antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E and reduced glutathione (GSH) were decreased in the erythrocytes, plasma and heart tissue of the ISO-induced rats and myocardium infarct size as observed by staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC).

The cardiovascular complications of radiation exposure cause morbidity and mortality in patients who received radiotherapy. HES, an antioxidant flavonoid found in citrus fruits, suggests the protection against the tissue damage. Fifty-eight rats were divided into four groups: Group 1 received phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and sham radiation; Group 2, HES and sham radiation; Group 3, PBS and radiation; and Group 4, HES and radiation. The rats were exposed to single dose of 18 Gy of 6 MV X-ray. One hundred milligrams per kilogram doses of HES was administered for 7 days before irradiation. The estimation of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and histopathological analyses was performed at 24 h and 8 weeks after radiation exposure. The irradiation of chest area resulted in an elevated MDA level and decreased SOD activity. Moreover, long-term pathological lesions of radiation were inflammation, fibrosis, the increased number of mast cells and macrophages, and development of plaque, vascular leakage, myocardial degeneration, and myocyte necrosis. Although the administration of HES decreases inflammation, fibrosis, mast cell and macrophage numbers, and myocyte necrosis, it did not result in reduced thrombus, myocardium degeneration, and vascular leakage. In conclusion, these results suggest that HES can perform a radioprotection action. The protective effect of HES may be attributable to its immunomodulatory effects and free radical-scavenging properties.", "journal": "Journal of medical physics", "date": "2016-09-22", "authors": ["AbolhasanRezaeyan", "Gholam HassanHaddadi", "MassoodHosseinzadeh", "MaryamMoradi", "MasoudNajafi"], "doi": "10.4103/0971-6203.189482"}

{"title": "MicroRNA Stability in FFPE Tissue Samples: Dependence on GC Content.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs responsible for fine-tuning of gene expression at post-transcriptional level. The alterations in miRNA expression levels profoundly affect human health and often lead to the development of severe diseases. Currently, high throughput analyses, such as microarray and deep sequencing, are performed in order to identify miRNA biomarkers, using archival patient tissue samples. MiRNAs are more robust than longer RNAs, and resistant to extreme temperatures, pH, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedding (FFPE) process. Here, we have compared the stability of miRNAs in FFPE cardiac tissues using next-generation sequencing. The mode read length in FFPE samples was 11 nucleotides (nt), while that in the matched frozen samples was 22 nt. Although the read counts were increased 1.7-fold in FFPE samples, compared with those in the frozen samples, the average miRNA mapping rate decreased from 32.0% to 9.4%. These results indicate that, in addition to the fragmentation of longer RNAs, miRNAs are to some extent degraded in FFPE tissues as well. The expression profiles of total miRNAs in two groups were highly correlated (0.88 <r < 0.92). However, the relative read count of each miRNA was different depending on the GC content (p<0.0001). The unequal degradation of each miRNA affected the abundance ranking in the library, and miR-133a was shown to be the most abundant in FFPE cardiac tissues instead of miR-1, which was predominant before fixation. Subsequent quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses revealed that miRNAs with GC content of less than 40% are more degraded than GC-rich miRNAs (p<0.0001). We showed that deep sequencing data obtained using FFPE samples cannot be directly compared with that of fresh frozen samples. The combination of miRNA deep sequencing and other quantitative analyses, such as qPCR, may improve the utility of archival FFPE tissue samples.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-09-21", "authors": ["YuKakimoto", "MasayukiTanaka", "HiroshiKamiguchi", "ErikoOchiai", "MotokiOsawa"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0163125\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.889048\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2014.05.006\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2378\n10.1073/pnas.0804549105\n10.1038/cr.2008.282\n10.1371/journal.pone.0129338\n10.1002/path.2736\n10.1371/journal.pone.0064393\n10.1038/labinvest.2013.157\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098187\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btr046\n10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.01.010\n10.1007/s00428-013-1485-2\n10.1016/j.gene.2012.03.021\n10.1038/srep01318\n10.1371/journal.pone.0017163\n10.1101/gr.079558.108\n10.1038/nmeth.1226\n10.1186/s12859-015-0778-7\n10.1038/ncomms3832\n10.1261/rna.027615.111\n10.1016/j.margen.2014.01.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0124873\n10.1371/journal.pone.0032724\n10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.04.005\n10.1093/nar/gkr688\n10.1073/pnas.1401724111\n10.1186/s12920-015-0109-x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003863"}

{"title": "Cell Death and Heart Failure in Obesity: Role of Uncoupling Proteins.", "abstract": "Metabolic diseases such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type II diabetes are often characterized by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in mitochondrial respiratory complexes, associated with fat accumulation in cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle, and hepatocytes. Several rodents studies showed that lipid accumulation in cardiac myocytes produces lipotoxicity that causes apoptosis and leads to heart failure, a dynamic pathological process. Meanwhile, several tissues including cardiac tissue develop an adaptive mechanism against oxidative stress and lipotoxicity by overexpressing uncoupling proteins (UCPs), specific mitochondrial membrane proteins. In heart from rodent and human with obesity, UCP2 and UCP3 may protect cardiomyocytes from death and from a state progressing to heart failure by downregulating programmed cell death. UCP activation may affect cytochrome c and proapoptotic protein release from mitochondria by reducing ROS generation and apoptotic cell death. Therefore the aim of this review is to discuss recent findings regarding the role that UCPs play in cardiomyocyte survival by protecting against ROS generation and maintaining bioenergetic metabolism homeostasis to promote heart protection.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2016-09-20", "authors": ["Ang\u00e9licaRuiz-Ram\u00edrez", "OcarolL\u00f3pez-Acosta", "Miguel AngelBarrios-Maya", "MohammedEl-Hafidi"], "doi": "10.1155/2016/9340654\n10.1210/jc.2006-0584\n10.1007/s11897-008-0013-1\n10.1038/ijo.2012.170\n10.1016/s0140-6736(04)17402-3\n10.1016/j.biocel.2005.05.013\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.05.004\n10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00317-8\n10.1093/cvr/cvu214\n10.1152/physrev.00015.2009\n10.1016/j.beem.2014.02.006\n10.1016/j.lfs.2014.11.008\n10.1007/s10863-014-9580-x\n10.1016/j.tem.2012.04.004\n10.1016/j.beem.2012.08.002\n10.1161/01.RES.0000170075.73039.5b\n10.3760/cma.j.issn.0366-6999.20130940\n10.1152/ajpheart.00592.2012\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000086\n10.1096/fj.03-0012com\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.01.055\n10.1089/ars.2012.4905\n10.1042/0264-6021:3450161\n10.1038/nature10257\n10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00177\n10.1042/0300-5127:0290751\n10.1038/nrn1767\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098969\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2006.05.027\n10.1074/jbc.m208262200\n10.1038/415096a\n10.1016/s0014-5793(99)01540-9\n10.1152/ajpendo.00267.2006\n10.1038/nrm1592\n10.1016/j.lfs.2006.04.012\n10.1074/jbc.M605552200\n10.1007/s10741-014-9457-4\n10.1016/j.mito.2014.06.002\n10.1073/pnas.1317400111/-/DCSupplemental\n10.1096/fj.07-8945com\n10.1074/jbc.M505258200\n10.1161/01.res.0000085581.60197.4d\n10.1159/000430142\n10.1074/jbc.m101049200\n10.1155/2007/74364\n10.1074/jbc.m006246200\n10.1210/en.2006-0226\n10.1074/jbc.M110.120584\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.10.733\n10.1210/me.2002-0395\n10.1093/cvr/cvu263\n10.1161/jaha.113.000086\n10.1152/ajpheart.00759.2014\n10.1093/cvr/cvu256\n10.1152/ajpendo.00631.2010\n10.2337/diabetes.54.8.2343\n10.2337/db07-0481\n10.1016/j.exger.2010.01.003\n10.1038/emboj.2012.300\n10.3390/ijms12085285\n10.1111/joim.12055\n10.1089/ars.2011.4085\n10.1242/jcs.099234\n10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.47.120505.105122\n10.1161/JAHA.115.002555\n10.1161/circresaha.114.300559\n10.1152/ajpendo.00617.2014\n10.1113/jphysiol.2014.274704\n10.1161/01.cir.99.23.3071\n10.1042/bst0391305\n10.1126/science.aaa0672\n10.1007/978-94-007-2869-1_6\n10.1093/cvr/cvu256\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.08.006\n10.1016/j.numecd.2013.09.016\n10.1016/j.diabres.2011.10.028\n10.1152/ajpendo.00380.2002\n10.1073/pnas.97.4.1784\n10.1210/jc.2012-3190\n10.1177/1074248411423022\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2013.07.004\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2005.03.005\n10.2337/diabetes.51.8.2587\n10.18632/oncotarget.6286\n10.1016/j.abb.2014.11.009\n10.1046/j.1463-1326.2003.00273.x\n10.1152/ajpendo.00190.2004\n10.1096/fj.13-234914\n10.1152/ajpheart.01190.2010\n10.1152/ajpendo.00779.2007\n10.2337/diabetes.53.9.2366\n10.1152/ajpheart.00257.2001\n10.1111/bph.12417\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.3653\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2007.04.005\n10.1074/jbc.m803871200\n10.1096/fj.03-0515fje\n10.1093/emboj/cdg412\n10.1042/BJ20021077\n10.2337/diabetes.50.9.2105\n10.1161/01.RES.0000085581.60197.4D\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.09.012\n10.1007/BF01799626\n10.1073/pnas.95.26.15592\n10.1016/j.numecd.2006.05.009\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2015.01.011\n10.2337/db06-0739\n10.1042/bst20140094\n10.1016/j.molcel.2011.07.019\n10.1074/jbc.m113.510354\n10.1038/nature08778"}

We determined that the superior efficiency of mitochondrial transfer by human induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived MSCs (iPSC-MSCs) compared with bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) is due to high expression of intrinsic Rho GTPase 1 (MIRO1). Further, due to a higher level of TNF\u03b1IP2 expression, iPSC-MSCs are more responsive to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)-induced tunneling nanotube (TNT) formation for mitochondrial transfer to CMs, which is regulated via the TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB/TNF\u03b1IP2 signaling pathway. Inhibition of TNF\u03b1IP2 or MIRO1 in iPSC-MSCs reduced the efficiency of mitochondrial transfer and decreased CMs protection. Compared with BM-MSCs, transplantation of iPSC-MSCs into a mouse model of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy resulted in more human mitochondrial retention and bioenergetic preservation in heart tissue. Efficacious transfer of mitochondria from iPSC-MSCs to CMs, due to higher MIRO1 expression and responsiveness to TNF-\u03b1-induced nanotube formation, effectively attenuates anthracycline-induced CM damage.", "journal": "Stem cell reports", "date": "2016-09-20", "authors": ["YuelinZhang", "ZhendongYu", "DanJiang", "XiaotingLiang", "SongyanLiao", "ZhaoZhang", "WenshengYue", "XiangLi", "Sin-MingChiu", "Yuet-HungChai", "YingminLiang", "YenyenChow", "ShuoHan", "AiminXu", "Hung-FatTse", "QizhouLian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.08.009"}

{"title": "Detection of Soluble ED-A(+) Fibronectin and Evaluation as Novel Serum Biomarker for Cardiac Tissue Remodeling.", "abstract": "Background and Aims. Fibronectin containing the extra domain A (ED-A(+) Fn) was proven to serve as a valuable biomarker for cardiac remodeling. The study was aimed at establishing an ELISA to determine ED-A(+) Fn in serum of heart failure patients. Methods. ED-A(+) Fn was quantified in serum samples from 114 heart failure patients due to ischemic (ICM, n = 44) and dilated (DCM, n = 39) cardiomyopathy as well as hypertensive heart disease (HHD, n = 31) compared to healthy controls (n = 12). Results. In comparison to healthy volunteers, heart failure patients showed significantly increased levels of ED-A(+) Fn (p < 0.001). In particular in ICM patients there were significant associations between ED-A(+) Fn serum levels and clinical parameters, for example, increased levels with rising NYHA class (p = 0.013), a negative correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.026, r: -0.353), a positive correlation with left atrial diameter (p = 0.008, r: 0.431), and a strong positive correlation with systolic pulmonary artery pressure (p = 0.002, r: 0.485). In multivariate analysis, ED-A(+) Fn was identified as an independent predictor of an ischemic heart failure etiology. Conclusions. The current study could clearly show that ED-A(+) Fn is a promising biomarker in cardiovascular diseases, especially in heart failure patients due to an ICM.

In this study, various DNA analysis techniques and a messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling method were applied to examine for trends in nucleic acid degradation and the postmortem interval. The DNA analysis techniques include highly sensitive DNA quantitation (with and without degradation index), standard and low template STR profiling, insertion and null alleles (INNUL) of retrotransposable elements typing and mitochondrial DNA profiling. The used mRNA profiling system targets genes with tissue specific expression for seven human organs as reported by Lindenbergh et al. (Int J Legal Med 127:891-900, 27) and has been applied to forensic evidentiary traces but not to excavated tissues. The techniques were applied to a total of 81 brain, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney and skin samples obtained from 19 excavated graves with burial times ranging from 4 to 42\u00a0years. Results show that brain and heart are the organs in which both DNA and RNA remain remarkably stable, notwithstanding long PMIs. The other organ tissues either show poor overall profiling results or vary for DNA and RNA profiling success, with sometimes DNA and other times RNA profiling being more successful. No straightforward relations were observed between nucleic acid profiling results and the PMI. This study shows that not only DNA but also RNA molecules can be remarkably stable and used for profiling of long-buried human remains, which corroborate forensic applications.

{"title": "Single-cell transcriptome and epigenomic reprogramming of cardiomyocyte-derived cardiac progenitor cells.", "abstract": "The molecular basis underlying the dedifferentiation of mammalian adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) into myocyte-derived cardiac progenitor cells (mCPCs) during cardiac tissue regeneration is poorly understood. We present data integrating single-cell transcriptome and whole-genome DNA methylome analyses of mouse mCPCs to understand the epigenomic reprogramming governing their intrinsic cellular plasticity. Compared to parental cardiomyocytes, mCPCs display epigenomic reprogramming with many differentially-methylated regions, both hypermethylated and hypomethylated, across the entire genome. Correlating well with the methylome, our single-cell transcriptomic data show that the genes encoding cardiac structure and function proteins are remarkably down-regulated in mCPCs, while those for cell cycle, proliferation, and stemness are significantly up-regulated. In addition, implanting mCPCs into infarcted mouse myocardium improves cardiac function with augmented left ventricular ejection fraction. This dataset suggests that the cellular plasticity of mammalian cardiomyocytes is the result of a well-orchestrated epigenomic reprogramming and a subsequent global transcriptomic alteration.

However, attempts to use these cells in vivo have resulted in drastic cell death caused by mechanical, metabolic, and/or exogenous factors. To explore this issue, we designed a Biomimetic Cardiac Tissue Model (BCTM) where various parameters associated with heart function including heart rate, peak-systolic pressure, end-diastolic pressure and volume, end-systolic pressure and volume, and ratio of systole to diastole can all be precisely manipulated to apply hemodynamic loading to culture cells. Using the BCTM, two causes of low survivability in current cardiac stem cell therapies, mechanical and metabolic, were explored. iPSC-CMs were subject to physiologically relevant mechanical loading (50 mmHg systolic, 10% biaxial stretch) in either a low- or high-serum environment and mechanical loads were applied either immediately or gradually. Results confirm that iPSC-CMs subject to mechanical loading in low-serum conditions experienced widespread cell death. The rate of application of stress also played an important role in adaptability to mechanical loading. Under high-serum conditions, iPSC-CMs subject to gradual imposition of stress were comparable to iPSC-CMs maintained in static culture when evaluated in terms of cell viability, sarcomeric structure, action potentials and conduction velocities. In contrast, iPSC-CMs that were immediately exposed to mechanical loading had significantly lower cell viability, destruction of sarcomeres, smaller action potentials, and lower conduction velocities. We report that iPSC-CMs survival under physiologically relevant hemodynamic stress requires gradual imposition of mechanical loads in a nutrient-rich environment.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2016-09-14", "authors": ["Aaron JRogers", "Vladimir GFast", "PalaniappanSethu"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03105"}
{"title": "The role of cardiac fibroblasts in post-myocardial heart tissue repair.", "abstract": "The relative resistance of fibroblasts to hypoxia and their remarkable adaptive plasticity in response to rapid changes in local tissue microenvironment made interstitial cardiac fibroblasts to be a key player in post-myocardial infarction myocardial repair. Cardiac fibroblasts are abundantly presented in the interstitial and perivascular extracellular matrix. These cells can be rapidly mobilized in response to cardiac injury. Inflammatory activation of fibroblasts leads to the loss of their quiescent phenotype and inhibition of matrix-producing capacity. Acute inflammation that follows the infarct induces production of inflammatory mediators, matrix-degrading activity, proliferation, and migration of fibroblasts. Fibroblasts migrate to the injured myocardial site where undergo transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in response to anti-inflammatory and mitogenic stimuli. They acquire capacity to synthesize matrix and contractile proteins. In the infarcted zone, fibroblasts/myofibroblasts actively proliferate, expand, and extensively produce and deposit collagen and other matrix proteins. The proliferative stage of heart healing transits to the scar maturation stage, in which collagen-based scar exhibits formation of intramolecular and extramolecular cross-links, deactivation and apoptosis of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. Generally, cardiac reparation is strongly controlled. Inability to pass from one repair stage to another in a timely manner can induce detrimental events such as expansion of the infarct area due to advanced inflammation, cardiac fibrosis and adverse remodeling due to the excessive proliferative and profibrotic response, left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmogenicity, and heart failure.", "journal": "Experimental and molecular pathology", "date": "2016-09-14", "authors": ["Dimitry AChistiakov", "Alexander NOrekhov", "Yuri VBobryshev"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexmp.2016.09.002"}

Patients at risk currently receive implantable defibrillators that deliver electrical shocks to terminate arrhythmias on demand. However, strong electrical shocks can damage the heart and cause severe pain. Therefore, we have tested optogenetic defibrillation using expression of the light-sensitive channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in cardiac tissue. Epicardial illumination effectively terminated ventricular arrhythmias in hearts from transgenic mice and from WT mice after adeno-associated virus-based gene transfer of ChR2. We also explored optogenetic defibrillation for human hearts, taking advantage of a recently developed, clinically validated in silico approach for simulating infarct-related ventricular tachycardia (VT). Our analysis revealed that illumination with red light effectively terminates VT in diseased, ChR2-expressing human hearts. Mechanistically, we determined that the observed VT termination is due to ChR2-mediated transmural depolarization of the myocardium, which causes a block of voltage-dependent Na+ channels throughout the myocardial wall and interrupts wavefront propagation into illuminated tissue. Thus, our results demonstrate that optogenetic defibrillation is highly effective in the mouse heart and could potentially be translated into humans to achieve nondamaging and pain-free termination of ventricular arrhythmia.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2016-09-13", "authors": ["TobiasBruegmann", "Patrick MBoyle", "Christoph CVogt", "Thomas VKarathanos", "Hermenegild JArevalo", "Bernd KFleischmann", "Natalia ATrayanova", "PhilippSasse"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI88950\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2010.02971.x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.02.049\n10.1001/archinternmed.2011.441\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.07.036\n10.1038/nmeth.1512\n10.1093/cvr/cvv004\n10.1038/nbt.3268\n10.1126/science.1195929\n10.1016/0002-9149(75)90865-6\n10.1038/nphoton.2015.196\n10.1093/cvr/cvu179\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00034.2003\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003220\n10.1038/nmeth.2836\n10.1038/nn.3502\n10.1038/nn.2776\n10.1529/biophysj.105.076505\n10.2214/ajr.147.2.239\n10.1038/oby.2007.591\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.016217\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.08.026\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2008.07.004\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.21.2334\n10.1126/science.1232437\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302331\n10.1093/cvr/cvu174\n10.1016/j.cub.2005.11.032\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.04.015\n10.1371/journal.pone.0068872\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.653568\n10.1109/42.52980\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2012.08.005\n10.1109/TBME.2009.2014243\n10.1007/s10439-012-0593-5\n10.1152/ajpheart.00109.2006\n10.1161/01.RES.81.1.110\n10.1152/ajpheart.00082.2004\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00159-0\n10.1152/ajpheart.00362.2010\n10.1152/ajpheart.00512.2002\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1105\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.204891\n10.1161/01.RES.0000059301.81035.06\n10.1161/01.RES.0000174429.00987.17\n10.1529/biophysj.107.110981\n10.1113/jphysiol.2012.229088\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2015.04.036\n10.1161/01.CIR.72.1.1\n10.1134/1.2135863\n10.1117/1.1854679\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2012.11.021\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.08.010"}
{"title": "Aptamer-Based Microfluidic Electrochemical Biosensor for Monitoring Cell-Secreted Trace Cardiac Biomarkers.", "abstract": "Continual monitoring of secreted biomarkers from organ-on-a-chip models is desired to understand their responses to drug exposure in a noninvasive manner. To achieve this goal, analytical methods capable of monitoring trace amounts of secreted biomarkers are of particular interest. However, a majority of existing biosensing techniques suffer from limited sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and require large working volumes, especially when cell culture medium is involved, which usually contains a plethora of nonspecific binding proteins and interfering compounds. Hence, novel analytical platforms are needed to provide noninvasive, accurate information on the status of organoids at low working volumes. Here, we report a novel microfluidic aptamer-based electrochemical biosensing platform for monitoring damage to cardiac organoids. The system is scalable, low-cost, and compatible with microfluidic platforms easing its integration with microfluidic bioreactors. To create the creatine kinase (CK)-MB biosensor, the microelectrode was functionalized with aptamers that are specific to CK-MB biomarker secreted from a damaged cardiac tissue. Compared to antibody-based sensors, the proposed aptamer-based system was highly sensitive, selective, and stable. The performance of the sensors was assessed using a heart-on-a-chip system constructed from human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes following exposure to a cardiotoxic drug, doxorubicin. The aptamer-based biosensor was capable of measuring trace amounts of CK-MB secreted by the cardiac organoids upon drug treatments in a dose-dependent manner, which was in agreement with the beating behavior and cell viability analyses. We believe that, our microfluidic electrochemical biosensor using aptamer-based capture mechanism will find widespread applications in integration with organ-on-a-chip platforms for in situ detection of biomarkers at low abundance and high sensitivity.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2016-09-13", "authors": ["Su RyonShin", "Yu ShrikeZhang", "Duck-JinKim", "AhmadManbohi", "HuseyinAvci", "AntoniaSilvestri", "JulioAleman", "NingHu", "TugbaKilic", "WendyKeung", "MartinaRighi", "PribpandaoAssawes", "Hani AAlhadrami", "Ronald ALi", "Mehmet RDokmeci", "AliKhademhosseini"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.6b02028\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.035"}

Recently, it was shown that cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C), a protein of the cardiac sarcomere, is degraded following MI, releasing a predominant N-terminal 40-kDa fragment (C0C1f) into myocardial tissue and the systemic circulation. We hypothesized that early release of C0C1f contributes to the initiation of inflammation and plays a key role in recruitment and activation of immune cells. Therefore, we investigated the role of C0C1f on macrophage/monocyte activation using both mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and human monocytes. Here we demonstrate that C0C1f leads to macrophage/monocyte activation in vitro. Furthermore, C0C1f induces strong upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2)) in cultured murine macrophages and human monocytes, resulting in a pro-inflammatory phenotype. We identified the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and Advanced Glycosylation End Product-Specific Receptor (RAGE) as potential receptors for C0C1f whose activation leads to mobilization of the NF\u03baB signaling pathway, a central mediator of the pro-inflammatory signaling cascade.

{"title": "Blot-MS of Carbonylated Proteins: A Tool to Identify Oxidized Proteins.", "abstract": "The efficiency of proteostasis regulation declines during aging and the failure of protein homeostasis is common in age-related diseases. Protein oxidation is a major contributor to the loss of proteome homeostasis, also called \"proteostasis,\" precluding protein misfolding and aggregation. So, the identification of the molecular pathways impaired by protein oxidation will increase the understanding of proteostasis and the pathophysiological conditions related to the loss of proteostasis. Sample derivatization with dinitrophenyl hydrazine and western blot immunoassay detection of carbonylated proteins (commonly known as Oxyblot\u2122) coupled to mass spectrometry (blot-MS) is an attractive methodological approach to identify proteins that are more prone to carbonylation, a typical oxidative modification of amino acid residues. The integration of blot-MS data of carbonylated proteins with bioinformatics tools allows the identification of the biological processes more affected by protein oxidation and that, eventually, result in the loss of proteostasis.In this chapter, we describe a blot-MS methodology to identify the proteins more prone to oxidation in biological samples, as cell and tissue extracts, and biofluids. Analysis of mitochondria isolated from cardiac tissue is provided as an example.

{"title": "Tuning the conductivity and inner structure of electrospun fibers to promote cardiomyocyte elongation and synchronous beating.", "abstract": "The key to addressing the challenges facing cardiac tissue engineering is the integration of physical, chemical, and electrical cues into scaffolds. Aligned and conductive scaffolds have been fabricated as synthetic microenvironments to improve the function of cardiomyocytes. However, up to now, the influence of conductive capability and inner structure of fibrous scaffolds have not been determined on the cardiomyocyte morphologies and beating patterns. In the current study, highly aligned fibers were fabricated with loaded up to 6% of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to modulate the electrical conductivity, while blend and coaxial electrospinning were utilized to create a bulk distribution of CNTs in fiber matrices and a spatial embedment in fiber cores, respectively. Conductive networks were formed in the fibrous scaffolds after the inoculation of over 3% CNTs, and the increase in the conductivity could maintain the cell viabilities, induce the cell elongation, enhance the production of sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin and troponin I, and promote the synchronous beating of cardiomyocytes. Although the conductivity of blend fibers is slightly higher than that of coaxial fibers with the same CNT loadings, the lower exposures to CNTs resulted in higher cell viability, elongation, extracellular matrix secretion and beating rates for cardiomyocytes on coaxial fibers. Taken altogether, core-sheath fibers with loaded 5% of CNTs in the fiber cores facilitated the cardiomyocyte growth with a production of organized contractile proteins and a pulsation frequency close to that of the atrium. It is suggested that electrospun scaffolds that couple conductivity and fibrous structure considerations may provide optimal stimuli to foster cell morphology and functions for myocardial regeneration or establishment of in vitro cardiomyocyte culture platform for drug screening.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

In addition, recent studies have indicated that the structure and function of heart tissue are also sensitive to mechanical cues at the nano- and micro-scale. Although fabrication methods exist for generating topographical features on polymeric scaffolds for cell culture, current techniques, especially those with nano-scale resolution, are typically complex, prohibitively expensive and not accessible to most biology laboratories. Here, we present a simple and tunable fabrication method for the production of patterned electrospun fibers that simulate the complex anisotropic and multi-scale architecture of cardiac tissue, to promote cardiac cell alignment. This method is based on the combination of electrospinning and soft lithography techniques, in which electrospun fibers, based on a blend of poly(glycerol sebacate) and poly(caprolactone), were collected on a patterned Teflon-coated silicon wafer with imprinted topographical features. Different surface topographies were investigated, such as squares and grooves, with constant or different interspatial distances. In vitro cell culture studies successfully demonstrated the alignment of both C2C12 myoblasts and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes on fabricated electrospun patterned surfaces. C2C12 cells were cultured over a period of 72h to study the effect of topographical cues on cell morphology. Cells attached within the first 8h after seeding and after 24h most of the cells started to align responding to the topographical cues. Similarly, cardiomyocytes responded to the topographical features by aligning themselves and by expressing Connexin 43 along cellular junctions.

At a less stringent definition of differential expression, the transcriptional responses to these two antagonistic drugs are reciprocal for many genes, with an overall anti-correlation of r\u2009=\u2009-0.3. This trend is also observed at the level of most individual strains even though the power to detect differential expression is significantly reduced. The inversely expressed gene sets are enriched with genes annotated for heart-related functions. Modular analysis revealed gene sets that exhibit coherent transcription profiles across some strains and/or treatments. Correlations between these modules and a broad spectrum of cardiovascular traits are stronger than expected by chance. This provides evidence for the overall importance of transcriptional regulation for these organismal responses and explicits links between co-expressed genes and the traits they are associated with. Gene set enrichment analysis of differentially expressed groups of genes pointed to pathways related to heart development and functionality.\nOur study provides new insights into the transcriptional response of the heart to perturbations of the \u03b2-adrenergic system, implicating several new genes that had not been associated to this system previously.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2016-09-09", "authors": ["AndreaPrunotto", "Brian JStevenson", "CorinneBerthonneche", "FannySch\u00fcpfer", "Jacques SBeckmann", "FabienneMaurer", "SvenBergmann"], "doi": "10.1186/s12864-016-3059-6\n10.1038/jhg.2013.35\n10.1038/jhg.2013.36\n10.1038/jhg.2013.37\n10.1038/jhg.2013.39\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3005237\n10.1038/jhg.2013.53\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300308\n10.1016/j.amjhyper.2005.09.010\n10.1007/s10741-007-9007-4\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.109.895763\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.109.895995\n10.1111/j.1752-8062.2010.00251.x\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr105\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.112.965277\n10.1093/eurheartj/eht251\n10.1371/journal.pone.0006610\n10.1371/journal.pone.0041032\n10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616\n10.3102/10769986025001060\n10.1093/nar/gku967\n10.1161/01.RES.0000259041.37059.8c\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.864686\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.10.023\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.03.011\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.01.056\n10.1007/s00395-010-0131-2\n10.1242/jcs.063859\n10.1038/ng.2261\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.4.485\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.2.196\n10.1073/pnas.0600268103\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.982298\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.273342\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.274803\n10.1093/hmg/10.3.189\n10.1038/ng.2007.6\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.04.007\n10.1074/jbc.M111.297127\n10.1371/journal.pone.0038454\n10.1152/ajpcell.00460.2011\n10.1186/gb-2007-8-9-r183\n10.1186/gb-2010-11-2-r14\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bti042\n10.1103/PhysRevE.67.031902\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bth166\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0020009\n10.1371/journal.pgen.0010039\n10.1038/nature10532\n10.1186/1471-2164-13-124\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001054\n10.1371/journal.pone.0070512\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.113.000732\n10.1210/en.2013-1535\n10.1093/nar/gkt211"}

Current methods measure the functional performance of engineered heart tissue by their twitch force and beating frequency, typically obtained by optical measurements. In this article, we describe a novel method for assessing twitch force and beating frequency of engineered heart tissue using magnetic field sensing, which enables multiple tissues to be measured simultaneously. The tissues are formed as thin structures suspended between two silicone posts, where one post is rigid and another is flexible and contains an embedded magnet. When the tissue contracts it causes the flexible post to bend in proportion to its twitch force. We measured the bending of the post using giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors located underneath a 24-well plate containing the tissues. We validated the accuracy of the readings from the GMR sensors against optical measurements. We demonstrated the utility and sensitivity of our approach by testing the effects of three concentrations of isoproterenol and verapamil on twitch force and beating frequency in real-time, parallel experiments. This system should be scalable beyond the 24-well format, enabling greater automation in assessing the contractile function of cardiomyocytes in a tissue-engineered environment.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

However, there is limited data regarding the optimal sequencing of RT and tamoxifen/AIs. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effects of tamoxifen and AIs on radiation-induced cardiotoxicity. Eighty ovariectomized rats were divided into eight groups (G). G1 was defined as a control group; G2, G3, G4, and G5 were RT, tamoxifen, anastrozle, and letrozole groups, respectively; G6, G7, and G8 were RT plus tamoxifen, anastrozle, and letrozole groups, respectively. Drugs were started 1 week before RT and continued until the animals were killed 16 weeks after RT. The heart tissues were then dissected and examined with light microscopy to determine endocardial thickness and cardiac fibrosis. The endocardial thickness scores of both RT alone and the tamoxifen groups as well as the cardiac fibrosis score of RT alone were higher than that the control group ( p < 0.05 for all). There was no difference in the endocardial thickness and cardiac fibrosis scores of the RT-only group and the RT plus hormonotherapy groups ( p > 0.05 for all). Concurrent administration of RT and hormonal therapy with either tamoxifen or AIs did not further amplify radiation-induced cardiac toxicity.

Increased oxidative stress may damage the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The coexistence of mtDNA variants in a cell or tissue (i.e., heteroplasmy) may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. Given the evidence on mitochondrial dysfunction and the relatively high incidence of multiorganic disorders associated with DS, we hypothesized that cardiac tissue from subjects with DS may exhibit higher frequencies of mtDNA variants in comparison to cardiac tissue from donors without DS. This study documents the analysis of mtDNA variants in heart tissue samples from donors with (n = 12) and without DS (n = 33) using massively parallel sequencing. Contrary to the original hypothesis, the study's findings suggest that the cardiac mitochondrial genomes from individuals with and without DS exhibit many similarities in terms of (1) total number of mtDNA variants per sample, (2) the frequency of mtDNA variants, (3) the type of mtDNA variants, and (4) the patterns of distribution of mtDNA variants.

{"title": "Cardiac Sodium Channel Mutations: Why so Many Phenotypes?", "abstract": "The cardiac Na(+) channel (Nav1.5) conducts a depolarizing inward Na(+) current that is responsible for the generation of the upstroke Phase 0 of the action potential. In heart tissue, changes in Na(+) currents can affect conduction velocity and impulse propagation. The cardiac Nav1.5 is also involved in determination of the action potential duration, since some channels may reopen during the plateau phase, generating a persistent or late inward current. Mutations of cardiac Nav1.5 can induce gain or loss of channel function because of an increased late current or a decrease of peak current, respectively. Gain-of-function mutations cause Long QT syndrome type 3 and possibly atrial fibrillation, while loss-of-function channel mutations are associated with a wider variety of phenotypes, such as Brugada syndrome, cardiac conduction disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, and sick sinus node syndrome. The penetrance and phenotypes resulting from Nav1.5 mutations also vary with age, gender, body temperature, circadian rhythm, and between regions of the heart. This phenotypic variability makes it difficult to correlate genotype-phenotype. We propose that mutations are only one contributor to the phenotype and additional modifications on Nav1.5 lead to the phenotypic variability. Possible modifiers include other genetic variations and alterations in the life cycle of Nav1.5 such as gene transcription, RNA processing, translation, posttranslational modifications, trafficking, complex assembly, and degradation. In this chapter, we summarize potential modifiers of cardiac Nav1.5 that could help explain the clinically observed phenotypic variability.

{"title": "Transcriptional profiling of regenerating embryonic mouse hearts.", "abstract": "The postnatal mammalian heart is considered a terminally differentiated organ unable to efficiently regenerate after injury. In contrast, we have recently shown a remarkable regenerative capacity of the prenatal heart using myocardial tissue mosaicism for mitochondrial dysfunction in mice. This model is based on inactivation of the X-linked gene encoding holocytochrome c synthase (Hccs) specifically in the developing heart. Loss of HCCS activity results in respiratory chain dysfunction, disturbed cardiomyocyte differentiation and reduced cell cycle activity. The Hccs gene is subjected to X chromosome inactivation, such that in females heterozygous for the heart conditional Hccs knockout approximately 50% of cardiac cells keep the defective X chromosome active and develop mitochondrial dysfunction while the other 50% remain healthy. During heart development the contribution of HCCS deficient cells to the cardiac tissue decreases from 50% at mid-gestation to 10% at birth. This regeneration of the prenatal heart is mediated by increased proliferation of the healthy cardiac cell population, which compensates for the defective cells allowing the formation of a fully functional heart by birth. Here we performed microarray RNA expression analyses on 13.5\u00a0dpc control and heterozygous Hccs knockout hearts to identify molecular mechanisms that drive embryonic heart regeneration.

In the Esp\u00edrito Santo state (southeastern Brazil), a fatal case of a patient with ACD led us to investigate the enzootic scenario to avoid the development of new cases. At the studied locality, Triatoma vitticeps exhibited high T. cruzi infection rates and frequently invaded residences.\nSylvatic and domestic mammals in the Rio da Prata locality, where the ACD case occurred, and in four surrounding areas (Baia Nova, Buenos Aires, Santa Rita and Todos os Santos) were examined and underwent parasitological and serological tests. Triatomines were collected for a fecal material exam, culturing and mini-exon gene molecular characterization, followed by RFLP-PCR of H3/Alul. Paraffin-embedded cardiac tissue of a patient was washed with xylene to remove paraffin and DNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroform method. For genotype characterization, PCR was performed to amplify the 1f8, GPI and 18S rRNA genes. In the case of V7V8 SSU rRNA, the PCR products were molecularly cloned. PCR products were sequenced and compared to sequences in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood method with 1000 bootstrap replicates was performed.\nNone of the animals showed positive hemocultures. Three rodents and two dogs showed signs of infection, as inferred from borderline serological titers. T. vitticeps was the only triatomine\u00a0species identified and showed T. cruzi infection by DTUs TcI and TcIV. The analysis of cardiac tissue DNA showed mixed infection by T. cruzi (DTUs I, II, III and IV) and Trypanosoma dionisii.\nEach case or outbreak of ACD should be analyzed as a particular epidemiological occurrence.

{"title": "", "abstract": "Clinical application of triptolide (TP), a main active ingredient of the traditional Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f. (TWHF), is limited by a series of severe toxicities, including cardiotoxicity. In previous studies, we found the activation of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) attenuated TP-induced toxicity in cardiomyocytes. Resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenol from the skins of grapes and red wine, is an activator of SIRT3. The current study aimed to investigate the protective effect of RSV against TP-induced cardiotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms. Mice were treated with a single dose of TP (2.5 mg/kg) via the intragastric (i.g.) route. After 24 h, TP induced abnormal changes of serum biochemistry, activity decrease of antioxidant enzymes and damage of heart tissue such as myocardial fiber rupture, cell swelling and interstitial congestion. In contrast, administration with RSV (50 mg/kg i.g. 12 h before and 2 h after the administration of TP) attenuated the detrimental effects induced by TP in BALB/c mice. Moreover, the cardiomyocyte protective effects of RSV on TP-induced heart injury were associated with the activation of SIRT3 and its downstream targets. In vitro study also indicated that RSV counteracted TP-induced cardiotoxicity through SIRT3-FOXO3 signaling pathway in H9c2 cells. Collectively, these findings suggest the potential of RSV as a promising agent in protecting heart from TP-induced damage.", "journal": "Die Pharmazie", "date": "2016-09-01", "authors": ["YanqinYang", "WenwenWang", "ZhewenXiong", "JiaminKong", "LiWang", "YuwenQiu", "FeihaiShen", "ZhiyingHuang"], "doi": "10.1691/ph.2016.6597"}
{"title": "Bi-layered polyurethane - Extracellular matrix cardiac patch improves ischemic ventricular wall remodeling in a rat model.", "abstract": "As an intervention to abrogate ischemic cardiomyopathy, the concept of applying a temporary, local patch to the surface of the recently infarcted ventricle has been explored from a number of design perspectives. Two important features considered for such a cardiac patch include the provision of appropriate mechanical support and the capacity to influence the remodeling pathway by providing cellular or biomolecule delivery. The objective of this report was to focus on these two features by first evaluating the incorporation of a cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) component, and second by evaluating the impact of patch anisotropy on the pathological remodeling process initiated by myocardial infarction. The functional outcomes of microfibrous, elastomeric, biodegradable cardiac patches have been evaluated in a rat chronic infarction model. Ten weeks after infarction and 8\u00a0wk after patch epicardial placement, echocardiographic function, tissue-level structural remodeling (e.g., biaxial mechanical response and microstructural analysis), and cellular level remodeling were assessed. The results showed that the incorporation of a cardiac ECM altered the progression of several keys aspects of maladaptive remodeling following myocardial infarction. This included decreasing LV global mechanical compliance, inhibiting echocardiographically-measured functional deterioration, mitigating scar formation and LV wall thinning, and promoting angiogenesis. In evaluating the impact of patch anisotropy, no effects from the altered patch mechanics were detected after 8\u00a0wk, possibly due to patch fibrous encapsulation. Overall, this study demonstrates the benefit of a cardiac patch design that combines both ventricle mechanical support, through a biodegradable, fibrillary elastomeric component, and the incorporation of ECM-based hydrogel components.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-09-01", "authors": ["AntonioD'Amore", "TomoYoshizumi", "Samuel KLuketich", "Matthew TWolf", "XinzhuGu", "MarcelloCammarata", "RichardHoff", "Stephen FBadylak", "William RWagner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.07.039"}

Fibroblast differentiation into adipogenic lineage is important for fat accumulation around the heart which is important in cardiac pathology. The differentiation in fibroblast has been observed both spontaneously and due to increased insulin stimulation. The present study aims to observe the effect of insulin in adipogenic differentiation of cardiac cells present in primary murine cardiomyocyte cultures. Oil Red O (ORO) staining has been used for observing the lipid accumulations formed due to adipogenic differentiation in murine cardiomyocyte cultures. The accumulated lipids were quantified by ORO assay and normalized using protein estimation. The lipid accumulation in cardiac cultures did not increase in presence of insulin. However, addition of other growth factors like insulin-like growth factor 1 and epidermal growth factor promoted adipogenic differentiation even in the presence of insulin and other inhibitory molecules such as vitamins. Lipid accumulation also increased in cells grown in media without insulin after an initial exposure to insulin-containing growth media. The current study adds to the existing knowledge that the insulin by itself cannot induce adipogenic induction in the cardiac cultures.

The cardioprotective effect of RA-3 in isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury in hyperlipidemic rats was investigated. Rats were divided into the normal diet (ND) fed and high fat diet (HFD) fed groups. The HFD rats were further subdivided into three groups. The experimental group was orally administered with RA-3 (100\u2009mg/kg) for 15 days. The rats were then injected with isoproterenol (85\u2009mg/kg) to induce myocardial injury. At the end of the experiment, hearts and blood tissues were collected and used for histology and biochemical assays, respectively.\nRA-3 exhibited a cardioprotective effect as it minimized myocardial injury in HFD rats. Few lesions of acute hyaline degeneration and reduced fat deposition were observed in the heart tissue of the triterpene pretreated rats. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was decreased in the blood of the RA-3 pretreated rats (44.1\u2009mU/mL) compared to the untreated group (64.8\u2009mU/mL).

This material enables formation of thin muscle strips whose biomechanical characteristics are easily measured and manipulated. To create EHTs, sections of porcine myocardium were laser-cut into ribbon-like shapes, decellularized, and mounted in specialized clips for seeding and culture. Scaffolds were first tested by seeding with neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. EHTs beat synchronously by day five and exhibited robust length-dependent activation by day 21. Fiber orientation within the scaffold affected peak twitch stress, demonstrating its ability to guide cells toward physiologic contractile anisotropy. Scaffold anisotropy also made it possible to probe cellular responses to stretch as a function of fiber angle. Stretch that was aligned with the fiber direction increased expression of brain natriuretic peptide, but off-axis stretches (causing fiber shear) did not. The method also produced robust EHTs from cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). hiPSC-EHTs achieved maximum peak stress of 6.5\u2009mN/mm(2) and twitch kinetics approaching reported values from adult human trabeculae.

Metal accumulation and biochemical responses were evaluated after rats were exposed to three different concentrations of PM2.5 in saline extract (10\u00d7 dilution, 5\u00d7 dilution, and concentrated). The experimental data showed the bioaccumulation of diverse trace metals in the hearts of groups exposed to PM2.5 from both regions. Furthermore, mobilization of the antioxidant defenses and an increase in lipid peroxidation of the cardiac tissue was observed in response to the industrial and rural area PM2.5. Glutathione-S-transferase activity was increased in groups exposed to the 5\u00d7 and concentrated rural PM2.5. Additionally, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter activity in the cardiac tissue exposed to PM2.5 was reduced in response to the 5\u00d7 dilution of the rural and industrial region PM2.5. Histological analysis showed a decrease in the percentage of cardiac cells in the heart at all tested concentrations. The results indicate that exposure to different concentrations of PM2.5 from both sources causes biochemical and histological changes in the heart with consequent damage to biological structures; these factors can favor the development of cardiac diseases.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2016-08-28", "authors": ["Joaquim de PaulaRibeiro", "Ana CristinaKalb", "Paula PeixotoCampos", "Alex Rub\u00e9n Huaman De LaCruz", "Pablo EliasMartinez", "AdrianaGioda", "Marta Marques deSouza", "Carolina RosaGioda"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.094"}

Efforts are therefore inclined toward finding other alternatives. The present study was, thus, undertaken to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of Azadirachta indica (AI) on microangiopathic changes in rat model of diabetes.\nDiabetes was induced in male rats by single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg body weight). Seven days after glucose levels are stabilized, aqueous leaf extract of AI (ALE) (600 mg/kg(1) body weight) was administered orally to diabetic animals every day for 7 days.\nHigh blood glucose characterizing diabetes in these animals was found to show increased lipid peroxidation (LPO), altered antioxidant biomarkers together with microangiopathic alterations. The treatment of diabetic rats with ALE reduced the levels of blood glucose, LPO, and restored the activities of antioxidant enzyme. Light and transmission electron microscopic analysis revealed reduced necrotic areas and inflammation in tissue architecture of ALE treated heart in comparison to untreated diabetic group.\nAI provides cardioprotection by ameliorating oxidative stress in rat model of diabetic mellitus.\nThe streptozotocin (STZ) treatment (60 mg/kg body weight) to animals induced diabetic changes such as elevated blood glucose levels, decreased body weight, altered lipid profiles together with development of proxidant state evidenced by elevated levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), depletion in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and altered antioxidant enzymes with consequent microangiopathic alterations in heart tissue evinced by localization of necrotic and inflamed areas in heart tissueThe treatment of animals with Azadirachta indica leaf extract (ALE) (600 mg/kg body weight) post-STZ treatment significantly reversed the adverse effects witnessed by normalized blood glucose levels, improvement in reduced body weight and stabilized lipid profilesFurther, ALE treatment also significantly reduced the LPO indices, improvement in GSH content and restoration of antioxidant enzyme activities, suggesting antioxidatant potential of ALEThe microangiopathic changes in the heart tissue consequent to induction of diabetes and oxidative stress by STZ as reiterated through light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were found to be reversed by ALE treatment.

With each boost, more inflammatory cells were observed infiltrating heart tissue which could lead to severe cardiac damage. We also found evidence that both complement and anti-M protein antibodies in serum from rM5-immunized rats have the potential to contribute to inflammation in heart valves by activating cardiac endothelium. More importantly, we have demonstrated by electrocardiography for the first time in the RAV model that elongation of P-R interval follows repetitive boost with rM5.

We have previously shown that the enzyme arachidonate 15 lipoxygenase (ALOX15), which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), is highly expressed in ischemic heart tissue, but its role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease is unclear. Here we showed that expression of ALOX15, but not ALOX12 or ALOX15B, was increased in ischemic versus non-ischemic human heart biopsy samples. A similar ALOX expression pattern was found in hypoxic human cardiomyocytes and cardiac endothelial cells. We also showed that levels of 15-HETE were significantly higher in ischemic versus non-ischemic human heart biopsy samples and showed a tendency to increase in serum from the patients with ischemic heart disease. Moreover, hypoxia increased the production of 15-HETE levels from human cardiomyocytes and cardiac endothelial cells. The hypoxia-induced increase in 15-HETE levels from human cardiomyocytes was inhibited by the ALOX15 inhibitor baicalein. Finally, by using intrinsic rotational thromboelastometry, we showed that human whole blood clotted faster in the presence of 15-HETE. In summary, we propose that increased ALOX15 expression in heart tissue under ischemic conditions may lead to increased production of 15-HETE, potentially contributing to thrombosis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-08-24", "authors": ["AnnikaLundqvist", "MikaelSandstedt", "JoakimSandstedt", "RuthWickelgren", "G\u00f6ran IHansson", "AndersJeppsson", "Lillemor MattssonHult\u00e9n"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0161629\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00137.2011\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.06.117\n10.1371/journal.pone.0043142\n10.1111/j.1365-2362.2009.02223.x\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.01.015\n10.1021/Cr200246d\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.10.002\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.618835\n10.1371/journal.pone.0088546\n10.1152/ajplung.00004.2015\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00118.2011\n10.1016/j.tiv.2011.12.005\n10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.01715.x\n10.1016/j.thromres.2014.05.023\n10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03066.x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.09.077\n10.1136/bmj.39430.529549.BE\n10.1007/s12032-008-9129-0\n10.1016/j.surg.2009.06.054"}

Since mitochondria play a critical role in the regulation of cardiac tissue homeostasis, this organelle is a critical target for the protective effects of several pharmaceuticals. Although specific mitochondria-targeted antioxidants and some pharmacological agents are described as potential cardioprotective agents, there are still a few effective mitochondrial therapies for the treatment of CVDs. Agents which have potential cardioprotective effects by directly targeting mitochondria in vitro and in vivo are still in pre-clinical or clinical trials, hence their widespread use in the clinic is still far. Also, some of these agents have a decreased bioavailability or show some intrinsic toxicity, which also limits their working mitochondrial concentrations.\nBy initially using PubMed specific queries for literature search, we review here cardiac mitochondrial effects of specific targeted and non-targeted antioxidants and pharmacological agents, including MitoE, MitoQ, MitoSNO, Mito-TEMPOL, SkQ1, SkQR1, carvedilol, trimetazidine, ranolazine, diazoxide and propofol.\nThe present review emphasizes new mitochondrial-targeting strategies which have emerged to address difficulties arising from current approaches.

The three-dimensional electromechanical model considered consists of the following four coupled components: the quasi-static transversely isotropic finite elasticity equations for the deformation of the cardiac tissue; the active tension model for the intracellular calcium dynamics and cross-bridge binding; the anisotropic Bidomain model for the electrical current flow through the deforming cardiac tissue; the membrane model of ventricular myocytes, including stretch-activated channels. The numerical simulations are based on our finite element parallel solver, which employs Multilevel Additive Schwarz preconditioners for the solution of the discretized Bidomain equations and Newton-Krylov methods for the solution of the discretized non-linear finite elasticity equations. Our findings show that: (i) the presence of intrinsic transmural cellular APD heterogeneities is not fully masked by electrotonic current flow or by the presence of the mechanical deformation; (ii) despite the presence of transmural APD heterogeneities, the recovery process follows the activation sequence and there is no significant transmural repolarization gradient; (iii) with or without transmural APD heterogeneities, epicardial electrograms always display the same wave shape and discordance between the polarity of QRS complex and T-wave; (iv) the main effects of the mechanical deformation are an increase of the dispersion of repolarization time and APD, when computed over the total cardiac domain and over the endo- and epicardial surfaces, while there is a slight decrease along the transmural direction.", "journal": "Mathematical biosciences", "date": "2016-08-23", "authors": ["PColli Franzone", "L FPavarino", "SScacchi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mbs.2016.08.003"}

Treated, sham operated (no MI), and control (MI without treatment) animals, were compared through echocardiography, hemodynamics, pathological evaluation and analyses of various mRNA and protein level markers.\nOur results show that in both acute and long-term chronic MI models, pcECM promotes significant cardiac function improvement, which is correlated to progenitor (GATA4(+), c-kit(+)) and myocyte (MYLC(+), TRPI(+)) recruitment. Interestingly, recruited progenitors, isolated using laser capture microdissection (LCM), expressed both early and late cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation markers, suggesting differentiation towards the CM lineage. Recruited CM-like cells organized in a partially striated and immature muscle fiber arrangement that presented connexin43 -a crucial mediator of cardiac electrical conductivity. Concomitantly, pcECM was rapidly vascularized, and induced a constructive remodeling process as indicated by increased M2/M1 macrophage phenotypic ratio and pathological evaluation.\nAcellular pcECM patch implants alone, i.e., without added biologics, are bioactive, and exert potent efficacy, stimulating biological regenerative processes that cooperatively lead to a cardiac progenitor-based restoration of function, even after scar tissue had already formed.\nMI ('heart attack') remains the leading cause of heart failure and death in developed-countries. Restoration of cardiac function requires active turnover of damaged heart contracting cells (CM), however, CM endogenous regeneration is not efficient and is a matter of controversy. We show that a bioactive biomaterial alone-decellularized heart tissue (pcECM)-without added cells or growth factors, can elicit a complex regenerative response even after irreversible scarring. The pcECM patch induces macrophage polarization towards constructive remodeling and cardiomyocyte progenitor cell (GATA4(+), c-kit(+)) recruitment (evidenced at both mRNA and protein levels) resulting in de novo immature striated-like muscle patterns (MLC(+), TrpI(+), connexin43(+)).

Using a model of cardiac transplant-mediated ischemia reperfusion injury and intravital 2-photon imaging of beating mouse hearts, we determined that tissue-resident CCR2", "journal": "JCI insight", "date": "2016-08-19", "authors": ["WenjunLi", "Hsi-MinHsiao", "RyujiHigashikubo", "Brian TSaunders", "AnkitBharat", "Daniel RGoldstein", "Alexander SKrupnick", "Andrew EGelman", "Kory JLavine", "DanielKreisel"], "doi": "10.1172/jci.insight.87315\n10.1161/01.CIR.102.13.1564\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.10.011\n10.1172/JCI62970\n10.1161/01.CIR.75.5.1083\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.516708\n10.1172/JCI115427\n10.4049/jimmunol.1301539\n10.4049/jimmunol.180.10.6439\n10.1038/nri2779\n10.1016/j.immuni.2013.11.019\n10.1073/pnas.1406508111\n10.2353/ajpath.2007.060547\n10.1084/jem.20132126\n10.1126/science.1195491\n10.1084/jem.20060925\n10.4049/jimmunol.1401415\n10.1152/ajplung.00453.2001\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4363-08.2009\n10.1084/jem.20070885\n10.1097/TP.0b013e3181e6f1eb\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.01.021\n10.1172/JCI31008\n10.1152/ajpheart.00119.2008\n10.1253/circj.CJ-11-0194\n10.1093/cvr/cvt047\n10.1152/ajpheart.01355.2006\n10.1002/hep.24501\n10.1038/nature10992\n10.1002/hep.23365\n10.1165/rcmb.2011-0260OC\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00367.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.18.2296\n10.1016/j.immuni.2010.07.009\n10.1161/01.RES.0000124395.20249.AE\n10.1089/jir.2014.0135\n10.1073/pnas.1008737107\n10.1182/blood-2011-04-347823"}
{"title": "Growth hormone and risk for cardiac tumors in Carney complex.", "abstract": "Carney complex (CNC) is a multiple neoplasia syndrome that is caused mostly by PRKAR1A mutations. Cardiac myxomas are the leading cause of mortality in CNC patients who, in addition, often develop growth hormone (GH) excess. We studied patients with CNC, who were observed for over a period of 20\u2009years (1995-2015) for the development of both GH excess and cardiac myxomas. GH secretion was evaluated by standard testing; dedicated cardiovascular imaging was used to detect cardiac abnormalities. Four excised cardiac myxomas were tested for the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). A total of 99 CNC patients (97 with a PRKAR1A mutation) were included in the study with a mean age of 25.8\u2009\u00b1\u200916.6\u2009years at presentation. Over an observed mean follow-up of 25.8\u2009years, 60% of patients with GH excess (n\u2009=\u200946) developed a cardiac myxoma compared with only 36% of those without GH excess (n\u2009=\u200954) (P\u2009=\u20090.016). Overall, patients with GH excess were also more likely to have a tumor vs those with normal GH secretion (OR: 2.78, 95% CI: 1.23-6.29; P\u2009=\u20090.014). IGF-1 mRNA and protein were higher in CNC myxomas than in normal heart tissue. We conclude that the development of cardiac myxomas in CNC may be associated with increased GH secretion, in a manner analogous to the association between fibrous dysplasia and GH excess in McCune-Albright syndrome, a condition similar to CNC.

S1PL inhibition is reported to preferentially elevate S1P in lymphoid organs. Tissue selectivity could potentially differentiate S1PL inhibitors from S1P receptor agonists, the use of which also results in bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and hypertension. But it is unknown if S1PL inhibition would also modulate cardiac S1P levels or cardiovascular function. The S1PL inhibitor 6-[(2R)-4-(4-benzyl-7-chlorophthalazin-1-yl)-2-methylpiperazin-1-yl]pyridine-3-carbonitrile was used to determine the relationship in rats between drug concentration, S1P levels in select tissues, and circulating lymphocytes. Repeated oral doses of the S1PL inhibitor fully depleted circulating lymphocytes after 3 to 4 days of treatment in rats. Full lymphopenia corresponded to increased levels of S1P of 100- to 1000-fold in lymph nodes, 3-fold in blood (but with no change in plasma), and 9-fold in cardiac tissue. Repeated oral dosing of the S1PL inhibitor in telemeterized, conscious rats resulted in significant bradycardia within 48 hours of drug treatment, comparable in magnitude to the bradycardia induced by 3 mg/kg fingolimod.

This was evidenced by improved left ventricle pressure, heart rate and coronary flow, and left ventricle end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in IR hearts (isolated from rabbits pre-exposed to saffron (S/IR)). Electrophysiological recordings revealed a significant decline in both premature ventricle contraction and ventricle tachycardia/fibrillation in S/IR compared to IR hearts. This was paralleled by increased expression of the contractile proteins \u03b1-actinin and Troponin C in the myocardium of S/IR hearts. Histological examination combined to biochemical analysis indicated that hearts pre-exposed to saffron exhibited reduced infarct size, lower lipid peroxidation, with increased glutathione peroxidase activity, and oxidation of nitro blue tetrazolium (by reactive oxygen species). Furthermore, in contrast with IR hearts, saffron pretreatment induced restoration of the phosphorylation level of the survival proteins Akt and 4EBP1 and reduced activity of p38. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the natural antioxidant saffron plays a pivotal role in halting IR-associated cardiac injuries and emerges as a novel preventive tool for ischemic heart disease.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2016-08-11", "authors": ["MoniNader", "NathalieChahine", "CharelleSalem", "RamezChahine"], "doi": "10.1007/s13105-016-0510-8"}
{"title": "Automated Texture Analysis and Determination of Fibre Orientation of Heart Tissue: A Morphometric Study.", "abstract": "The human heart has a heterogeneous structure, which is characterized by different cell types and their spatial configurations. The physical structure, especially the fibre orientation and the interstitial fibrosis, determines the electrical excitation and in further consequence the contractility in macroscopic as well as in microscopic areas. Modern image processing methods and parameters could be used to describe the image content and image texture. In most cases the description of the texture is not satisfying because the fibre orientation, detected with common algorithms, is biased by elements such as fibrocytes or endothelial nuclei. The goal of this work is to figure out if cardiac tissue can be analysed and classified on a microscopic level by automated image processing methods with a focus on an accurate detection of the fibre orientation. Quantitative parameters for identification of textures of different complexity or pathological attributes inside the heart were determined. The focus was set on the detection of the fibre orientation, which was calculated on the basis of the cardiomyocytes' nuclei. It turned out that the orientation of these nuclei corresponded with a high precision to the fibre orientation in the image plane. Additionally, these nuclei also indicated very well the inclination of the fibre.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-08-10", "authors": ["BernhardZach", "ErnstHofer", "MartinAsslaber", "HelmutAhammer"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0160735\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2010.10.019\n10.1117/1.JBO.17.2.026007\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.1111/j.1365-2818.2012.03646.x\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2256359"}
{"title": "Comparative Genomics Analysis of Streptococcus tigurinus Strains Identifies Genetic Elements Specifically and Uniquely Present in Highly Virulent Strains.", "abstract": "Streptococcus tigurinus is responsible for severe invasive infections such as infective endocarditis, spondylodiscitis and meningitis. As described, S. tigurinus isolates AZ_3aT and AZ_14 were highly virulent (HV phenotype) in an experimental model of infective endocarditis and showed enhanced adherence and invasion of human endothelial cells when compared to low virulent S. tigurinus isolate AZ_8 (LV phenotype). Here, we sought whether genetic determinants could explain the higher virulence of AZ_3aT and AZ_14 isolates. Several genetic determinants specific to the HV strains were identified through extensive comparative genomics amongst which some were thought to be highly relevant for the observed HV phenotype. These included i) an iron uptake and metabolism operon, ii) an ascorbate assimilation operon, iii) a newly acquired PI-2-like pilus islets described for the first time in S. tigurinus, iv) a hyaluronate metabolism operon, v) an Entner-Doudoroff pathway of carbohydrates metabolism, and vi) an alternate pathways for indole biosynthesis. We believe that the identified genomic features could largely explain the phenotype of high infectivity of the two HV S. tigurinus strains. Indeed, these features include determinants that could be involved at different stages of the disease such as survival of S. tigurinus in blood (iron uptake and ascorbate metabolism operons), initial attachment of bacterial pathogen to the damaged cardiac tissue and/or vegetation that formed on site (PI-2-like pilus islets), tissue invasion (hyaluronate operon and Entner-Doudoroff pathway) and regulation of pathogenicity (indole biosynthesis pathway).", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-08-10", "authors": ["Seydina MDiene", "PatriceFran\u00e7ois", "AndreaZbinden", "Jos\u00e9 ManuelEntenza", "Gr\u00e9goryResch"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0160554\n10.1186/s12866-014-0231-5\n10.1111/1574-6968.12519\n10.1128/JCM.00849-12\n10.1099/ijs.0.038299-0\n10.1128/JCM.02801-13\n10.1016/j.jiac.2014.08.014\n10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2014.12.007\n10.1016/j.eimc.2015.01.006\n10.1128/JCM.01551-15\n10.1016/j.ijmm.2013.06.006\n10.1128/genomeA.00210-12\n10.1101/gr.072033.107\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2008.07.003\n10.1093/molbev/mst010\n10.1371/journal.pone.0009490\n10.1128/AEM.02411-13\n10.1186/1471-2164-13-202\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btq315\n10.1186/1471-2164-9-75\n10.1371/journal.pone.0025124\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002683\n10.1128/mSphere.00041-15\n10.1128/IAI.01710-14\n10.1099/mic.0.26942-0\n10.1128/JB.06379-11\n10.1093/infdis/jit353\n10.1128/ecosalplus.3.6.1.8\n10.1038/nature09354\n10.1016/j.tim.2015.08.001\n10.4161/viru.2.6.17732\n10.1073/pnas.0908876106\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1000422\n10.1016/j.str.2009.10.019\n10.1128/JB.00384-08\n10.1099/mic.0.25996-0\n10.1128/JB.01520-07\n10.1128/AEM.00258-07\n10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07887.x\n10.1124/pr.107.07110\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2004.04.014\n10.1073/pnas.032523999\n10.1128/JB.01011-06\n10.1074/jbc.M115.647834"}
{"title": "Defining myocardial tissue abnormalities in end-stage renal failure with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using native T1 mapping.", "abstract": "Noninvasive quantification of myocardial fibrosis in end-stage renal disease is challenging. Gadolinium contrast agents previously used for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are contraindicated because of an association with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. In other populations, increased myocardial native T1 times on cardiac MRI have been shown to be a surrogate marker of myocardial fibrosis. We applied this method to 33 incident hemodialysis patients and 28 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers who underwent MRI at 3.0T. Native T1 relaxation times and feature tracking-derived global longitudinal strain as potential markers of fibrosis were compared and associated with cardiac biomarkers. Left ventricular mass indices were higher in the hemodialysis than the control group. Global, Septal and midseptal T1 times were all significantly higher in the hemodialysis group (global T1 hemodialysis 1171 \u00b1 27 ms vs. 1154 \u00b1 32 ms; septal T1 hemodialysis 1184 \u00b1 29 ms vs. 1163 \u00b1 30 ms; and midseptal T1 hemodialysis 1184 \u00b1 34 ms vs. 1161 \u00b1 29 ms). In the hemodialysis group, T1 times correlated with left ventricular mass indices. Septal T1 times correlated with troponin and electrocardiogram-corrected QT interval. The peak global longitudinal strain was significantly reduced in the hemodialysis group (hemodialysis -17.7\u00b15.3% vs. -21.8\u00b16.2%). For hemodialysis patients, the peak global longitudinal strain significantly correlated with left ventricular mass indices (R\u00a0= 0.426), and a trend was seen for correlation with galectin-3, a biomarker of cardiac fibrosis. Thus, cardiac tissue properties of hemodialysis patients consistent with myocardial fibrosis can be determined noninvasively and associated with multiple structural and functional abnormalities.", "journal": "Kidney international", "date": "2016-08-10", "authors": ["ElaineRutherford", "Mohammed ATalle", "KennethMangion", "ElizabethBell", "Samuli MRauhalammi", "GilesRoditi", "ChristieMcComb", "AleksandraRadjenovic", "PaulWelsh", "RosemaryWoodward", "Allan DStruthers", "Alan GJardine", "Rajan KPatel", "ColinBerry", "Patrick BMark"], "doi": "10.1016/j.kint.2016.06.014"}

Effect of modulation of T cell trafficking on diabetes-induced cardiac fibrosis has yet to be determined. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the circulatory T cell depletion-mediated cardioprotection in streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy. Fingolimod (FTY720), an immunomodulatory drug, was tested in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and recombination activating gene 1 (Rag1) knockout (KO) mice without mature lymphocytes in streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic model. FTY720 (0.3mg/kg/day) was administered intraperitoneally daily for the first 4weeks with interim 3weeks then resumed for another 4weeks in 11weeks study period. T lymphocyte counts, cardiac histology, function, and fibrosis were examined in diabetic both WT and KO mice. FTY720 reduced both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in diabetic WT mice. FTY720-treated diabetic WT mouse myocardium showed reduction in CD3 T cell infiltration and decreased expression of S1P1 and TGF-\u03b21 in cardiac tissue. Fibrosis was reduced after FTY720 treatment in diabetic WT mice. Rag1 KO mice exhibited no CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the blood and CD3 T cells in the heart. Diabetic Rag1 KO mouse hearts appeared no fibrosis and exhibited preserved myocardial contractility. FTY720-induced antifibrosis was abolished in diabetic Rag1 KO mice.

{"title": "Nilotinib reverses ABCB1/P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance but increases cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin in a MDR xenograft model.", "abstract": "The BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), nilotinib, was developed to surmount resistance or intolerance to imatinib in patients with Philadelphia-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. Recent studies have shown that nilotinib induces potent sensitization to anticancer agents by blocking the functions of ABCB1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in multidrug resistance (MDR). However, changes in P-gp expression or function affect the cardiac disposition and prolong the presence of both doxorubicin (DOX) and doxorubicinol (DOXol) in cardiac tissue, thus, enhancing the risk of cardiotoxicity. In this study, we used a MDR xenograft model to evaluate the antitumor activity, tissue distribution and cardiotoxicity of DOX when co-administered with nilotinib. This information will provide more insight into the pharmacological role of nilotinib in MDR reversal and the risk of DOX cardiotoxicity. Our results showed that nilotinib significantly enhanced DOX cytotoxicity and increased intracellular rhodamine 123 accumulation in MG63/DOX cells in vitro and strongly enhanced DOX inhibition of growth of P-gp-overexpressing MG63/DOX cell xenografts in nude mice. Additionally, nilotinib significantly increased DOX and DOXol accumulation in serum, heart, liver and tumor tissues. Importantly, nilotinib induced a disproportionate increase in DOXol in cardiac tissue. In the co-administration group, CBR1 and AKR1A1 protein levels were significantly increased in cardiac tissue, with more severe necrosis and vacuole formation. These results indicate that nilotinib reverses P-gp- mediated MDR by blocking the efflux function and potentiates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.

{"title": "Renal Sympathetic Denervation in Rats Ameliorates Cardiac Dysfunction and Fibrosis Post-Myocardial Infarction Involving MicroRNAs.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND The role of renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) in ameliorating post-myocardial infarction (MI) left ventricular (LV) fibrosis via microRNA-dependent regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) remains unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS MI and RSD were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by ligating the left coronary artery and denervating the bilateral renal nerves, respectively. Norepinephrine, renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone in plasma, collagen, microRNA21, microRNA 101a, microRNA 133a and CTGF in heart tissue, as well as cardiac function were evaluated six weeks post-MI. RESULTS In the RSD group, parameters of cardiac function were significantly improved as evidenced by increased LV ejection fraction (p<0.01), LV end-systolic diameter (p<0.01), end-diastolic diameter (p<0.05), LV systolic pressure (p<0.05), maximal rate of pressure rise and decline (dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin, p<0.05), and decreased LV end-diastolic pressure (p<0.05) when compared with MI rats. Further, reduced collagen deposition in peri-infarct myocardium was observed in RSD-treated rats along with higher microRNA101a and microRNA133a (p<0.05) and lower microRNA21 expression (p<0.01) than in MI rats. CTGF mRNA and protein levels were decreased in LV following RSD (p<0.01), accompanied by decreased expression of norepinephrine, renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone in plasma (p<0.05) compared with untreated MI rats.

{"title": "How Biomaterials Can Influence Various Cell Types in the Repair and Regeneration of the Heart after Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "The healthy heart comprises many different cell types that work together to preserve optimal function. However, in a diseased heart the function of one or more cell types is compromised which can lead to many adverse events, one of which is myocardial infarction (MI). Immediately after MI, the cardiac environment is characterized by excessive cardiomyocyte death and inflammatory signals leading to the recruitment of macrophages to clear the debris. Proliferating fibroblasts then invade, and a collagenous scar is formed to prevent rupture. Better functional restoration of the heart is not achieved due to the limited regenerative capacity of cardiac tissue. To address this, biomaterial therapy is being investigated as an approach to improve regeneration in the infarcted heart, as they can possess the potential to control cell function in the infarct environment and limit the adverse compensatory changes that occur post-MI. Over the past decade, there has been considerable research into the development of biomaterials for cardiac regeneration post-MI; and various effects have been observed on different cell types depending on the biomaterial that is applied. Biomaterial treatment has been shown to enhance survival, improve function, promote proliferation, and guide the mobilization and recruitment of different cells in the post-MI heart. This review will provide a summary on the biomaterials developed to enhance cardiac regeneration and remodeling post-MI with a focus on how they control macrophages, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. A better understanding of how a biomaterial interacts with the different cell types in the heart may lead to the development of a more optimized biomaterial therapy for cardiac regeneration.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2016-08-04", "authors": ["ZacharyLister", "Katey JRayner", "Erik JSuuronen"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2016.00062\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.02.028\n10.1166/jbt.2014.1264\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000134791.68010.FA\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.025\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0264\n10.1016/j.msec.2016.02.056\n10.1016/j.lfs.2012.08.034\n10.1016/j.bbi.2008.05.010\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.11.004\n10.1016/j.micinf.2011.07.011.Innate\n10.1016/S0955-0674(02)00361-7\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.07.046\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.11.031\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.11.040\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.08.003\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.04.022\n10.1152/ajpheart.01047.2006\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.10.002\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.04.040\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.07.004\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00212-6\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.001273\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.652859\n10.1002/jbm.a.35232\n10.1161/01.RES.0000163017.13772.3a\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.07.015.The\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.011\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.655688\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3007244\n10.1084/jem.20110132\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302335\n10.2147/IJN.S81451\n10.1182/blood-2009-12-257832\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.10.034\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0707\n10.1093/cvr/cvs109\n10.1089/ars.2007.1957\n10.1016/j.phrs.2008.06.007\n10.1152/physrev.00008.2011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243162\n10.1152/ajpheart.01016.2002\n10.1093/cvr/cvu025\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.005\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.11.075\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.065\n10.1038/nri978\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.02.054\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.09.005\n10.1073/pnas.1015623108\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.10.022\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.05.049\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.1860\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.07.003\n10.1016/j.lfs.2010.07.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.300484\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.031\n10.1074/jbc.M109.028449\n10.1007/s00109-011-0847-y\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.01.041\n10.1007/s00424-011-0954-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.727420\n10.1017/S1431927611012438\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302819\n10.1038/icb.2011.20\n10.1242/jcs.074112\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000343\n10.1016/j.it.2004.09.015\n10.1016/j.cjca.2014.03.018\n10.1002/jcp.10333\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014937\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.08.045\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.10.007\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.08.042\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.916346\n10.1084/jem.20070885\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1172/JCI64216.4294\n10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68074-4\n10.1002/jbm.b.33410\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.02.009\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.05.043\n10.1161/01.CIR.81.4.1161\n10.18632/aging.100669\n10.1016/j.scr.2014.06.004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036814\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.10.058\n10.1016/j.actbio.2007.03.013\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.11.001\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001881\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.08.097\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.188965\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3005503\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.017\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.045\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.888\n10.1038/nature05383\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.021\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs215\n10.1016/S0142-9612(96)00183-4\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.25.2981\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.001081\n10.1096/fj.08-111054\n10.1126/science.1175202.Identification\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.06.063\n10.1038/nrm809\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.05.027\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.09.018\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.01.011\n10.1016/j.matbio.2010.06.007\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.05.057\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.05.032\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.041\n10.1038/nrcardio.2009.199\n10.1016/j.vph.2012.07.003\n10.1016/j.actbio.2005.06.006\n10.1098/rsif.2011.0301\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.06.002\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfn009\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.078\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.06.022\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehq277\n10.1002/wsbm.1322\n10.1038/srep24474\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00593-3\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.12.016\n10.1016/S1499-3872(14)60024-2\n10.1152/physrev.00021.2014"}

The postoperative course was uncomplicated in all patients, and they are still alive at this time. An aggressive surgical approach to cardiac tumors can possibly lead to complete resection but often requires reconstruction of the cardiac tissue with a membrane.

To investigate the role of microRNA-26a (miR-26a) in regulating cardiac hypertrophy and its functioning mechanisms, overexpression and suppression of miR\u201126a via its mimic and inhibitor in a transverse abdominal aortic constriction (TAAC)-induced rat model and in angiotensin\u00a0II (Ang\u00a0II)-induced cardiomyocytes (CMs) was performed. In the rat model, the heart weight (HW) compared with the body weight (BW), the CM area, and expression of the hypertrophy\u2011associated factors, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and \u03b2\u2011myosin heavy chain (\u03b2\u2011MHC), were assessed. In CMs, the protein synthesis rate was determined using a leucine incorporation assay. Mutation of the GATA\u2011binding protein\u00a04 (GATA4) 3'\u2011untranslated region (UTR) and overexpression of GATA4 were performed to confirm whether GATA4 is the target of miR\u201126a. The results indicated that miR-26a was significantly downregulated in the heart tissue of the rat model, as well as in Ang\u00a0II\u2011induced CMs (P<0.05). The TAAC-induced rat model exhibited a higher HW/BW ratio, a larger CM area, and higher expression levels of ANF and \u03b2\u2011MHC. CMs, upon Ang\u00a0II treatment, also demonstrated a larger CM area, higher levels of ANF and \u03b2\u2011MHC, as well as accelerated protein synthesis. miR\u201126a was not able to regulate GATA4 with mutations in the 3'\u2011UTR, indicating that GATA4 was the direct target of miR\u201126a. Overexpression of GATA4 abrogated the inhibitory functions of miR\u201126a in cardiac hypertrophy.

{"title": "The effect of door-to-balloon delay in primary percutaneous coronary intervention on clinical outcomes of STEMI: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a medical emergency in which sudden occlusion of coronary artery(ies) results in ischemia and necrosis of the cardiac tissues. Reperfusion therapies that aim at reopening the occluded artery remain the mainstay of treatment for AMI. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which enables the restoration of blood flow by reopening the occluded artery(ies) via a catheter with an inflatable balloon, is currently the preferred treatment for AMI with ST segment elevation (STEMI). The door-to-balloon (D2B) delay refers to the time interval counting from the arrival of a patient with STEMI at a hospital to the time of the balloon inflation (or stent deployment) that reopens the occluded artery(ies). Reducing this delay in primary PCI is thought to be an important strategy toward achieving better patient outcomes. Unfortunately, significant reduction of D2B delay in the USA over the last decade has not been shown to be associated with improved STEMI mortality. It has been suggested that the lack of impact could be due to the expanding use of primary PCI in STEMI as well as the survival cohort effect, leading to a shift toward a higher risk population receiving the procedure. Others have suggested that reduction in D2B delay may not be as impactful as expected, given that it only represents a small fraction of the total ischemic time. Although most existing evidence have pointed to the presence of a beneficial effect of shorter D2B delay, some inconsistencies however exist. This study aims to synthesize available evidence in order to answer the following questions: (1) what is the overall effect of D2B delay on clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI treated with primary PCI? (2) What factors explain the differences of the effect estimates among the studies? (3) What are the important strength and limitation of the existing body of evidence?\nWe will search PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry, CINAHL Database, and the Cochrane Library using a predefined search strategy. Other sources of literature will include proceedings from the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, the EUROPCR, and the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database. We will include data from observational studies (case-control and cohort study design) and randomized control trials (that have investigated the relationship of D2B time and clinical outcome(s) in an adult (older than 18) STEMI population). Mortality (cardiac related and all-cause) and incidence heart failure (HF) have been prioritized as the primary outcomes. All eligible studies will be assessed for risk of bias using the Risk Of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions tool. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework will be used to report the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. We will proceed to analyze the data quantitatively if the pre-specified conditions are satisfied.\nRecent discussion on the negative findings of improved D2B delay over time being unrelated to better STEMI outcomes at the population level has reminded us of an important knowledge gap we have on this domain. This systematic review will serve to address some of these key questions not previously examined. Answers to these questions could clarify the controversies and offer empirical support for or against the suggested hypotheses.\nPROSPERO CRD42015026069.", "journal": "Systematic reviews", "date": "2016-08-04", "authors": ["Chee YoongFoo", "Daniel DReidpath", "NathornChaiyakunapruk"], "doi": "10.1186/s13643-016-0304-7\n10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61237-4\n10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60692-4\n10.1002/ccd.24776\n10.1016/j.ahj.2010.10.001\n10.1056/NEJM199311253292211\n10.1056/NEJM199311253292204\n10.1016/j.ahj.2005.07.016\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.12.072\n10.1111/imj.12405\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.044107\n10.1001/archinternmed.2010.381\n10.1056/NEJMoa1208200\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61932-2\n10.1136/bmj.e3257\n10.1111/j.1742-1241.2009.02122.x\n10.1001/jama.2010.1139\n10.1016/S0002-9149(02)02320-2\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.03.111\n10.1016/j.ahj.2012.11.014\n10.1056/NEJM200101113440217\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs104\n10.1016/j.jclinepi.2005.08.017\n10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.04.026\n10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.08.010\n10.1177/0272989X13485157\n10.1136/bmj.d4002"}

Although accumulating data support that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) enhance the efficacy of cardiac cKit(+) cells (CSCs), the underlying mechanism for this synergistic effect remains incompletely understood.\nTo test the hypothesis that MSCs stimulate endogenous CSCs to proliferate, migrate, and differentiate via the SDF1/CXCR4 and stem cell factor/cKit pathways.\nUsing genetic lineage-tracing approaches, we show that in the postnatal murine heart, cKit(+) cells proliferate, migrate, and form cardiomyocytes, but not endothelial cells. CSCs exhibit marked chemotactic and proliferative responses when cocultured with MSCs but not with cardiac stromal cells. Antagonism of the CXCR4 pathway with AMD3100 (an SDF1/CXCR4 antagonist) inhibited MSC-induced CSC chemotaxis but stimulated CSC cardiomyogenesis (P<0.0001). Furthermore, MSCs enhanced CSC proliferation via the stem cell factor/cKit and SDF1/CXCR4 pathways (P<0.0001).\nTogether these findings show that MSCs exhibit profound, yet differential, effects on CSC migration, proliferation, and differentiation and suggest a mechanism underlying the improved cardiac regeneration associated with combination therapy using CSCs and MSCs.

{"title": "Polymer microfiber meshes facilitate cardiac differentiation of c-kit(+) human cardiac stem cells.", "abstract": "Electrospun microfiber meshes have been shown to support the proliferation and differentiation of many types of stem cells, but the phenotypic fate of c-kit(+) human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs) have not been explored. To this end, we utilized thin (~5\u00b5m) elastomeric meshes consisting of aligned 1.7\u00b5m diameter poly (ester-urethane urea) microfibers as substrates to examine their effect on hCSC viability, morphology, proliferation, and differentiation relative to cells cultured on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). The results showed that cells on microfiber meshes displayed an elongated morphology aligned in the direction of fiber orientation, lower proliferation rates, but increased expressions of genes and proteins majorly associated with cardiomyocyte phenotype. The early (NK2 homeobox 5, Nkx2.5) and late (cardiac troponin I, cTnI) cardiomyocyte genes were significantly increased on meshes (Nkx=2.5 56.2\u00b113.0, cTnl=2.9\u00b10.56,) over TCPS (Nkx2.5=4.2\u00b10.9, cTnl=1.6\u00b10.5, n=9, p<0.05 for both groups) after differentiation. In contrast, expressions of smooth muscle markers, Gata6 and myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), were decreased on meshes.

{"title": "In Vivo Cardioprotective Effects and Pharmacokinetic Profile of N-Propyl Caffeamide Against Ischemia Reperfusion Injury.", "abstract": "Caffeic acid derivatives constitute a class of potent anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective drug candidates. We recently synthesized a new caffeic acid derivative N-propyl caffeamide (PCA). Our pilot experiments demonstrated that PCA enhanced the survival of rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 cells against oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation challenge in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, PCA exhibited better cardioprotective potential than caffeic acid phenethyl ester and propyl caffeate. Thus, we hypothesized that PCA could protect heart against ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice. We first determined the stability and pharmacokinetic profile of PCA in male Sprague-Dawley rats by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV and MS/MS detections. The stability of PCA in rat plasma was defined by the half-life of 31.39, 7.19 and 1.37\u00a0h in rat plasma at 25, 37 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. To study the pharmacokinetic profiles, PCA was injected into male SD rats at the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg via intravenous bolus administration. PCA showed the elimination half-life of approximate 235\u00a0min in rats. We subsequently evaluated the cardioprotective potential of PCA in mice model of myocardial infarction. Our results demonstrated that PCA effectively reduced infarct size and release of myocardial enzymes (e.g., CK, CK-MB and LDH). Biochemical analyses suggested that PCA increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., CAT and SOD) while attenuated lipid peroxidation. Moreover, PCA profoundly reduced the number of apoptotic cells in infarcted myocardium. Consistently, PCA increased the expression level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 whereas suppressed the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in cardiac tissues.

The presence of nitric oxide and cytokines in cardiac tissue constitute the molecular markers and the intracellular messengers of inflammatory conditions in the heart due to the onset of sepsis and endotoxemia, derived from the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway activation and proinflammatory gene transcription. Sepsis occurs with an exacerbated inflammatory response that damages tissue mitochondria and impaired bioenergetic processes. The heart consumes 20-30 times its own weight in adenosine triphosphate every day, and 90% of this molecule is derived from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Cardiac energy management is comprised in sepsis and endotoxemia; both a deficit in energy production and alterations in the source of energy substrates are believed to be involved in impaired cardiac function. Although several hypotheses try to explain the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex condition of sepsis and endotoxemia, the current view is that these syndromes are the result of an intricate balance between prevailing levels of mitochondrial stress, biogenesis/autophagy signaling and mitochondria quality control processes, rather on a single factor.

VMC mouse model was established via intraperitoneal injection of CVB3 in transgenic and wild mouse respectively. Myocardial injury was assayed histologically (HE staining and pathology grading) and serologically (myocardial damage markers of CK-MB and cTnI). CVB3 replication was observed in vivo and in vitro via the capsid protein VP1 detection or virus titration. Inflammation/fibrotic factors of MPO, perforin, IFN\u03b3, IL17, Smad3 and MMP2 were evaluated using western blot or immunohistology stain. Role of calpain in regulating fibroblast migration was studied in scratch assays.\nCalpastatin overexpression ameliorated myocardial injury induced by CVB3 infection significantly in transgenic mouse indicated by reduced peripheral CK-MB and cTnI levels and improved histology injury. Comparing with CVB3-infected wild type mouse, the transgenic mouse heart tissue carried lower virus load. The inflammation factors of MPO, perforin, IFN\u03b3 and IL17 were down-regulated accompanied with fibrotic agents of Smad3 and MMP2 inhibition. And calpain participated in the migration of fibroblasts in vitro, which further proves its role in regulating fibrosis.\nCalpain plays dual roles of facilitating CVB3 replication and inflammation promotion. Calpain inhibition in CVB3-induced myocarditis showed significant treatment effect. Calpain might be a novel target for VMC treatment in clinical practices.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2016-07-30", "authors": ["MinghuiLi", "YangangSu", "YongYu", "YingYu", "XinggangWang", "YunzengZou", "JunboGe", "RuizhenChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.07.121"}

PCDHGA3 Implications in Decreased Stroke Volume and Ventricular Dysfunction.", "abstract": "Intercalated disks are unique structures in cardiac tissue, in which adherens junctions, desmosomes, and GAP junctions co-localize, thereby facilitating cardiac muscle contraction and function. Protocadherins are involved in these junctions; however, their role in heart physiology is poorly understood. We aimed to analyze the transcriptomic profile of adhesion molecules in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and relate the changes uncovered with the hemodynamic alterations and functional depression observed in these patients.\nTwenty-three left ventricular tissue samples from patients diagnosed with ICM (n = 13) undergoing heart transplantation and control donors (CNT, n = 10) were analyzed using RNA sequencing. Forty-two cell adhesion genes involved in cellular junctions were differentially expressed in ICM myocardium. Notably, the levels of protocadherin PCDHGA3 were related with the stroke volume (r = -0.826, P = 0.003), ejection fraction (r = -0.793, P = 0.004) and left ventricular end systolic and diastolic diameters (r = 0.867, P = 0.001; r = 0.781, P = 0.005, respectively).\nOur results support the importance of intercalated disks molecular alterations, closely involved in the contractile function, highlighting its crucial significance and showing gene expression changes not previously described. Specifically, altered PCDHGA3 gene expression was strongly associated with reduced stroke volume and ventricular dysfunction in ICM, suggesting a relevant role in hemodynamic perturbations and cardiac performance for this unexplored protocadherin.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-07-30", "authors": ["AnaOrtega", "CarolinaGil-Cayuela", "Estefan\u00edaTaraz\u00f3n", "Mar\u00edaGarc\u00eda-Manzanares", "Jos\u00e9 AnastasioMontero", "JuanCinca", "ManuelPortol\u00e9s", "MiguelRivera", "EstherRosell\u00f3-Llet\u00ed"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0160168\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000152\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs104\n10.1111/jcmm.12477\n10.1371/journal.pone.0145518\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.03.192\n10.1093/cvr/cvr182\n10.1007/s00018-013-1374-5\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.937805\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.229054\n10.1016/j.schres.2008.04.013\n10.1113/jphysiol.2008.167718\n10.1038/nbt.1621\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btu638\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616\n10.1093/nar/gkp427\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu509\n10.1016/j.carpath.2013.04.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0100560\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2015.07.037\n10.1016/j.bpj.2014.12.001\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2012.11.018\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.182147\n10.1007/s00424-009-0718-3\n10.1073/pnas.0909432107\n10.1093/hmg/ddt508\n10.3109/15419061.2014.908853\n10.1093/neuonc/nor070\n10.1074/jbc.M109.092031\n10.1152/ajplung.00346.2014\n10.1016/j.yexmp.2015.12.009\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.07.012"}

Many studies have shown that miRNAs have important roles in congenital heart diseases (CHDs) by regulating gene expression and signaling pathways. We previously found that miR-30c was highly expressed in the heart tissues of aborted embryos with ventricular septal defects. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of miR-30c in CHDs. miR-30c was overexpressed or knocked down in P19 cells, a myocardial cell model that is widely used to study cardiogenesis. We found that miR-30c overexpression not only increased cell proliferation by promoting cell entry into S phase but also suppressed cell apoptosis. In addition, we found that miR-30c inhibited dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of P19 cells. miR-30c knockdown, in contrast, inhibited cell proliferation and increased apoptosis and differentiation. The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is essential for normal embryonic development. Western blotting and luciferase assays revealed that Gli2, a transcriptional factor that has essential roles in the Shh signaling pathway, was a potential target gene of miR-30c. Ptch1, another important player in the Shh signaling pathway and a transcriptional target of Gli2, was downregulated by miR-30c overexpression and upregulated by miR-30c knockdown. Collectively, our study revealed that miR-30c suppressed P19 cell differentiation by inhibiting the Shh signaling pathway and altered the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, which may result in embryonic cardiac malfunctions.", "journal": "Experimental & molecular medicine", "date": "2016-07-30", "authors": ["XuehuaLiu", "MengmengLi", "YuzhuPeng", "XiaoshanHu", "JingXu", "ShashaZhu", "ZhangbinYu", "ShupingHan"], "doi": "10.1038/emm.2016.57"}

Transgenic mice carrying an activating point mutation (TgD814Y) in the kinase domain of the c-Kit gene were generated. c-Kit(TgD814Y) receptor was expressed in the heart during embryonic development and postnatal life, in a similar timing and expression pattern to that of the endogenous gene, but not in the hematopoietic compartment allowing the study of a cardiac-specific phenotype. c-Kit(TgD814Y) mutation produced a constitutive active c-Kit receptor in cardiac tissue and cells from transgenic mice as demonstrated by the increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT, which are the main downstream molecular effectors of c-Kit receptor signaling. In adult transgenic hearts, cardiac morphology, size and total c-Kit(+) cardiac cell number was not different compared with wt mice. However, when c-Kit(TgD814Y) mice were subjected to transmural necrotic heart damage by cryoinjury (CI), all transgenic survived, compared with half of wt mice. In the sub-acute phase after CI, transgenic and wt mice showed similar heart damage. However, 9 days after CI, transgenic mice exhibited an increased number of c-Kit(+)CD31(+) endothelial progenitor cells surrounding the necrotic area. At later follow-up, a consistent reduction of fibrotic area, increased capillary density and increased cardiomyocyte replenishment rate (as established by BrdU incorporation) were observed in transgenic compared with wt mice. Consistently, CD45(-)c-Kit(+) cardiac stem cells isolated from transgenic c-Kit(TgD814Y) mice showed an enhanced endothelial and cardiomyocyte differentiation potential compared with cells isolated from the wt.

They are not adaptable for pathological tissues commonly associated with tissue microstructure alterations. To investigate cardiac tissue mechanics, a novel approach is proposed to model hyperelasticity and anisotropy. This approach is adaptable to various tissue microstructural constituent's distributions in normal and pathological tissues. In this approach, the tissue is idealized as composite material consisting of cardiomyocytes distributed in extracellular matrix (ECM). The major myocardial tissue constituents are mitochondria and myofibrils while the main ECM's constituents are collagen fibers and fibroblasts. Accordingly, finite element simulations of uniaxial and equibiaxial tests of normal and infarcted tissue samples with known amounts of these constituents were conducted, leading to corresponding tissue stress-strain data that were fitted to anisotropic/hyperelastic models. The models were validated where they showed good agreement characterized by maximum average stress-strain errors of 16.17 and 10.01% for normal and infarcted cardiac tissue, respectively.

This hypothesis is contentious.\nWe reviewed the primary literature and patent landscape of PHX from its initial development in the 1960s through to its emergence as a drug beneficial for HF. We focused on its physico-chemistry, molecular targets, tissue accumulation and clinical dosing.\nDogma that the beneficial effects of PHX are due primarily to potent myocardial CPT-1 inhibition is not supported by the literature and all available evidence point to it being extremely unlikely that the major effects of PHX occur via this mechanism. In vivo PHX is much more likely to be an inhibitor of surface membrane ion channels and also to have effects on other components of cellular metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation across the cardiovascular system.

Substantial variations in action potential waveform-such as decreased action potential duration (APD) and plateau height-were found when hCMs were coupled to the two hMSC models expressing functional delayed rectifier-like human ether \u00e0-go-go K+ channel 1 (hEAG1); the effects were exacerbated for fused hMSC-hCM hybrid cells. The third family of hMSCs (Type C), absent of hEAG1 activity, led to smaller single-cell action potential alterations during coupling and fusion, translating to longer tissue-level mean action potential wavelength. In a simulated 2-D monolayer of cardiac tissue, re-entry vulnerability with low (5%) hMSC insertion was approximately eight-fold lower with Type C hMSCs compared to hEAG1-functional hMSCs. A 20% decrease in APD dispersion by Type C hMSCs compared to hEAG1-active hMSCs supports the claim of reduced arrhythmogenic potential of this cell type with low hMSC insertion. However, at moderate (15%) and high (25%) hMSC insertion, the vulnerable window increased independent of hMSC type. In summary, this study provides novel electrophysiological models of hMSCs, predicts possible arrhythmogenic effects of hMSCs when directly coupled to healthy hCMs, and proposes that isolating a subset of hMSCs absent of hEAG1 activity may offer increased safety as a cell delivery cardiotherapy at low levels of hMSC-hCM coupling.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["JoshuaMayourian", "Ruben MSavizky", "Eric ASobie", "Kevin DCosta"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005014\n10.2217/rme.12.80\n10.1161/01.cir.0000441139.02102.80\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303180\n10.1093/ejechocard/jep191\n10.1001/jama.2013.282909\n10.1007/s12015-012-9375-6\n10.1038/nature06800\n10.1016/j.ccep.2015.03.012\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00419\n10.1038/srep12043\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.02.005\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.07.055\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.07.016\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2003.03124.x\n10.1113/jphysiol.2003.058719\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.593038\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.07.036\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303614\n10.1152/ajpheart.00794.2003\n10.1088/0031-9155/51/23/014\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002061\n10.1529/biophysj.106.101410\n10.1007/s10439-007-9405-8\n10.1152/ajpheart.01298.2007\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.08.003\n10.1634/stemcells.2004-0213\n10.1113/jphysiol.2003.055806\n10.4252/wjsc.v3.i3.19\n10.1016/S0143-4160(03)00069-1\n10.1371/journal.pone.0090024\n10.1038/nature04710\n10.1073/pnas.0636603100\n10.1017/S0033583506004227\n10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764\n10.1098/rsta.2008.0283\n10.1161/01.RES.82.1.63\n10.1113/jphysiol.1977.sp011853\n10.1371/journal.pone.0103273\n10.1109/TBME.2012.2188291\n10.1161/01.CIR.102.14.1664\n10.1016/j.bpj.2008.10.056\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000914\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003543\n10.1186/1475-925X-4-11\n10.1161/01.RES.84.11.1318\n10.1063/1.1503941\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.208101\n10.1161/CIRCEP.111.000215\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.03.008\n10.1152/ajpheart.00533.2012\n10.1369/jhc.2008.952507\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0198\n10.1161/01.CIR.67.6.1356\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)02008-9\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2003.09.001\n10.1161/01.RES.24.3.409\n10.1016/0079-6107(73)90008-4\n10.1093/cvr/11.3.210\n10.1111/j.1748-1716.1979.tb06419.x\n10.1016/S0022-2828(86)80291-7\n10.1002/(SICI)1098-1136(200003)30:1%3C39::AID-GLIA5%3E3.0.CO;2-S\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.02.041\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.058101\n10.1161/01.RES.0000031957.70034.89\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.153858\n10.1103/PhysRevE.68.062902\n10.1046/j.1540-8167.2005.30490.x\n10.1111/j.1432-2277.2008.00742.x\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2010.07.025\n10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0036\n10.1152/ajpheart.00747.2003\n10.1161/01.RES.0000125629.72053.95\n10.1016/S0022-0736(99)90077-8\n10.1196/annals.1380.029"}

{"title": "Therapeutic potential of adipose stem cell-derived conditioned medium against pulmonary hypertension and lung fibrosis.", "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF) are life threatening cardiopulmonary diseases. Existing pharmacological interventions have failed to improve clinical outcomes or reduce disease-associated mortality. Emerging evidence suggests that stem cells offer an effective treatment approach against various pathological conditions. It has been proposed that their beneficial actions may be mediated via secretion of paracrine factors. Herein, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of conditioned media (CM) from adipose stem cells (ASCs) against experimental models of PH and PF.\nMonocrotaline (MCT) or bleomycin (Bleo) was injected into male Sprague-Dawley rats to induce PH or PF respectively. A subset of MCT and Bleo animals were treated with ASCs or CM. Echocardiographic and haemodynamic measurements were performed at the end of the study. Lung and heart tissues were harvested for RNA, protein and histological measurements.\nCM treatment attenuated MCT-induced PH by improving pulmonary blood flow and inhibiting cardiac remodelling. Further, histological studies revealed that right ventricular fibrosis, pulmonary vessel wall thickness and pericyte distribution were significantly decreased by CM administration. Likewise, CM therapy arrested the progression of PF in the Bleo model by reducing collagen deposition. Elevated expression of markers associated with tissue remodelling and inflammation were significantly reduced in both PF and PH lungs. Similar results were obtained with ASCs administration.\nOur study indicates that CM treatment is as effective as ASCs in treating PH and PF. These beneficial effects of CM may provide an innovative approach to treat cardiopulmonary disorders.", "journal": "British journal of pharmacology", "date": "2016-07-23", "authors": ["AnandharajanRathinasabapathy", "ErinBruce", "AndrewEspejo", "AlanaHorowitz", "Dhivya RSudhan", "AnandNair", "DominicGuzzo", "JosephFrancis", "Mohan KRaizada", "VinayakShenoy", "Michael JKatovich"], "doi": "10.1111/bph.13562\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00556\n10.1155/2013/383685\n10.1186/scrt109"}
{"title": "Prevalence and first molecular identification of Sarcocystis species in cattle and water buffaloes in India.", "abstract": "The importance of Sarcocystis hominis in causing zoonotic infections is well known. Recently, S. hominis like cysts have been reported from water buffalo in China. Previous studies indicate prevalence of Sarcocystis species in bovine populations in India but molecular evidence is required for proper species differentiation. We examined two hundred and ninety six cardiac tissue samples of Indian water buffaloes and cattle from northern and western parts of the country. Tissues were examined for Sarcocystis using intact cyst isolation method, pepsin acid digestion method and Sarcocystis 18S rRNA PCR. The combination of primers was used for 18S rRNA PCR amplification followed by sequencing. Twenty five representative samples were sent for sequencing and 19 readable sequences were obtained for phylogenetic analysis. Overall, the Sarcocystis cysts/zoites were recorded in 44% (95% CI 38-49%), 58% (95% CI 53-64%) and 68% (95% CI 63-73%) from both cattle and buffalo samples using intact cyst isolation, pepsin-HCl digestion method and conventional PCR, respectively. The results indicate that pepsin-HCl digestion method and conventional PCR are more sensitive than intact cyst isolation for detection of Sarcocystis species in tissue samples. The prevalence of Sarcocystis species was high in buffalo as compared to cattle intermediate hosts. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that more than one Sarcocystis species are circulating in cattle and water buffaloes in India. The results further indicate that experimental transmission studies are required to re-confirm the identities and host ranges of the Sarcocystis species in cattle and water buffaloes in India.", "journal": "Acta parasitologica", "date": "2016-07-23", "authors": ["MonalDaptardar", "Balbir BagichaSingh", "Rabinder SinghAulakh", "Jatinder Paul SinghGill"], "doi": "10.1515/ap-2016-0069"}

This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of testosterone and voluntary exercise on vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), stromal cell-derived factor 1a (SDF-1a) and myocardial capillary density in heart of rats with diabetes.\nType 1 diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 55\u2009mg/kg of streptozotocin in 80 male Wistar rats. After 42 days of treatment with testosterone (2\u2009mg/kg/day) or voluntary exercise alone or in combination, angiogenesis was determined in the hearts by immunostaining for PECAM-1/CD31. The expressions of VEGF-A and SDF-1a levels in heart were also determined by the ELISA method.\nOur results showed that capillary density, VEGF-A and SDF-1a levels in the heart were significantly decreased in castrated rats with diabetes, whereas these effects were reversed by testosterone and exercise. Furthermore, simultaneous treatment of castrated rats with diabetes with testosterone and exercise had a synergistic effect on capillary density, VEGF-A and SDF-1a levels in the heart. In the group with diabetes, either testosterone or exercise increased capillary density, VEGF-A and SDF-1a protein levels in heart tissue. However, the effects of combination therapy in rats with diabetes with testosterone and exercise on capillary density, VEGF-A and SDF-1a levels in the heart was synergistic.\nOur findings suggest that testosterone and exercise can promote neoangiogenesis in rats with diabetes and in castrated rats with diabetes.

The current study investigated the susceptibility of cardiac damage responding to isoproterenol (ISO) in adult offspring that underwent maternal inflammation (modeled by pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) challenge). We found that 2 weeks of ISO treatment in adult offspring of LPS-treated mothers led to augmented heart damage, characterized by left-ventricular systolic dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Mechanistically, prenatal exposure to LPS led to up-regulated expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases, antioxidant enzymes, and p38 MAPK activity in left ventricular of adult offspring at resting state. ISO treatment exaggerated ROS generation, p38 MAPK activation but down-regulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination capacity in the left ventricular of offspring from LPS-treated mothers, while antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) reversed these changes together with improved cardiac functions. The p38 inhibitor SB202190 alleviated the heart damage only via inhibiting the expression of NADPH oxidases. Collectively, our data demonstrated that prenatal inflammation programs pre-existed ROS activation in the heart tissue, which switches on the early process of oxidative damages on heart rapidly through a ROS-p38 MAPK-NADPH oxidase-ROS positive feedback loop in response to a myocardial hypertrophic challenge in adulthood.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-07-23", "authors": ["QiZhang", "YafeiDeng", "WenjingLai", "XiaoGuan", "XiongshanSun", "QiHan", "FangjieWang", "XiaodongPan", "YanJi", "HongqinLuo", "PeiHuang", "YuanTang", "LiangqiGu", "GuorongDan", "JianhuaYu", "MichaelNamaka", "JianxiangZhang", "YoucaiDeng", "XiaohuiLi"], "doi": "10.1038/srep30146"}

For this purpose, the present study is aimed to research the effects of aging on AQP 1 and AQP 4 in heart tissue.\nIn this study, 14 Balb/C type white mice were used. Animals were divided into two equal groups. Group I consisted of 2-month-old young animals (n=7), and group II consisted of 18-month-old animals (n=7). To determine the AQP1 and AQP4 expression in the myocardium, the heart tissue was removed to perform western blotting and immunohistochemical and histopathological evaluations.\nMuscle fibers of the heart in aged animals were more irregular and loosely organized in hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) stained sections. Hscore analysis revealed that AQP1 and AQP4 immunoreactivity significantly increased in heart tissues of old mice compared with those of young mice (p<0.001). In addition, AQP1 and AQP4 protein expressions in the tissues of old animals were increased significantly according to western blot analysis (p=0.018 and p<0.001 for AQP1 and AQP4, respectively).\nIncreased AQP1 and AQP4 levels in the heart tissue may be correlated with the maintenance of water and electrolytes balance, which decreases with aging. In this context, it might be the result of a compensatory response to decreased AQP4 functions.

{"title": "Inhibition of the Unfolded Protein Response Mechanism Prevents Cardiac Fibrosis.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis attributed to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins is a major cause of heart failure and death. Cardiac fibrosis is extremely difficult and challenging to treat in a clinical setting due to lack of understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to cardiac fibrosis and effective anti-fibrotic therapies. The objective in this study was to examine whether unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway mediates cardiac fibrosis and whether a pharmacological intervention to modulate UPR can prevent cardiac fibrosis and preserve heart function.\nWe demonstrate here that the mechanism leading to development of fibrosis in a mouse with increased expression of calreticulin, a model of heart failure, stems from impairment of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, transient activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and stimulation of the TGF\u03b21/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Remarkably, sustained pharmacologic inhibition of the UPR pathway by tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is sufficient to prevent cardiac fibrosis, and improved exercise tolerance.\nWe show that the mechanism leading to development of fibrosis in a mouse model of heart failure stems from transient activation of UPR pathway leading to persistent remodelling of cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Evaluation of oxidative stress markers in the heart and liver of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss walbaum) exposed to the formalin.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine change in lipid and protein oxidation biomarkers, transamination enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase activities, lactate and pyruvate levels in liver and heart tissue of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) that was exposed to formalin baths. Increase of 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and carbonyl derivatives of protein oxidative destruction was noticed only in cardiac tissue of formalin-exposed fish. Activity of lactate dehydrogenase and lactate level in the cardiac tissue were elevated, indicating active glycolysis. Effects of formalin disinfection were different in both tissues. Aldehydic and ketonic derivatives of oxidatively modified proteins in liver were consistently reduced upon exposure to the formalin.

The in vitro generation of three-dimensional myocardial tissue constructs using biomaterials as an implantable hiPSC-derived myocardium provides a path to realize sustainable myocardial regeneration. We generated engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) from three cellular compositions of cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial cells (ECs), and vascular mural cells (MCs) differentiated from hiPSCs. We then determined the impact of cell composition on ECT structural and functional properties. In vitro force measurement showed that CM+EC+MC ECTs possessed preferential electromechanical properties versus ECTs without vascular cells indicating that incorporation of vascular cells augmented tissue maturation and function. The inclusion of MCs facilitated more mature CM sarcomeric structure, preferential alignment, and activated multiple tissue maturation pathways. The CM+EC+MC ECTs implanted onto infarcted, immune tolerant rat hearts engrafted, displayed both host and graft-derived vasculature, and ameliorated myocardial dysfunction. Thus, a composition of CMs and multiple vascular lineages derived from hiPSCs and incorporated into ECTs promotes functional maturation and demonstrates myocardial replacement and perfusion relevant for clinical translation.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-07-21", "authors": ["HidetoshiMasumoto", "TakeichiroNakane", "Joseph PTinney", "FangpingYuan", "FeiYe", "William JKowalski", "KenjiMinakata", "RyuzoSakata", "Jun KYamashita", "Bradley BKeller"], "doi": "10.1038/srep29933"}

Additionally, compared to c-kit(+)AT2R(-) and unfractionated BMMNCs, intravenous transplantation of c-kit(+)AT2R(+) BMMNC resulted in smaller infarct size and lower levels of inflammatory reactions in heart tissue, leading to a higher global heart function improvement.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the potential of fetal (E18) and adult myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) to support cardiac cells. Acellular three-dimensional (3D) bioscaffolds were obtained by parallel decellularization of fetal- and adult-heart explants thereby ensuring reliable comparison. Acellular scaffolds retained main constituents of the cardiac ECM including distinctive biochemical and structural meshwork features of the native equivalents. In\u00a0vitro, fetal and adult ECM-matrices supported 3D culture of heart-derived Sca-1(+) progenitors and of neonatal cardiomyocytes, which migrated toward the center of the scaffold and displayed elongated morphology and excellent viability. At the culture end-point, more Sca-1(+) cells and cardiomyocytes were found adhered and inside fetal bioscaffolds, compared to the adult. Higher repopulation yields of Sca-1(+) cells on fetal ECM relied on \u03b21-integrin independent mitogenic signals. Sca-1(+) cells on fetal bioscaffolds showed a gene expression profile that anticipates the synthesis of a permissive microenvironment for cardiomyogenesis.

{"title": "GsMTx4-D is a cardioprotectant against myocardial infarction during ischemia and reperfusion.", "abstract": "GsMTx4 is a selective inhibitor of cationic mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) and has helped establish the role of MSCs in cardiac physiology. Inhomogeneous local mechanical stresses due to hypercontracture and swelling during ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI) likely induce elevated MSC activity that can contribute to cation imbalance. The aim of this study was to determine if the D enantiomer of GsMTx4 can act as a cardioprotectant in a mouse IRI model. Ischemia and reperfusion involved ligating a coronary artery followed by release of the ligature. GsMTx4-D was tested by either acute intravenous injection during the ischemic event or by two day pretreatment by intraperitoneal injection, both methods achieving similar results. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, GsMTx4-D dosage was set to achieve expected plasma concentrations between 50 and 5000nM and heart tissue concentrations between 1 and 200nM by intravenous injection. Relative to vehicle injected animals, GsMTx4-D reduced infarct area by ~40% for acute and pretreated animals for both 20 and 45min ischemic challenges. Many indicators of cardiac output were indistinguishable from sham-treated control hearts after GsMTx4-D treatment showing improvement at both 4 and 48h post ischemia, and premature ventricular beats immediately following reperfusion were also significantly reduced. To determine if GsMTx4-D cardioprotection could act directly at the level of cardiomyocytes, we tested its effects in vitro on indicators of IRI damage like cation influx and activation of inflammatory kinases in isolated myocytes cultured under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia challenged cardiomyocytes treated with 10\u03bcM GsMTx4-D showed improved contractility and near normal contraction-related Ca(2+) influx. GsMTx4-D inhibited indicators of ischemic damage such as the apoptotic signaling system JNK/c-Jun, but also inhibited the energy response signaling system Akt kinase. We conclude that GsMTx4-D is a potent cardioprotectant in vivo that may act directly on cardiomyocytes and potentially be useful in multidrug strategies to treat IRI.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2016-07-18", "authors": ["JinliWang", "YinaMa", "FrederickSachs", "JiLi", "Thomas MSuchyna"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.07.005"}

Here, to improve our understanding of the diverse roles miRs play in cardiovascular function and disease, we applied high-throughput methods to globally profile miR:target interactions in human heart tissues. We deciphered Ago2:RNA interactions using crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HITS-CLIP) to generate the first transcriptome-wide map of miR targeting events in human myocardium, detecting 4000 cardiac Ago2 binding sites across >2200 target transcripts. Our initial exploration of this interactome revealed an abundance of miR target sites in gene coding regions, including several sites pointing to new miR-29 functions in regulating cardiomyocyte calcium, growth and metabolism. Also, we uncovered several clinically-relevant interactions involving common genetic variants that alter miR targeting events in cardiomyopathy-associated genes.

Although the functional roles of AMPK and Akt are well established, the significance of cross talk between them in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and antihypertrophy of CYP2J2 and EETs remains unclear. We investigated whether CYP2J2 and its metabolites EETs protected against cardiac hypertrophy by activating AMPK\u03b12 and Akt1. Moreover, we tested whether EETs enhanced cross talk between AMPK\u03b12 and phosphorylated Akt1 (p-Akt1), and stimulated nuclear translocation of p-Akt1, to exert their antihypertrophic effects. AMPK\u03b12(-/-) mice that overexpressed CYP2J2 in heart were treated with Ang II for 2\u00a0weeks. Interestingly, overexpression of CYP2J2 suppressed cardiac hypertrophy and increased levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the heart tissue and plasma of wild-type mice but not AMPK\u03b12(-/-) mice. The CYP2J2 metabolites, 11,12-EET, activated AMPK\u03b12 to induce nuclear translocation of p-Akt1 selectively, which increased the production of ANP and therefore inhibited the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, by co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we found that AMPK\u03b12\u03b22\u03b31 and p-Akt1 interact through the direct binding of the AMPK\u03b31 subunit to the Akt1 protein kinase domain.

During reverse electron transfer (RET) from NADH, purified Ogdh generated ~3-3.5\u00d7 more O2(\u00b7-)/H2O2 in comparison to Pdh when metabolizing 0.5-10\u00b5M NADH. Under forward electron transfer (FET) conditions Ogdh generated ~2-4\u00d7 more O2(\u00b7-)/H2O2 than Pdh. In both liver and cardiac mitochondria, Ogdh displayed significantly higher rates of ROS formation when compared to Pdh. Ogdh was also a significant source of ROS in liver mitochondria metabolizing 50\u00b5M and 500\u00b5M pyruvate or succinate. Finally, we also observed that DTT directly stimulated O2(\u00b7-)/H2O2 formation by purified Pdh and Ogdh and in cardiac or liver mitochondria in the absence of substrates and cofactors. Taken together, Ogdh is a more potent source of ROS than Pdh in liver and cardiac tissue. Ogdh is also an important ROS generator regardless of whether pyruvate or succinate serve as the sole source of carbon. Our observations provide insight into the ROS generating capacity of either complex in cardiac and liver tissue. The evidence presented herein also indicates DTT, a reductant that is routinely added to biological samples, should be avoided when assessing mitochondrial O2(\u00b7-)/H2O2 production.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2016-07-11", "authors": ["Ryan JMailloux", "DanielleGardiner", "MarisaO'Brien"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.06.014"}

However, data comparing differential effects of various body sites visceral adiposity on atrial and ventricular electrocardiographic alterations remains largely unknown.\nWe assessed both peri-cardial fat (PCF) and peri-aortic visceral adiposity (TAT) using dedicated computed tomography (CT) software (Aquarius 3D Workstation, TeraRecon, San Mateo, CA, USA), with anthropometrics including body mass index (BMI) and biochemical data obtained. We further related PCF and TAT data to standardized 12-leads electrocardiogram (ECG), including P and QRS wave morphologies. Among 3,087 study subjects (mean age, 49.6 years; 28% women), we observed a linear association among greater visceral adiposity burden, leftward deviation of P and QRS axes, longer PR interval and widened QRS duration (all p<0.001). These associations became attenuated after accounting for BMI and baseline clinical co-variates, with greater PCF remained independently associated with prolonged QRS duration (\u03b2 = 0.91 [95% CI: 0.52, 1.31] per 1-SD increase in PCF, p<0.001). Finally, both PCF and TAT showed incremental value in identifying abnormally high PR interval (>200ms, likelihood-ratio: 33.17 to 41.4 & 39.03 for PCF and TAT) and widened QRS duration (>100ms, likelihood-ratio: 55.67 to 65.4 & 61.94 for PCF and TAT, all X2 p<0.05) when superimposed on age and BMI.\nWe show in our data greater visceral fat burden may have differential associations on several body surface electrocardiographic parameters.

Irregular dynamics at the cellular level can lead to instabilities in cardiac tissue, including alternans, a beat-to-beat alternation in the action potential and/or the intracellular Ca transient. In this study, we incorporate a detailed single cell coupled map model of Ca cycling and bidirectional APD-Ca coupling into a spatially extended tissue model to investigate the influence of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca uptake and release properties on alternans and conduction block. We find that an intermediate SR Ca uptake rate and larger SR Ca release resulted in the widest range of stimulus periods that promoted alternans.

We report that heterogeneity and the area of waveblock can extend itself in space and can result formation of new additional sources, or termination of existing sources of arrhythmias. This effect is based on a new form of instability, which we coin as global alternans instability (GAI). GAI is closely related to the so-called (discordant) alternans instability, however its onset is determined by the global properties of the APD-restitution curve and not by its slope. The APD-restitution curve relates the duration of the cardiac pulse (APD) to the time interval between the pulses, and can easily be measured in an experimental or even clinical setting. We formulate the conditions for the onset of GAI, study its manifestation in various 1D and 2D situations and discuss its importance for the onset of cardiac arrhythmias.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-07-08", "authors": ["NeleVandersickel", "ArneDefauw", "PeterDawyndt", "Alexander VPanfilov"], "doi": "10.1038/srep29397"}

{"title": "Exercise, Nrf2 and Antioxidant Signaling in Cardiac Aging.", "abstract": "Aging is represented by a progressive decline in cellular functions. The age-related deformities in cardiac behaviors are the loss of cardiac myocytes through apoptosis or programmed cell death. Oxidative stress (OS) and its deleterious consequence contribute to age-related mechanical remodeling, reduced regenerative capacity, and apoptosis in cardiac tissue. The pathogenesis of OS in the elderly can predispose the heart to other cardiac complications such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cardiac myopathy, and so on. At the molecular level, oxidant-induced activation of Nrf2 (Nuclear erythroid-2-p45-related factor-2), a transcription factor, regulates several genes containing AREs (Antioxidant Response Element) and bring the respective translates to counteract the reactive radicals and establish homeostasis. Myriad of Nrf2 gene knockout studies in various organs such as lung, liver, kidney, brain, etc. have shown that dysregulation of Nrf2 severely affects the oxidant/ROS sensitivity and predispose the system to several pathological changes with aberrant cellular lesions. On the other hand, its gain of function chemical interventions exhibited oxidant stress resistance and cytoprotection. However, thus far, only a few investigations have shown the potential role of Nrf2 and its non-pharmacological induction in cardiac aging. Therefore, here we review the involvement of Nrf2 signaling along with its responses and ramifications on the cascade of OS under acute exercise stress (AES), moderate exercise training (MET), and endurance exercise stress (EES) conditions in the aging heart.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2016-07-06", "authors": ["MadhusudhananNarasimhan", "Namakkal SRajasekaran"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2016.00241\n10.1016/j.apmr.2004.03.010\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.9.1173\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.6.553\n10.1155/2011/540458\n10.2165/00007256-200737060-00005\n10.1249/JSR.0b013e31825e19cd\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.255216\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.153692\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.188771\n10.1097/00005768-199911000-00016\n10.1186/1476-5918-8-1\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.545459\n10.1371/annotation/8690bb36-3c5d-48a6-b3be-39a2b50896e1\n10.1074/jbc.M000737200\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2007.05.008\n10.1073/pnas.78.11.7124\n10.1007/s004419900156\n10.1093/gerona/61.8.851\n10.1001/archinternmed.2009.312\n10.1037/0882-7974.12.2.225\n10.1139/h04-008\n10.1016/j.jshs.2014.02.001\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3007\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr397\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.189480\n10.1038/271\n10.1046/j.1365-201X.1997.00198.x\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000157\n10.1128/MCB.00481-12\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.10.440\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000048890.59383.8D\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.02.023\n10.1152/ajpregu.00208.2003\n10.1016/j.mrrev.2007.11.006\n10.1152/physiol.00052.2010\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000055013.92097.40\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.10.022\n10.1089/ars.2011.4498\n10.1155/2014/761264\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31823ac046\n10.1073/pnas.1019581108\n10.1016/j.hfc.2011.08.011\n10.1161/01.CIR.89.4.1648\n10.2337/db10-1164\n10.1139/H07-125\n10.1152/ajpheart.01134.2010\n10.2174/157015909787602823\n10.1093/gerona/glr229\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.04.012\n10.1007/s12017-008-8028-z\n10.1186/s12967-015-0578-x\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.200610.043\n10.1111/j.1748-1716.2010.02127.x\n10.1155/2014/615312\n10.3892/or.2013.2278\n10.1155/2014/260429"}

This study investigated the hypothesis that inhibiting soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), responsible for converting epoxyeicosatrienoic acids to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids protects mitochondrial from injury caused by myocardial infarction.\nsEH null and WT littermate mice were subjected to surgical occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery or sham operation. A parallel group of WT mice received an sEH inhibitor, trans-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-y1-ureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (tAUCB; 10 mg/L) or vehicle in the drinking water 4 days prior and 7 days post-MI. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography prior- and 7-days post-surgery. Heart tissues were dissected into infarct, peri-, and non-infarct regions to assess ultrastructure by electron microscopy. Complexes I, II, IV, citrate synthase, PI3K activities, and mitochondrial respiration were assessed in non-infarct regions. Isolated working hearts were used to measure the rates of glucose and palmitate oxidation.\nEchocardiography revealed that tAUCB treatment or sEH deficiency significantly improved systolic and diastolic function post-MI compared to controls. Reduced infarct expansion and less adverse cardiac remodeling were observed in tAUCB-treated and sEH null groups. EM data demonstrated mitochondrial ultrastructure damage occurred in infarct and peri-infarct regions but not in non-infarct regions.

Methods The melanoma models of the BALB/c mice were established by subcutaneously injecting B16 melanoma cells. These mice were randomly divided into four groups. The treated groups received pulsed electric stimulation at pulse width of 1, 3, 5 ms, with field strength of 100 V/cm and frequency of 10 Hz for 10 minutes daily in 15 consecutive days. ECG of mice was recorded. Tumor volume was measured with vernier caliper. Morphological changes of tumors were observed by HE staining. The expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) mRNA was tested by real-time quantitative PCR, and the expression of PCNA protein was detected by immunofluorescence histochemistry. The ultrastructural changes of the cardiac tissues were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The serum levels of cardial troponin T (cTnT) and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) were detected by ELISA. Results Compared with the control group, tumor volumes in all treated groups were reduced 7 days after PEFs treatment; more melanin granules in tumor cells were found in the treated groups; the expressions of PCNA mRNA and protein were down-regulated in all treated groups, and there were greater changes in the groups receiving the bigger pulse width.

We have developed a preclinical platform for validation of new therapies in human heart tissue using organotypic slices isolated from donor and end-stage failing hearts. A major advantage of the slices when compared with human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes is that native tissue architecture and extracellular matrix are preserved, thereby allowing investigation of multi-cellular physiology in normal or diseased myocardium. To validate this model, we used optical mapping of transmembrane potential and calcium transients. We found that normal human electrophysiology is preserved in slice preparations when compared with intact hearts, including slices obtained from the region of the sinus node.

{"title": "Effects of exogenous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in the rat heart are mediated by P2 purine receptors.", "abstract": "Recently, NAD+ has been considered as an essential factor, participating in nerve control of physiological functions and intercellular communication. NAD+ also has been supposed as endogenous activator of P1 and P2 purinoreceptors. Effects of extracellular NAD+ remain poorly investigated in cardiac tissue. This study aims to investigate the effects of extracellular NAD+ in different types of supraventricular and ventricular working myocardium from rat and their potential mechanisms.\nThe standard technique of sharp microelectrode action potential recording in cardiac multicellular preparations was used to study the effects of NAD+.\nExtracellular NAD+ induced significant changes in bioelectrical activity of left auricle (LA), right auricle (RA), pulmonary veins (PV) and right ventricular wall (RV) myocardial preparations. 10-100\u00a0\u03bcM NAD+ produced two opposite effects in LA and RA - quickly developing and transient prolongation of action potentials (AP) and delayed sustained AP shortening, which follows the initial positive effect. In PV and RV only AP shortening was observed in response to NAD+ application. In PV preparations AP shortening induced by NAD+ may be considered as a potential proarrhythmic effect. Revealed cardiotropic effects of NAD+ are likely to be mediated by P2 purine receptors, since P1 blocker DPCPX failed to affect them and P2 antagonist suramin abolished NAD\u2009+\u2009-induced alterations of electrical activity. P2X receptors may be responsible for NAD\u2009+\u2009-induced short-lasting AP prolongation, while P2Y receptors mediate persistent AP shortening. The latter effect is partially removed by PLC inhibitor U73122 showing the potential involvement of phosphoinositide signaling pathway in mediation of NAD+ cardiotropic effects.\nExtracellular NAD+ is supposed to be a novel regulator of cardiac electrical activity.

Hyperglycemia is the primary characteristic of diabetes and is associated with many complications. The role of hyperglycemia in the dysfunction of human cardiac progenitor cells that can regenerate damaged cardiac tissue has been investigated, but the exact mechanism underlying this association is not clear. Thus, we examined whether hyperglycemia could regulate mitochondrial dynamics and lead to cardiac progenitor cell dysfunction, and whether blocking glucose uptake could rescue this dysfunction. High glucose in cardiac progenitor cells results in reduced cell viability and decreased expression of cell cycle-related molecules, including CDK2 and cyclin E. A tube formation assay revealed that hyperglycemia led to a significant decrease in the tube-forming ability of cardiac progenitor cells. Fluorescent labeling of cardiac progenitor cell mitochondria revealed that hyperglycemia alters mitochondrial dynamics and increases expression of fission-related proteins, including Fis1 and Drp1. Moreover, we showed that specific blockage of GLUT1 improved cell viability, tube formation, and regulation of mitochondrial dynamics in cardiac progenitor cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that high glucose leads to cardiac progenitor cell dysfunction through an increase in mitochondrial fission, and that a GLUT1 blocker can rescue cardiac progenitor cell dysfunction and downregulation of mitochondrial fission.

{"title": "Thyroid Hormone and Cardioprotection.", "abstract": "The heart is a major target of thyroid hormones, with maintenance of euthyroid hormone balance critical for proper function. In particular, chronic low thyroid function can eventually lead to dilated heart failure with impaired coronary blood flow. New evidence also suggests that heart diseases trigger a reduction in cardiac tissue thyroid hormone levels, a condition that may not be detectible using serum hormone assays. Many animal and clinical studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of low thyroid function in heart diseases with worse outcomes from this condition. Animal and human studies have also demonstrated many benefits from thyroid hormone treatment of heart diseases, particularly heart failure. Nonetheless, this potential treatment has not yet translated to patients due to a number of important concerns. The most serious concern involves the potential of accidental overdose leading to increased arrhythmias and sudden death. Several important clinical studies, which actually used excessive doses of thyroid hormone analogs, have played a major role in convincing the medical community that thyroid hormones are simply too dangerous to be considered for treatment in cardiac patients. Nonetheless, this issue has not gone away due primarily to overwhelmingly positive evidence for treatment benefits and a new understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying those benefits. This review will first discuss the clinical evidence for the use of thyroid hormones as a cardioprotective agent and then provide an overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying beneficial changes from thyroid hormone treatment of heart diseases. \u00a9 2016 American Physiological Society.

ANIMALS 8 dogs with and 5 dogs without DCM. PROCEDURES Following euthanasia, samples of left ventricular myocardium were collected from each dog. Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples, and RNA sequencing was performed on each sample. Samples from dogs with and without DCM were grouped to identify genes that were differentially regulated between the 2 populations. Overrepresentation analysis was performed on upregulated and downregulated gene sets to identify altered molecular pathways in dogs with DCM. RESULTS Genes involved in cellular energy metabolism, especially metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, were significantly downregulated in dogs with DCM. Expression of cardiac structural proteins was also altered in affected dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that RNA sequencing may provide important insights into the pathogenesis of DCM in dogs and highlight pathways that should be explored to identify causative mutations and develop novel therapeutic interventions.", "journal": "American journal of veterinary research", "date": "2016-06-28", "authors": ["Steven GFriedenberg", "LhoucineChdid", "BruceKeene", "BarbaraSherry", "AlisonMotsinger-Reif", "Kathryn MMeurs"], "doi": "10.2460/ajvr.77.7.693"}

Transcriptome Mapper (TRAM) software integrated 32 gene expression profile datasets from different sources returning a reference value of expression for each of the 43,360 known, mapped transcripts assayed by any of the experimental platforms used in this regard. Main findings include the visualization at the gene and chromosomal levels of the classical description of the basic histology and physiology of the heart, the identification of suitable housekeeping reference genes, the analysis of stoichiometry of gene products, and the focusing on chromosome 21 genes, which are present in one excess copy in Down syndrome subjects, presenting cardiovascular defects in 30-40% of cases. Independent in vitro validation showed an excellent correlation coefficient (r\u2009=\u20090.98) with the in silico data. Remarkably, heart/non-cardiac tissue expression ratio may also be used to anticipate that effects of mutations will most probably affect or not the heart.

Corin is a transmembrane protease that activates ANP in the heart. Corin expression has been detected in non-cardiac tissues including the kidney. Here we examined corin, pro-ANP/ANP and natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) expression in human renal segments. By immunostaining and in situ hybridization, we found similar corin, pro-ANP/ANP and NPR-A protein and mRNA expression in human renal segments. The expression was most abundant in the proximal convoluted tubules and the medullary connecting ducts. In the proximal tubules, corin protein was present in the apical membrane region underneath the brush border where the ANP-degrading protease neprilysin was abundant. These results suggest that corin-mediated pro-ANP activation may occur in renal segments and that locally produced ANP may act in an autocrine manner to regulate sodium and water reabsorption in situ Our results also point to the proximal convoluted tubules as a major site for local ANP action. Such a renal corin/ANP autocrine mechanism may differ from the cardiac corin/ANP endocrine mechanism in regulating sodium homoeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions.", "journal": "Clinical science (London, England : 1979)", "date": "2016-06-28", "authors": ["LiangDong", "HaoWang", "NingzhengDong", "CeZhang", "BoxinXue", "QingyuWu"], "doi": "10.1042/CS20160398"}

The compound 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-\u03b2-d-glucoside (THSG) can induce CSC proliferation in vitro based on our previous study, so we aimed to study the induce effect of THSG on CSCs-transplanted MI rat in vivo.\nUsing a murine model of MI, this study was designed to evaluate the impact of THSG (30, 60, 120mg/kg) on CSCs-based therapy for MI and the underlying mechanism in this process.\nThe results showed that THSG on CSCs-transplanted therapy groups (THSG+CSCs groups) can significantly reduce S-T segment elevation, and increase heart rate compared with MI group. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were significantly reduced in THSG+CSCs groups compared to the MI group. The levels of enzyme expression (CK-MB, LDH), the heart weight index (HWI) and myocardial infarct size (IS) were all reduced in THSG+CSCs groups. Moreover, other changes noted during these 28days post-MI, included pathologic changes, as well as increased stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) expression, or expression of Nkx2.5, GATA-4, and Connexin 43 in myocardial tissue, and reduced the Caspase-3 expression.\nOur findings indicated that THSG facilitated CSCs-transplanted therapy in MI.

{"title": "Scanning Electron Microscopy of Macerated Tissue to Visualize the Extracellular Matrix.", "abstract": "Fibrosis is a component of all forms of heart disease regardless of etiology, and while much progress has been made in the field of cardiac matrix biology, there are still major gaps related to how the matrix is formed, how physiological and pathological remodeling differ, and most importantly how matrix dynamics might be manipulated to promote healing and inhibit fibrosis. There is currently no treatment option for controlling, preventing, or reversing cardiac fibrosis. Part of the reason is likely the sheer complexity of cardiac scar formation, such as occurs after myocardial infarction to immediately replace dead or dying cardiomyocytes. The extracellular matrix itself participates in remodeling by activating resident cells and also by helping to guide infiltrating cells to the defunct lesion. The matrix is also a storage locker of sorts for matricellular proteins that are crucial to normal matrix turnover, as well as fibrotic signaling. The matrix has additionally been demonstrated to play an electromechanical role in cardiac tissue. Most techniques for assessing fibrosis are not qualitative in nature, but rather provide quantitative results that are useful for comparing two groups but that do not provide information related to the underlying matrix structure. Highlighted here is a technique for visualizing cardiac matrix ultrastructure.

{"title": "Rebuilding the Damaged Heart: Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Cell-Based Therapy, and Engineered Heart Tissue.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are broadly distributed cells that retain postnatal capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. MSCs evade immune detection, secrete an array of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic mediators, and very importantly activate resident precursors. These properties form the basis for the strategy of clinical application of cell-based therapeutics for inflammatory and fibrotic conditions. In cardiovascular medicine, administration of autologous or allogeneic MSCs in patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy holds significant promise. Numerous preclinical studies of ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy employing MSC-based therapy have demonstrated that the properties of reducing fibrosis, stimulating angiogenesis, and cardiomyogenesis have led to improvements in the structure and function of remodeled ventricles. Further attempts have been made to augment MSCs' effects through genetic modification and cell preconditioning. Progression of MSC therapy to early clinical trials has supported their role in improving cardiac structure and function, functional capacity, and patient quality of life. Emerging data have supported larger clinical trials that have been either completed or are currently underway. Mechanistically, MSC therapy is thought to benefit the heart by stimulating innate anti-fibrotic and regenerative responses. The mechanisms of action involve paracrine signaling, cell-cell interactions, and fusion with resident cells. Trans-differentiation of MSCs to bona fide cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels is also thought to occur, although at a nonphysiological level. Recently, MSC-based tissue engineering for cardiovascular disease has been examined with quite encouraging results.

Myocardial disease in heart failure is frequently accompanied by impairment of the specialized electrical conduction system and myocardium. We introduce an epicardial mesh made of electrically conductive and mechanically elastic material, to resemble the innate cardiac tissue and confer cardiac conduction system function, to enable electromechanical cardioplasty. Our epicardium-like substrate mechanically integrated with the heart and acted as a structural element of cardiac chambers. The epicardial device was designed with elastic properties nearly identical to the epicardial tissue itself and was able to detect electrical signals reliably on the moving rat heart without impeding diastolic function 8 weeks after induced myocardial infarction. Synchronized electrical stimulation over the ventricles by the epicardial mesh with the high conductivity of 11,210 S/cm shortened total ventricular activation time, reduced inherent wall stress, and improved several measures of systolic function including increases of 51% in fractional shortening, ~90% in radial strain, and 42% in contractility. The epicardial mesh was also capable of delivering an electrical shock to terminate a ventricular tachyarrhythmia in rodents.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the late effects of total-body irradiation (TBI) on cardiac morphology, function and selected circulating biomarkers in a well-established nonhuman primate model. For this study we used male rhesus macaques that were exposed to a single total-body dose of ionizing gamma radiation (6.5-8.4 Gy) 5.6-9.7 years earlier at ages ranging from \u223c3-10 years old and a cohort of nonirradiated controls. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed annually for 3 years on 20 irradiated and 11 control animals. Myocardium was examined grossly and histologically, and myocardial fibrosis/collagen was assessed microscopically and by morphometric analysis of Masson's trichrome-stained sections. Serum/plasma from 27 irradiated and 13 control animals was evaluated for circulating biomarkers of cardiac damage [N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic protein (nt-proBNP) and troponin-I], inflammation (CRP, IL-6, MCP-1, sICAM) and microbial translocation [LPS-binding protein (LBP) and sCD14]. A higher prevalence of histological myocardial fibrosis was observed in the hearts obtained from the irradiated animals (9/14) relative to controls (0/3) (P = 0.04, \u03c7(2)). Echocardiographically determined left ventricular end diastolic and systolic diameters were significantly smaller in irradiated animals (repeated measures ANOVA, P < 0.001 and P < 0.008, respectively). Histomorphometric analysis of trichrome-stained sections of heart tissue demonstrated \u223c14.9 \u00b1 1.4% (mean \u00b1 SEM) of myocardial area staining for collagen in irradiated animals compared to 9.1 \u00b1 0.9 % in control animals. Circulating levels of MCP-1 and LBP were significantly higher in irradiated animals (P < 0.05). A high incidence of diabetes in the irradiated animals was associated with higher plasma triglyceride and lower HDLc but did not appear to be associated with cardiovascular phenotypes. These results demonstrate that single total-body doses of 6.5-8.4 Gy produced long-term effects including a high incidence of myocardial fibrosis, reduced left ventricular diameter and elevated systemic inflammation.

Despite the recognized importance of various wildlife species for perpetuating Trypanosoma cruzi in nature, relatively little is known about the development of cardiac disease in infected wildlife. Using a cross-sectional study design, we collected cardiac tissue and blood from hunter-donated wildlife carcasses- including raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), and bobcat (Lynx rufus) - from central Texas, a region with established populations of infected triatomine vectors and increasing diagnoses of Chagas disease in domestic dogs. Based on PCR analysis, we found that 2 bobcats (14.3%), 12 coyotes (14.3%), 8 foxes (13.8%), and 49 raccoons (70.0%) were positive for T.\u00a0cruzi in at least one sample (right ventricle, apex, and/or blood clot). Although a histologic survey of right ventricles showed that 21.1% of 19 PCR-positive hearts were characterized by mild lymphoplasmocytic infiltration, no other lesions and no amastigotes were observed in any histologic section. DNA sequencing of the TcSC5D gene revealed that raccoons were infected with T.\u00a0cruzi strain TcIV, and a single racoon harbored a TcI/TcIV mixed infection. Relative to other wildlife species tested here, our data suggest that raccoons may be important reservoirs of TcIV in Texas and a source of infection for indigenous triatomine bugs. The overall high level of infection in this wildlife community likely reflects high levels of vector contact, including ingestion of bugs. Although the relationship between the sylvatic cycle of T.\u00a0cruzi transmission and human disease risk in the United States\u00a0has yet to be defined, our data suggest that hunters and wildlife professionals should take precautions to avoid direct contact with potentially infected wildlife tissues.", "journal": "International journal for parasitology.

{"title": "Long noncoding RNA dysregulation in ischemic heart failure.", "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein coding transcripts regulating a variety of physiological and pathological functions. However, their implication in heart failure is still largely unknown. The aim of this study is to identify and characterize lncRNAs deregulated in patients affected by ischemic heart failure.\nLncRNAs were profiled and validated in left ventricle biopsies of 18 patients affected by non end-stage dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy and 17 matched controls. Further validations were performed in left ventricle samples derived from explanted hearts of end-stage heart failure patients and in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy, obtained by transverse aortic constriction. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of heart failure patients were also analyzed. LncRNA distribution in the heart was assessed by in situ hybridization. Function of the deregulated lncRNA was explored analyzing the expression of the neighbor mRNAs and by gene ontology analysis of the correlating coding transcripts.\nFourteen lncRNAs were significantly modulated in non end-stage heart failure patients, identifying a heart failure lncRNA signature. Nine of these lncRNAs (CDKN2B-AS1/ANRIL, EGOT, H19, HOTAIR, LOC285194/TUSC7, RMRP, RNY5, SOX2-OT and SRA1) were also confirmed in end-stage failing hearts. Intriguingly, among the conserved lncRNAs, h19, rmrp and hotair were also induced in a mouse model of heart hypertrophy.

Our previous study has used RNA-seq technology to show that apoptotic molecules were involved in the myocardial protection of electroacupuncture pretreatment (EAP) on the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) animal model. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate how EAP protects myocardium against myocardial I/R injury through antiapoptotic mechanism. Methods. By using rats with myocardial I/R, we ligated the left anterior descending artery (LAD) for 30 minutes followed by 4\u2009hr of reperfusion after EAP at the Neiguan (PC6) acupoint for 12 days; we employed arrhythmia scores, serum myocardial enzymes, and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) to evaluate the cardioprotective effect. Heart tissues were harvested for western blot analyses for the expressions of pro- and antiapoptotic signaling molecules. Results. Our preliminary findings showed that EAP increased the survival of the animals along with declined arrhythmia scores and decreased CK, LDH, CK-Mb, and cTnT levels. Further analyses with the heart tissues detected reduced myocardial fiber damage, decreased number of apoptotic cells and the protein expressions of Cyt c and cleaved caspase 3, and the elevated level of Endo G and AIF after EAP intervention. At the same time, the protein expressions of antiapoptotic molecules, including Xiap, BclxL, and Bcl2, were obviously increased. Conclusions. The present study suggested that EAP protected the myocardium from I/R injury at least partially through the activation of endogenous antiapoptotic signaling.", "journal": "Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM", "date": "2016-06-18", "authors": ["Sheng-FengLu", "YanHuang", "NingWang", "Wei-XingShen", "Shu-PingFu", "QianLi", "Mei-LingYu", "Wan-XinLiu", "XiaChen", "Xin-YueJing", "Bing-MeiZhu"], "doi": "10.1155/2016/4609784\n10.1056/nejm198306023082202\n10.1177/1089253211436350\n10.1016/j.abb.2003.08.037\n10.1056/nejmra071667\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.023\n10.1016/s0140-6736(13)61450-6\n10.1161/atvbaha.113.301586\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e31829be05b\n10.1161/01.res.0000137171.97172.d7\n10.1038/ncpcardio0096\n10.1016/S0254-6272(08)60052-7\n10.2170/physiolsci.rp007108\n10.1155/2012/792820\n10.1152/ajpheart.00979.2006\n10.1111/j.1460-9592.2012.03822.x\n10.1142/S0192415X04002557\n10.3748/wjg.14.6496\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.12.003\n10.1016/s0828-282x(09)70095-9\n10.1186/1742-2094-10-63\n10.1016/j.lfs.2007.01.019\n10.1155/2012/195397\n10.3390/molecules191016158\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.05.043\n10.1093/ecam/nen064\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.10.018\n10.1093/cvrese/22.9.656\n10.1177/002215549804600306\n10.1186/1423-0127-18-53\n10.1371/journal.pone.0094604\n10.3109/10520298309066797\n10.1038/srep02767\n10.2170/physiolsci.rp006606\n10.1152/ajpheart.00030.2012\n10.1186/s12906-015-0521-y\n10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2014.04.005\n10.1001/archinternmed.2011.2275\n10.1093/bja/aeh148\n10.1016/j.hoc.2006.11.010\n10.1093/cvr/cvs088\n10.1172/jci62874\n10.2174/138920209788920967\n10.1200/JCO.2007.13.9717\n10.1002/ijc.24064\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.10.010\n10.1038/sj.onc.1207517\n10.3390/ijms14022334\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2012.06.620\n10.1007/s10495-007-0747-3\n10.1038/ncb1192\n10.1007/s00534-009-0155-x\n10.1016/j.brainres.2013.01.051\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2010.04.009\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.08.010\n10.1016/j.acvd.2015.09.006"}

The accurate detection of different myocardial cell populations, as well as the high-resolution imaging of protein expression and distribution, within the diverse intracellular compartments, is essential for basic research on disease mechanisms and for the translatability of the results to human pathophysiology. While enormous progress has been made on the imaging hardware and methods and on biotechnological tools [e.g., use of green fluorescent protein (GFP), viral-mediated gene transduction] to investigate heart cell structure and function, most of the protocols to prepare heart tissue samples for analysis have remained almost identical for decades. We here provide a detailed description of a novel protocol of heart processing, tailored to the simultaneous detection of tissue morphology, immunofluorescence markers and native emission of fluorescent proteins (i.e., GFP). We compared a variety of procedures of fixation, antigen unmasking and tissue permeabilization, to identify the best combination for preservation of myocardial morphology and native GFP fluorescence, while simultaneously allowing detection of antibody staining toward sarcomeric, membrane, cytosolic and nuclear markers. Furthermore, with minimal variations, we implemented such protocol for the study of human heart samples, including those already fixed and stored with conventional procedures, in tissue archives or bio-banks. In conclusion, a procedure is here presented for the laboratory investigation of the heart, in both rodents and humans, which accrues from the same tissue section information that would normally require the time-consuming and tissue-wasting observation of multiple serial sections.", "journal": "Histochemistry and cell biology", "date": "2016-06-18", "authors": ["TaniaZaglia", "AnnaDi Bona", "TatianaChioato", "CristinaBasso", "SimonettaAusoni", "MarcoMongillo"], "doi": "10.1007/s00418-016-1456-1"}

Injectable hydrogels with conductivity and self-healing ability are highly desirable as cell delivery vehicles for cardiac regeneration. Here, we developed self-healable conductive injectable hydrogels based on chitosan-graft-aniline tetramer (CS-AT) and dibenzaldehyde-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-DA) as cell delivery vehicles for myocardial infarction. Self-healed electroactive hydrogels were obtained after mixing CS-AT and PEG-DA solutions at physiological conditions. Rapid self-healing behavior was investigated by rheometer. Swelling behavior, morphology, mechanical strength, electrochemistry, conductivity, adhesiveness to host tissue and antibacterial property of the injectable hydrogels were fully studied. Conductivity of the hydrogels is \u223c10(-3) S\u00b7cm(-1), which is quite close to native cardiac tissue. Proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts in the hydrogel showed its good biocompatibility. After injection, viability of C2C12 cells in the hydrogels showed no significant difference with that before injection. Two different cell types were successfully encapsulated in the hydrogels by self-healing effect. Cell delivery profile of C2C12 myoblasts and H9c2 cardiac cells showed a tunable release rate, and in vivo cell retention in the conductive hydrogels was also studied. Subcutaneous injection and in vivo degradation of the hydrogels demonstrated their injectability and biodegradability.

{"title": "Predicted Coverage and Immuno-Safety of a Recombinant C-Repeat Region Based Streptococcus pyogenes Vaccine Candidate.", "abstract": "The C-terminal region of the M-protein of Streptococcus pyogenes is a major target for vaccine development. The major feature is the C-repeat region, consisting of 35-42 amino acid repeat units that display high but not perfect identity. SV1 is a S. pyogenes vaccine candidate that incorporates five 14mer amino acid sequences (called J14i variants) from differing C-repeat units in a single recombinant construct. Here we show that the J14i variants chosen for inclusion in SV1 are the most common variants in a dataset of 176 unique M-proteins. Murine antibodies raised against SV1 were shown to bind to each of the J14i variants present in SV1, as well as variants not present in the vaccine. Antibodies raised to the individual J14i variants were also shown to bind to multiple but different combinations of J14i variants, supporting the underlying rationale for the design of SV1. A Lewis Rat Model of valvulitis was then used to assess the capacity of SV1 to induce deleterious immune response associated with rheumatic heart disease. In this model, both SV1 and the M5 positive control protein were immunogenic. Neither of these antibodies were cross-reactive with cardiac myosin or collagen. Splenic T cells from SV1/CFA and SV1/alum immunized rats did not proliferate in response to cardiac myosin or collagen. Subsequent histological examination of heart tissue showed that 4 of 5 mice from the M5/CFA group had valvulitis and inflammatory cell infiltration into valvular tissue, whereas mice immunised with SV1/CFA, SV1/alum showed no sign of valvulitis.

Its unique capacity to integrate various Ca(2+) signals into different specific outcomes is a precious asset to excitable and nonexcitable cells. Numerous studies have reported roles and mechanisms involving CaMKII in brain and heart tissues. However, corresponding functions in vascular cell types (endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells) remained largely unexplored until recently. Investigation of the intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics, their impact on vascular cell function, the regulatory processes involved and more recently the spatially restricted oscillatory Ca(2+) signals and microdomains triggered significant interest towards proteins like CaMKII. Heteromultimerization of CaMKII isoforms (four isoforms and several splice variants) expands this kinase's peculiar capacity to decipher Ca(2+) signals and initiate specific signaling processes, and thus controlling cellular functions. The physiological functions that rely on CaMKII are unsurprisingly diverse, ranging from regulating contractile state and cellular proliferation to Ca(2+) homeostasis and cellular permeability.

While dealing with a common biology across species, the goals of biomedical and food animals lipid metabolism research differ in emphasis. In humans, mechanisms and regulation of fat synthesis, accumulation of fat in regional fat depots, lipid metabolism and dysmetabolism in adipose, liver and cardiac tissues have been investigated. Further, energy balance and weight control have also been extensively explored in humans. Finally, obesity and associated maladies including high cholesterol and atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and health outcomes have been widely studied. In food animals, the emphasis has been on regulation of fatty acid synthesis and lipid deposition in fat depots and deposition of intramuscular fat. For humans, understanding the regulation of energy balance and body weight and of prevention or treatment of obesity and associated maladies have been important clinical outcomes. In production of food animals lowering fat content in muscle foods while enhancing intramuscular fat (marbling) have been major targets. In this review, we summarize how our laboratories have addressed the goal of providing lean but yet tasty and juicy muscle food products to consumers. In addition, we here describe efforts in the development of a new porcine model to study regulation of fat metabolism and obesity.

Several populations of CSC/CPCs have been identified based on expression of different stem cell-associated antigens. Sca-1(+) cells in the cardiac tissue may be the most common CSC/CPCs. However, they are a heterogeneous cell population and, in transplants, clinicians might transplant more endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, or other cells than stem cells. The purposes of this study were to (1) isolate CSC/CPCs with Lin(-)CD45(-)Sca-1(+)CD31(-) and Lin(-)CD45(-)Sca-1(+)CD31(+) surface antigens using flow-activated cell sorting; (2) investigate their differentiation potential; and (3) determine the molecular basis for differences in stemness characteristics between cell subtypes. The results indicated that mouse heart-derived Sca-1(+)CD31(-) cells were multipotent and retained the ability to differentiate into different cardiac cell lineages, but Sca-1(+)CD31(+) cells did not. Integrated analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression indicated that 20 microRNAs and 49 mRNAs were inversely associated with Sca-1(+)CD31(-) and Sca-1(+)CD31(+) subtype stemness characteristics.

Our hypothesis is that EtOH exposure and FA protection relate to lipid and FA metabolism during mouse cardiogenesis and placentation.\nOn the morning of conception, pregnant C57BL/6J mice were placed on either of two FA-containing diets: a 3.3 mg health maintenance diet or a high FA diet of 10.5 mg/kg. Mice were injected a binge level of EtOH, HCy, or saline on embryonic day (E) 6.75, targeting gastrulation. On E15.5, cardiac and umbilical blood flow were examined by ultrasound. Embryonic cardiac tissues were processed for gene expression of lipid and FA metabolism; the placenta and heart tissues for neutral lipid droplets, or for medium chain acyl-dehydrogenase (MCAD) protein.\nEtOH exposure altered lipid-related gene expression on E7.5 in comparison to control or FA-supplemented groups and remained altered on E15.5 similarly to changes with HCy, signifying FA deficiency. In comparison to control tissues, the lipid-related acyl CoA dehydrogenase medium length chain gene and its protein MCAD were altered with EtOH exposure, as were neutral lipid droplet localization in the heart and placenta.\nEtOH altered gene expression associated with lipid and folate metabolism, as well as neutral lipids, in the E15.5 abnormally functioning heart and placenta.

{"title": "The Effect of a High-Protein Diet and Exercise on Cardiac AQP7 and GLUT4 Gene Expression.", "abstract": "High-protein (HP) diets are commonly consumed by athletes despite their potential health hazard, which is postulated to enforce a negative effect on bone and renal health. However, its effects on heart have not been known yet. Aquaporin-7 (AQP7) is an aquaglyceroporin that facilitates glycerol and water transport. Glycerol is an important cardiac energy production substrate, especially during exercise, in conjunction with fatty acids and glucose. Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) is an insulin-sensitive glucose transporter in heart. We aimed to investigate the effect of HPD on AQP7 and GLUT4 levels in the rat heart subjected to exercise. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control (n\u00a0=\u00a012), exercise (E) training (n\u00a0=\u00a010), HPD (n\u00a0=\u00a012), and HPD-E training (n\u00a0=\u00a09) groups. The HPD groups were fed a 45\u00a0% protein-containing diet 5\u00a0weeks. The HPD-E and E groups were performed the treadmill exercise during the 5-week study period. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry techniques were used to determine the gene expression and localization of AQP7 and GLUT4 in heart tissue. Results of relative gene expression were calculated by the 'Pfaffl' mathematical method using the REST program. Differences in AQP7 and GLUT4 gene expression were expressed as fold change compared to the control group. Heart weight/tibia ratio and ventricular wall thickness were evaluated as markers of cardiac hypertrophy. Further, serum glucose, glycerol, and insulin levels were also measured. AQP7 gene expression was found to be increased in the E (3.47-fold, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), HPD (5.59-fold, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and HPD-E (3.87-fold, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) groups compared to the control group. AQP7 protein expression was also increased in the HPD and HPD-E groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Additionally, cardiac mRNA expression levels of GLUT4 showed a significant increase in the E (2.16-fold, p\u00a0<\u00a00.003), HPD (7.14-fold, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and HPD-E (3.43-fold, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) groups compared to the control group. GLUT4 protein expression was significantly increased in the E, HPD, and HPD-E groups compared to the control group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively). Furthermore, Serum glucose levels were significantly different between groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005). This difference was observed between the HPD groups and normal-protein diet groups (C and E). Serum insulin levels were higher for HPD groups compared with the normal-protein diet groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), whereas no differences were observed between the exercise and sedentary groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.111). Serum glycerol levels were significantly increased in the HPD groups compared with control and E groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, respectively).

Adult male Wistar Albino rats were pretreated with Sundarban honey (5\u2009g/kg) daily for a period of 6 weeks. After the treatment period, ISO (85\u2009mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected into the rats at 24\u2009h intervals for 2 days. ISO-induced myocardial damage was indicated by increased serum cardiac specific troponin I levels and cardiac marker enzyme activities including creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase. Significant increases in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were also observed, along with a reduction in the serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level. In addition to these diagnostic markers, the levels of lipid peroxide products were significantly increased. The activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase were significantly decreased in the hearts after ISO-induced myocardial infarction. However, pretreatment of ischemic rats with Sundarban honey brought the biochemical parameters to near normalcy, indicating the protective effect of Sundarban honey against ISO-induced ischemia in rats.

{"title": "Sulforaphane effects on postinfarction cardiac remodeling in rats: modulation of redox-sensitive prosurvival and proapoptotic proteins.", "abstract": "This study investigated whether sulforaphane (SFN), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, could attenuate the progression of post-myocardial infarction (MI) cardiac remodeling. Male Wistar rats (350 g) were allocated to four groups: SHAM (n=8), SHAM+SFN (n=7), MI (n=8) and MI+SFN (n=5). On the third day after surgery, cardiac function was assessed and SFN treatment (5 mg/kg/day) was started. At the end of 25 days of treatment, cardiac function was assessed and heart was collected to measure collagen content, oxidative stress and protein kinase. MI and MI+SFN groups presented cardiac dysfunction, without signs of congestion. Sulforaphane reduced fibrosis (2.1-fold) in infarcted rats, which was associated with a slight attenuation in the cardiac remodeling process. Both infarcted groups presented increases in the oxidative markers xanthine oxidase and 4-hydroxinonenal, as well as a parallel increase in the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. Moreover, sulforaphane stimulated the cytoprotective heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (38%). Oxidative markers correlated with ERK 1/2 activation. In the MI+SFN group, up-regulation of ERK 1/2 (34%) and Akt (35%), as well as down-regulation of p38 (52%), was observed. This change in the prosurvival kinase balance in the MI+SFN group was related to a down-regulation of apoptosis pathways (Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3). Sulforaphane was unable to modulate autophagy. Taken together, sulforaphane increased HO-1, which may generate a redox environment in the cardiac tissue favorable to activation of prosurvival and deactivation of prodeath pathways.

{"title": "BMP Antagonist Gremlin 2 Limits Inflammation After Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "We have recently shown that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist Gremlin 2 (Grem2) is required for early cardiac development and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Our initial studies discovered that Grem2 is strongly induced in the adult heart after experimental myocardial infarction (MI). However, the function of Grem2 and BMP-signaling inhibitors after cardiac injury is currently unknown.\nTo investigate the role of Grem2 during cardiac repair and assess its potential to improve ventricular function after injury.\nOur data show that Grem2 is transiently induced after MI in peri-infarct area cardiomyocytes during the inflammatory phase of cardiac tissue repair. By engineering loss- (Grem2(-/-)) and gain- (TG(Grem2)) of-Grem2-function mice, we discovered that Grem2 controls the magnitude of the inflammatory response and limits infiltration of inflammatory cells in peri-infarct ventricular tissue, improving cardiac function. Excessive inflammation in Grem2(-/-) mice after MI was because of overactivation of canonical BMP signaling, as proven by the rescue of the inflammatory phenotype through administration of the canonical BMP inhibitor, DMH1. Furthermore, intraperitoneal administration of Grem2 protein in wild-type mice was sufficient to reduce inflammation after MI. Cellular analyses showed that BMP2 acts with TNF\u03b1 to induce expression of proinflammatory proteins in endothelial cells and promote adhesion of leukocytes, whereas Grem2 specifically inhibits the BMP2 effect.\nOur results indicate that Grem2 provides a molecular barrier that controls the magnitude and extent of inflammatory cell infiltration by suppressing canonical BMP signaling, thereby providing a novel mechanism for limiting the adverse effects of excessive inflammation after MI.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2016-06-11", "authors": ["Lehanna NSanders", "John ASchoenhard", "Mohamed ASaleh", "AmritaMukherjee", "SergeyRyzhov", "William GMcMaster", "KristofNolan", "Richard JGumina", "Thomas BThompson", "Mark AMagnuson", "David GHarrison", "Antonis KHatzopoulos"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308700"}

{"title": "Giving Priority to Lipid Administration Can Reduce Lung Injury Caused by Epinephrine in Bupivacaine-Induced Cardiac Depression.", "abstract": "Epinephrine is usually administered in concert with a lipid emulsion during local anesthetic toxicity. However, the timing and role of epinephrine administration in combination with a lipid emulsion remain unclear. Specifically, the temporal association of epinephrine and lipid emulsion administration with related changes in pulmonary vascular pressures that may lead to pulmonary edema and hemorrhage needs to be determined.\nThis study consisted of 2 parts, experiments A and B. In experiment A, 24 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 8) to receive 1 of 3 treatments. All rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate, and anesthesia was maintained by sevoflurane. Each treatment group was initially given an infusion of bupivacaine (15 mg/kg) in order to produce cardiac depression. Group 1 (A-LEN) received a 30% lipid infusion (3 mL/kg) followed by a rapid epinephrine bolus (10 \u03bcg/kg), which was then followed by a normal saline infusion (3 mL/kg). Group 2 (A-NEL) first received a normal saline infusion (3 mL/kg) followed by a rapid epinephrine bolus, which was then followed by a 30% lipid emulsion. Group 3 (A-NEN, considered a control group) first received a normal saline infusion (3 mL/kg) followed by a rapid epinephrine bolus (10 \u03bcg/kg), which was then followed by another normal saline infusion (3 mL/kg). Lipid and normal saline infusions were administered over 1 minute, whereas epinephrine was injected rapidly. The continuous monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, pulmonary arterial pressure, and pulmonary venous pressure occurred for 30 minutes. After the 30-minute monitoring period, lung tissue was sampled, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected. In experiment B, the experimental model and resuscitation protocol were similar to experiment A (B-LEN and B-NEL groups). In this arm of the experiment, bupivacaine concentrations of cardiac tissue were determined after the second minute of normal saline infusion.\nThe A-LEN group produced the best rate pressure product when compared with the A-NEL or A-NEN group (P = 0.045, P = 0.011, respectively). In regard to pulmonary venous pressure, the A-LEN group was lower than the A-NEL or A-NEN group (P = 0.031, P = 0.006, respectively). Animals in the A-NEL and A-NEN groups rapidly developed pulmonary edema after infusion of epinephrine. The wet-to-dry ratio of the lungs in the A-LEN group was lower than that of the lungs in the A-NEL group (P = 0.024).The lung permeability index of the A-LEN group was lower than that of the A-NEL group (P = 0.011). In experiment B, concentrations of bupivacaine in cardiac tissue and plasma of the B-LEN group were lower than those of the B-NEL group (P = 0.001, P = 0.03, respectively).\nGiving priority to the administration of a lipid emulsion before the administration of epinephrine can reduce lung injury in bupivacaine-induced cardiac depression in rats.", "journal": "Regional anesthesia and pain medicine", "date": "2016-06-10", "authors": ["MengxuLuo", "XiaYun", "ChaoxingChen", "NanaBao", "XiaonaFeng", "LinminPan", "ZhoushengJin", "CongWu", "XianqinWang", "Thomas JPapadimos", "XuzhongXu"], "doi": "10.1097/AAP.0000000000000424"}

Yet achieving cardiac differentiation after stem cell transplantation remains challenging. This compromises the efficacy of current stem cell therapy. Delivery of cells using matrices that stimulate the cardiac differentiation may improve the degree of cardiac differentiation in the heart tissue. In this report, we investigated whether elastic modulus of highly flexible poly(N-isopropylamide) (PNIPAAm)-based hydrogels can be modulated to stimulate the encapsulated cardiosphere derived cells (CDCs) to differentiate into cardiac lineage under static condition and dynamic stretching that mimics the heart beating condition. We have developed hydrogels whose moduli do not change under both dynamic stretching and static conditions for 14 days. The hydrogels had the same chemical structure but different elastic moduli (11, 21, and 40 kPa). CDCs were encapsulated into these hydrogels and cultured under either native heart-mimicking dynamic stretching environment (12% strain and 1 Hz frequency) or static culture condition. CDCs were able to grow in all three hydrogels. The greatest growth was found in the hydrogel with elastic modulus of 40 kPa. The dynamic stretching condition stimulated CDC growth. The CDCs demonstrated elastic modulus-dependent cardiac differentiation under both static and dynamic stretching conditions as evidenced by gene and protein expressions of cardiac markers such as MYH6, CACNA1c, cTnI, and Connexin 43. The highest differentiation was found in the 40 kPa hydrogel.

{"title": "Heterogeneity of T-Tubules in Pig Hearts.", "abstract": "T-tubules are invaginations of the sarcolemma that play a key role in excitation-contraction coupling in mammalian cardiac myocytes. Although t-tubules were generally considered to be effectively absent in atrial myocytes, recent studies on atrial cells from larger mammals suggest that t-tubules may be more numerous than previously supposed. However, the degree of heterogeneity between cardiomyocytes in the extent of the t-tubule network remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the t-tubule network of pig atrial myocytes in comparison with ventricular tissue.\nCardiac tissue was obtained from young female Landrace White pigs (45-75 kg, 5-6 months old). Cardiomyocytes were isolated by arterial perfusion with a collagenase-containing solution. Ca2+ transients were examined in field-stimulated isolated cells loaded with fluo-4-AM. Membranes of isolated cells were visualized using di-8-ANEPPS. T-tubules were visualized in fixed-frozen tissue sections stained with Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated WGA. Binary images were obtained by application of a threshold and t-tubule density (TTD) calculated. A distance mapping approach was used to calculate half-distance to nearest t-tubule (HDTT).\nThe spatio-temporal properties of the Ca2+ transient appeared to be consistent with the absence of functional t-tubules in isolated atrial myocytes. However, t-tubules could be identified in a sub-population of atrial cells in frozen sections. While all ventricular myocytes had TTD >3% (mean TTD = 6.94\u00b10.395%, n = 24), this was true of just 5/22 atrial cells. Mean atrial TTD (2.35\u00b10.457%, n = 22) was lower than ventricular TTD (P<0.0001). TTD correlated with cell-width (r = 0.7756, n = 46, P<0.0001). HDTT was significantly greater in the atrial cells with TTD \u22643% (2.29\u00b10.16 \u03bcm, n = 17) than in either ventricular cells (1.33\u00b10.05 \u03bcm, n = 24, P<0.0001) or in atrial cells with TTD >3% (1.65\u00b10.06 \u03bcm, n = 5, P<0.05).

The expression model of Mef2c and uc.167 showed an opposite correlation in the embryonic development and process of differentiation of P19 cells into cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of uc.167 inhibited proliferation but promoted apoptosis in P19 cells compared with the vector group, and those relative mRNAs and proteins decreased during the differentiation process. Whereas, co-expression of Mef2c and uc.167 can partially reverse the negative effects of uc.167 on proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Taken together, our findings suggest that uc.167 contributes to the development potential of VSD and may constitute a potential therapeutic target in this disease. uc.167 influences cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation of P19 cell by regulating Mef2c.", "journal": "Gene", "date": "2016-06-09", "authors": ["GuixianSong", "YahuiShen", "ZhongbaoRuan", "XingLi", "YumeiChen", "WeiYuan", "XiangweiDing", "LiZhu", "LingmeiQian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gene.2016.06.006"}

CNHs were incorporated into collagen to form growth substrates for NRVMs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations demonstrated that CNHs exhibited a good affinity to collagen. Moreover, it was found that CNH-embedded substrates enhanced adhesion and proliferation of NRVMs. Immunohistochemical staining, western blot analysis, and intracellular calcium transient measurements indicated that the addition of CNHs significantly increased the expression and maturation of electrical and mechanical proteins (connexin-43 and N-cadherin).

{"title": "An injectable silk sericin hydrogel promotes cardiac functional recovery after ischemic myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) leads to morbidity and mortality due to cardiac dysfunction. Here we identify sericin, a silk-derived protein, as an injectable therapeutic biomaterial for the minimally invasive MI repair. For the first time, sericin prepared in the form of an injectable hydrogel has been utilized for cardiac tissue engineering and its therapeutical outcomes evaluated in a mouse MI model. The injection of this sericin hydrogel into MI area reduces scar formation and infarct size, increases wall thickness and neovascularization, and inhibits the MI-induced inflammatory responses and apoptosis, thereby leading to a significant functional improvement. The potential therapeutical mechanisms have been further analyzed in vitro. Our results indicate that sericin downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-18) and chemokine (CCL2) and reduces TNF-\u03b1 expression by suppressing the TLR4-MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathways. Moreover, sericin exhibits angiogenic activity by promoting migration and tubular formation of human umbilical vessel endothelial cells (HUVECs). Also, sericin stimulates VEGFa expression via activating ERK phosphorylation. Further, sericin protects endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes from apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of caspase 3. Together, these diverse biochemical activities of sericin protein lead to a significant recovery of cardiac function. This work represents the first study reporting sericin as an effective therapeutic biomaterial for ischemic myocardial repair in vivo.\nIntramyocardial biomaterial injection is thought to be a potential therapeutic approach to improve cardiac performance after ischemic myocardial infarction. In this study, we report the successful fabrication and in vivo application of an injectable sericin hydrogel for ischemic heart disease. We for the first time show that the injection of in situ forming crosslinked sericin hydrogel promotes heart functional recovery accompanied with reduced inflammatory responses, attenuated apoptosis and increased microvessel density in the infarcted hearts. Further, we reveal that the improvement in those aspects is ascribed to sericin protein's functional bioactivities that are comprehensively uncovered in this study.

{"title": "Vascularization of three-dimensional engineered tissues for regenerative medicine applications.", "abstract": "Engineering of three-dimensional (3D) tissues is a promising approach for restoring diseased or dysfunctional myocardium with a functional replacement. However, a major bottleneck in this field is the lack of efficient vascularization strategies, because tissue constructs produced in vitro require a constant flow of oxygen and nutrients to maintain viability and functionality. Compared to angiogenic cell therapy and growth factor treatment, bioengineering approaches such as spatial micropatterning, integration of sacrificial materials, tissue decellularization, and 3D bioprinting enable the generation of more precisely controllable neovessel formation. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art approaches to develop 3D tissue engineered constructs with vasculature, and demonstrate how some of these techniques have been applied towards regenerative medicine for treatment of heart failure.\nTissue engineering is a promising approach to replace or restore dysfunctional tissues/organs, but a major bottleneck in realizing its potential is the challenge of creating scalable 3D tissues. Since most 3D engineered tissues require a constant supply of nutrients, it is necessary to integrate functional vasculature within the tissues in order to facilitate the transport of nutrients. To address these needs, researchers are employing biomaterial engineering and design strategies to foster vessel formation within 3D tissues.

We tested the hypothesis that cardiac macs are M2 polarized in infarcted mouse and human hearts and that polarization is dependent on mac-derived uPA.\nStudies were performed using uninjured (UI) or infarcted (MI) hearts of uPA overexpressing (SR-uPA), uPA null, or nontransgenic littermate (Ntg) mice. At 7days post-infarction, cardiac mac were isolated, RNA extracted and M2 markers Arg1, YM1, and Fizz1 measured with qrtPCR. Histologic analysis for cardiac fibrosis, mac and myofibroblasts was performed at the same time-point. Cardiac macs were also isolated from Ntg hearts and RNA collected after primary isolation or culture with vehicle, IL-4 or plasmin and M2 marker expression measured. Cardiac tissue and blood was collected from humans with ischemic heart disease. Expression of M2 marker CD206 and M1 marker TNFalpha was measured.\nMacs from WT mice had increased expression of Arg1 and Ym1 following MI (41.3\u00b16.5 and 70.3\u00b136, fold change vs UI, n=8, P<0.007). There was significant up-regulation of cardiac mac Arg1 and YM1 with MI in both WT and uPA null mice (n=4-9 per genotype and condition). Treatment with plasmin increased expression of Arg1 and YM1 in cultured cardiac macs. Histologic analysis revealed increased density of activated fibroblasts and M2 macs in SR-uPA hearts post-infarction with associated increases in fibrosis. Cardiac macs isolated from human hearts with ischemic heart disease expressed increased levels of the M2 marker CD206 in comparison to blood-derived macs (4.9\u00b11.3).\nCardiac macs in mouse and human hearts adopt a M2 phenotype in association with fibrosis. Plasmin can induce an M2 phenotype in cardiac macs. However, M2 activation can occur in the heart in vivo in the absence of uPA indicating that alternative pathways to activate plasmin are present in the heart.

To further characterize Cnm as a virulence factor, the cnm gene from S. mutans strain OMZ175 was expressed in the non-pathogenic Lactococcus lactis NZ9800 using a nisin-inducible system. Despite the absence of the machinery necessary for Cnm glycosylation, Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses demonstrated that Cnm was effectively expressed and translocated to the cell wall of L. lactis. Similar to S. mutans, expression of Cnm in L. lactis enabled robust binding to collagen and laminin, invasion of human coronary artery endothelial cells and increased virulence in G. mellonella. Using an ex vivo human heart tissue colonization model, we showed that Cnm-positive strains of either S. mutans or L. lactis outcompete their Cnm-negative counterparts for tissue colonization. Finally, Cnm expression facilitated L. lactis adhesion and colonization in a rabbit model of infective endocarditis.

RHD is a leading cause of mortality in the developing world. The strong epidemiological association between GAS throat infection and ARF is highly suggestive of causation, but does not exclude other infections as contributory. There is good evidence of both humoral and cellular autoreactivity and GAS/self cross-reactivity in established RHD. RHD pathogenesis could feasibly be triggered and driven by humoral and/or cellular molecular cross-reactivity between GAS and host cardiac tissues (molecular mimicry). However, good evidence of humoral pathogenicity is lacking and the specific triggering event for RHD remains unknown. It is likely that the critical immunological events leading to ARF/RHD occur at the point of contact between GAS and the immune system in the throat, strongly implicating the mucosal immune system in RHD pathogenesis. Additionally, there is circumstantial evidence that continued live GAS may play a role in ARF/RHD pathogenesis. We suggest that future avenues for study should include the exclusion of GAS components directly contributing to RHD pathogenesis; large genome-wide association studies of patients with RHD looking for candidate genes involved in RHD pathogenesis; genome-wide association studies of GAS from patients with ARF taken at diagnosis to look for characteristics of rheumatogenic strains; and performing case/control studies of GAS pharyngitis/ARF/patients with RHD, and controls to identify microbiological, immunological and environmental differences to elucidate RHD pathogenesis.", "journal": "Heart (British Cardiac Society)", "date": "2016-06-05", "authors": ["Philip DavidBright", "Bongani MMayosi", "William JohnMartin"], "doi": "10.1136/heartjnl-2015-309188"}

In addition, therapeutic angiogenesis depends on stimulating host angiogenesis with paracrine factors released by transplanted cells rather than on direct blood vessel formation by transplanted cells. In the present study, to overcome these limitations and to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of MI treatment, combinatorial therapy with three-dimensional cell masses (3DCMs) and self-assembling peptides (SAPs) was tested in a rat MI model. Spheroid-type 3DCMs, which are vascular differentiation-induced cells, were prepared by culturing human adipose-derived stromal cells on a fibroblast growth factor-immobilized surface. The SAPs were used as the carrier material to increase engraftment of transplanted cells. After coronary artery ligation, 3DCMs were combined with SAPs and were transplanted into ischaemic lesions. The therapeutic potential was evaluated 4\u00a0weeks after treatment. By combining 3DCMs and SAPs, survival and retention of transplanted cells increased threefold when compared with treatment with 3DCMs alone and transplanted cells established vascular networks in infarcted hearts. In addition, the size of the infarct in the 3DCM\u00a0+\u00a0SAP group was reduced to 6.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.83% by the promotion of host angiogenesis and cardiac function was preserved, as demonstrated by a 54.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.42% increase in the ejection fraction.

Cardiomyocytes show stronger contractility and faster spontaneous beating rate on rGO-GelMA hydrogel sheets compared to those on pristine GelMA hydrogels, as well as GO-GelMA hydrogel sheets with similar mechanical property and particle concentration. Our strategy of integrating rGO within a biocompatible hydrogel is expected to be broadly applicable for future biomaterial designs to improve tissue engineering outcomes.

We sought to identify specific markers of MR signaling in isolated tissue macrophages (cardiac, aortic) vs splenic mononuclear cells from wild-type and myeloid MR-null mice given vehicle/salt or deoxycorticosterone (DOC)/salt for 8 weeks. Cardiac tissue fibrosis in response to 8 weeks of DOC/salt treatment was found in the hearts from wild-type but not myeloid MR-null mice.

Differential expression of immunomodulatory M2-like markers (eg, arginase-1, macrophage scavenger receptor 1) was dependent on the tissue location of wild-type and MR-null macrophages. Finally, intact MR signaling is required for the phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase in response to a proinflammatory stimulus in bone marrow monocytes/macrophages in culture.

We investigate the impact of the conjugation of doxorubicin (DOX) to carboxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM) through a bond that allows for intracellular-triggered release, and the effect of pulmonary delivery of the dendrimer-DOX conjugate in decreasing tumor burden in a lung metastasis model. The results show a dramatic increase in efficacy of DOX treatment of the melanoma (B16-F10) lung metastasis mouse model upon pulmonary administration of the drug, as indicated by decreased tumor burden (lung weight) and increased survival rates of the animals (male C57BL/6) when compared to iv delivery. Conjugation of DOX further increased the therapeutic efficacy upon lung delivery as indicated by the smaller number of nodules observed in the lungs when compared to free DOX. These results are in agreement with the biodistribution characteristics of the DOX upon pulmonary delivery, which showed a longer lung accumulation/retention compared to iv administration. The distribution of DOX to the heart tissue is also significantly decreased upon pulmonary administration, and further decreased upon conjugation. The results show, therefore, that pulmonary administration of DOX combined to conjugation to PAMAM dendrimer through an intracellular labile bond is a potential strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and decrease systemic toxicity of DOX.", "journal": "Molecular pharmaceutics", "date": "2016-06-03", "authors": ["QianZhong", "Elizabeth RBielski", "Leonan SRodrigues", "Matthew RBrown", "Joshua JReineke", "Sandro R Pda Rocha"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00126\n10.3389/fchem.2014.00108"}
{"title": "Cardiac Morphology and Function, and Blood Gas Transport in Aquaporin-1 Knockout Mice.", "abstract": "We have studied cardiac and respiratory functions of aquaporin-1-deficient mice by the Pressure-Volume-loop technique and by blood gas analysis. In addition, the morphological properties of the animals' hearts were analyzed. In anesthesia under maximal dobutamine stimulation, the mice exhibit a moderately elevated heart rate of < 600 min(-1) and an O2 consumption of ~0.6 ml/min/g, which is about twice the basal rate. In this state, which is similar to the resting state of the conscious animal, all cardiac functions including stroke volume and cardiac output exhibited resting values and were identical between deficient and wildtype animals. Likewise, pulmonary and peripheral exchange of O2 and CO2 were normal. In contrast, several morphological parameters of the heart tissue of deficient mice were altered: (1) left ventricular wall thickness was reduced by 12%, (2) left ventricular mass, normalized to tibia length, was reduced by 10-20%, (3) cardiac muscle fiber cross sectional area was decreased by 17%, and (4) capillary density was diminished by 10%. As the P-V-loop technique yielded normal end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes, the deficient hearts are characterized by thin ventricular walls in combination with normal intraventricular volumes. The aquaporin-1-deficient heart thus seems to be at a disadvantage compared to the wild-type heart by a reduced left-ventricular wall thickness and an increased diffusion distance between blood capillaries and muscle mitochondria. While under the present quasi-resting conditions these morphological alterations have no consequences for cardiac function, we expect that the deficient hearts will show a reduced maximal cardiac output.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2016-06-03", "authors": ["SamerAl-Samir", "YongWang", "Joachim DMeissner", "GerolfGros", "VolkerEndeward"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2016.00181\n10.1111/febs.12653\n10.1113/expphysiol.2010.055244\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00382\n10.1096/fj.07-9097com\n10.1096/fj.04-3300com\n10.1096/fj.13-245621\n10.1152/ajprenal.00353.2006\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000223652.29338.77\n10.1006/geno.2002.6754\n10.1002/hep.23628\n10.1152/ajpregu.00406.2001\n10.1016/j.mvr.2007.12.003\n10.1056/NEJM200107193450304\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.989665\n10.1016/1056-8719(93)90019-B\n10.1074/jbc.273.8.4296\n10.1007/s00424-013-1325-x\n10.1073/pnas.0813231106\n10.1172/JCI119776\n10.1007/s00109-012-0977-x\n10.1073/pnas.90.15.7275\n10.1007/s10549-009-0370-9\n10.1007/s00424-007-0357-5\n10.1126/science.256.5055.385\n10.1007/s00380-009-1179-5\n10.1007/s00395-013-0393-6\n10.1038/nature03460\n10.1073/pnas.95.16.9660\n10.1073/pnas.0912924107\n10.1139/y67-063\n10.1042/cs1030567\n10.1172/JCI32024\n10.1016/j.resp.2007.02.012\n10.1017/s1462399408000690\n10.1016/j.jsb.2006.11.008\n10.1074/jbc.275.4.2686\n10.1111/j.1525-1438.2006.00476.x\n10.1111/j.1478-3231.2011.02610.x\n10.1111/micc.12248\n10.1210/jc.2012-4081"}

While advances in surgical technique and medical management have allowed survival into adulthood, HLHS patients have severe morbidities, decreased quality of life, and a shortened lifespan. The single right ventricle (RV) is especially prone to early failure because of its vulnerability to chronic pressure overload, a mode of failure distinct from ischemic cardiomyopathy encountered in acquired heart disease. As these patients enter early adulthood, an emerging epidemic of RV failure has become evident. Regenerative medicine strategies may help preserve or boost RV function in children and adults with HLHS by promoting angiogenesis and mitigating oxidative stress. Rescuing a RV in decompensated failure may also require the creation of new, functional myocardium.

Cardiac cell sheets obtained from NCF or ACF co-culture showed numerous uniformly distributed and functional (beating) cardiomyocytes, while cell sheets obtained by co-culture with ADFs showed fewer and aggregated cardiomyocytes. The greater number of cardiomyocytes in the presence of NCFs was because of enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation, as revealed by protein markers of mitosis and BrdU incorporation. Microarray analysis revealed that NCFs expressed substantially higher levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) than ADFs. Treatment of ESC-derived cardiomyocytes in monoculture with soluble VCAM-1 significantly increased the number of functional cardiomyocytes, while the enhancement of cardiomyocyte number by co-culture with NCFs was abolished by anti-VCAM-1 antibodies.\nCardiac fibroblasts enhance the proliferation of ESC-derived cardiomyocytes through VCAM-1 signaling, leading to an increase in functional myocardial cells in bioengineered tissue sheets.

Theileriosis involves different organs in ruminants, but the effect of the disease on the cardiovascular system is unclear. To understand the pathogenesis of T. lestoquardi on the cardiovascular system, Baluchi breed sheep were infected with the mentioned parasite by releasing unfed adults of Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum, which were infected with T. lestoquardi. The infected sheep were clinically examined on days 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, and 21, and the blood samples were collected for biochemical parameters measurement. At termination of the experiment, the infected sheep were euthanized and pathological examinations of heart tissue were conducted. During experimental infection of sheep with T. lestoquardi, activities of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase, were significantly increased (P\u02c20.05), while a conspicuous decrease (P\u02c20.05) was observed in creatine phosphokinase activities. Alterations made in biochemical factors almost coincided with the presence of piroplasm in the blood and schizont in lymph nodes. Maximum and minimum of parasitemia in the sheep stood between 3.3% and 0.28%, respectively. In addition, electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, sino-atrial block and ST-elevation, atrial premature beat, and alteration in QRS and in T waves' amplitude. Heart histopathological examination showed hyperemia, infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells into interstitial tissue, endocarditis, and focal necrosis of cardiac muscle cells. In addition, in one of the sheep, definite occurrence of infarction was observed.

To elucidate which kinases that are involved in the basal (diastolic phase) RLC phosphorylation, we studied non-contracting adult rat cardiomyocytes. RLC kinase activities in situ were unmasked by maximally inhibiting myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) by calyculin A in the absence and presence of various protein kinase inhibitors. Surprisingly MLCK did not contribute to the phosphorylation of RLC in the non-contracting cardiomyocytes. Two kinase activity groups were revealed by different sensitivities to staurosporine. The fraction with the highest sensitivity to staurosporine was inhibited by KN-93, a selective CaMKII inhibitor, producing a 23%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07% reduction in RLC phosphorylation. Calmodulin antagonism (W7) and reduction in Ca(2+) (EGTA) combined with low concentration of staurosporine caused a larger decrease in RLC phosphorylation than staurosporine alone. These data strongly suggest that in addition to CaMKII, there is another Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase and a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-independent kinase phosphorylating RLC.

Timely repression of inflammatory response are critical to prevent and minimize cardiac tissue injuries, nonetheless, progression in this aspect remains challenging.

Using label-free quantitative proteomics approach, we compared the protein cargo of plasma EVs between patients with MI and from patients with stable angina (NMI). We report, for the first time, the proteomics profiling on 252 EV proteins that were modulated with >1.2-fold after MI.

{"title": "Antifibrotic therapies to control cardiac fibrosis.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis occurs naturally after myocardial infarction. While the initially formed fibrotic tissue prevents the infarcted heart tissue from rupture, the progression of cardiac fibrosis continuously expands the size of fibrotic tissue and causes cardiac function decrease. Cardiac fibrosis eventually evolves the infarcted hearts into heart failure. Inhibiting cardiac fibrosis from progressing is critical to prevent heart failure. However, there is no efficient therapeutic approach currently available. Myofibroblasts are primarily responsible for cardiac fibrosis.

We used propranolol (a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker) to compare the results. Rats were given intraperitoneal injections of histidine (40 mg kg(-1)) and vitamin C (40 mg kg(-1)) alone and combined daily for 21 days. Propranolol (10 mg kg(-1)) was orally administered daily for 10 days (from day 11 to day 21). Myocardial infarction was induced by subcutaneous injections of 150 mg kg(-1) of isoproterenol at an interval of 24 hr on days 20 and 21. Blood and tissue samples were taken for histopathological and biochemical evaluations following electrocardiography recording on day 21. Isoproterenol elevated ST segment, increased heart weight, heart rate, serum activities of aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase-MB and heart tissue content of malondialdehyde, and decreased R wave amplitude and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities of heart tissue. Necrosis, edema and inflammatory cells infiltration were observed in myocardial tissue sections. Our results indicated that histidine and vitamin C alone, and especially in combination prevent isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity and have similar protective effects with propranolol.

In this study, the beneficial effects of 17-DMAG on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced MODS and DIC was evaluated in anesthetized rats. 17-DMAG (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was significantly increased survival rate, and prevented hypotension in LPS (30 mg/kg i.v. infused for 4 h) induced endotoxemia. The elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in LPS-exposed rat plasma were significantly reduced by 17-DMAG. Moreover, 17-DMAG suppressed LPS-induced superoxide anion production and caspase 3 activation in heart tissues. LPS induced the prolongation of prothrombin time, and a pronounced decrease in platelet count, which were improved by 17-DMAG. 17-DMAG markedly induced HSP70 and heme oxygenase (HO)-1, and suppressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65 protein expression in organs 6 h after LPS initiation. Pretreatment with high dose of quercetin (300 mg/kg, i.p.), as an HSP70 inhibitor, reversed the beneficial effects of 17-DMAG on survival rate, plasma levels of ALT, CPK, creatinine, IL-6, and NO metabolites, iNOS induction, and caspase-3 activation in LPS-treated rats. In conclusion, 17-DMAG possesses the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that were proved through LPS-induced acute inflammation, which is associated with induction of HSP70 and HO-1, leading to prevent MODS in sepsis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-05-26", "authors": ["Yi-LiWang", "Hsin-HsuehShen", "Pao-YunCheng", "Yen-JuChu", "Hwong-RuHwang", "Kwok-KeungLam", "Yen-MeiLee"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0155583\n10.1007/s00018-014-1762-5\n10.1101/cshperspect.a004390\n10.4049/jimmunol.1003652\n10.1007/s12192-011-0288-0\n10.1038/nrc2887\n10.1002/hep.24802\n10.1093/cvr/cvq046\n10.1152/ajprenal.00361.2007\n10.1016/j.thromres.2011.01.017\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.044\n10.1016/j.jep.2011.03.009\n10.1016/j.jep.2014.12.062\n10.1007/s00011-012-0442-x\n10.1186/2045-3701-1-21\n10.1667/RR1585.1\n10.1007/978-3-642-38007-5_11\n10.1093/cvr/cvs158\n10.1038/srep12958\n10.1152/ajpcell.00493.2010\n10.1096/fj.10-180554"}

Texas also harbors enzootic transmission cycles of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi , agent of Chagas disease. Given previous evidence that swine can serve as reservoirs of T. cruzi in Latin America and new evidence of triatomines (kissing bugs) feeding on swine in Texas, we measured the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in feral swine in Texas. From 2013 to 2014, we sampled blood and/or cardiac tissue from 78 feral swine across 14 Texas counties (seven with and seven without prior documentation of kissing bug occurrence) and used PCR and histopathology to detect T. cruzi infection. We determined an overall infection prevalence of 6% (3 of 54) based on PCR evaluation of cardiac tissue, and no blood samples were positive (n=72). All three positive pigs were from counties where kissing bugs are documented. No T. cruzi amastigotes were noted on histopathology (n=54). Sarcocysts were observed in 10 (18%) of the samples, five of which also had mild focal areas of degeneration and inflammatory cell infiltration.

{"title": "The heart as an extravascular target of endothelin-1 in particulate matter-induced cardiac dysfunction.", "abstract": "Exposure to particulate matter air pollution has been causally linked to cardiovascular disease in humans. Several broad and overlapping hypotheses describing the biological mechanisms by which particulate matter exposure leads to cardiovascular disease have been explored, although linkage with specific factors or genes remains limited. These hypotheses may or may not also lead to particulate matter-induced cardiac dysfunction. Evidence pointing to autocrine/paracrine signaling systems as modulators of cardiac dysfunction has increased interest in the emerging role of endothelins as mediators of cardiac function following particulate matter exposure. Endothelin-1, a well-described small peptide expressed in the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, is best known for its ability to constrict blood vessels, although it can also induce extravascular effects. Research on the role of endothelins in the context of air pollution has largely focused on vascular effects, with limited investigation of responses resulting from the direct effects of endothelins on cardiac tissue. This represents a significant knowledge gap in air pollution health effects research, given the abundance of endothelin receptors found on cardiac tissue and the ability of endothelin-1 to modulate cardiac contractility, heart rate, and rhythm. The plausibility of endothelin-1 as a mediator of particulate matter-induced cardiac dysfunction is further supported by the therapeutic utility of certain endothelin receptor antagonists. The present review examines the possibility that endothelin-1 release caused by exposure to PM directly modulates extravascular effects on the heart, deleteriously altering cardiac function.", "journal": "Pharmacology & therapeutics", "date": "2016-05-26", "authors": ["Elizabeth A WChan", "BarbaraBuckley", "Aimen KFarraj", "Leslie CThompson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.05.006"}
{"title": "Hydrogen sulfide exhibits cardioprotective effects by decreasing endoplasmic reticulum stress in a diabetic cardiomyopathy rat model.", "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is critical in the occurrence and development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been found to be the third gaseous signaling molecule with anti\u2011ER stress effects. Previous studies have shown that H2S acts as a potent inhibitor of fibrosis in the heart of diabetic rats. This study aimed to demonstrate whether H2S exhibits protective effects on the myocardium of streptozotocin (STZ)\u2011induced diabetic rats by suppressing ER stress. In this study, diabetic models were established by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 40\u00a0mg/kg STZ. The STZ\u2011treated mice were divided into three groups, and subsequently treated with normal saline, 30\u00a0\u00b5mol/kg or 100\u00a0\u00b5mol/kg\u00a0NaHS, i.p., respectively, for 8\u00a0weeks. The extent of myocyte hypertrophy was measured using hematoxylin and eosin\u2011stained sections and collagen components were investigated using immunostaining. The expression of glucose-regulated protein (Grp78), C/EBP\u2011homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase\u201112 in the heart tissue of each group was detected by western blot analysis. It was demonstrated that H2S could improve myocardial hypertrophy and myocardial collagen deposition in diabetic rats. In addition, it could reduce the expression of Grp78, caspase-12 and CHOP.

{"title": "Effects of dexmedetomidine postconditioning on myocardial ischemia and the role of the PI3K/Akt-dependent signaling pathway in reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "The present study aimed to determine whether post-ischemic treatment with dexmedetomidine\u00a0(DEX) protected the heart against acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)\u2011induced injury in rats. The phosphatidylinositol\u20113 kinase/protein kinase\u00a0B(PI3K/Akt)\u2011dependent signaling pathway was also investigated. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n=64) were subjected to ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which produced ischemia for 25\u00a0min, followed by reperfusion. Following LAD ligation, rats were treated with DEX (5, 10 and 20\u00a0\u00b5g/kg) or underwent post\u2011ischemic conditioning, which included three cycles of ischemic insult. In order to determine the role of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, wortmannin (Wort), a PI3K inhibitor, was used to treat a group of rats that had also been treated with DEX (20\u00a0\u00b5g/kg). Post\u2011reperfusion, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac troponin\u00a0I (cTnI), creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK\u2011MB), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) serum levels were measured using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer. The protein expression levels of phosphorylated (p)\u2011Akt, Ser9\u2011p\u2011glycogen synthase kinase\u20113\u03b2 (p\u2011GSK\u20113\u03b2) and cleaved caspase\u20113 were detected in heart tissue by western blotting. The mRNA expression levels of B\u2011cell lymphoma\u00a02 (Bcl\u20112) and Bcl\u20112\u2011associated X protein (Bax) were detected using reverse transcription\u2011polymerase chain reaction. At the end of the experiment, the hearts were removed and perfused in an isolated perfusion heart apparatus with Evans blue (1%) in order to determine the non\u2011ischemic areas. The risk and infarct areas of the heart were not dyed. As expected, I/R induced myocardial infarction, as determined by the increased serum levels of cTnI, CK\u2011MB and MDA, and the decreased levels of SOD. Post\u2011ischemic treatment with DEX increased the expression levels of p\u2011Akt and p\u2011GSK\u20113\u03b2, whereas caspase\u20113 expression was reduced following DEX treatment compared with in the I/R group. Compared with the I/R group, the ratio of Bcl\u20112/Bax at the mRNA level was elevated in the DEX and ischemic post\u2011conditioning groups, whereas the expression levels of Bax were decreased. Conversely, the effects of DEX were attenuated by Wort. These results indicated that, similar to post\u2011ischemic conditioning, post\u2011ischemic treatment with DEX protects the heart against I/R via the PI3K/Akt\u2011dependent signaling pathway, possibly by activating GSK\u20113\u03b2.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2016-05-26", "authors": ["Xiang YangCheng", "Xiao YuGu", "QinGao", "Qiao FengZong", "Xiao HongLi", "YeZhang"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2016.5345\n10.1097/01.ana.0000211027.26550.24\n10.1097/00008506-200307000-00015\n10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.07.021\n10.2174/1381612043384402\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.197996\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2015.09.040\n10.1080/140174302317282366\n10.3109/13880209.2012.742116\n10.1177/0960327114564794\n10.1155/2015/518926\n10.1002/iub.51\n10.4161/cc.6.24.5115\n10.1002/prp2.45\n10.1016/j.jep.2011.03.015\n10.1016/j.taap.2015.08.007"}
{"title": "Advances in stem cell therapy for cardiovascular disease (Review).", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease constitutes the primary cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and represents a group of disorders associated with the loss of cardiac function. Despite considerable advances in the understanding of the pathologic mechanisms of the disease, the majority of the currently available therapies remain at best palliative, since the problem of cardiac tissue loss has not yet been addressed. Indeed, few therapeutic approaches offer direct tissue repair and regeneration, whereas the majority of treatment options aim to limit scar formation and adverse remodeling, while improving myocardial function. Of all the existing therapeutic approaches, the problem of cardiac tissue loss is addressed uniquely by heart transplantation. Nevertheless, alternative options, particularly stem cell therapy, has emerged as a novel and promising approach.

The fiber generated contractile force along the fiber direction due to the hiPS-CM alignment, and we were able to measure its contractile force accurately.

{"title": "Nutrition has a pervasive impact on cardiac microRNA expression in isogenic mice.", "abstract": "The complex interaction between obesity, Western-style diets, and cardiovascular disease is of increasing interest, with a growing number of children being born to obese parents with poor lifestyle choices. These offspring have themselves an increased susceptibility to obesity and subsequent cardiovascular disease in adult life, which may be 'programmed' by their intrauterine environment. Cardiac microRNAs (miRNAs) are affected by multiple disease states, and have also been shown to be capable of exerting a hormone-like control on whole body metabolism. Here we sought to determine the effect of prenatal exposure to maternal obesity and/or postnatal exposure to a Western diet on miRNA expression in the heart. Unbiased small RNA sequencing was carried out on cardiac tissue from young adult mice born to lean or obese mothers; offspring were weaned onto either a low-fat control diet or a high-fat Western-style diet. We found 8 cardiac miRNAs that were significantly altered in response to maternal obesity, but only when the offspring were challenged postnatally with the Western diet. In contrast, postnatal exposure to the diet alone induced significant changes to the expression of a much larger number of miRNAs (33 in offspring of lean and 46 in offspring of obese). Many of the affected miRNAs have previously been implicated in various cardiac pathologies. The pervasive cardiac miRNA changes induced by a Western diet suggest that an individual's lifestyle choices outweigh the impact of any programming effects by maternal obesity on miRNA-related cardiac health.", "journal": "Epigenetics", "date": "2016-05-25", "authors": ["EdwinaWing-Lun", "Sally AEaton", "Suzy S JHur", "AlastairAiken", "Paul EYoung", "Michael EBuckland", "Cheryl C YLi", "Jennifer ECropley", "Catherine MSuter"], "doi": "10.1080/15592294.2016.1190895\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60460-8\n10.1038/ijo.2015.178\n10.1136/bmj.315.7112.837\n10.1136/bmj.f4539\n10.1002/bdrb.20206\n10.1016/j.ajog.2013.05.023\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.00815.x\n10.1210/en.2014-1383\n10.1210/en.2012-1508\n10.1042/CS20130011\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.01.050\n10.4161/epi.24656\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018174\n10.1038/srep14925\n10.1093/cvr/cvu044\n10.1152/ajpheart.00063.2012\n10.1210/en.2014-1106\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.02.007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.182535\n10.1371/journal.pone.0053950\n10.1016/j.molmet.2014.01.007\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019481\n10.1126/science.1139089\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.813576\n10.1172/JCI36154\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000882\n10.1074/jbc.M112.442384\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.029\n10.1073/pnas.1207605109\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00050.2013\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616\n10.1371/journal.pone.0042390"}
{"title": "Metabolic Dysfunction in Heart Failure: Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Pathophysiologic Insights From Metabolomic Profiling.", "abstract": "Metabolic impairment is an intrinsic component of heart failure (HF) pathophysiology. Although initially conceived as a myocardial defect, metabolic dysfunction is now recognized as a systemic process with complex interplay between the myocardium and peripheral tissues and organs. Specifically, HF-associated metabolic dysfunction includes alterations in substrate utilization, insulin resistance, defects in energy production, and imbalanced anabolic-catabolic signaling leading to cachexia. Each of these metabolic abnormalities is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with HF; however, their detection and therapeutic management remains challenging. Given the difficulty in obtaining human cardiac tissue for research purposes, peripheral blood metabolomic profiling, a well-established approach for characterizing small-molecule metabolite intermediates from canonical biochemical pathways, may be a useful technology for dissecting biomarkers and mechanisms of metabolic impairment in HF. In this review, metabolic abnormalities in HF will be discussed with particular emphasis on the application of metabolomic profiling to detecting, risk stratifying, and identifying novel targets for metabolic therapy in this heterogeneous population.", "journal": "Current heart failure reports", "date": "2016-05-25", "authors": ["Wynn GHunter", "Jacob PKelly", "Robert WMcGarrah", "William EKraus", "Svati HShah"], "doi": "10.1007/s11897-016-0289-5\n10.1038/nm.2280\n10.1016/j.cmet.2009.02.002\n10.1038/pr.2013.1\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.109.852814\n10.1016/j.ahj.2012.02.005\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2013.10.036\n10.1373/clinchem.2011.169573\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.02.018\n10.1038/nmeth.3584\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1005553\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.114.000223\n10.1056/NEJMra063052\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.04.083\n10.7326/0003-4819-12-8-1233\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014420\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.302922\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.02.092\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfr173\n10.1007/s11897-015-0257-5\n10.1096/fj.14-255901\n10.1152/physrev.00006.2004\n10.1152/physrev.00015.2009\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.301863\n10.1016/j.jacc.2008.08.081\n10.1016/S0735-1097(97)00185-X\n10.1002/ehf2.12035\n10.1093/ehjci/jev061\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.02.093\n10.1002/ejhf.337\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.01.024\n10.2337/dc08-2075\n10.1007/s00125-009-1637-8\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.08.042\n10.1039/c3mb70227h\n10.1093/aje/kwt004\n10.1111/j.1365-2362.2010.02441.x\n10.1007/s11306-007-0063-5\n10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2010.11.010\n10.1080/152165400410182\n10.1371/journal.pone.0124844\n10.1186/s12967-015-0661-3\n10.3109/1354750X.2013.781222\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.12.033\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060737\n10.1371/journal.pone.0088102\n10.1177/0891988709358592\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.816116\n10.1161/01.CIR.85.5.1751\n10.1152/ajpendo.00602.2014\n10.1152/ajpendo.00656.2013\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.060368\n10.1007/s11306-011-0345-9\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.010637\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.07.979\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.03.043\n10.1016/j.jchf.2014.09.009\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.934059\n10.1159/000375288\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.03.060\n10.1038/msb.2009.11\n10.1038/nm.2307\n10.1172/JCI35111"}
{"title": "Chagas cardiomyopathy: The potential effect of benznidazole treatment on diastolic dysfunction and cardiac damage in dogs chronically infected with Trypanosoma cruzi.", "abstract": "Cardiac involvement represents the main cause of mortality among patients with Chagas disease, and the relevance of trypanocidal treatment to improving diastolic dysfunction is still doubtful. In the present study, we used a canine model infected with the benznidazole-sensitive Berenice-78 Trypanosoma cruzi strain to verify the efficacy of an etiologic treatment in reducing the parasite load and ameliorating cardiac muscle tissue damage and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in the chronic phase of the infection. The effect of the treatment on reducing the parasite load was monitored by blood PCR and blood culture assays, and the effect of the treatment on the outcome of heart tissue damage and on diastolic function was evaluated by histopathology and echo Doppler cardiogram. The benefit of the benznidazole-treatment in reducing the parasite burden was demonstrated by a marked decrease in positive blood culture and PCR assay results until 30days post-treatment. At this time, the PCR and blood culture assays yielded negative results for 82% of the treated animals, compared with only 36% of the untreated dogs. However, a progressive increase in the parasite load could be detected in the peripheral blood for one year post-treatment, as evidenced by a progressive increase in positive results for both the PCR and the blood culture assays at follow-up. The parasite load reduction induced by treatment was compatible with the lower degree of tissue damage among animals euthanized in the first month after treatment and with the increased cardiac damage after this period, reaching levels similar to those in untreated animals at the one-year follow-up. The two infected groups also presented similar, significantly smaller values for early tissue septal velocity (E' SIV) than the non-infected dogs did at this later time. Moreover, in the treated animals, an increase in the E/E' septal tissue filling pressure ratio was observed when compared with basal values as well as with values in non-infected dogs. These findings strongly suggest that the temporary reduction in the parasite load that was induced by benznidazole treatment was not able to prevent myocardial lesions and diastolic dysfunction for long after treatment.", "journal": "Acta tropica", "date": "2016-05-25", "authors": ["Fabiane MSantos", "Ana LMazzeti", "S\u00e9rgioCaldas", "Karolina RGon\u00e7alves", "Wanderson GLima", "Ros\u00e1lia MTorres", "Maria TerezinhaBahia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.05.007"}

To reach this aim, we engineered a new class of cardiac tissue precursor (CTP), specifically conceived in order to promote the synthesis and the assembly of a cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM). The CTPs were obtained by culturing a mixed cardiac cell population, composed of myocyte and non-myocyte cells, into porous gelatin microspheres in a dynamic bioreactor. By engineering the culture conditions, the CTP developed both beating properties and an endogenous immature cardiac ECM. By following a bottom-up approach, a macrotissue was fabricated by molding and packing the engineered tissue precursor in a maturation chamber. During the macrotissue formation, the tissue precursors acted as cardiac tissue depots by promoting the formation of an endogenous and interconnected cardiac network embedding the cells and the microbeads. The myocytes cell fraction pulled on ECM network and induced its compaction against the internal posts represented by the initial porous microbeads. This reciprocal interplay induced ECM consolidation without the use of external biophysical stimuli by leading to the formation of a beating and endogenous macrotissue. We have thus engineered a new class of cardiac micromodules and show its potential for the fabrication of endogenous cardiac tissue models useful for in vitro studies that involve the cardiac tissue remodeling.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-05-24", "authors": ["ATotaro", "FUrciuolo", "GImparato", "P ANetti"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/2/025014"}

Specific characteristics of biomaterials including electrical conductivity, mechanical robustness and structural integrity need to be further enhanced to promote the functionalities of cardiac cells. In this work, we fabricated UV-crosslinkable gold nanorod (GNR)-incorporated gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hybrid hydrogels with enhanced material and biological properties for cardiac tissue engineering. Embedded GNRs promoted electrical conductivity and mechanical stiffness of the hydrogel matrix. Cardiomyocytes seeded on GelMA-GNR hybrid hydrogels exhibited excellent cell retention, viability, and metabolic activity. The increased cell adhesion resulted in abundance of locally organized F-actin fibers, leading to the formation of an integrated tissue layer on the GNR-embedded hydrogels. Immunostained images of integrin \u03b2-1 confirmed improved cell-matrix interaction on the hybrid hydrogels. Notably, homogeneous distribution of cardiac specific markers (sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin and connexin 43), were observed on GelMA-GNR hydrogels as a function of GNRs concentration. Furthermore, the GelMA-GNR hybrids supported synchronous tissue-level beating of cardiomyocytes. Similar observations were also noted by, calcium transient assay that demonstrated the rhythmic contraction of the cardiomyocytes on GelMA-GNR hydrogels as compared to pure GelMA. Thus, the findings of this study clearly demonstrated that functional cardiac patches with superior electrical and mechanical properties can be developed using nanoengineered GelMA-GNR hybrid hydrogels.\nIn this work, we developed gold nanorod (GNR) incorporated gelatin-based hydrogels with suitable electrical conductivity and mechanical stiffness for engineering functional cardiac tissue constructs (e.g. cardiac patches).

NCLs result from mutations in at least 13 different genes. Canine versions of the NCLs can serve as important models in developing effective therapeutic interventions for these diseases. NCLs have been described in a number of dog breeds, including Chihuahuas. Studies were undertaken to further characterize the pathology of Chihuahua NCL and to verify its molecular genetic basis. Four unrelated client owned Chihuahuas from Japan, Italy and England that exhibited progressive neurological signs consistent with a diagnosis of NCL underwent neurological examinations. Brain and in some cases also retinal and heart tissues were examined postmortem for the presence of lysosomal storage bodies characteristic of NCL. The affected dogs exhibited massive accumulation of autofluorescent lysosomal storage bodies in the brain, retina and heart accompanied by brain atrophy and retinal degeneration. The dogs were screened for known canine NCL mutations previously reported in a variety of dog breeds. All 4 dogs were homozygous for the MFSD8 single base pair deletion (MFSD8:c.843delT) previously associated with NCL in a Chinese Crested dog and in 2 affected littermate Chihuahuas from Scotland. The dogs were all homozygous for the normal alleles at the other genetic loci known to cause different forms of canine NCL. The MFSD8:c.843delT mutation was not present in 57 Chihuahuas that were either clinically normal or suffered from unrelated diseases or in 1761 unaffected dogs representing 186 other breeds. Based on these data it is almost certain that the MFSD8:c.843delT mutation is the cause of NCL in Chihuahuas. Because the disorder occurred in widely separated geographic locations or in unrelated dogs from the same country, it is likely that the mutant allele is widespread among Chihuahuas. Genetic testing for this mutation in other Chihuahuas is therefore likely to identify intact dogs with the mutant allele that could be used to establish a research colony that could be used to test potential therapeutic interventions for the corresponding human disease.", "journal": "Molecular genetics and metabolism", "date": "2016-05-24", "authors": ["AkankshaAshwini", "AntonioD'Angelo", "OsamuYamato", "CristinaGiordano", "GiuliaCagnotti", "TomHarcourt-Brown", "TendaiMhlanga-Mutangadura", "JuyuanGuo", "Gary SJohnson", "Martin LKatz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ymgme.2016.05.008"}

In-vitro studies have suggested that lyso-globotriaosylceramide may have an important role in the generation of fibrosis. Imaging, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, may have a role in detection of early stages of the disease. Long-term outcomes for patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy are now being described with some suggestion that patients treated at earlier points in the disease course may have better outcomes.\nRecent advances in understanding pathology, disease processes and treatment effects may enable future rational targeting of treatment with improved outcomes.", "journal": "Current opinion in cardiology", "date": "2016-05-21", "authors": ["Derralynn AHughes"], "doi": "10.1097/HCO.0000000000000308"}

Tissue engineering strategies aim at developing efficient therapeutic approaches to overcome the current challenges in prolonging patients survival upon cardiac diseases. The integration of advanced biomaterials and stem cells has offered enormous promises for regeneration of damaged myocardium. Natural or synthetic biomaterials have been extensively used to deliver cells or bioactive molecules to the site of injury in heart. Additionally, nano-enabled approaches (e.g., nanomaterials, nanofeatured surfaces) have been instrumental in developing suitable scaffolding biomaterials and regulating stem cells microenvironment to achieve functional therapeutic outcomes. This review article explores tissue engineering strategies, which have emphasized on the use of nano-enabled approaches in combination with stem cells for regeneration and repair of injured myocardium upon myocardial infarction (MI). Primarily a wide range of biomaterials, along with different types of stem cells, which have utilized in cardiac tissue engineering will be presented.

{"title": "Deletion of LOX-1 Protects against Heart Failure Induced by Doxorubicin.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress is one of the major factors in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy. Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1) plays an important role to regulate cardiac remodeling and oxidative stress after ischemia-reperfusion. Therefore, we examined whether or not LOX-1 contributes to the pathogenesis of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of DOX into wild-type (WT) mice and LOX-1 knockout (KO) mice. Echocardiography and catheter-based hemodynamic assessment apparently revealed preserved left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening (FS) and cavity size of LOX-1 KO mice compared with those of WT mice after DOX administration. Less production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u00df) was observed in LOX-1 KO mice than WT mice after DOX administration. Western blotting analysis also showed lower activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in LOX-1 KO mice treated with DOX than WT mice treated with DOX. In fact, NF-\u03baB-dependent gene expressions of LOX-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were suppressed in LOX-1 KO mice treated with DOX compared with WT mice treated with DOX. Therefore, histological analyses showed attenuation of leukocyte infiltration and cardiac fibrosis in LOX-1 KO mice compared with WT mice. Meanwhile, extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK (ERK) inactivation and decreased expression of sarcomeric proteins and related transcription factor GATA-4 in WT mice treated with DOX administration were not seen in LOX-1 KO mice treated with DOX administration and WT and LOX-1 KO mice treated with vehicle. Decreased expression of sarcometric proteins resulted in smaller diameters of cardiomyocytes in WT mice than in LOX-1 KO mice after DOX treatment. The expression of LOX-1 in cardiomyocytes was much more abundant than that in endothelial cells, fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. Endothelial cells, fibroblasts and inflammatory cells treated with DOX showed no elevated LOX-1 expression compared with those treated with vehicle. However, cardiomyocytes treated with DOX showed much more expression of LOX-1 than those treated with vehicle. Immunohistochemistry study also showed that LOX-1 expression was strongly elevated in cardiomyocytes in the heart tissue of mice treated with DOX in vivo. We conclude that LOX-1 in cardiomyocytes plays the most important roles in the pathology of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.

Although c-kit-positive cells were rarely found, radiation exposure significantly induced apoptosis and DNA damage in the cells of the heart.

The proliferative activity of CSCs evaluated by Ki-67 expression was not significantly different between the groups. However, compared to the healthy control, CSCs expanded from irradiated mice showed significantly lower telomerase activity, more 53BP1 foci in the nuclei, lower expression of c-kit and higher expression of CD90. Furthermore, CSCs expanded from irradiated mice had significantly poorer potency in the production of insulin-like growth factor-1.

{"title": "Abundance and Significance of Iron, Zinc, Copper, and Calcium in the Hearts of Patients With Friedreich Ataxia.", "abstract": "Cardiomyopathy is a frequent cause of death in patients with Friedreich ataxia (FA), and a characteristic pathological feature is the focal accumulation of iron (Fe) in cardiomyocytes. This restricted localization of the metal contrasts with the diffuse cardiac Fe overload in hemochromatosis and transfusion siderosis. Nevertheless, heart Fe in FA contributes to cardiomyocyte necrosis, inflammation, and scarring as the disease progresses. A putative mechanism of cardiomyopathy in FA is Fe-mediated oxidative damage. Two other transition metals zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu), are diffusely distributed throughout normal hearts and the hearts of patients with FA. The myocardium in FA is also prone to deposits of calcium in the form of scattered concretions. In this study, heart tissues (left and right ventricular walls and ventricular septum) of 23 patients with genetically confirmed FA and 8 normal controls were obtained at autopsy and analyzed for Fe, Zn, Cu, and calcium. The principal assay methods were inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and plasma mass spectrometry. Total levels of Fe in bulk extracts were not significantly higher than normal, and the concentrations of Zn also remained in the normal range. Cu levels, however, were significantly lower in FA.

A 2D axial symmetric macro-scaled model of a squeeze pressure bioreactor chamber was used as starting point for generating time dependent pressure profiles. Subsequently the fluid movement generated by the pressure fields was coupled with a complete 3D micro-scaled model of a porous protein cryogel. Oxygen transport and consumption inside the scaffold was evaluated considering a homogeneous distribution of cardiomyocytes throughout the structure, as confirmed by preliminary cell culture experiments.

In this study, ten analogs of methyl- and ethyl-substituted SIH derivatives with modified hydrazide scaffolds were synthesized to further explore their structure-activity relationships. Their iron-chelation efficiencies, anti- or pro-oxidant potentials, abilities to induce protection against model oxidative injury on the H9c2 cell line derived from rat embryonic cardiac tissue, cytotoxicities on the same H9c2 cells and antiproliferative activities on MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma and HL-60 human promyelotic leukemia cell lines were evaluated. Compounds derived from lipophilic naphthyl and biphenyl hydrazides displayed highly selective antiproliferative activities against both MCF-7 and HL-60 cell lines, and they showed markedly improved stabilities in plasma compared to SIH. Of particular interest is a hydrazone prepared from 2-hydroxypropiophenone and pyridazin-4-carbohydrazide that showed a considerable antiproliferative effect and protected cardiomyoblasts against oxidative stress with a five-fold higher selectivity compared to the parent compound SIH.

Cardiac extracellular matrix is essential for implanted cells since it provides the cardiac microenvironment. In this study, we hypothesized high concentrations of cardiac nature protein (NP), namely elastin and collagen, in hybrid polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun nanofibrous sheets could be effective as cardiac-mimicking patch. Optimal ratio of elastin and collagen with PCL in electrospun sheets (80% NP/PCL) was selected based on cytocompatibility and mechanical characteristics. Bone-marrow (BM) c-kit(+) cells anchoring onto NP/PCL sheets exhibited increased proliferative capacity compared with those seeded on PCL in vitro. Moreover, we examined the improvement of cardiac function in MI mice by cell-seeded cardiac patch. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-labeled BM c-kit(+) cells were loaded on 80% NP/PCL sheets which was transplanted into MI mice. Both 80% NP/PCL and c-kit(+)-seeded 80% NP/PCL effectively improved cardiac function after 4 weeks of transplantation, with reduced infarction area and restricted LV remodeling. C-kit(+)-seeded 80% NP/PCL was even superior to the 80% NP/PCL alone and both superior to PCL. GFP(+) cells were identified both in the sheets and local infarcted area where transplanted cells underwent cardiac differentiation after 4 weeks.

Due to lack of available treatment methods to restore the cardiac function, various research strategies have come up to treat the ischemic myocardium. However these have met with limited success due to the complexity of the cardiac tissue, which exhibits a nanofibrous collagenous matrix with spatio-temporal localization of a combination of growth factors. To mimic the topographical and chemical cues of the natural cardiac tissue, we have fabricated a growth factor embedded nanofibrous scaffold through electrospinning.

The scaffold properties were specifically characterized in\u00a0vitro for cardio-compatibility.

The encapsulation and release of dual growth factors from the matrix were studied using XPS and ELISA. Bioactivity of the loaded growth factors towards proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (HUVECs) was evaluated through MTS and Boyden chamber assays respectively. The efficiency of growth factors on the nanofibrous matrix to activate signaling molecules was studied in HUVECs through gene expression analysis. Preclinical evaluation of the growth factor embedded nanofibrous patch in a rabbit acute myocardial infarction (AMI) model was studied and cardiac function assessment was made through ECG and echocardiography.

Male Wistar rats were administered isoproterenol subcutaneously (85 mg/kg, 7 days) to induce chronic heart failure and were then treated with natakalim or saline for 6 weeks. Their blood pressure, heart rates and cardiac functions were measured using an 8-channel physiological recorder. Sophisticated technologies such as histological analysis, ELISA, radioimmunoassay, immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and western blotting were employed for analysis. Natakalim (1, 3, 9 mg/kg/day, orally) or saline was administered for 6 weeks orally via a gastric tube to rats that had been injected with isoproterenol. Natakalim remarkably inhibited changes in left ventricular hemodynamic parameters and decreased the heart mass index, the left ventricular weight index, right ventricular weight index and lung weight index. Histological examination demonstrated no significant hypertrophy or fibrosis in the hearts of the natakalim-treated rats. Mechanistically, natakalim attenuates the elevation of plasma nitric oxide (NO) level and inducible NO synthase in cardiac tissue induced by isoproterenol. Additionally, natakalim inhibits the endothelin signaling system by decreasing both the content of endothelin-1 in the plasma and the protein levels of cardiac endothelin receptors A and B. Moreover, natakalim could augment the plasma prostacyclin concentration.

{"title": "Expression and function of toll-like receptor 4 and inflammasomes in cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts: IL-1\u03b2 synthesis, secretion, and degradation.", "abstract": "Cardiac inflammation can be produced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), from parasitic, bacterial or viral origin; or by danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), released from dead cells after cardiac tissue damage, for example by cardiac infarction. Both, PAMPS and DAMPS activate TLR4 on resident immune cells and heart tissue cells, triggering an inflammatory process necessary to begin the wound healing process. Cardiac fibroblasts (CF) are the most abundant cells in the heart and are critical to wound healing, along with cardiac myofibroblasts (CMF), which are differentiated from CF through a TGF-\u03b21-mediated process. While TLR4 and the inflammasome complex are known to play important roles in CF function, the effects of TGF-\u03b21 on TLR4 and inflammasome expression and activity remain unknown. To elucidate this important point, we evaluated the effect of TGF-\u03b21 on TLR4, and the inflammasome protein expression and activity through activation by LPS, mimicking a myocarditis condition by bacterial origin. We found that TGF-\u03b21 increased TLR4 expression in CF and that the process was mediated by the TGF\u03b2RI and p38 signaling pathways. In both CF and CMF, LPS triggered ERK1/2, PI3K-Akt, and p65-NF-\u03baB phosphorylation. All of these effects were blocked by TAK-242, a TLR4 signaling pathway inhibitor. LPS increased pro-IL-1\u03b2 levels, which were dependent on the ERK1/2, PI3K-Akt, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways, and levels were higher in CF than CMF. NLRP3 and ASC levels were similar in CF and CMF, while pro-caspase-1 levels and caspase-1 activity were higher in CMF. LPS+ATP treatment induced inflammasome complex assembly and activation, triggering the release of IL-1\u03b2 in both CMF and CF.

These advances are based on insights gained from investigating the regulation of cardiac morphogenesis and adaptation. Our lab continues to explore this approach, including changes in gene expression that occur in response to mechanical loading and tyrosine kinase inhibition, the incorporation of vascular fragments into ECTs, and the fabrication of porous implantable electrical sensors for in vitro conditioning and postimplantation testing. Significant challenges remain including optimizing ECT survival postimplantation and limited evidence of ECT functional coupling to the recipient myocardium. One clear focus of current research is the optimization and expansion of the cellular constituents, including CM, required for clinical-grade ECTs.

In the present study, we cloned the Chinese perch MSTN cDNA sequence and analyzed its expression patterns under various conditions. The MSTN full cDNA sequence was 3347 bp long, including an open-reading frame of 1131 bp, which encoded 376 amino acids. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the MSTN shared a highly conserved signal peptide, a TGF-\u03b2 functional peptide, a hydrolytic site (RARR), and nine conservative cysteine residues with other members of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analyses indicated that the MSTN had a close relationship with teleostean fish, but they are far separated from mammals. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the MSTN was strongly expressed in the skeletal muscle and heart tissues. Temporal expression analysis demonstrated that the MSTN gene was expressed in very low levels, from 20 to 90 dph (post-hatching development), and was at its highest level at 150 dph (P < 0.05). The fasting-re-feeding experiment showed that the expression of the MSTN gene was initially decreased in response to a single meal, after seven days of fasting, and subsequently increased significantly, and finally decreased back to its original level.

The application of either radio frequency (RF) or cryothermal ablations will alter the biomechanical properties of various cardiac tissues in a differential manner; in some cases, this may be attributable to increased incidences of cardiac tamponade, pulmonary vein stenosis, and/or atrial-esophageal fistula. Thus, a greater understanding of the underlying changes in tissue properties induced by ablative therapies will ultimately promote safer and more efficacious procedures. The effects of applied RF or cryothermal energies on the biomechanical properties of the pulmonary vein, left atrial, or right atrial samples ([Formula: see text]) were examined from fresh excised porcine ([Formula: see text]) and donated human tissue ([Formula: see text]). RF ablations were found to reduce the tensile strength of the porcine cardiac specimens ([Formula: see text]), and a similar trend was noted for human samples. Cryoablations did not have a significant impact on the tissue properties compared with the untreated tissue specimens. Locational and species differences were also observed in this experimental paradigm ([Formula: see text].

The present study is designed to investigate the H2S preconditioning effect specifically on the mitochondrial subpopulation, namely, interfibrillar (IFM) and subsarcolemmal (SSM) mitochondria.\nIsolated heart perfusion model with the method of Langendorff was used to induce reperfusion injury in rat hearts. The animals were randomly divided into five groups: normal, ischemia (ISC), reperfusion (IR), preconditioning (IPC), and H2S preconditioning (HIPC). All the groups, except normal and ischemia, were subjected to 30-min global ischemia followed by 60-min reperfusion with Krebs-Henseleit buffer.\nOur study results show that H2S at a dose of 20 \u03bcM significantly (P<.05) reduced the infarct size (59%) and the creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activity in cardiac tissue. DNA fragmentation as observed in ischemia reperfusion control was absent in case of H2S-preconditioned heart. On comparing the classical protection provided by IPC with H2S, a significant recovery was seen in the IFM fraction in case of HIPC, whereas the SSM could not recover as evidenced by better mitochondrial respiration rate and electron chain enzyme activities.

In the heart, improved characterisation on how this complexity influences acquired diffusion weighted signals is key to advancing our interpretation of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, as well as to propose novel biomarkers to further characterise myocardial microstructure. In this work, we propose stretched Mittag-Leffler signal decay models for the quantification of the anomalous decay observed in acquired diffusion weighted signals. Our results, analysed in ex vivo healthy, fixed rat ventricles, indicate that such a representation suffices to capture the anomalous signal decay observed in the myocardial syncytium. The subdiffusive order of signal decay is shown to encode independent information to that encapsulated by standard diffusion tensor metrics, and thus may provide additional information on tissue microstructure. Moreover, subdiffusion gradients are shown to be indicative of the total structural heterogeneity spanning the left ventricular wall, which includes progressive myolaminae branching and spatially varying densities of perimysial collagen, microvasculature and adipose tissue.

Several rodent-associated Bartonella species have been related to human diseases. Recently, Bartonella species was reported as the etiology of a human case in the country of Georgia (Caucasus). However, information on Bartonella in rodents in Georgia is absent. Rodent hearts were collected from Georgia to investigate the presence and diversity of Bartonella species. Bartonella bacteria were cultured from 37.2% (16/43) of rodents examined, while Bartonella DNA was detected in 41.2% (28/68) of rodents by polymerase chain reaction targeting citrate synthase (gltA) gene. Sequences of gltA showed that rodents in this region harbored multiple Bartonella strains, including Bartonella elizabethae, Bartonella tribocorum, Bartonella grahamii, and an unknown genogroup. The first three Bartonella species, known to be rat-associated and human cases linked, were commonly observed in wood mice (Apodemus [Sylvaemus] uralensis) (5/8 positive with B. elizabethae and B. tribocorum) and social voles (Microtus socialis) (4/6 positive with B. grahamii and B. elizabethae) in this study.

In the present work, tissue patches containing human microvessels that were either randomly oriented or aligned were placed acutely on rat hearts post-infarction and for each case it was determined whether rapid inosculation could occur and perfusion of the patch could be maintained for 6 days in an infarct environment. Patches containing self-assembled microvessels were formed by co-entrapment of human blood outgrowth endothelial cells and human pericytes in fibrin gel. Cell-induced gel contraction was mechanically-constrained resulting in samples with high densities of microvessels that were either randomly oriented (with 420\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0140 lumens/mm(2)) or uniaxially aligned (with 940\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0240\u00a0lumens/mm(2)) at the time of implantation.

Presently, the available treatments only mitigate the symptoms of CCC. To improve CCC prognosis, we interfered with the parasite load and unbalanced immune response using the trypanocidal drug benznidazole (Bz) and the immunoregulator pentoxifylline (PTX). C57BL/6 mice chronically infected with the Colombian strain of Trypanosoma cruzi and with signs of CCC were treated for 30 days with a suboptimal dose of Bz (25 mg/kg of body weight), PTX (20 mg/kg), or their combination (Bz plus PTX) and analyzed for electrocardiographic, histopathological, and immunological changes. Bz (76%) and Bz-plus-PTX (79%) therapies decreased parasite loads. Although the three therapies reduced myocarditis and fibrosis and ameliorated electrical alterations, only Bz plus PTX restored normal heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) intervals. Bz-plus-PTX-treated mice presented complementary effects of Bz and PTX, which reduced TNF expression (37%) in heart tissue and restored normal TNF receptor 1 expression on CD8(+) T cells, respectively. Bz (85%) and PTX (70%) therapies reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) in heart tissue, but only Bz (58%) reduced NO levels in serum.

Previous studies demonstrated that QL could prevent cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy in response to hypertensive or ischemic stress. However, little is known about whether QL could modulate cardiac hypertrophy in vitro, and (if so) whether it is through modulation of specific hypertrophy-related microRNA.\nThe primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated, cultured, and treated with phenylephrine (PE, 50 \u00b5mol/L, 48 h) to induce hypertrophy in vitro, in the presence or absence of pretreatment with QL (0.5 \u00b5g/ml, 48 h). The cell surface area was determined by immunofluorescent staining for \u03b1-actinin. The mRNA levels of hypertrophic markers including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) were assayed by qRT-PCRs. The protein synthesis of cardiomyocytes was determined by the protein/DNA ratio. The miR-199a-5p expression level was quantified in PE-treated cardiomyocytes and heart samples from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mouse model. MiR-199a-5p overexpression was used to determine its role in the anti-hypertrophic effect of QL on cardiomyocytes.\nPE induced obvious enlargement of cell surface in cardiomyocytes, paralleling with increased ANP, BNP, and MYH7 mRNA levels and elevated protein/DNA ratio. All these changes were reversed by the treatment with QL. Meanwhile, miR-199a-5p was increased in AMI mouse heart tissues. Of note, the increase of miR-199a-5p in PE-treated cardiomyocytes was reversed by the treatment with QL. Moreover, overexpression of miR-199a-5p abolished the anti-hypertrophic effect of QL on cardiomyocytes.\nQL prevents PE-induced cardiac hypertrophy. MiR-199a-5p is increased in cardiac hypertrophy, while reduced by treatment with QL. miR-199a-5p suppression is essential for the anti-hypertrophic effect of QL on cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2016-05-11", "authors": ["HaifengZhang", "ShanshanLi", "QiulianZhou", "QiSun", "ShutongShen", "YanliZhou", "YihuaBei", "XinliLi"], "doi": "10.1159/000443113"}

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether nobiletin exerts the therapeutic effect on streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) in mice. 80 experimental male C57BL mice were randomly assigned into four groups: sham\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle (VEH/SH), sham\u00a0+\u00a0nobiletin (NOB/SH), DCM\u00a0+\u00a0vehicle (VEH/DM), and DCM\u00a0+\u00a0nobiletin (NOB/DM). Nobiletin treatment ameliorated cardiac dysfunction in the DCM group, as shown by the result of echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements. Nobiletin treatment also blunted the mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase isoforms p67(phox), p22(phox), and p91(phox), and abated oxidative stress. Although administration of diabetic mice with nobiletin did not significantly effect the level of blood glucose, it decreased the TGF-\u03b21, CTGF, fibronectin, and collagen I\u03b1 expressions and blunted cardiac fibrosis. In addition, nobiletin inhibited the activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), P38, and NF-\u03baB in the cardiac tissue of diabetic mice.

Its elastomeric properties fell within the range of adult heart myocardium, but they could also be optimized for higher elasticity for weaker immature constructs. The polymer showed relatively stable degradation characteristics, both hydrolytically and in a cellular environment, suggesting maintenance of material properties as a scaffold support for potential tissue implants. When assessed for cell interaction, this polymer supported rat cardiac cell attachment in vitro as well as comparable acute in vivo host response when compared to poly(l-lactic acid) control.

Since in addition to DOX also suppression of proteasome activity is a rational therapeutic strategy for MM, we examined how small molecular compounds with clinically relevant proteasome subunit specificity affect DOX cytotoxicity. We found that during DOX-treatment, the activity of the \u03b25 standard proteasome subunit is crucial for limiting off-target cytotoxicity in primary cardiomyocytes. In contrast, we demonstrate that the \u03b25 equivalent LMP7 of the immunoproteasome represents a safe target for subunit-specific inhibitors in DOX-exposed cardiomyocytes. Neither inhibition of LMP7 in primary cardiomyocytes nor genetic ablation of LMP7 in heart tissue influenced the development of DOX cardiotoxicity. Our results indicate that as compared to compounds like carfilzomib, which target both the \u03b25 standard proteasome and the LMP7 immunoproteasome subunit, immunoproteasome-specific inhibitors with known anti-tumor capacity for MM cells might be advantageous for reducing cardiomyocyte death, when a combination therapy with DOX is envisaged.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2016-05-08", "authors": ["Eva-MargareteSpur", "NadineAlthof", "DorotaRespondek", "KarinKlingel", "ArndHeuser", "Hermen SOverkleeft", "AntjeVoigt"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tox.2016.04.010"}

This study expands upon our previous observations by examining whether dietary supplementation with Calanus oil could antagonize angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension and ventricular remodeling in mice given a high fat diet (HFD).\nC57BL/6J mice were initially subjected to 8 weeks of HFD with or without 2% (w/w) Calanus oil. Thereafter, animals within each group were randomized for the administration of either Ang II (1\u00b5g/kg/min) or saline for another two weeks, while still on the same dietary regimen.\nAng II caused a marked decline in body and organ weights in mice receiving non-supplemented HFD, a response which was clearly attenuated in mice receiving Calanus oil supplementation. Furthermore, Ang II-induced elevation in blood pressure was also attenuated in the Calanus oil-supplemented group. As expected, infusion of Ang II produced hypertrophy and up-regulation of marker genes (mRNA level) of both hypertrophy and fibrosis in cardiac muscle, but this response was unaffected by dietary Calanus oil. Fibrosis and inflammation were up-regulated also in the aorta following Ang II infusion. However, the inflammatory response was blocked by Calanus oil supplementation. A final, and unexpected, finding was that dietary intake of Calanus oil caused a robust increase in the level of O-GlcNAcylation in cardiac tissue.\nThese results suggest that dietary intake of oil from the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus could be a beneficial addition to conventional hypertension treatment. The compound attenuates inflammation and the severe metabolic stress caused by Ang II infusion.

While much insight has been gained from these studies, one important limitation associated with computational modeling arises when using in vivo images of the heart to generate the reference state of the model. An unloaded reference configuration is needed to accurately represent the deformation of the heart. However, it is rare for a beating heart to actually reach a zero-pressure state during the cardiac cycle. To overcome this, a computational technique was adapted to determine the unloaded configuration of an in vivo porcine left ventricle (LV). In the current study, in vivo measurements were acquired using magnetic resonance images (MRI) and synchronous pressure catheterization in the LV (N\u00a0=\u00a05). The overall goal was to quantify the effects of using early-diastolic filling as the reference configuration (common assumption used in modeling) versus using the unloaded reference configuration for predicting the in vivo properties of LV myocardium. This was accomplished by using optimization to minimize the difference between MRI measured and finite element predicted strains and cavity volumes. The results show that when using the unloaded reference configuration, the computational method predicts material properties for LV myocardium that are softer and less anisotropic than when using the early-diastolic filling reference configuration. This indicates that the choice of reference configuration could have a significant impact on capturing the realistic mechanical response of the heart.", "journal": "Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering", "date": "2016-05-07", "authors": ["AmirNikou", "Shauna MDorsey", "Jeremy RMcGarvey", "Joseph HGorman", "Jason ABurdick", "James JPilla", "Robert CGorman", "Jonathan FWenk"], "doi": "10.1080/10255842.2016.1183122"}

Consequently, LY294002 increased the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio compared with peptide treatment alone.\nThis report provides evidence that PI3K inhibitor LY294002 has potent effects against cardiac injury caused by EAM, suggesting that it has therapeutic value for the treatment of myocarditis.", "journal": "Current research in translational medicine", "date": "2016-05-04", "authors": ["H SLiu", "JZhang", "J-LGuo", "C YLin", "Z-WWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.retram.2016.01.012"}
{"title": "Deregulation of XBP1 expression contributes to myocardial vascular endothelial growth factor-A expression and angiogenesis during cardiac hypertrophy in\u00a0vivo.", "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been reported to be involved in many cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, myocardial ischemia, and hypertension that ultimately result in heart failure. XBP1 is a key ER stress signal transducer and an important pro-survival factor of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in mammalian cells. The aim of this study was to establish a role for XBP1 in the deregulation of pro-angiogenic factor VEGF expression and potential regulatory mechanisms in hypertrophic and failing heart. Western blots showed that myocardial XBP1s protein was significantly increased in both isoproterenol (ISO)-induced and pressure-overload-induced hypertrophic and failing heart compared to normal control. Furthermore, XBP1 silencing exacerbates ISO-induced cardiac dysfunction along with a reduction of myocardial capillary density and cardiac expression of pro-angiogenic factor VEGF-A in\u00a0vivo. Consistently, experiments in cultured cardiomyocytes H9c2 (2-1) cells showed that UPR-induced VEGF-A upregulation was determined by XBP1 expression level. Importantly, VEGF-A expression was increased in failing human heart tissue and blood samples and was correlated with the levels of XBP1. These results suggest that XBP1 regulates VEGF-mediated cardiac angiogenesis, which contributes to the progression of adaptive hypertrophy, and might provide novel targets for prevention and treatment of heart failure.", "journal": "Aging cell", "date": "2016-05-03", "authors": ["QuanluDuan", "LiNi", "PeihuaWang", "ChenChen", "LeiYang", "BenMa", "WeiGong", "ZhejunCai", "Ming-HuiZou", "Dao WenWang"], "doi": "10.1111/acel.12460"}
{"title": "Alterations in the cardiac proteome of the spontaneously hypertensive rat induced by transgenic expression of CD36.", "abstract": "Fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) plays an important role in fatty acid uptake by different cell types and may also participate in regulation of calcium homeostasis and eicosanoid production. CD36 deficiency or polymorphisms in the CD36 gene are linked to some physiological irregularities. It is known that the expression of FAT/CD36 is aberrant in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), one of the most widely studied rat strains in cardiovascular research. In this work, we compared the cardiac proteome of SHR and transgenic SHR-Cd36 rats, who carry a copy of the wild type CD36 gene. Protein expression profiling was based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and label-free LC/MS. These two complementary proteomic approaches allowed us to investigate proteome differences in the left and right heart ventricles of SHR and SHR-Cd36 rats. In total, we identified 26 differently expressed myocardial proteins, out of which 18 were found in the right ventricles and 8 in the left ventricles. Besides that, we determined a great number of proteins uniquely expressed either in the left or right ventricles. These data indicate a large qualitative disparity between the left and right ventricles. Genetic manipulations may affect different proteins in both heart ventricles. Biological significance: This is the first report revealing a relatively broad impact of transgenic expression of CD36 on the heart at the proteome level. Comparison of the protein profiles in both the left and right ventricles revealed differences in several proteins involved especially in energy metabolism. The observed downregulation of the respiratory chain enzymes in transgenic SHR-Cd36 rats may suggest a shift in regulation of energy metabolism due to expression of fatty acid translocase FAT/CD36.

There is a strong genetic component to many disease subtypes (e.g., cardiomyopathy) and we are just beginning to understand the relevant genetic factors. Several studies have related RNA splicing to cardiovascular disease and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an emerging player. circRNAs, which originate through back-splicing events from primary transcripts, are resistant to exonucleases and typically not polyadenylated. Initial functional studies show clear phenotypic outcomes for selected circRNAs. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive catalogue of RNase R-resistant circRNA species for the adult murine heart. This work combines state-of-the-art circle sequencing with our novel DCC software to explore the circRNA landscape of heart tissue. Overall, we identified 575 circRNA species that pass a beta-binomial test for enrichment (false discovery rate of 1%) in the exonuclease-treated sequencing sample. Several circRNAs can be directly attributed to host genes that have been previously described as associated with cardiovascular disease.

The powder form of SP has been widely used for hundreds of years to relieve \"He-Yi\" related myocardial ischemia independently or in a traditional Chinese medicine preparation.\nSP was extracted with 95% and 80% ethanol. Chemical profiling was performed using HPLC-DAD and IT-TOF-ESI-MS analyses. Myocardial ischemia was produced by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery to evaluate the anti-myocardial ischemia effect of SP. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into six groups (n=10 per group): a sham group, a model group, groups pretreated with SP at three dosages (20mg/kg, 40mg/kg, and 80mg/kg, intragastrically), and a positive control group (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA, 53mg/kg, intragastrically). Echocardiography was performed to determine heart function by measuring ejection fraction and fractional shortening. The levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in serum, and 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 and TXB2 both in plasma and in protein homogenate of myocardial tissue were also measured. The levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 in the heart tissue and their expressions in mouse myocardial tissue were determined using Western blot and an immunofluorescence assay, respectively. Inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition changes in the myocardial ischemic tissue were observed by pathological examination.\nIntragastric pretreatment with SP produced a dose-dependent increase in cardiac function. SP at 80mg/kg significantly improved the EF (p<0.001) and FS (p<0.01) compared with the model group, as well as the levels of serum CK-MB and LDH decreased obviously (p<0.001), approaching those in the sham group. Besides, an obvious reduction in inflammatory cells infiltration and collagen deposition in the infarcted myocardial tissue was shown in each SP treatment group. In addition, SP increased 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 and decreased TXB2 levels in the plasma, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in the protein homogenate from the myocardial tissues at the infarction edge, but keeping balance the ratio of 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 and TXB2, which is better than ASA in plasma. The mechanisms is associated with the downregulated expressions of COX-1 (p<0.05) and COX-2 (p<0.001).\nEthanol extract of SP has a protective effect against myocardial ischemia via down regulation of COX-1 and COX-2 expression and by adjusting the ischemia-induced imbalance between 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 and TXB2.

Here we have assessed the contribution of non-myocyte cells on the contractile function of co-cultured human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) in spheroid microtissue format. Microtissues were formed using a scaffold free 96-well cell suspension method from hESC-CM cultured alone (CM microtissues) or in combination with human primary cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts (CMEF microtissues). Contractility was characterized with fluorescence and video-based edge detection. CMEF microtissues displayed greater Ca(2+\u2009)transient amplitudes, enhanced spontaneous contraction rate and remarkably enhanced contractile function in response to both positive and negative inotropic drugs, suggesting a more mature contractile phenotype than CM microtissues. In addition, for several drugs the enhanced contractile response was not apparent when endothelial cell or fibroblasts from a non-cardiac tissue were used as the ancillary cells. Further evidence of maturity for CMEF microtissues was shown with increased expression of genes that encode proteins critical in cardiac Ca(2+\u2009)handling (S100A1), sarcomere assembly (telethonin/TCAP) and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor signalling.

Prolonged preservation of cardiac tissue in formalin prior to imaging has been seen many times in the DTI literature as it is considered orderly. Our objective is to define the effects of the prolonged cardiac tissue exposure to formalin on tissue microanatomical organization, as this is assessed by DTI parameters. DTI experiments were conducted on eight excised rodent hearts that were fixed by immersion in formalin. The samples were randomly divided into two equinumerous groups corresponding to shorter (\u223c2 weeks) and more prolonged (\u223c6-8 weeks) durations of tissue exposure to formalin prior to imaging. We found that when the duration of cardiac tissue exposure to formalin before imaging increased, water diffusion became less restricted, helix angle (HA) histograms flattened out and exhibited heavier tails (even though the classic HA transmural variation was preserved), and a significant loss of inter-voxel primary diffusion orientation integrity was introduced. The prolonged preservation of cardiac tissue in formalin profoundly affected its microstructural organization, as this was assessed by DTI parameters. The accurate interpretation of diffusivity profiles necessitates awareness of the pitfalls of prolonged cardiac tissue exposure duration to formalin. The acquired knowledge works to the advantage of a proper experimental design of DTI studies of fixed hearts.

Therefore, identification of the causative pathogen is crucial and currently based on blood cultures followed by characterization and susceptibility testing of the isolate. However, antibiotic treatment starting prior to blood sampling or IE caused by fastidious or intracellular microorganisms may cause negative culture results. Here we investigate the additional diagnostic value of broad-range PCR in combination with direct sequencing on resected heart tissue or swabs in patients with tissue or swab culture-negative IE in a routine clinical setting. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of broad-range PCR from diagnostic material in our patients were 33.3%, 76.9%, 90.9%, and 14.3%, respectively.

The velvet antler peptide sVAP32 is one of active components in VAs; based on structural study, the sVAP32 interacts with TGF-\u03b21 receptors and disrupts the TGF-\u03b21 pathway. We hypothesized that sVAP32 prevents cardiac fibrosis from pressure overload by blocking TGF-\u03b21 signaling. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or a sham operation. After one month, rats received either sVAP32 (15mg/kg/day) or vehicle for an additional one month. TAC surgery induced significant cardiac dysfunction, fibroblast activation and fibrosis; these effects were improved by treatment with sVAP32. In the heart tissue, TAC remarkably increased the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), reactive oxygen species levels, and the phosphorylation levels of Smad2/3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2). SVAP32 inhibited the increases in reactive oxygen species levels, CTGF expression and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and ERK1/2, but not TGF-\u03b21 expression. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, angiotensin II (Ang II) had similar effects compared to TAC surgery, such as increases in \u03b1-SMA-positive cardiac fibroblasts and collagen synthesis. SVAP32 eliminated these effects by disrupting TGF-\u03b21 binding to its receptors and blocking Ang II/TGF-\u03b21 downstream signaling.

Expression of tropomyosin has been shown to be modulated at both the transcription and the translational levels. Tropomyosins are known to make up some of the stress fibers of human epithelial cells and differences in their expression has been demonstrated in malignant breast epithelial cell lines compared to 'normal' breast cell lines. We have recently reported the expression of four novel TPM1 isoforms (TPM1\u03bb, TPM1\u00b5, TPM1\u03bd, and TPM1\u03be) from human malignant tumor breast cell lines that are not expressed in adult and fetal cardiac tissue. Also, we evaluated their expression in relation to the stress fiber formation. In this study, nine malignant breast epithelial cell lines and three 'normal' breast cell lines were examined for stress fiber formation and expression of tropomyosin\u00a02 (TPM2) isoform-specific RNAs and proteins. Stress fiber formation was assessed by immunofluorescence using Leica AF6000 Deconvolution microscope. Stress fiber formation was strong (++++) in the 'normal' cell lines and varied among the malignant cell lines (negative to +++). No new TPM2 gene RNA isoforms were identified, and TPM2\u03b2 was the most frequently expressed TPM2 RNA and protein isoform. Stress fiber formation positively correlated with TPM2\u03b2 RNA or protein expression at high, statistically significant degrees. Previously, we had shown that TPM1\u03b4 and TPM1\u03bb positively and inversely, respectively, correlated with stress fiber formation. The most powerful predictor of stress fiber formation was the combination of TPM2\u03b2 RNA, TPM1\u03b4 RNA, and the inverse of TPM1\u03bb RNA expression.

The most frequently mutated gene is MYBPC3, encoding cardiac myosin-binding protein-C (cMyBP-C). We compared the pathomechanisms of a truncating mutation (c.2373_2374insG) and a missense mutation (c.1591G>C) in MYBPC3 in engineered heart tissue (EHT). EHTs enable to study the direct effects of mutants without interference of secondary disease-related changes. EHTs were generated from Mybpc3-targeted knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mouse cardiac cells. MYBPC3 WT and mutants were expressed in KO EHTs via adeno-associated virus. KO EHTs displayed higher maximal force and sensitivity to external [Ca(2+)] than WT EHTs. Expression of WT-Mybpc3 at MOI-100 resulted in ~73% cMyBP-C level but did not prevent the KO phenotype, whereas MOI-300 resulted in \u226595% cMyBP-C level and prevented the KO phenotype. Expression of the truncating or missense mutation (MOI-300) or their combination with WT (MOI-150 each), mimicking the homozygous or heterozygous disease state, respectively, failed to restore force to WT level. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed correct incorporation of WT and missense, but not of truncated cMyBP-C in the sarcomere. In conclusion, this study provides evidence in KO EHTs that i) haploinsufficiency affects EHT contractile function if WT cMyBP-C protein levels are \u226473%, ii) missense or truncating mutations, but not WT do not fully restore the disease phenotype and have different pathogenic mechanisms, e.g. sarcomere poisoning for the missense mutation, iii) the direct impact of (newly identified) MYBPC3 gene variants can be evaluated.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2016-04-26", "authors": ["Paul J MWijnker", "Felix WFriedrich", "AlexanderDutsch", "SilkeReischmann", "AlexandraEder", "IngraMannhardt", "GiuliaMearini", "ThomasEschenhagen", "Jolandavan der Velden", "LucieCarrier"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.03.003"}

Recently, the profound negative effects of cancer cachexia on cardiac tissue draw much attention, which is likely to contribute to mortality in tumor-bearing animals. The mechanism of cardiac remodeling is not so clear and involved with a series of molecular alterations. In cancer cachexia model, progressive loss of left ventricular mass and decrease in myocardial function is observed and cardiac autonomic functions are altered. Levels of several emerging cardiovascular neurohormones are found elevating in patients with cancer, but it is still controversial whether the changes could reflect the heart injury accurately. The remedy for cardiac remodeling has been explored. It is showed that exercise can modulate signaling pathways activated by wasting cytokines and impact on the resulting outcomes on heart adaptation.

{"title": "Exposure to chronic alcohol accelerates development of wall stress and eccentric remodeling in rats with volume overload.", "abstract": "Chronic alcohol abuse is one of the leading causes of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in the United States. Volume overload (VO) also produces DCM characterized by left ventricular (LV) dilatation and reduced systolic and diastolic function, eventually progressing to congestive heart failure. For this study, we hypothesized that chronic alcohol exposure would exacerbate cardiac dysfunction and remodeling due to VO. Aortocaval fistula surgery was used to induce VO, and compensatory cardiac remodeling was allowed to progress for either 3days (acute) or 8weeks (chronic). Alcohol was administered via chronic intermittent ethanol vapor (EtOH) for 2weeks before the acute study and for the duration of the 8week chronic study. Temporal alterations in LV function were assessed by echocardiography. At the 8week end point, pressure-volume loop analysis was performed by LV catheterization and cardiac tissue collected. EtOH did not exacerbate LV dilatation (end-systolic and diastolic diameter) or systolic dysfunction (fractional shortening, ejection fraction) due to VO. The combined stress of EtOH and VO decreased the eccentric index (posterior wall thickness to end-diastolic diameter ratio), increased end-diastolic pressure (EDP), and elevated diastolic wall stress. VO also led to increases in posterior wall thickness, which was not observed in the VO+EtOH group, and wall thickness significantly correlated with LV BNP expression. VO alone led to increases in interstitial collagen staining (picrosirius red), which while not statistically significant, tended to be decreased by EtOH. VO increased LV collagen I protein expression, whereas in rats with VO+EtOH, LV collagen I was not elevated relative to Sham. The combination of VO and EtOH also led to increases in LV collagen III expression relative to Sham. Rats with VO+EtOH had significantly lower collagen I/III ratio than rats with VO alone. During the acute remodeling phase of VO (3days), VO significantly increased collagen III expression, whereas this effect was not observed in rats with VO+EtOH. In conclusion, chronic EtOH accelerates the development of elevated wall stress and promotes early eccentric remodeling in rats with VO. Our data indicate that these effects may be due to disruptions in compensatory hypertrophy and extracellular matrix remodeling in response to volume overload.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2016-04-25", "authors": ["Alan JMouton", "Van KNinh", "Elia CEl Hajj", "Milad CEl Hajj", "Nicholas WGilpin", "Jason DGardner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.04.010"}

We considered two electrode configurations: two parallel needles inserted into the myocardium (\"penetrating needles\" configuration) and one circular electrode each on epi- and endocardium, opposing each other (\"epi-endo\" configuration).\nFor thick tissues (10 mm) and moderate anisotropy ratio (a = 2), we find that the geometry of the ablated volume is almost unaffected by twisted anisotropy, i.e. it is approximately translationally symmetric from epi- to endocardium, for both electrode configurations. Higher anisotropy ratio (a = 10) leads to substantial variation in ablation width across the wall; these variations were more pronounced for the penetrating needle configuration than for the epi-endo configuration. For thinner tissues (4 mm, typical for human atria) and higher anisotropy ratio (a = 10), the epi-endo configuration yielded approximately translationally symmetric ablation volumes, while the penetrating electrodes configuration was much more sensitive to fiber twist.\nThese results suggest that the epi-endo configuration will be reliable for ablation of atrial fibrillation, independently of fiber orientation, while the penetrating electrode configuration may experience problems when the fiber orientation is not consistent across the atrial wall.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-04-23", "authors": ["FeiXie", "Christian WZemlin"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0152262\n10.1161/CIRCEP.114.001853\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.000629\n10.3978/j.issn.2225-319X.2014.01.03\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61463-9\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.06.016\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2008.01181.x\n10.3390/ijms160510834\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.03.013\n10.1532/HSF98.20061202\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2010.01863.x\n10.1161/CIRCEP.114.001607\n10.1371/journal.pone.0144833\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.09.017\n10.1161/01.RES.24.3.339\n10.1007/978-3-319-12664-7\n10.1002/ar.1091550403\n10.1186/1532-429X-13-74\n10.1109/TMI.2013.2240693\n10.1186/1475-925X-12-54\n10.1109/TMI.2012.2227776\n10.1093/europace/eut349\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00226-2\n10.1109/TBME.2010.2096425\n10.1073/pnas.1205923109\n10.1109/27.842875\n10.1152/ajpheart.01121.2011\n10.1111/j.1755-148X.2010.00704.x\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.02.181\n10.1002/ijc.24345\n10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091692"}

Model animal screens have identified several candidate signalling pathways, however, it remains unclear as to what extent these pathways can be exploited, either individually or in combination, in the human system. The advent of human cardiac cells from directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) now provides the ability to interrogate human cardiac biology in vitro, but it remains difficult with existing culture formats to simply and rapidly elucidate signalling pathway penetrance and interplay. To facilitate high-throughput combinatorial screening of candidate biologicals or factors driving relevant molecular pathways, we developed a high-density microbioreactor array (HDMA)--a microfluidic cell culture array containing 8100 culture chambers. We used HDMAs to combinatorially screen Wnt, Hedgehog, IGF and FGF pathway agonists. The Wnt activator CHIR99021 was identified as the most potent molecular inducer of human cardiomyocyte proliferation, inducing cell cycle activity marked by Ki67, and an increase in cardiomyocyte numbers compared to controls.

The goal of the present study was to assess the functional impact of these drugs on thyroxin-induced hemodynamic changes, cardiac hypertrophy and associated altered responses of the contractile myocardium both in-vivo at the whole heart level and ex-vivo at the cardiac tissue level. Control and thyroxin (500 \u03bcg/kg/day)-treated mice with or without 2-week treatments of sorafenib (10 mg/kg/day; I.P), tadalafil (1 mg/kg/day; I.P or 4 mg/kg/day; oral), macitentan (30 and 100 mg/kg/day; oral), and their vehicles were studied. Blood pressure, echocardiography and electrocardiogram were non-invasively evaluated, followed by ex-vivo assessments of isolated multicellular cardiac preparations. Thyroxin increased blood pressure, resulted in cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction in-vivo. Also, it caused contractile abnormalities in right ventricular papillary muscles ex-vivo. None of the drug treatments were able to significantly attenuate theses hemodynamic changes or cardiac abnormalities in thyroxin-treated mice.

{"title": "Emergent Global Contractile Force in Cardiac Tissues.", "abstract": "The heart is a complex organ whose structure and function are intricately linked at multiple length scales. Although several advancements have been achieved in the field of cardiac tissue engineering, current in\u00a0vitro cardiac tissues do not fully replicate the structure or function necessary for effective cardiac therapy and cardiotoxicity studies. This is partially due to a deficiency in current understandings of cardiac tissue organization's potential downstream effects, such as changes in gene expression levels. We developed a novel (to our knowledge) in\u00a0vitro tool that can be used to decouple and quantify the contribution of organization and associated downstream effects to tissue function. To do so, cardiac tissue monolayers were designed into a parquet pattern to be organized anisotropically on a local scale, within a parquet tile, and with any desired organization on a global scale. We hypothesized that if the downstream effects were muted, the relationship between developed force and tissue organization could be modeled as a sum of force vectors. With the in\u00a0vitro experimental platforms of parquet tissues and heart-on-a-chip devices, we were able to prove this hypothesis for both systolic and diastolic stresses. Thus, insight was gained into the relationship between the generated stress and global myofibril organization. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the developed quantitative tool could be used to estimate the changes in stress production due to downstream effects decoupled from tissue architecture. This has the potential to elucidate properties coupled to tissue architecture, which change force production and pumping function in the diseased heart or stem cell-derived tissues.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2016-04-14", "authors": ["Meghan BKnight", "Nancy KDrew", "Linda AMcCarthy", "AnnaGrosberg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2016.03.003"}

{"title": "Biomimetic Polymers for Cardiac Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Heart failure is a morbid disorder characterized by progressive cardiomyocyte (CM) dysfunction and death. Interest in cell-based therapies is growing, but sustainability of injected CMs remains a challenge. To mitigate this, we developed an injectable biomimetic Reverse Thermal Gel (RTG) specifically engineered to support long-term CM survival. This RTG biopolymer provided a solution-based delivery vehicle of CMs, which transitioned to a gel-based matrix shortly after reaching body temperature. In this study we tested the suitability of this biopolymer to sustain CM viability. The RTG was biomolecule-functionalized with poly-l-lysine or laminin. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) and adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM) were cultured in plain-RTG and biomolecule-functionalized-RTG both under 3-dimensional (3D) conditions. Traditional 2D biomolecule-coated dishes were used as controls. We found that the RTG-lysine stimulated NRVM to spread and form heart-like functional syncytia. Regarding cell contraction, in both RTG and RTG-lysine, beating cells were recorded after 21 days. Additionally, more than 50% (p value < 0.05; n = 5) viable ARVMs, characterized by a well-defined cardiac phenotype represented by sarcomeric cross-striations, were found in the RTG-laminin after 8 days.

Concentrations of reactive nitrogen species and reactive oxygen species in the heart tissue increased significantly while antioxidant enzymes level declined. The levels of tissue pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 were significantly increased after ISO administration. Pretreatment with baicalein significantly reversed these alterations induced by ISO administration. Exploration of the underlying mechanisms of protective effect of baicalein pretreatment revealed that it repressed the expression of nuclear factor kappa B and restored the ISO induced elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative and nitrosative stress. We found that baicalein pretreatment enhanced the level of antioxidant defense enzymes like SOD, catalase and GSH.

The results suggest that the sizes and zeta potentials of multifunctional gelatin/silica nanovectors were 203-217\u00a0nm and 2-8\u00a0mV, respectively. Functional GS-PEG nanoparticles mainly accumulated in the liver and tumor, with the lowest uptake by the heart and brain. Moreover, the synergistic effects of tumor-targeting aptamer AGRO100 and fusogenic peptide HA2 promoted the efficient cellular internalization in the tumor site. More importantly, the combined use of AGRO100 and PEG enhanced tumor gene expression specificity and effectively reduced toxicity in reticuloendothelial system (RES) organs after intravenous injection.

In 3D tissue engineered constructs, cell retention efficiency is dependent on the cell delivery method, and biomaterial properties. Passive cell delivery relies on cell migration to the scaffold surface; biomaterial surface properties and porosity determine cell infiltration capacity. As a result, cell retention efficiencies remain low. The development of an effective two-stage cell seeding technique, coupled with perfusion culture, provides the potential to improve cellularization efficiency, and retention. This study, uses a chitosan bioengineered open ventricle (BEOV) scaffold to produce a two-stage perfusion cultured ventricle (TPCV). TPCV were fabricated by direct injection of 10 million primary rat neonatal cardiac cells, followed by wrapping of the outer scaffold surface with a 3D fibrin gel artificial heart muscle patch; TPCV were perfusion cultured for 3 days.

In this study, histological structure, biochemical compositions and mechanical properties of the FDA-approved SIS-ECM biomaterial were retained following MSCs repopulation in vitro. Similarly, the cellular phenotypes and differentiation potential of MSCs were preserved following seeding on SIS-ECM. In a porcine in vivo patch study, the presence of porcine MSCs on SIS-ECM significantly reduced adaptive T cell response regardless of cell dose and orientation compared to SIS-ECM alone.

We observed significant upregulation of HMGB1, toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, nuclear factor (NF)\u03baB p65, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, cyclooxygenase (COX)2, interferon (IFN)\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and M1 like macrophage specific marker cluster of differentiation (CD)68 expressions in SAMP8 heart. In contrast, M2 macrophage specific marker CD36, and IL-10 expressions were down-regulated in SAMP8 mice. The results from the study demonstrated that, HMGB1-TLR2/TLR4 signaling cascade and induction of phenotypic switching to M1 macrophage polarization in SAMP8 mice heart would be one of the possible reasons behind the cardiac dysfunction and thus it could become an important therapeutic target to improve the age related cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-04-14", "authors": ["VengadeshprabhuKaruppagounder", "Vijayasree VGiridharan", "SomasundaramArumugam", "RemyaSreedhar", "Suresh SPalaniyandi", "PrasannaKrishnamurthy", "JoaoQuevedo", "KenichiWatanabe", "TetsuyaKonishi", "Rajarajan AThandavarayan"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0152922\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2011.04.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.246868\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e3182009701\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.09.013\n10.1093/cvr/cvn212\n10.1016/j.intimp.2015.05.050\n10.1016/j.intimp.2013.11.018\n10.1093/cvr/cvv128\n10.1016/j.intimp.2014.10.014\n10.1111/exd.12685\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2012.07.015\n10.1152/ajpheart.00407.2010\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.02.016\n10.1093/gerona/glr083\n10.1152/ajprenal.00580.2012\n10.1016/j.intimp.2015.01.003\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2005.02075.x\n10.1159/000338166\n10.1074/jbc.M103740200\n10.4049/jimmunol.0900390\n10.1111/exd.12685\n10.4049/jimmunol.0902660\n10.1111/jcmm.12399\n10.1007/s10456-008-9093-5\n10.1155/2013/206039\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.140723\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000112575.66565.84\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.769331\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1004011\n10.1089/ars.2010.3356\n10.1155/2014/270930\n10.1152/japplphysiol.90470.2008\n10.1097/MOL.0b013e32834a77b4\n10.1096/fj.09-148155\n10.1111/acel.12062"}

{"title": "Alterations in Multi-Scale Cardiac Architecture in Association With Phosphorylation of Myosin Binding Protein-C.", "abstract": "The geometric organization of myocytes in the ventricular wall comprises the structural underpinnings of cardiac mechanical function. Cardiac myosin binding protein-C (MYBPC3) is a sarcomeric protein, for which phosphorylation modulates myofilament binding, sarcomere morphology, and myocyte alignment in the ventricular wall. To elucidate the mechanisms by which MYBPC3 phospho-regulation affects cardiac tissue organization, we studied ventricular myoarchitecture using generalized Q-space imaging (GQI). GQI assessed geometric phenotype in excised hearts that had undergone transgenic (TG) modification of phospho-regulatory serine sites to nonphosphorylatable alanines (MYBPC3(AllP-/(t/t))) or phospho-mimetic aspartic acids (MYBPC3(AllP+/(t/t))).\nMyoarchitecture in the wild-type (MYBPC3(WT)) left-ventricle (LV) varied with transmural position, with helix angles ranging from -90/+90 degrees and contiguous circular orientation from the LV mid-myocardium to the right ventricle (RV). Whereas MYBPC3(AllP+/(t/t)) hearts were not architecturally distinct from MYBPC3(WT), MYBPC3(AllP-/(t/t)) hearts demonstrated a significant reduction in LV transmural helicity. Null MYBPC3((t/t)) hearts, as constituted by a truncated MYBPC3 protein, demonstrated global architectural disarray and loss in helicity. Electron microscopy was performed to correlate the observed macroscopic architectural changes with sarcomere ultrastructure and demonstrated that impaired phosphorylation of MYBPC3 resulted in modifications of the sarcomere aspect ratio and shear angle. The mechanical effect of helicity loss was assessed through a geometric model relating cardiac work to ejection fraction, confirming the mechanical impairments observed with echocardiography.\nWe conclude that phosphorylation of MYBPC3 contributes to the genesis of ventricular wall geometry, linking myofilament biology with multiscale cardiac mechanics and myoarchitecture.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2016-04-14", "authors": ["Erik NTaylor", "Matthew PHoffman", "David YBarefield", "George EAninwene", "Aurash DAbrishamchi", "Thomas LLynch", "SureshGovindan", "HannaOsinska", "JeffreyRobbins", "SakthivelSadayappan", "Richard JGilbert"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.115.002836"}
{"title": "Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) post-smolts challenged two or nine weeks after seawater-transfer show differences in their susceptibility to salmonid alphavirus subtype 3 (SAV3).", "abstract": "Pancreas disease (PD), caused by salmonid alphavirus (SAV), is an important disease affecting salmonid aquaculture. It has been speculated that Atlantic salmon post-smolts are more prone to infections in the first few weeks following seawater- transfer. After this period of seawater acclimatization, the post-smolts are more robust and better able to resist infection by pathogens. Here we describe how we established a bath immersion (BI) model for SAV subtype 3 (SAV3) in seawater. We also report how this challenge model was used to study the susceptibility of post-smolts to SAV3 infection in two groups of post-smolts two weeks or nine weeks after seawater - transfer.\nPost-smolts, two weeks (Phase-A) or nine weeks (Phase-B) after seawater- transfer, were infected with SAV3 by BI or intramuscular injection (IM) to evaluate their susceptibility to infection. A RT-qPCR assay targeting the non-structural protein (nsP1) gene was performed to detect SAV3-RNA in blood, heart tissue and electropositive-filtered tank-water. Histopathological changes were examined by light microscope, and the presence of SAV3 antigen in pancreas tissue was confirmed using immuno-histochemistry.\nVirus shedding from the Phase-B fish injected with SAV3 (IM Phase-B) was markedly lower than that from IM Phase-A fish. A lower percentage of viraemia in Phase-B fish compared with Phase-A fish was also observed. Viral RNA in hearts from IM Phase-A fish was higher than in IM Phase-B fish at all sampling points (p < 0.05) and a similar trend was also seen in the BI groups. Necrosis of exocrine pancreatic cells was observed in all infected groups. Extensive histopathological changes were found in Phase-A fish whereas milder PD-related histopathological lesions were seen in Phase-B fish. The presence of SAV3 in pancreas tissue from all infected groups was also confirmed by immuno-histochemical staining.\nOur results suggest that post-smolts are more susceptible to SAV3 infection two weeks after seawater-transfer than nine weeks after transfer.

{"title": "pH-Sensitive and Thermosensitive Hydrogels as Stem-Cell Carriers for Cardiac Therapy.", "abstract": "Stem-cell therapy has the potential to regenerate damaged heart tissue after a heart attack. Injectable hydrogels may be used as stem-cell carriers to improve cell retention in the heart tissue. However, current hydrogels are not ideal to serve as cell carriers because most of them block blood vessels after solidification. In addition, these hydrogels have a relatively slow gelation rate (typically >60 s), which does not allow them to quickly solidify upon injection, so as to efficiently hold cells in the heart tissue. As a result, the hydrogels and cells are squeezed out of the tissue, leading to low cell retention. To address these issues, we have developed hydrogels that can quickly solidify at the pH of an infarcted heart (6-7) at 37 \u00b0C but cannot solidify at the pH of blood (7.4) at 37 \u00b0C. These hydrogels are also clinically attractive because they can be injected through catheters commonly used for minimally invasive surgeries. The hydrogels were synthesized by free-radical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide, propylacrylic acid, hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-oligo(trimethylene carbonate), and methacrylate poly(ethylene oxide) methoxy ester. Hydrogel solutions were injectable through 0.2-mm-diameter catheters at pH 8.0 at 37 \u00b0C, and they can quickly form solid gels under pH 6.5 at 37 \u00b0C. All of the hydrogels showed pH-dependent degradation and mechanical properties with less mass loss and greater complex shear modulus at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.4. When cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) were encapsulated in the hydrogels, the cells were able to survive during a 7-day culture period. The surviving cells were differentiated into cardiac cells, as evidenced by the expression of cardiac markers at both the gene and protein levels, such as cardiac troponin T, myosin heavy chain \u03b1, calcium channel CACNA1c, cardiac troponin I, and connexin 43. The gel integrity was found to largely affect CDC cardiac differentiation.

{"title": "The H2S Donor NaHS Changes the Expression Pattern of H2S-Producing Enzymes after Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Aims. To examine the expression patterns of hydrogen sulphide- (H2S-) producing enzymes in ischaemic heart tissue and plasma levels of H2S after 2 weeks of NaHS treatment after myocardial infarction (MI) and to clarify the role of endogenous H2S in the MI process. Results. After MI surgery, 2 weeks of treatment with the H2S donor NaHS alleviated ischaemic injury. Meanwhile, in ischemia myocardium, three H2S-producing enzymes, cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) significantly increased. Plasma H2S levels were also elevated. In vitro, NaHS treatment protected cardiomyocytes from hypoxic injury and raised CBS levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Different from in vivo results, however, CSE or 3-MST expression did not change. NaHS treatment increased the activity of CSE/CBS but not of 3-MST. When CSE was either knocked down (in vitro) or knocked out (in vivo), H2S levels significantly decreased, which subsequently exacerbated the ischaemic injury. Meanwhile, the expressions of CBS and 3-MST increased due to compensation. Conclusions. Exogenous H2S treatment changed the expressions of three H2S-producing enzymes and H2S levels after MI, suggesting a new and indirect regulatory mechanism for H2S production and its contribution to cardiac protection.

The contribution of (micro)vascular injury to CRMS is considered to be substantial. However, mechanistic studies are hampered by lack of in vivo models that mimic the natural onset of the disease. Here, we evaluated the coronary and renal microvasculature during CRMS development in obese diabetic Zucker fatty/Spontaneously hypertensive heart failure F1 hybrid (ZSF1) rats.\nEchocardiographic, urine, and blood evaluations were conducted in 3 groups (Wistar-Kyoto, lean ZSF1, and obese ZSF1) at 20 and 25 weeks of age. Immunohistological evaluation of renal and cardiac tissues was conducted at both time points. At 20 and 25 weeks, obese ZSF1 rats showed higher body weight, significant left ventricular hypertrophy, and impaired diastolic function compared with all other groups. Indices of systolic function did not differ between groups. Obese ZSF1 rats developed hyperproliferative vascular foci in the subendocardium, which lacked microvascular organization and were predilection sites of inflammation and fibrosis. In the kidney, obese ZSF1 animals showed regression of the peritubular and glomerular microvasculature, accompanied by tubulointerstitial damage, glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria.\nThe obese ZSF1 rat strain is a suitable in vivo model for CRMS, sharing characteristics with the human syndrome during the earliest onset of disease. In these rats, CRMS induces microvascular fibrotic responses in heart and kidneys, associated with functional impairment of both organs.", "journal": "Circulation.

Drug combination may be a promising strategy for treating multi-factorial diseases. Titanium dioxide (TDN) nanoparticles are being widely used in many industries as well as in medicine and pharmacology. Therefore, increased human and environmental exposure can be expected, which has put TDN under toxicological scrutiny, and it is necessary to address the potential health and safety implications of nanomaterials used in nanomedicine. The toxicity of titanium oxide nanoparticles (TDN) and salicylic acid (SA) separately or in combination was studied for 21 days.\nThe liver and kidney biomarker were determined, and hormones and oxidative stress levels were detected in mice.\nThe intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of TDN and SA in combination had a potential toxicological effect on major organs and hormonal homeostasis of mice. TDN and SA could antagonistically interact to affect the liver and kidney functions. No synergistic damage was observed in the liver function of mice that were treated with both TDN and SA as compared to the SA group. TDN acted as a synergistic agent to SA in the case of total cholesterol and total proteins levels. SA acted as antagonistic to the effect of TDN when injected together in mice because the effect on kidney functions is less than that predicted on the basis of the additive. The effect of co-administration of SA and TDN on the following hormones; triiodothyronine, thyroxine, estradiol II and insulin various among additive, potentiation, antagonistic and no effect, respectively as compared to TDN group. The interaction of TDN and SA was also found to induce oxidative stress as indicated by the increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels. The decrease in the level of the reduced glutathione in the co-treated group indicated that there were no synergistic damages. SA and TDN co-administration could induce a potential increase in LPO levels in liver, kidney, and spleen but not in heart tissue. These results have not suggested that TDN and SA have a synergistic sub-chronic toxicity in mice after i.p. administration.

{"title": "Inhibition of microRNA-155 ameliorates experimental autoimmune myocarditis by modulating Th17/Treg immune response.", "abstract": "Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) is an inflammatory cardiac disease driven by autoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells. Th17 and Treg cells are crucial participants in immune response. A wide variety of immune disorders are associated with Th17/Treg imbalance. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) is a pivotal regulator of the immune system. However, the modulatory effect of miR-155 on Th17/Treg immune response during EAM is unknown. Our study aims to investigate the potential role of miR-155 on the development of autoimmune myocarditis. In this study, we revealed that miR-155 expression was highly elevated in heart tissue and CD4+ T cells during EAM. Also, we identified a proliferative and functional imbalance of Th17/Treg in EAM, which is due to a more active development of Th17 cells and an increased resistance of Th17 cells to Treg-mediated suppression. MiR-155 inhibition in EAM resulted in attenuated severity of disease and cardiac injury, reduced Th17 immune response, and decreased dendritic cell (DC) function of secreting Th17-polarizing cytokines. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells from miR-155-inhibited EAM mice exhibited reduced proliferation and IL-17A secretion in response to autoantigen. Finally, we confirmed an indispensable positive role of miR-155 on the differentiation of Th17 cells and the DC function of secreting Th17-polarizing cytokines through in vitro studies. These findings demonstrated that miR-155 adversely promotes EAM by driving a Th17/Treg imbalance in favor of Th17 cells, and anti-miR-155 treatment can significantly reduce the autoimmune response thus to ameliorate EAM, suggesting that miR-155 inhibition could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune myocarditis.\nMiR-155 expression was highly elevated in EAM mice. An imbalance of Th17/Treg existed in EAM mice. MiR-155 inhibition in EAM attenuated disease severity and cardiac injury. MiR-155 inhibition suppressed Th17 immune response in EAM.

Western blot analysis such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II receptor type IA (ATIA), troponin I (Tn I) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were performed.\nBody weights were significantly higher in the FR group compared with the C group at weeks 8 and 20 and lower in the CX group at week 20. Blood pressure was significantly higher in the FR group compared with the C group at week 20 and lower in the CX group at weeks 12 and 20.

After aspirin administration, myocardial cells showed fewer pathological lesions than broilers treated with heat alone. A high positive Hsp90 signal was always detected in the nuclei of myocardial cells from broilers treated with aspirin, while in myocardial cells treated with heat alone, Hsp90 in the nuclei decreased, as did that in the cytoplasm. Aspirin induced rapid and significant synthesis of Hsp90 before and at the initial phase of heat stress, and significant expression of hsp90 mRNA was stimulated throughout the experiment when compared with cells exposed to heat stress alone.

To demonstrate the utility of our technique, heart tissue was obtained from four species (rat, mouse, rabbit, sheep) at up to three life stages: prenatal, weaning and adulthood.

Using confocal microscopy and three-dimensional image analysis software (Imaris Version 8.2, Bitplane AG, Switzerland), cardiomyocyte volume, nuclearity, and ploidy were measured.

Although oxidative stress has a well-established role in cardiac remodeling and dysfunction, the mechanisms linking redox state to atrial cardiomyocyte hypertrophic changes are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of nuclear erythroid-2 like factor-2 (Nrf2), a central transcriptional mediator, in redox signaling under high intensity exercise stress (HIES) in atria.\nAge and sex-matched wild-type (WT) and Nrf2(-/-) mice at >20 months of age were subjected to HIES for 6 weeks. Gene markers of hypertrophy and antioxidant enzymes were determined in the atria of WT and Nrf2(-/-) mice by real-time qPCR analyses. Detection and quantification of antioxidants, 4-hydroxy-nonenal (4-HNE), poly-ubiquitination and autophagy proteins in WT and Nrf2(-/-) mice were performed by immunofluorescence analysis. The level of oxidative stress was measured by microscopical examination of di-hydro-ethidium (DHE) fluorescence.\nUnder the sedentary state, Nrf2 abrogation resulted in a moderate down regulation of some of the atrial antioxidant gene expression (Gsr, Gclc, Gst\u03b1 and Gst\u00b5) despite having a normal redox state. In response to HIES, enlarged atrial myocytes along with significantly increased gene expression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy markers (Anf, Bnf and \u03b2-Mhc) were observed in Nrf2(-/-) when compared to WT mice. Further, the transcript levels of Gclc, Gsr and Gst\u00b5 and protein levels of NQO1, catalase, GPX1 were profoundly downregulated along with GSH depletion and increased oxidative stress in Nrf2(-/-) mice when compared to its WT counterparts after HIES. Impaired antioxidant state and profound oxidative stress were associated with enhanced atrial expression of LC3 and ATG7 along with increased ubiquitination of ATG7 in Nrf2(-/-) mice subjected to HIES.\nLoss of Nrf2 describes an altered biochemical phenotype associated with dysregulation in genes related to redox state, ubiquitination and autophagy in HIES that result in atrial hypertrophy.

{"title": "Computational Detection of Stage-Specific Transcription Factor Clusters during Heart Development.", "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression in living organisms. In higher organisms, TFs often interact in non-random combinations with each other to control gene transcription. Understanding the interactions is key to decipher mechanisms underlying tissue development. The aim of this study was to analyze co-occurring transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in a time series dataset from a new cell-culture model of human heart muscle development in order to identify common as well as specific co-occurring TFBS pairs in the promoter regions of regulated genes which can be essential to enhance cardiac tissue developmental processes. To this end, we separated available RNAseq dataset into five temporally defined groups: (i) mesoderm induction stage; (ii) early cardiac specification stage; (iii) late cardiac specification stage; (iv) early cardiac maturation stage; (v) late cardiac maturation stage, where each of these stages is characterized by unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs). To identify TFBS pairs for each stage, we applied the MatrixCatch algorithm, which is a successful method to deduce experimentally described TFBS pairs in the promoters of the DEGs. Although DEGs in each stage are distinct, our results show that the TFBS pair networks predicted by MatrixCatch for all stages are quite similar. Thus, we extend the results of MatrixCatch utilizing a Markov clustering algorithm (MCL) to perform network analysis. Using our extended approach, we are able to separate the TFBS pair networks in several clusters to highlight stage-specific co-occurences between TFBSs. Our approach has revealed clusters that are either common (NFAT or HMGIY clusters) or specific (SMAD or AP-1 clusters) for the individual stages. Several of these clusters are likely to play an important role during the cardiomyogenesis. Further, we have shown that the related TFs of TFBSs in the clusters indicate potential synergistic or antagonistic interactions to switch between different stages.

After a 9-week follow-up, physical capacity, metabolic parameters, and morphometric and cardiac functions were assessed. Subsequently, arterial pressure was recorded and cardiac autonomic control was evaluated. Oxidative stress was measured on the cardiac tissue, while inflammatory profile was assessed in the plasma.\nAging or OVX caused an increase in body and fat weight and triglyceride concentration and a decrease in both insulin sensitivity and aerobic exercise capacity. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and increased cardiac overload (myocardial performance index) were reported in old groups when compared with young groups. Aging and OVX led to an increased sympathetic tonus, and vagal tonus was lower only for the old groups. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 were increased in old groups when compared with young groups. Glutathione redox balance (GSH/GSSG) was reduced in young ovariectomized, old controls, and old ovariectomized groups when compared with young controls, indicating an increased oxidative stress. A negative correlation was found between GSH/GSSG and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (r=-0.6, P<0.003). Correlations were found between interleukin-6 with adipose tissue (r=0.5, P<0.009) and vagal tonus (r=-0.7, P<0.0002); and among myocardial performance index with interleukin-6 (r=0.65, P<0.0002), sympathetic tonus (r=0.55, P<0.006), and physical capacity (r=-0.55, P<0.003).

This investigation was conducted to elucidate the potential ability of sitagliptin to counteract the injurious effects of doxorubicin in cardiac tissue. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with sitagliptin for 10 days then treated with a single dose of doxorubicin (20\u2009mg/kg, i.p). Electrocardiography, biochemical estimation of serum and tissue markers, and histo- and immunopathological examinations were done. Results have shown that supplementation with sitagliptin resulted in significant improvement of cardiac function with contaminant decrease in serum markers of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. These results were supported by the histopathological results. Furthermore, a marked protection against oxidative stress was evident through reduction of lipid peroxidation and prevention of reduced glutathione content depletion and superoxide dismutase activity reduction in cardiac tissue of rats pretreated with sitagliptin in combination with doxorubicin. Moreover, sitagliptin ameliorated the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B and the release of inflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and nitric oxide. Finally, sitagliptin attenuated doxorubicin-induced increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and in the apoptotic marker, caspase-3.

{"title": "Cardiac-Specific Disruption of GH Receptor Alters Glucose Homeostasis While Maintaining Normal Cardiac Performance in Adult Male Mice.", "abstract": "GH is considered necessary for the proper development and maintenance of several tissues, including the heart. Studies conducted in both GH receptor null and bovine GH transgenic mice have demonstrated specific cardiac structural and functional changes. In each of these mouse lines, however, GH-induced signaling is altered systemically, being decreased in GH receptor null mice and increased in bovine GH transgenic mice. Therefore, to clarify the direct effects GH has on cardiac tissue, we developed a tamoxifen-inducible, cardiac-specific GHR disrupted (iC-GHRKO) mouse line. Cardiac GH receptor was disrupted in 4-month-old iC-GHRKO mice to avoid developmental effects due to perinatal GHR gene disruption. Surprisingly, iC-GHRKO mice showed no difference vs controls in baseline or postdobutamine stress test echocardiography measurements, nor did iC-GHRKO mice show differences in longitudinal systolic blood pressure measurements. Interestingly, iC-GHRKO mice had decreased fat mass and improved insulin sensitivity at 6.5 months of age. By 12.5 months of age, however, iC-GHRKO mice no longer had significant decreases in fat mass and had developed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Furthermore, investigation via immunoblot analysis demonstrated that iC-GHRKO mice had appreciably decreased insulin stimulated Akt phosphorylation, specifically in heart and liver, but not in epididymal white adipose tissue. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in circulating IGF-1 levels in 12.5-month-old iC-GHRKO mice. These data indicate that whereas the disruption of cardiomyocyte GH-induced signaling in adult mice does not affect cardiac function, it does play a role in systemic glucose homeostasis, in part through modulation of circulating IGF-1.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2016-04-02", "authors": ["AdamJara", "XingboLiu", "DonSim", "Chance MBenner", "SilvanaDuran-Ortiz", "YanrongQian", "Edward OList", "Darlene EBerryman", "Jason KKim", "John JKopchick"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2015-1686"}

In this study, we sequenced the 2\u2009kb region upstream of the TBX20 transcription start site in 228 CHD patients and 292 controls in a Han Chinese population. Among the 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, six SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium and the minor alleles are associated with lower CHD risk (for rs10235849 chosen as tag SNP, p\u2009=\u20090.0069, OR (95%\u2009CI)\u2009=\u20090.68 (0.51-0.90)).

Applying continuous live imaging, this protocol demonstrates how a specifically designed bioreactor system allows controlled exposure of cultured cells to cyclic stretch, rhythmic electrical stimulation, and controlled fluid perfusion, at user-defined temperatures.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2016-04-02", "authors": ["Jan-ChristophEdelmann", "LizzieJones", "RemiPeyronnet", "LiangLu", "PeterKohl", "UrsulaRavens"], "doi": "10.1007/7651_2016_336"}
{"title": "Oxidative state and oxidative metabolism of the heart from rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis.", "abstract": "The aim of the present work was to investigate, in a more extensive way, the oxidative state and parameters related to energy metabolism of the heart tissue of rats using the model of adjuvant-induced arthritis. The latter is a model for the human arthritic disease. Measurements were done in the total tissue homogenate, isolated mitochondria and cytosolic fraction. The adjuvant-induced arthritis caused several modifications in the oxidative state of the heart which, in general, indicate an increased oxidative stress (+80% reactive oxygen species), protein damage (+53% protein carbonyls) and lipid damage (+63% peroxidation) in the whole tissue. The distribution of these changes over the various cell compartments was frequently unequal. For example, protein carbonyls were increased in the whole tissue and in the cytosol, but not in the mitochondria. No changes in GSH content of the whole tissue were found, but it was increased in the mitochondria (+33%) and decreased in the cytosol (-19%). The activity of succinate dehydrogenase was 77% stimulated by arthritis; the activities of glutamate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase were diminished by 31, 25 and 35.3%, respectively. In spite of these alterations, no changes in the mitochondrial respiratory activity and in the efficiency of energy transduction were found. It can be concluded that the adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats causes oxidative damage to the heart with an unequal intracellular distribution. Compared to the liver and brain the modifications caused by arthritis in the heart are less pronounced on variables such as GSH levels and protein integrity. Possibly this occurs because the antioxidant system of the heart is less impaired by arthritis than that reported for the former tissues. Even so, the modifications caused by arthritis represent an imbalanced situation that probably contributes to the cardiac symptoms of the arthritis disease.", "journal": "Experimental and molecular pathology", "date": "2016-04-02", "authors": ["Amanda CarolineSchubert", "Mariana Marques NogueiraWendt", "Anacharis Babetode S\u00e1-Nakanishi", "Ciomar Aparecida BersaniAmado", "Rosane MarinaPeralta", "Jurandir FernandoComar", "AdelarBracht"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexmp.2016.03.005"}

Mice were given a single dose of Ganmaoling grain or its different ingredients respectively by gavage, and then observed for 14 days. LD\u2085\u2080 values of Ganmaoling grain or its chemical ingredient and the maximal tolerated dose of its herb ingredient were determined. Mice were divided into starvation and diet group, a single dose of Ganmaoling grain was administered by gavage. LD\u2085\u2080 values were estimated after 14 day observation. Mice were divided into starvation and diet group. At the same time,control group was set up for each. A single dose of Ganmaoling grain was given. Serum biochemical indexes were detected, liver weight index was calculated and liver tissue morphological change was observed after 6 h. LD\u2085\u2080 values were 4.42, 0.64 g\u2022kg\u207b\u00b9 for Ganmaoling grain group and chemical ingredient group, respectively. The maximal tolerated dose of the herb ingredient group was close to 24.24 g\u2022kg\u207b\u00b9. The toxic symptom was basically similar in the Ganmaoling grain and the chemical ingredient group. The body weight and food intake were decreased to a certain extent in both groups. There were pathological changes of liver and heart tissue in some of the surviving animals. The animals in the Ganmaoling grain group exhibited a lighter toxicity and recovered faster than that in the chemical ingredient group. LD\u2085\u2080 values of Ganmaoling grain were 2.56, 6.93 g\u2022kg\u207b\u00b9 for starvation and diet group respectively.

The toxicity of 999 Ganmaoling was less, which may be related to the reduction of toxicity after the combination of herb and chemical ingredients. Compared with starvation group, the values of LD\u2085\u2080 and TD\u2085\u2080 of diet group was significantly increased, and toxicity was decreased.

{"title": "Influence of different fixation protocols on the preservation and dimensions of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Recent extensive progress in invasive cardiac procedures has triggered a wave of dozens of heart morphometric anatomical studies that are carried out largely using autopsied samples fixed in formaldehyde solution prior to observations and measurements. In reality, very little is known about changes in heart tissue dimensions during fixation. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate how fixation affects the dimensions of cardiac tissue, and if different types and concentrations of reagents affect this phenomenon. A total of 40 pig heart samples were investigated, and seven different measuring sites were permanently marked in every heart prior to fixation. Four study groups (n\u2005=\u200510 each) were assembled that differed only in concentration and the type of fixative: (i) 2% formaldehyde solution; (ii) 4% formaldehyde solution (formalin); (iii) 10% formaldehyde solution; (iv) alcoholic formalin. The samples were measured before and after fixation at the following time points: 24\u2005h, 72\u2005h and 168\u2005h. It was found that different fixatives significantly affected different parameters. Almost all of the heart dimensions that were measured stabilized after 24\u2005h; later changes were statistically insignificant in the point-to-point comparison. Change in the length of the interatrial septum surface was not altered significantly in any of the fixatives after 24\u2005h of preservation. It was found that 10% formaldehyde increased the thickness of muscular tissue only after 24\u2005h; this thickening was reduced after 72\u2005h and was insignificant at 168\u2005h. Other heart parameters in this group do not present significant changes over the entire fixation time duration. In conclusion, the 10% formaldehyde phosphate-buffered solution appeared to be the best fixative among the fixatives that were studied for cardiac morphometric purposes; this solution caused the smallest changes in tissue dimensions. Measurements should be obtained at least after 1\u2005week of preservation when most parameters exhibit the smallest changes compared with the non-preserved samples.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2016-04-01", "authors": ["Mateusz KHo\u0142da", "Wies\u0142awaKlimek-Piotrowska", "MateuszKoziej", "KatarzynaPi\u0105tek", "JakubHo\u0142da"], "doi": "10.1111/joa.12469"}
{"title": "Mitochondrial dysfunction bridges negative affective disorders and cardiomyopathy in socially isolated rats: Pros and cons of fluoxetine.", "abstract": "Objectives Depression is tightly associated with cardiovascular comorbidity and accounts for high financial and social burden worldwide. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of depression and cardiovascular disorders; its contribution to depression-cardiovascular comorbidity has not yet been investigated. Methods Adolescent rats were subjected to 4 weeks of isolation (social isolation stress or SIS) or social conditions (control), and then they were divided into treatment (fluoxetine, 7.5\u2009mg/kg/day for 21 days) and non-treatment groups. After different housing conditions and treatment, animals were evaluated by behavioural tests (n\u2009=\u20096-8) and mitochondrial assessments (n\u2009=\u20093) of brain and cardiac tissues. Results We found that juvenile SIS induced behavioural abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction in adulthood. We showed that juvenile SIS was associated with impaired respiratory chain complex, which leads to reactive oxygen species formation, oxidative damage and ATP abatement in both brain and heart. Administration of FLX (7.5\u2009mg/kg/day) during the isolation period attenuated the effects of SIS on the brain mitochondria and behavioural abnormalities, but had little or no effect on SIS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac tissue. Conclusions This suggests that juvenile SIS predisposes the co-occurrence of depression and cardiovascular disease through mitochondrial dysfunction and that therapeutic effect of fluoxetine is partly mediated by its effect on mitochondrial function.", "journal": "The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry", "date": "2016-04-01", "authors": ["NazaninSonei", "ShayanAmiri", "ImanJafarian", "MahdiehAnoush", "MaryamRahimi-Balaei", "HugoBergen", "AryaHaj-Mirzaian", "Mir-JamalHosseini"], "doi": "10.3109/15622975.2016.1149218"}

However, high intensity, volume and/or frequency may lead to injury and other health issues such as adverse cardiac effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of RT on left ventricle proteome, and to identify the pathways involved on the harmful adaptations induced by this protocol. Male Wistar rats were randomized into 2 groups: Trained (T) and Sedentary (S). Animals from T group were trained for 6weeks, and then all the animals were sacrificed and left ventricle was isolated for analysis. We identified 955 proteins, and 93 proteins were considered; 36 were expressed exclusively in T group, and 4 in S group. Based on quantitative analysis, 42 proteins were found overexpressed and 11 underexpressed in T group compared with S group. Using the Gene Ontology to relate the biological processes in which these proteins are involved, we conclude that RT protocol promotes changes similar to those found in the initial phase of heart failure, but we also observed a concomitant increased expression of protective proteins, suggesting the activation of pathways to avoid major damages on left ventricle and delay the onset of pathological hypertrophy.\nOur study shows that high-intensity RT protocol changes left ventricle proteome, modifying metabolic profile of heart tissue and inducing the expression of proteins that acts against cardiac injury. We hypothesize that these adaptations occur to prevent the onset of cardiac dysfunction. Despite highly significant, it remains to be determined whether these adaptations are sufficient to further keep left ventricle function and exert cardioprotection, and whether this panel will be shifted towards maladaptation, and heart failure.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2016-03-30", "authors": ["Patr\u00edcia SousaDantas", "Ma\u00edsa MayumiSakata", "Juliana Din\u00e9iaPerez", "Regina Lucia HarumiWatanabe", "Fernando C\u00e9sarBizerra", "Vander Jos\u00e9 dasNeves", "ViniciusGuzzoni", "Fernanda KleinMarcondes", "Dulce ElenaCasarini", "Tatiana SousaCunha"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2016.03.040"}

All of these changes were inhibited by treatment with X22. Furthermore, oral administration of X22 suppressed high-fat diet-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, hypertrophy and fibrosis in rat heart tissues and decreased serum lipid concentration.

To determine susceptibility of the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris L.) and pathogenesis of the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype III isolate 12-654, previously associated with VHSV infection in the Shetland Islands in 2012, fish were experimentally challenged by intraperitoneal injection (IP), bath immersion and cohabitation routes. Cumulative proportion of moribund wrasse reached 17% following the virus immersion challenge while by the IP-route moribunds exceeded 50% within 14days post-challenge. Typical signs of VHS as reported in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), were not observed in moribund goldsinny wrasse. The most pronounced histopathological changes, consistent regardless of the route of infection, were observed within the heart and included atrium myofibril degeneration, focal infiltration and multifocal necrosis, with prominent swelling of the endocardium and occasional detachment. Pathological changes in the atrium were associated with presence of the viral antigen as confirmed by a positive immunohistochemical staining. Virus clearance and heart tissue recovery were noted although further experiments are required to confirm these observations. The results of a cohabitation experiment confirmed that goldsinny wrasse shed viable virus and therefore represent a risk of virus transmission to other VHSV susceptible species.

{"title": "Cardiac activation heat remains inversely dependent on temperature over the range 27-37\u00b0C.", "abstract": "The relation between heat output and stress production (force per cross-sectional area) of isolated cardiac tissue is a key metric that provides insight into muscle energetic performance. The heat intercept of the relation, termed \"activation heat,\" reflects the metabolic cost of restoring transmembrane gradients of Na(+) and K(+) following electrical excitation, and myoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration following its release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. At subphysiological temperatures, activation heat is inversely dependent on temperature. Thus one may presume that activation heat would decrease even further at body temperature. However, this assumption is prima facie inconsistent with a study, using intact hearts, which revealed no apparent change in the combination of activation and basal metabolism between 27 and 37\u00b0C. It is thus desired to directly determine the change in activation heat between 27 and 37\u00b0C. In this study, we use our recently constructed high-thermal resolution muscle calorimeter to determine the first heat-stress relation of isolated cardiac muscle at 37\u00b0C. We compare the relation at 37\u00b0C to that at 27\u00b0C to examine whether the inverse temperature dependence of activation heat, observed under hypothermic conditions, prevails at body temperature. Our results show that activation heat was reduced (from 3.5 \u00b1 0.3 to 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 kJ/m(3)) at the higher temperature. This leads us to conclude that activation metabolism continues to decline as temperature is increased from hypothermia to normothermia and allows us to comment on results obtained from the intact heart by previous investigators.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

As the membrane potential of cardiac cells is mainly controlled by activity of voltage-gated ion channels, this study examined whether the sensitization effect of azoTAB was exerted primarily via the modulation of voltage-gated ion channel activity. The effects of trans- and cis- isomers of azoTAB on voltage-dependent sodium (INav), calcium (ICav), and potassium (IKv) currents in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were investigated using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The experiments showed that azoTAB modulated ion currents, causing suppression of sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) currents and potentiation of net potassium (K+) currents. This finding confirms that azoTAB-effect on cardiac tissue excitability do indeed result from modulation of voltage-gated ion channels responsible for action potential.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-03-26", "authors": ["Sheyda RFrolova", "OlgaGaiko", "Valeriya ATsvelaya", "Oleg YPimenov", "Konstantin IAgladze"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0152018\n10.1021/bi0618058\n10.1002/anie.200904504\n10.1152/physiol.00018.2008\n10.1039/b710287a\n10.1126/science.1166022\n10.1039/c1cs15023e\n10.1021/ja209239m\n10.1002/anie.201101398\n10.1002/chem.200501564\n10.1016/j.sbi.2008.07.005\n10.1038/nmeth.1187\n10.3389/fnmol.2013.00005\n10.1021/cn200037p\n10.1152/jn.00438.2012\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0745\n10.1007/978-1-59745-526-8_11\n10.1038/nmeth.1897\n10.1021/ja211664f\n10.1021/jp060981n\n10.1021/bi048556c\n10.1021/bi051646c\n10.1021/bi700233k\n10.1021/ja0576738"}
{"title": "Regular exercise alleviates renovascular hypertension-induced cardiac/endothelial dysfunction and oxidative injury in rats.", "abstract": "The importance of physical activity in the management of renovascular diseases is well-known, but lacks evidence of underlying mechanisms. The purpose of the study was to elucidate the protective/therapeutic effects of regular exercise on experimental renovascular hypertension (RVH)-induced oxidative stress and cardiac dysfunction. Wistar albino rats underwent a RVH surgery (2K1C, Goldblatt). Three weeks later half of the rats started swimming exercise for 9 weeks (n = 15), while the sedentary RVH group (n = 15) had no exercise during that period. Sham-operated control rats (n = 10), had the similar surgical procedures but the left renal artery was left unclipped. Body weights were monitored, and blood pressures were measured weekly using tail-cuff. Echocardiographic evaluation was performed on the 3(rd) week and on the 12(th) week of the experiment before the rats were decapitated. Heart and thoracic aorta were removed and serum was collected, while aortic samples were put in a 10% formaldehyde solution for immunochemistry. Cardiac tissue samples obtained from each animal were used for the determination of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) and catalase (CAT) activities, malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) levels. In the sedentary RVH group, aortic contractile response (contraction/relaxation in isolated organ bath), left ventricular diastolic and systolic dimensions, and immunohistochemical staining of aortic inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were increased, while ejection fraction and aortic endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) staining were decreased. RVH in the sedentary rats resulted in increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-6), lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) and neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity) along with reductions in antioxidant glutathione and catalase levels in the cardiac tissue. Exercise after RVH increased the immunohistochemical staining of aortic eNOS, decreased iNOS staining and reversed the alterations in echocardiographic and oxidative parameters. Regular exercise commenced after RVH surgery alleviated renovascular hypertension-induced oxidative injury, by modulating oxidant-antioxidant balance via the involvement of the endothelial NO system.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society", "date": "2016-03-25", "authors": ["Z N OKumral", "GSener", "SOzgur", "MKoc", "SSuleymanoglu", "CHurdag", "B CYegen"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Latest aspects of aldosterone actions on the heart muscle.", "abstract": "The genomic action of aldosterone has already been known to the scientific community and is well-documented to a satisfactory degree. However, the existence of rapid, non-genomic aldosterone actions has repeatedly been proven. These actions are apparent to a lot of tissues, among which the cardiac tissue, with the cardiac cells being responsible for the secretion of endogenous aldosterone. In the genomic pathway, the connection between the hormone and its receptor results increased reabsorption of sodium and water and excretion of potassium. Thus, the genomic procedure reacts indirectly on cardiovascular system by altering the blood pressure. New studies have shed light on unknown aspects of the non-genomic mechanism, which is sometimes performed by means of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), while others through an MR-independent pathway. It is believed that aldosterone exerts its non-genomic action with the help of a different receptor, probably a G protein coupled receptor. A possible target is protein kinase C (PKC), and PKC\u03b5 is postulated increase the permeability of the membrane of the cardiac cells to sodium, resulting in delayed repolarization and prolongation of action potential. These findings totally agree with and account for the serendipitous finding of our laboratory, that there is a positive correlation between plasma aldosterone levels and left ventricle (LV) contraction duration. Also, aldosterone has been proven to exacerbate the oxidative stress and induce vasoconstriction by acting on the vascular resistance and the cardiac output. Finally, this article deals with the role of aldosterone in cardiac fibrosis and the latest aspects of aldosterone actions on the heart muscle as well as providing a historical overview of the landmarks pertaining aldosterone's research.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society", "date": "2016-03-25", "authors": ["A AKritis", "C PGouta", "E ILiaretidou", "K IKallaras"], "doi": null}

The goals of this retrospective multi-institutional study were to determine the tissue distribution of iron storage in captive adult Egyptian fruit bats and the incidence of intercurrent neoplasia and infection, which may be directly or indirectly related to iron overload. Tissue sections from 83 adult Egyptian fruit bats were histologically evaluated by using tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, trichrome, and Prussian blue techniques. The liver and spleen consistently had the largest amount of iron, but significant amounts of iron were also detected in the pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, and lung. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 11) was the most common neoplasm, followed by cholangiocarcinoma (4). Extrahepatic neoplasms included bronchioloalveolar adenoma (3), pulmonary carcinosarcoma (1), oral sarcoma (1), renal adenocarcinoma (1), transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (1), mammary gland adenoma (1), and parathyroid adenoma (1). There were also metastatic neoplasms of undetermined primary origin that included three poorly differentiated carcinomas, a poorly differentiated sarcoma, and a neuroendocrine tumor. Bats with hemochromatosis were significantly more likely to have HCC than bats with hemosiderosis (P = 0.032). Cardiomyopathy was identified in 35/77 bats with evaluable heart tissue, but no direct association was found between cardiac damage and the amount of iron observed within the liver or heart. Hepatic abscesses occurred in multiple bats, although a significant association was not observed between hemochromatosis and bacterial infection.

However, there is no effective method to treat the disease presently. The present research was to investigate the effects of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) on homing of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in heart I/R injury.\nEffects of TGF-\u03b21 on the expression of CXCR4 [Chemokine (C-X-C Motif) Receptor 4] and chemotactic effect to SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor 1) in MSCs were investigated by in vitro transmembrane chemotaxis. Anti-TGF-\u03b21 was incubated with I/R injury's heart tissue of mice. In addition, effects of TGF-\u03b21 and anti-CXCR4 treatment using MSCs on the expression of SDF-1/CXCR4 in heart tissue and on I/R injury repair were further explored.\nCXCR4 and TGF-\u03b21 expression were significantly increased after TGF-\u03b21 treatment in MSCs; TGF-\u03b21 treatment increased MSCs cell migration, and anti-CXCR4 and anti-TGF-\u03b21 treatment blocked MSCs/TGF-\u03b21cell migration. Expression of TGF-\u03b21 in the I/R injury's myocardial tissue of mice was increased, and MSCs transplantation could enhance the protein expression of CXCR4 in the I/R injury's myocardial tissue of mice, and the expression of CXCR4 was decreased by the anti-TGF-\u03b21 and the anti-CXCR4 treatment. TGF-\u03b21 induced homing of MSCs in the repair of myocardial injury by regulating expression of CXCR4 on the cell membranes. Blue fluorescence of DAPI-positive MSCs cells of myocardial in the I/R+MSC group was enhanced significantly, which was significantly inhibited by anti-TGF-\u03b21 and anti-CXCR4 antibody, and the inhibitory effect of anti-CXCR4 antibody was more evident than that of anti-TGF-\u03b21 antibody.\nTGF-\u03b21 promotes homing of bone marrow (BM) MSCs in I/R injury's myocardial.

{"title": "A Comparison of Acoustic Radiation Force-Derived Indices of Cardiac Function in the Langendorff Perfused Rabbit Heart.", "abstract": "In the past decade, there has been an increased interest in characterizing cardiac tissue mechanics utilizing newly developed ultrasound-based elastography techniques. These methods excite the tissue mechanically and track the response. Two frequently used methods, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) and shear-wave elasticity imaging (SWEI), have been considered qualitative and quantitative techniques providing relative and absolute measures of tissue stiffness, respectively. Depending on imaging conditions, it is desirable to identify indices of cardiac function that could be measured by ARFI and SWEI and to characterize the relationship between the measures. In this study, we have compared two indices (i.e., relaxation time constant used for diastolic dysfunction assessment and systolic/diastolic stiffness ratio) measured nearly simultaneously by M-mode ARFI and SWEI techniques. We additionally correlated ARFI-measured inverse displacements with SWEI-measured values of the shear modulus of stiffness. For the eight animals studied, the average relaxation time constant ( \u03c4) measured by ARFI and SWEI were ([Formula: see text]) and ([Formula: see text]), respectively ([Formula: see text]). Average systolic/diastolic stiffness ratios for ARFI and SWEI measurements were 6.01\u00b11.37 and 7.12\u00b13.24, respectively ([Formula: see text]). Shear modulus of stiffness (SWEI) was linearly related to inverse displacement values (ARFI) with a 95% CI for the slope of 0.010-0.011 [Formula: see text] ( R(2)=0.73). In conclusion, the relaxation time constant and the systolic/diastolic stiffness ratio were calculated with good agreement between the ARFI- and SWEI-derived measurements.

{"title": "Adjoint multi-start-based estimation of cardiac hyperelastic material parameters using shear data.", "abstract": "Cardiac muscle tissue during relaxation is commonly modeled as a hyperelastic material with strongly nonlinear and anisotropic stress response. Adapting the behavior of such a model to experimental or patient data gives rise to a parameter estimation problem which involves a significant number of parameters. Gradient-based optimization algorithms provide a way to solve such nonlinear parameter estimation problems with relatively few iterations, but require the gradient of the objective functional with respect to the model parameters. This gradient has traditionally been obtained using finite differences, the calculation of which scales linearly with the number of model parameters, and introduces a differencing error. By using an automatically derived adjoint equation, we are able to calculate this gradient more efficiently, and with minimal implementation effort. We test this adjoint framework on a least squares fitting problem involving data from simple shear tests on cardiac tissue samples. A second challenge which arises in gradient-based optimization is the dependency of the algorithm on a suitable initial guess. We show how a multi-start procedure can alleviate this dependency.

Currently, the analysis of multi-channel fluorescence tissue images is primarily achieved by manual measurements of tissue cellular content and sub-cellular compartments. Since the current manual methodology for image analysis is a tedious and subjective approach, there is clearly a need for an automated analytical technique to process large-scale image datasets. Here, we introduce Nuquantus (Nuclei quantification utility software) - a novel machine learning-based analytical method, which identifies, quantifies and classifies nuclei based on cells of interest in composite fluorescent tissue images, in which cell borders are not visible. Nuquantus is an adaptive framework that learns the morphological attributes of intact tissue in the presence of anatomical variability and pathological processes. Nuquantus allowed us to robustly perform quantitative image analysis on remodeling cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction. Nuquantus reliably classifies cardiomyocyte versus non-cardiomyocyte nuclei and detects cell proliferation, as well as cell death in different cell classes. Broadly, Nuquantus provides innovative computerized methodology to analyze complex tissue images that significantly facilitates image analysis and minimizes human bias.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-03-24", "authors": ["PolinaGross", "NicolasHonnorat", "ErdemVarol", "MarkusWallner", "Danielle MTrappanese", "Thomas ESharp", "TimothyStarosta", "Jason MDuran", "SarahKoller", "ChristosDavatzikos", "Steven RHouser"], "doi": "10.1038/srep23431"}

Here, we examined the effects of apelin-13 on myocardial injury in a mouse model combining ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) and obesity and explored their underlying mechanisms.\nAdult male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 6\u00a0months and then subjected to cardiac I/R. The effects of apelin-13 post-treatment on myocardial injury were evaluated in HFD-fed mice after 24\u00a0h I/R. Changes in protein abundance, phosphorylation, subcellular localization and mRNA expression were determined in cardiomyoblast cell line H9C2, primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac tissue from ND- and HFD-fed mice. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was analysed by electron microscopy.\nIn HFD-fed mice subjected to cardiac I/R, i.v. administration of apelin-13 significantly reduced infarct size, myocardial apoptosis and mitochondrial damage compared with vehicle-treated animals. In H9C2 cells and primary cardiomyocytes, apelin-13 induced FoxO1 phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion. FoxO1 silencing by siRNA abolished the protective effects of apelin-13 against hypoxia-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial ROS generation. Finally, apelin deficiency in mice fed a HFD resulted in reduced myocardial FoxO1 expression and impaired FoxO1 distribution.\nThese data reveal apelin as a novel regulator of FoxO1 in cardiac cells and provide evidence for the potential of apelin-13 in prevention of apoptosis and mitochondrial damage in conditions combining I/R injury and obesity.", "journal": "British journal of pharmacology", "date": "2016-03-24", "authors": ["FredericBoal", "AndreiTimotin", "JessicaRoumegoux", "ChiaraAlfarano", "DenisCalise", "RodicaAnesia", "AngeloParini", "PhilippeValet", "HeleneTronchere", "OksanaKunduzova"], "doi": "10.1111/bph.13485"}

We aimed to explore the effects of DQP on Peroxisome Proliferator activated receptors \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), lipid uptake-transportation-metabolism pathway and arachidonic acid (AA)-mediated inflammation pathway in rats with CHD.\n80 Sprague-Dawley (SD) Rats were randomly divided into sham group, model group, positive control group and DQP group. Rat model of CHD was induced by ligation of left ventricle anterior descending artery and fed with high fat diet in all but the sham group. Rats in sham group only underwent thoracotomy. After surgery, rats in the positive control and DQP group received daily treatments of pravastatin and DQP respectively. At 28 days after surgery, rats were sacrificed and plasma lipids were evaluated by plasma biochemical detection. Western blot and PCR were applied to evaluate the expressions of PPAR\u03b1, proteins involved in lipid metabolism and AA pathways.\nTwenty eight days after surgery, dyslipidemia developed in CHD model rats, as illustrated by elevated plasma lipid levels. Expressions of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and fatty acid binding protein (FABP) in the heart tissues of model group were down-regulated compared with those in sham group. Expressions of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT-1A) and lipoproteinlipase (LPL) were also reduced significantly. In addition, levels of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) were up-regulated. Expressions of Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF- \u03baB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) also increased. Furthermore, Expression of PPAR\u03b1 decreased in the model group.

The group has recently synthesized a novel polycaprolactone based polyurethane-urea copolymer that showed improved mechanical properties compared with its previously published counterparts. The aim of this study was to explore whether indirect three-dimensional (3D) printing could provide a means to fabricate this novel, biodegradable polymer into a scaffold suitable for cardiac tissue engineering. Indirect 3D printing was carried out through printing water dissolvable poly(vinyl alcohol) porogens in three different sizes based on a wood-stack model, into which a polyurethane-urea solution was pressure injected. The porogens were removed, leading to soft polyurethane-urea scaffolds with regular tubular pores. The scaffolds were characterized for their compressive and tensile mechanical behavior; and their degradation was monitored for 12 months under simulated physiological conditions. Their compatibility with cardiac myocytes and performance in novel cardiac engineering-related techniques, such as aggregate seeding and bi-directional perfusion, was also assessed. The scaffolds were found to have mechanical properties similar to cardiac tissue, and good biocompatibility with cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, the incorporated cells preserved their phenotype with no signs of de-differentiation. The constructs worked well in perfusion experiments, showing enhanced seeding efficiency. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Currently, however, the differentiated cells induced from hUCMSCs or hATMSCs can hardly display functional characteristics similar to cardiomyocytes. In this study, we have investigated the effects of bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) on cardiac differentiations of hUCMSCs and hATMSCs in condition medium composed of cardiac myocytes culture medium or 5-azacytidine. Cardiac differentiations were identified through immunofluorescence staining, and the results were observed with fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy. Synergistic effects of S1P and condition medium on cell viability were evaluated by MTT assays. Functional characteristics similar to cardiomyocytes were evaluated through detecting calcium transient. The differentiated hUCMSCs or hATMSCs in each group into cardiomyocytes showed positive expressions of cardiac specific proteins, including \u03b1-actin, connexin-43 and myosin heavy chain-6 (MYH-6). MTT assays showed that suitable differentiation time was 14\u2009days and that the optimal concentration of S1P was 0.5\u2009\u03bcM. Moreover, incorporation of S1P and cardiac myocytes culture medium gave rise to calcium transients, an important marker for displaying in vivo electrophysiological properties.

However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying its beneficial effects remains poorly understood. Oxidative stress is known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and one of the enzyme systems that produce reactive oxygen species is NADH/NADPH oxidase. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetes on expression of p47(phox) and p67(phox), key regulatory subunits of NADPH oxidase, in cardiac tissues and determine whether ExT can attenuate these changes. Four weeks after STZ treatment, expression of p47(phox) and p67(phox) increased 2.3-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively, in left ventricles of diabetic rats and these increases were attenuated with three weeks of ExT, initiated 1 week after onset of diabetes. In atrial tissues, there was increased expression of p47(phox) (74%), which was decreased by ExT in diabetic rats. Furthermore, increased collagen III levels in diabetic hearts (52%) were significantly reduced by ExT. Taken together, ExT attenuates the increased expression of p47(phox) and p67(phox) in the hearts of diabetic rats which could be an underlying mechanism for improving intracardiac matrix and thus cardiac function and prevent cardiac remodeling in diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2016-03-19", "authors": ["Neeru MSharma", "BrandonRabeler", "HongZheng", "EugeniaRaichlin", "Kaushik PPatel"], "doi": "10.1155/2016/5868913\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2014.02.007\n10.1161/01.cir.101.19.2271\n10.1067/mhj.2001.115302\n10.1016/0002-9149(72)90595-4\n10.1161/circulationaha.106.679597\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2008.03.046\n10.1007/s10741-011-9257-z\n10.2337/diabetes.48.1.1\n10.2337/diacare.19.3.257\n10.1093/cvr/cvn104\n10.1161/circulationaha.108.792101\n10.1253/circj.cj-13-1187\n10.2174/1874192400802010070\n10.1253/circj.cj-12-1099\n10.1038/320454a0\n10.1016/0008-6363(96)88533-6\n10.1007/s001090050275\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.04.004\n10.1161/01.res.86.5.494\n10.1161/hh0901.089987\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00407-2\n10.1098/rstb.2005.1772\n10.1074/jbc.274.28.19814\n10.1152/ajpregu.00246.2010\n10.1161/01.hyp.37.4.1053\n10.1074/jbc.271.48.30326\n10.1210/en.2003-0010\n10.1161/01.res.74.6.1141\n10.1161/01.res.86.4.463\n10.1161/hc0302.103712\n10.1161/01.CIR.87.6.1816\n10.1161/01.atv.20.10.2175\n10.1016/s0167-0115(00)00136-1\n10.1073/pnas.94.26.14483\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00183-2\n10.1161/circulationaha.105.581397\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.02.006\n10.1161/01.hyp.0000082814.62655.85\n10.1161/01.res.88.2.e14\n10.1007/s00421-009-1260-x\n10.1016/S1043-6618(03)00099-9\n10.2337/diabetes.52.7.1837\n10.1152/ajpheart.00918.2002\n10.1536/jhj.43.25\n10.1111/j.1527-5299.2003.00277.x\n10.1152/ajpheart.00534.2013\n10.1016/S1043-6618(03)00150-6\n10.1097/00001573-200209000-00009\n10.1126/science.210504\n10.1006/bbrc.1999.0285\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00103.2008\n10.1016/0076-6879(69)13005-0\n10.1093/cvr/cvr217\n10.1152/ajpcell.00258.2011\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00821.2002\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.04.034\n10.1161/01.hyp.37.4.1047\n10.1161/01.res.80.1.45\n10.1161/hh0202.103615\n10.1152/ajpheart.00489.2007\n10.1136/jcp.46.1.32\n10.1111/j.1755-5922.2010.00205.x\n10.5114/aoms.2014.43748\n10.2337/dcs13-2024\n10.1056/nejmoa011858\n10.1185/030079902125000246\n10.1152/ajpregu.00046.2012\n10.1152/ajpheart.00190.2002\n10.1016/s0925-4439(02)00070-4\n10.2337/diabetes.52.5.1256\n10.1172/jci118623\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00164.2004\n10.1007/s11892-003-0020-2\n10.1530/eje.0.1450273\n10.1152/ajpheart.01328.2005"}

To address this issue, this article presents a validated analytical method for the quantification of 16 QT-prolonging drugs (QTD) and metabolites in postmortem whole blood and postmortem cardiac tissue. Samples were prepared by protein precipitation and quantified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Deuterated internal standards were used. Validation results showed that the bias was \u00b115% and precision was \u226415% for all compounds in both matrices. The recovery ranged from 78.8 to 127.4%, and the matrix effect ranged from 61.0 to 128.7% across both matrices. The limit of detection and the lower limit of quantification were below the therapeutic concentrations of the prescription drugs. No noteworthy degradation during storage of the extracts was detected. The method was applied in five authentic cases of mentally ill patients. In conclusion, an analytical method was successfully developed and validated for the quantification of QTD in postmortem whole blood and cardiac tissue. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this article presents the first fully validated method for quantification of QTD in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Journal of analytical toxicology", "date": "2016-03-16", "authors": ["Christian RMikkelsen", "Jakob RJornil", "Ljubica VAndersen", "JytteBanner", "J\u00f8rgen BHasselstr\u00f8m"], "doi": "10.1093/jat/bkw014"}
{"title": "Age- and Hypertension-Associated Protein Aggregates in Mouse Heart Have Similar Proteomic Profiles.", "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are largely defined by protein aggregates in affected tissues. Aggregates contain some shared components as well as proteins thought to be specific for each disease. Aggregation has not previously been reported in the normal, aging heart or the hypertensive heart. Detergent-insoluble protein aggregates were isolated from mouse heart and characterized on 2-dimensional gels. Their levels increased markedly and significantly with aging and after sustained angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Of the aggregate components identified by high-resolution proteomics, half changed in abundance with age (392/787) or with sustained hypertension (459/824), whereas 30% (273/901) changed concordantly in both, each P<0.05. One fifth of these proteins were previously associated with age-progressive neurodegenerative or cardiovascular diseases, or both (eg, ApoE, ApoJ, ApoAIV, clusterin, complement C3, and others involved in stress-response and protein-homeostasis pathways). Because fibrosis is a characteristic of both aged and hypertensive hearts, we posited that aging of fibroblasts may contribute to the aggregates observed in cardiac tissue. Indeed, as cardiac myofibroblasts \"senesced\" (approached their replicative limit) in vitro, they accrued aggregates with many of the same constituent proteins observed in vivo during natural aging or sustained hypertension. In summary, we have shown for the first time that compact (detergent-insoluble) protein aggregates accumulate during natural aging, chronic hypertension, and in vitro myofibroblast senescence, sharing many common proteins. Thus, aggregates that arise from disparate causes (aging, hypertension, and replicative senescence) may have common underlying mechanisms of accrual.", "journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "date": "2016-03-16", "authors": ["SrinivasAyyadevara", "FedericoMercanti", "XianweiWang", "Samuel GMackintosh", "Alan JTackett", "Sastry V SPrayaga", "FrancescoRomeo", "Robert JShmookler Reis", "Jawahar LMehta"], "doi": "10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.06849"}

Although it had been reported that statins have beneficial effects on cardiac fibrosis in hypertension and myocardial ischemia models, their effects on AGEs models have not been studied. We aimed to investigate the effects of atorvastatin (Ator) on the AGEs-induced cardiac fibrosis both in vitro and vivo.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control, AGEs, Ator or AGEs+Ator. The cardiac function was evaluated with the echocardiography at the second and the third month. Fibrosis area, \u03b1-SMA and RAGE expression in cardiac tissue were measured. For in vitro study, rat cardiac fibroblasts were treated with PD98059 (ERK inhibitor), Ator or Ator+GW9662 (PPAR-\u03b3 antagonist), and then were stimulated with AGEs. Fibroblasts proliferation, ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2, \u03b1-SMA, and RAGE expression were studied.\nCompared with the control group, in vivo treatment with Ator significantly retarded the AGEs-induced diastolic function and attenuated cardiac fibrosis, \u03b1-SMA, and RAGE over expression induced by AGEs.

Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a transcription inhibitor, and plays a key role in the fibrotic diseases. However, the precise role of MeCP2 in cardiac fibrosis remains unclear. \u03b1-tubulin plays an essential role in cell function, whereby the acetylation state of \u03b1-Tubulin dictates the efficiency of cell proliferation and differentiation. This study was undertaken to investigate that MeCP2 dynamics affect the acetylation state of \u03b1-tubulin in the cardiac fibrosis.\nForty adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into two groups, cardiac fibrosis was produced by common ISO. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were harvested from SD neonate rats and cultured. The expression of HDAC6, MeCP2, \u03b1-SMA, collagen I was measured by western blotting and qRT-PCR. siRNA of HDAC6 and MeCP2 effect the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts, and affect the acetylation state of \u03b1-tubulin.\nWe have found the acetylation state of \u03b1-tubulin in cardiac fibroblasts as well as cardiac tissue from a ISO-induced rat cardiac fibrosis model and observed a reduction in acetylated \u03b1-tubulin and an increase in the \u03b1-tubulin-specific deacetylase, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Furthermore, we have shown that treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with HDAC6 inhibitor Tubastatin A and HDAC6-siRNA can restore \u03b1-tubulin acetylation levels. In addition, treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with MeCP2-siRNA blocked cell proliferation. Knockdown of MeCP2 suppresses HDAC6 expression in activated cardiac fibroblasts but increases the acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin.\nWe demonstrated that MeCP2 may negatively control the acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin through HDAC6 in cardiac fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis.

{"title": "Construction of Defined Human Engineered Cardiac Tissues to Study Mechanisms of Cardiac Cell Therapy.", "abstract": "Human cardiac tissue engineering can fundamentally impact therapeutic discovery through the development of new species-specific screening systems that replicate the biofidelity of three-dimensional native human myocardium, while also enabling a controlled level of biological complexity, and allowing non-destructive longitudinal monitoring of tissue contractile function. Initially, human engineered cardiac tissues (hECT) were created using the entire cell population obtained from directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells, which typically yielded less than 50% cardiomyocytes. However, to create reliable predictive models of human myocardium, and to elucidate mechanisms of heterocellular interaction, it is essential to accurately control the biological composition in engineered tissues. To address this limitation, we utilize live cell sorting for the cardiac surface marker SIRP\u03b1 and the fibroblast marker CD90 to create tissues containing a 3:1 ratio of these cell types, respectively, that are then mixed together and added to a collagen-based matrix solution. Resulting hECTs are, thus, completely defined in both their cellular and extracellular matrix composition. Here we describe the construction of defined hECTs as a model system to understand mechanisms of cell-cell interactions in cell therapies, using an example of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) that are currently being used in human clinical trials. The defined tissue composition is imperative to understand how the hMSCs may be interacting with the endogenous cardiac cell types to enhance tissue function. A bioreactor system is also described that simultaneously cultures six hECTs in parallel, permitting more efficient use of the cells after sorting.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2016-03-12", "authors": ["Timothy JCashman", "RebeccaJosowitz", "Bruce DGelb", "Ronald ALi", "Nicole CDubois", "Kevin DCosta"], "doi": "10.3791/53447"}

To this end, female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 28) were anesthetized either with ketamine (80-120 mg/kg, i.p.) or with one minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) sevoflurane (2% v/v). Following in vivo hepatic ischemia procedure, the liver was isolated and reperfusion was produced. During the period of reperfusion, liver reperfusion samples were collected, and the concentrations of heparan sulfate and syndecan-1 (Syn-1), and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzymes, were measured. The morphology of hepatocytes and endothelial glycocalyx were then assessed by using the light and electron microscopies, respectively. Ischemia-reperfusion increased the release of HS and Syn-1, and elevated the levels of ALT and AST in a time-dependent manner. However, sevoflurane pretreatment reduced the release of HS and Syn-1and attenuated the levels of ALT and AST, in a time-dependent manner, as compared with ketamine pretreatment.

Radiation-induced changes in cardiac DNA methylation associated with repetitive elements were detected. Specifically, modest hypomethylation of retrotransposon LINE-1 was observed at day 7 after irradiation with either protons or (56)Fe. This was followed by LINE-1, and other retrotransposons, ERV2 and SINE B1, as well as major satellite DNA hypermethylation at day 90 after irradiation with (56)Fe. These changes in DNA methylation were accompanied by alterations in the expression of DNA methylation machinery and affected the one-carbon metabolism pathway. Furthermore, loss of transposable elements expression was detected in the cardiac tissue at the 90-day time-point, paralleled by substantial accumulation of mRNA transcripts, associated with major satellites. Given that the one-carbon metabolism pathway can be modulated by dietary modifications, these findings suggest a potential strategy for the mitigation and, possibly, prevention of the negative effects exerted by ionizing radiation on the cardiovascular system.

The mice developed a complex form of acute RHD with tissue hardening in the absence of either NKX2-5 or Smad-6 which are confirmed in NKX2-5 or Smad-6 null mice. Immunohistochemical studies reveal that the NKX2-5 and Smad-6 expression get down regulated on developing with RHD. Through experiments, we detected that both Nkx2-5 and Smad-6 are both inter-dependable and it negatively regulated each other by inhibiting them. In the absence of NKX2-5 or Smad-6, a severe form of RHD is observed together with down-regulation of either NKX2-5 or Smad-6.\nThe present investigation of NKX2-5 and Smad-6 in RHD provides a new insight of data that helps to understand the disease pathogenesis.", "journal": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "date": "2016-03-10", "authors": ["X-LLu", "X-LYao", "C-YYan", "Q-LWan", "Y-MLi"], "doi": null}

Among many factors that contribute to development and progression of diabetic complications is angiotensin II (Ang2). Activation of pathological arm of renin-angiotensin system results in increased levels of Ang2 and signaling through angiotensin type 1 receptor. This pathway is well recognized for its role in induction of oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, hypertrophy and fibrosis. Angiotensin (1-7) [A(1-7)], through activation of Mas receptor, opposes the actions of Ang2 which can result in the amelioration of diabetic complications; enhancing the overall welfare of diabetic patients. In this study, 8 week-old db/db mice were administered A(1-7) daily via subcutaneous injections. After 16 weeks of treatment, echocardiographic assessment of heart function demonstrated significant improvement in cardiac output, stroke volume and shortening fraction in diabetic animals. A(1-7) also prevented cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, apoptosis, lipid accumulation, and decreased diabetes-induced fibrosis and OS in the heart tissue. Treatment with A(1-7) reduced levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines that contribute to the low grade inflammation observed in diabetes. In addition, lung pathologies associated with type 2 diabetes, including fibrosis and congestion, were decreased with treatment. OS and macrophage infiltration were also reduced in the lungs after treatment with A(1-7). Long-term administration of A(1-7) to db/db mice is effective in improving heart and lung function in db/db mice. Treatment prevented pathological remodeling of the tissues and reduced OS, fibrosis and inflammation.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2016-03-10", "authors": ["Anna MPapinska", "MairaSoto", "Christopher JMeeks", "Kathleen ERodgers"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2016.02.026"}
{"title": "Stromal Cells in Dense Collagen Promote Cardiomyocyte and Microvascular Patterning in Engineered Human Heart Tissue.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering is a strategy to replace damaged contractile tissue and model cardiac diseases to discover therapies. Current cardiac and vascular engineering approaches independently create aligned contractile tissue or perfusable vasculature, but a combined vascularized cardiac tissue remains to be achieved. Here, we sought to incorporate a patterned microvasculature into engineered heart tissue, which balances the competing demands from cardiomyocytes to contract the matrix versus the vascular lumens that need structural support. Low-density collagen hydrogels (1.25\u2009mg/mL) permit human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) to form a dense contractile tissue but cannot support a patterned microvasculature. Conversely, high collagen concentrations (density \u22656\u2009mg/mL) support a patterned microvasculature, but the hESC-CMs lack cell-cell contact, limiting their electrical communication, structural maturation, and tissue-level contractile function. When cocultured with matrix remodeling stromal cells, however, hESC-CMs structurally mature and form anisotropic constructs in high-density collagen. Remodeling requires the stromal cells to be in proximity with hESC-CMs. In addition, cocultured cardiac constructs in dense collagen generate measurable active contractions (on the order of 0.1\u2009mN/mm(2)) and can be paced up to 2\u2009Hz. Patterned microvascular networks in these high-density cocultured cardiac constructs remain patent through 2 weeks of culture, and hESC-CMs show electrical synchronization. The ability to maintain microstructural control within engineered heart tissue enables generation of more complex features, such as cellular alignment and a vasculature.

Since adult cardiac cells are limited in their proliferation, cardiac tissue with dead or damaged cardiac cells downstream of the occluded vessel does not regenerate after myocardial infarction. The cardiac tissue is then replaced with nonfunctional fibrotic scar tissue rather than new cardiac cells, which leaves the heart weak. The limited proliferation ability of host cardiac cells has motivated investigators to research the potential cardiac regenerative ability of stem cells. Considerable progress has been made in this endeavor. However, the optimum type of stem cells along with the most suitable matrix-material and cellular microenvironmental cues are yet to be identified or agreed upon. This review presents an overview of various types of biofunctional materials and biomaterial matrices, which in combination with stem cells, have shown promises for cardiac tissue replacement and reinforcement.

This study was designed as a comparison of human umbilical cord blood (HUCB)-derived CD34+ and HUCB-derived MSCs for the repair of cardiac tissue by induction of the angiogenesis. Forty-eight male rats were randomized into four groups: sham-operated group, MI group, MSCs-treated group, and CD34+ cells-treated group. After 4 weeks, the rats were sacrificed. All sections from left ventricles of all groups were subjected to hematoxylin & eosin, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemical stains (CD133, CD44, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin).

Such direct programming has been clearly realized with the use of transcription factors, microRNAs and more recently small molecule delivery to enhance epigenetic modifications, all albeit with low efficiencies in vitro. In this review, we aim to present a brief overview of the current in vitro and in vivo transdifferentiation strategies in the generation of cardiomyocytes from somatic sources. The interdisciplinary fields of tissue, cell, material and regenerative engineering offer many opportunities to synergistically achieve directly programmed cardiac tissue in vitro and enhance transdifferentiation in vivo. This review aims to present a concise outlook on this topic with these fields in mind.", "journal": "Current opinion in biotechnology", "date": "2016-03-08", "authors": ["Michael GMonaghan", "MonikaHoleiter", "Shannon LLayland", "KatjaSchenke-Layland"], "doi": "10.1016/j.copbio.2016.02.014"}
{"title": "Visualizing allele-specific expression in single cells reveals epigenetic mosaicism in an H19 loss-of-imprinting mutant.", "abstract": "Imprinting is a classic mammalian epigenetic phenomenon that results in expression from a single parental allele. Imprinting defects can lead to inappropriate expression from the normally silenced allele, but it remains unclear whether every cell in a mutant organism follows the population average, which would have profound implications for human imprinting disorders. Here, we apply a new fluorescence in situ hybridization method that measures allele-specific expression in single cells to address this question in mutants exhibiting aberrant H19/Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) imprinting. We show that mutant primary embryonic mouse fibroblasts are comprised of two subpopulations: one expressing both H19 alleles and another expressing only the maternal copy. Only in the latter cell population is Igf2 expression detected. Furthermore, the two subpopulations are stable in that cells do not interconvert between the two expression patterns. Combined small input methylation analysis and transcriptional imaging revealed that these two mutant subpopulations exhibit distinct methylation patterns at their imprinting control regions. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of DNA methylation reduced the proportion of monoallelic cells. Importantly, we observed that the same two subpopulations are also present in vivo within murine cardiac tissue. Our results establish that imprinting disorders can display striking single-cell heterogeneity in their molecular phenotypes and suggest that such heterogeneity may underlie epigenetic mosaicism in human imprinting disorders.", "journal": "Genes & development", "date": "2016-03-06", "authors": ["PaulGinart", "Jennifer MKalish", "Connie LJiang", "Alice CYu", "Marisa SBartolomei", "ArjunRaj"], "doi": "10.1101/gad.275958.115"}
{"title": "Digoxin-Mediated Upregulation of RGS2 Protein Protects against Cardiac Injury.", "abstract": "Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins have emerged as novel drug targets since their discovery almost two decades ago. RGS2 has received particular interest in cardiovascular research due to its role in regulating Gqsignaling in the heart and vascular smooth muscle. RGS2(-/-)mice are hypertensive, prone to heart failure, and display accelerated kidney fibrosis. RGS2 is rapidly degraded through the proteasome, and human mutations leading to accelerated RGS2 protein degradation correlate with hypertension. Hence, stabilizing RGS2 protein expression could be a novel route in treating cardiovascular disease. We previously identified cardiotonic steroids, including digoxin, as selective stabilizers of RGS2 protein in vitro. In the current study we investigated the functional effects of digoxin-mediated RGS2 protein stabilization in vivo. Using freshly isolated myocytes from wild-type and RGS2(-/-)mice treated with vehicle or low-dose digoxin (2\u00b5g/kg/day for 7 days) we demonstrated that agonist-induced cAMP levels and cardiomyocyte contractility was inhibited by digoxin in wild-type but not in RGS2(-/-)mice. This inhibition was accompanied by an increase in RGS2 protein levels in cardiomyocytes as well as in whole heart tissue. Furthermore, digoxin had protective effects in a model of cardiac injury in wild-type mice and this protection was lost in RGS2(-/-)mice. Digoxin is the oldest known therapy for heart failure; however, beyond its activity at the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, the exact mechanism of action is not known. The current study adds a novel mechanism, whereby through stabilizing RGS2 protein levels digoxin could exert its protective effects in the failing heart.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["BenitaSj\u00f6gren", "SergioParra", "Kevin BAtkins", "BehirdaKaraj", "Richard RNeubig"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.115.231571"}
{"title": "Opsin spectral sensitivity determines the effectiveness of optogenetic termination of ventricular fibrillation in the human heart: a simulation study.", "abstract": "Optogenetics-based defibrillation, a theoretical alternative to electrotherapy, involves expression of light-sensitive ion channels in the heart (via gene or cell therapy) and illumination of the cardiac surfaces (via implanted LED arrays) to elicit light-induced activations. We used a biophysically detailed human ventricular model to determine whether such a therapy could terminate fibrillation (VF) and identify which combinations of light-sensitive ion channel properties and illumination configurations would be effective. Defibrillation was successful when a large proportion (>\u00a016.6%) of ventricular tissue was directly stimulated by light that was bright enough to induce an action potential in an uncoupled cell. While illumination with blue light never successfully terminated VF, illumination of red light-sensitive ion channels with dense arrays of implanted red light sources resulted in successful defibrillation. Our results suggest that cardiac expression of red light-sensitive ion channels is necessary for the development of effective optogenetics-based defibrillation therapy using LED arrays.\nOptogenetics-based defibrillation has been proposed as a novel and potentially pain-free approach to enable cardiomyocyte-selective defibrillation in humans, but the feasibility of such a therapy remains unknown. This study aimed to (1) assess the feasibility of terminating sustained ventricular fibrillation (VF) via light-induced excitation of opsins expressed throughout the myocardium and (2) identify the ideal (theoretically possible) opsin properties and light source configurations that would maximise therapeutic efficacy. We conducted electrophysiological simulations in an MRI-based human ventricular model with VF induced by rapid pacing; light sensitisation via systemic, cardiac-specific gene transfer of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) was simulated. In addition to the widely used blue light-sensitive ChR2-H134R, we also modelled theoretical ChR2 variants with augmented light sensitivity (ChR2+), red-shifted spectral sensitivity (ChR2-RED) or both (ChR2-RED+).

The aim in the present study was to investigate whether treatment with fluoxetine (Fx), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, mimics the detrimental effect of low-protein diet during the perinatal period on the male rat heart. Our hypothesis is that increased circulating serotonin as a result of pharmacologic treatment with Fx leads to cardiac dysfunction similar to that observed in protein-restricted rats. Male Wistar rat pups received daily subcutaneous injection of Fx or vehicle from postnatal day 1 to postnatal day 21. Male rats were euthanized at 60 days of age and the following parameters were evaluated in the cardiac tissue: mitochondrial respiratory capacity, respiratory control ratio, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense. We found that Fx treatment increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity (123%) and membrane potential (212%) and decreased ROS production (55%). In addition we observed an increase in the antioxidant capacity (elevation in catalase activity (5-fold) and glutathione peroxidase (4.6-fold)).

Given that plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (CA) in red muscle of rainbow trout has recently been shown to facilitate oxygen unloading from arterial blood under certain physiological conditions, we tested the hypothesis that plasma-accessible CA is present in the lumen of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) hearts, and may therefore assist in the luminal oxygen supply to the spongy myocardium, which has no coronary circulation. We demonstrate a widespread distribution of CA throughout the heart chambers, including lumen-facing cells in the atrium, and confirm that the membrane-bound isoform ca4 is expressed in the atrium and ventricle of the heart. Further, we confirm that CA catalytic activity is available to blood in the atrial lumen using a modified electrometric \u0394pH assay in intact atria in combination with either a membrane-impermeable CA inhibitor or specific cleavage of the Ca4 membrane anchor. Combined, these results support our hypothesis of the presence of an enhanced oxygen delivery system in the lumen of a salmonid heart, which could help support oxygen delivery when the oxygen content of venous blood becomes greatly reduced, such as after burst exercise and during environmental hypoxia.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["Sarah LAlderman", "Till SHarter", "Jonathan MWilson", "Claudiu TSupuran", "Anthony PFarrell", "Colin JBrauner"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.130443"}

Infiltration and/or migration of macrophages into the infarct area early after MI is critical for infarct healing, vascularization, and cardiac function. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been demonstrated to possess cardioprotective effects post MI and during the progress of cardiac remodeling. However, the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in macrophage recruitment by H2S remain to be identified. In this study, the NaHS (exogenous sources of H2S) treatment exerted an increased infiltration of macrophages into the infarcted myocardium at early stage of MI cardiac tissues in both wild type (WT) and cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase-knockout (CSE-KO) mice. And NaHS accelerated the migration of macrophage cells in vitro. While, the inhibitors not only significantly diminished the migratory ability in response to NaHS, but also blocked the activation of phospho-Src, -Pyk2, -FAK(397), and -FAK(925). Furthermore, NaHS induced the internalization of integrin \u03b21 on macrophage surface, but, integrin \u03b21 silencing inhibited macrophage migration and Src signaling activation.

Herein we observed that pneumococcal invasion of the myocardium occurred soon after development of bacteremia and was continuous thereafter. Using immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM), we observed that S. pneumoniae replication within the heart preceded visual signs of tissue damage in cardiac tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Different S. pneumoniae strains caused distinct cardiac pathologies: strain TIGR4, a serotype 4 isolate, caused discrete pneumococcus-filled microscopic lesions (microlesions), whereas strain D39, a serotype 2 isolate, was, in most instances, detectable only using IFM and was associated with foci of cardiomyocyte hydropic degeneration and immune cell infiltration. Both strains efficiently invaded the myocardium, but cardiac damage was entirely dependent on the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin only for D39. Early microlesions caused by TIGR4 and microlesions formed by a TIGR4 pneumolysin-deficient mutant were infiltrated with CD11b(+) and Ly6G-positive neutrophils and CD11b(+) and F4/80-positive (F4/80(+)) macrophages. We subsequently demonstrated that macrophages in TIGR4-infected hearts died as a result of pneumolysin-induced necroptosis. The effector of necroptosis, phosphorylated mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), was detected in CD11b(+) and F4/80(+) cells associated with microlesions. Likewise, treatment of infected mice and THP-1 macrophages in vitro with the receptor-interacting protein 1 kinase (RIP1) inhibitor necrostatin-5 promoted the formation of purulent microlesions and blocked cell death, respectively.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1(HIF-1\u03b1) is a core transcription factor for restoring homeostasis in intracellular oxygen and has a crucial role in preventing the development of DCM. However, the effect of HIF-1\u03b1 in T lymphocytes on DCM has not been reported. We established T lymphocyte-specific HIF-1\u03b1 knockout homozygous mice that were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) for establishing diabetic models. Random blood glucose (RBG), body weight and the survival rate were detected. The cardiac pathological changes were evaluated by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) and Masson collagen staining. Cardiac function measurements were obtained by echocardiography. We observed the infiltration of T lymphocytes/CD3+ in the hearts by immunofluorescence stain. Also, we isolated splenic lymphocytes which would be in vitro cultured in the environment of high glucose and hypoxia. HIF-1\u03b1 protein level of splenic lymphocytes was measured by Western blot. The results of this study indicate that the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in lymphocytes is activated in the complex environment of DCM consisting of hypoxia and high glucose. Also, HIF-1\u03b1 in T cells plays a critical role in avoiding damage to the diabetic cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Annals of clinical and laboratory science", "date": "2016-03-02", "authors": ["YeLin", "YingTang", "FangWang"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Cardiovascular manifestations of renovascular hypertension in diabetic mice.", "abstract": "Purpose. Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of end stage renal disease in the United States. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is commonly observed in diabetic patients and impacts the rate of renal and cardiovascular disease progression. We sought to test the hypothesis that renovascular hypertension, induced by unilateral renal artery stenosis, exacerbates cardiac remodeling in leptin-deficient (db/db) mice, which serves as a model of human type II diabetes. Methods. We employed a murine model of renovascular hypertension through placement of a polytetrafluoroethylene cuff on the right renal artery in db/db mice. We studied 109 wild-type (non-diabetic, WT) and 95 db/db mice subjected to renal artery stenosis (RAS) or sham surgery studied at 1, 2, 4, and 6+ weeks following surgery. Cardiac remodeling was assessed by quantitative analysis of the percent of myocardial surface area occupied by interstitial fibrosis tissue, as delineated by trichrome stained slides. Aortic pathology was assessed by histologic sampling of grossly apparent structural abnormalities or by section of ascending aorta of vessels without apparent abnormalities. Results. We noted an increased mortality in db/db mice subjected to RAS. The mortality rate of db/db RAS mice was about 23.5%, whereas the mortality rate of WT RAS mice was only 1.5%. Over 60% of mortality in the db/db mice occurred in the first two weeks following RAS surgery. Necropsy showed massive intrathoracic hemorrhage associated with aortic dissection, predominantly in the ascending aorta and proximal descending aorta. Aortas from db/db RAS mice showed more smooth muscle dropout, loss of alpha smooth muscle actin expression, medial disruption, and hemorrhage than aortas from WT mice with RAS. Cardiac tissue from db/db RAS mice had more fibrosis than did cardiac tissue from WT RAS mice. Conclusions. db/db mice subjected to RAS are prone to develop fatal aortic dissection, which is not observed in WT mice with RAS. The db/db RAS model provides the basis for future studies directed towards defining basic mechanisms underlying the interaction of hypertension and diabetes on the development of aortic lesions.", "journal": "PeerJ", "date": "2016-03-01", "authors": ["SonuKashyap", "SeanEngel", "MazenOsman", "YousifAl-Saiegh", "AsarnWongjarupong", "Joseph PGrande"], "doi": "10.7717/peerj.1736\n10.4330/wjc.v6.i8.855\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.09.050\n10.1161/01.RES.54.3.286\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001963\n10.1080/17471060701649962\n10.1152/ajprenal.90439.2008\n10.1042/CS20090372\n10.1177/0003319715606255\n10.1067/mva.2002.127351\n10.1161/01.CIR.93.6.1148\n10.1016/j.coph.2010.01.006\n10.1186/1471-2369-15-58\n10.1016/S0002-9343(00)00605-7\n10.1093/ndt/gfq269\n10.1016/j.jash.2014.01.008\n10.1016/S0002-9343(03)00158-X\n10.3961/jpmph.2014.47.4.216\n10.1161/01.RES.68.4.905\n10.1056/NEJMoa055695\n10.1586/14779072.2015.1100537\n10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2015.08.011\n10.3791/3741\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.248161\n10.1093/eurheartj/eht108\n10.1056/NEJM200102083440607\n10.1177/0003319715602414\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000269\n10.2337/dc14-1296\n10.2337/diacare.23.4.539\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.1.73\n10.1152/ajprenal.00706.2012\n10.1152/ajprenal.00645.2011\n10.1053/euhj.2002.3314"}

Amino acid analyses revealed high glutamic and aspartic acid, but the sulfur amino acids were the most limited. The present study was designed to investigate the role of Adansonia digitata (Baobab fruit pulp) against isoproterenol induced myocardial oxidative stress in experimental rats by demonstrating the changes in tissue cardiac markers, some antioxidant enzymes, interleukin-1 \u03b2 (IL-1 \u03b2), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(MCP-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), Collagen-1, galectin-3, and serum corticosterone. The activities of enzymatic antioxidant glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and non-enzymatic antioxidant reduced glutathione (GSH) in the heart tissue; additionally, histopathological examination of the heart was estimated. Male albino rats were randomly divided into four groups of ten animals each. Group I served as normal control animal.

To unpin these life-threatening spiral waves, methods of wave emission from heterogeneities (WEH) induced by low-voltage pulsed DC electric fields (PDCEFs) and circularly polarized electric fields (CPEFs) have been used in two-dimensional (2D) cardiac tissues. Nevertheless, the unpinning of scroll waves in three-dimensional (3D) cardiac systems is much more difficult than that of spiral waves in 2D cardiac systems, and there are few reports on the removal of pinned scroll waves in 3D cardiac tissues by electric fields. In this article, we investigate in detail the removal of pinned scroll waves in a generic model of 3D excitable media using PDCEF, AC electric field (ACEF) and CPEF, respectively. We find that spherical waves can be induced from the heterogeneities by these electric fields in initially quiescent excitable media. However, only CPEF can induce spherical waves with frequencies higher than that of the pinned scroll wave. Such higher-frequency spherical waves induced by CPEF can be used to drive the pinned scroll wave out of the cardiac systems.

{"title": "Harnessing the secretome of cardiac stem cells as therapy for ischemic heart disease.", "abstract": "Adult stem cells continue to promise opportunities to repair damaged cardiac tissue. However, precisely how adult stem cells accomplish cardiac repair, especially after ischemic damage, remains controversial. It has been postulated that the clinical benefit of adult stem cells for cardiovascular disease results from the release of cytokines and growth factors by the transplanted cells. Studies in animal models of myocardial infarction have reported that such paracrine factors released from transplanted adult stem cells contribute to improved cardiac function by several processes. These include promoting neovascularization of damaged tissue, reducing inflammation, reducing fibrosis and scar formation, as well as protecting cardiomyocytes from apoptosis. In addition, these factors might also stimulate endogenous repair by activating cardiac stem cells. Interestingly, stem cells discovered to be resident in the heart appear to be functionally superior to extra-cardiac adult stem cells when transplanted for cardiac repair and regeneration. In this review, we discuss the therapeutic potential of cardiac stem cells and how the proteins secreted from these cells might be harnessed to promote repair and regeneration of damaged cardiac tissue. We also highlight how recent controversies about the efficacy of adult stem cells in clinical trials of ischemic heart disease have not dampened enthusiasm for the application of cardiac stem cells and their paracrine factors for cardiac repair: the latter have proved superior to the mesenchymal stem cells used in most clinical trials in the past, some of which appear to have been conducted with sub-optimal rigor.", "journal": "Biochemical pharmacology", "date": "2016-02-24", "authors": ["RaminKhanabdali", "Ayeshah ARosdah", "Gregory JDusting", "Shiang YLim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bcp.2016.02.012"}
{"title": "[Correlation between uncoupling protein 2 expression and myocardial mitochondrial injury in rats with sepsis induced by lipopolysaccharide].", "abstract": "To investigate the correlation between uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) expression and myocardial mitochondria injury in rats with sepsis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\nThe rat model of sepsis was established through an intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly and equally divided into control group (an intraperitoneal injection of normal saline), sepsis 6\u2005h group (LPS-6\u2005h group), sepsis 12\u2005h group (LPS-12\u2005h group), sepsis 24\u2005h group (LPS-24\u2005h group), and sepsis 48\u2005h group (LPS-48\u2005h group). The serum and heart tissues were harvested at corresponding time points and myocardial mitochondria was extracted. The microplate reader was applied to measure creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Flow cytometry was applied to measure the degree of mitochondrial swelling and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Western blot was used to measure the expression level of UCP2. Electron microscopy was applied to observe the morphological changes in heart tissues and myocardial mitochondria.\nCompared with the control group, the LPS groups had significantly increased serum levels of CK, CK-MB, and myocardial ROS, as well as a significantly increased degree of mitochondrial swelling (P<0.05), and these values reached their peaks at 24 hours after LPS injection. The LPS groups had a significant decrease in MMP (P<0.05), which reached the lowest level at 24 hours after LPS injection. Western blot showed that the LPS groups had a significant increase in the expression level of myocardial UCP2 compared with the control group (P<0.05), which reached its peak at 24 hours after LPS injection. The results of electron microscopy showed mitochondrial swelling, partial rupture of the mitochondrial membrane, and cavity formation in rats in the LPS groups. The most severe lesions occurred in the LPS-24 h group. In rats with LPS, the ROS level in the myocardial mitochondria and the degree of mitochondrial swelling were positively correlated with the expression level of UCP2 (r=0.796 and 0.893, respectively; P<0.05), while MMP was negatively correlated with the expression level of UCP2 (r=-0.903, P<0.05).\nIn the rat model of sepsis, the myocardium and myocardial mitochondria have obvious injuries, and the expression level of UCP2 is closely correlated with mitochondrial injury. Therefore, UCP2 might play an important role in myocardial mitochondrial injury in sepsis.\n\u63a2\u8ba8\u89e3\u5076\u8054\u86cb\u767d2(uncoupling protein 2, UCP2)\u4e0e\u8102\u591a\u7cd6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u5927\u9f20\u5fc3\u808c\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u635f\u4f24\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n\u901a\u8fc7\u8179\u8154\u6ce8\u5c04\u8102\u591a\u7cd6(LPS)\u5efa\u7acb\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5c0640\u53eaSprague-Dawley(SD)\u96c4\u6027\u5927\u9f20\u968f\u673a\u5206\u4e3a5\u7ec4, \u6bcf\u7ec48\u53ea:\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4(\u8179\u8154\u6ce8\u5c04\u751f\u7406\u76d0\u6c34)\u3001\u8113\u6bd2\u75c76 h\u7ec4(LPS-6 h\u7ec4)\u3001\u8113\u6bd2\u75c712 h\u7ec4(LPS-12 h\u7ec4)\u3001\u8113\u6bd2\u75c724 h\u7ec4(LPS-24 h\u7ec4)\u548c\u8113\u6bd2\u75c748 h\u7ec4(LPS-48 h\u7ec4)\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7559\u53d6\u5927\u9f20\u8840\u6e05\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7, \u63d0\u53d6\u5fc3\u808c\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53, \u901a\u8fc7\u9176\u6807\u4eea\u68c0\u6d4b\u808c\u9178\u6fc0\u9176(CK)\u3001\u808c\u9178\u6fc0\u9176\u540c\u5de5\u9176(CK-MB)\u548c\u6d3b\u6027\u6c27(ROS)\u6c34\u5e73, \u6d41\u5f0f\u7ec6\u80de\u4eea\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u80bf\u80c0\u5ea6\u548c\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u819c\u7535\u4f4d(MMP), \u91c7\u7528\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u514d\u75ab\u5370\u8ff9\u8bd5\u9a8c(Western blot)\u6d4b\u5b9aUCP2\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73; \u7535\u955c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u6bd4\u8f83, LPS\u5404\u7ec4\u8840\u6e05CK\u3001CK-MB\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec4\u7ec7ROS\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u80bf\u80c0\u5ea6\u5747\u660e\u663e\u5347\u9ad8(\n\u5728\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u5927\u9f20\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d, \u5fc3\u808c\u548c\u5fc3\u808c\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u90fd\u660e\u663e\u635f\u4f24, \u5fc3\u808c\u7ec4\u7ec7UCP2\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u635f\u4f24\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173, \u63a8\u6d4bUCP2\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u5fc3\u808c\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u635f\u4f24\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "journal": "Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics", "date": "2016-02-24", "authors": ["Jin-DaHuang", "Sheng-LiChen", "Juan-JuanLyu", "CuiLiu", "Qi-YiZeng"], "doi": "10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2016.02.012\n10.3390/ijms160817763\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2014.05.031\n10.1152/ajpheart.00203.2011\n10.3969/j.issn.2095-5340.2014.02.007\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2013.10.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0063435\n10.1097/01.rli.0000227494.17444.64\n10.3760/cma.j.issn.2095-428X.2015.06.007\n10.1189/jlb.0806542\n10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-9030.2013.05.085\n10.25011/cim.v37i2.21087\n10.1097/01.shk.0000055241.25446.5f\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000286\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.07.084\n10.1371/journal.pone.0069452\n10.1165/rcmb.2012-0361OC\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4269-04.2005\n10.1038/nm903\n10.3892/ijmm.2015.2177"}
{"title": "Effects of Adrenomedullin on Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiac Damage in Mice.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the best known anticancer drugs, and is used in the treatment of lymphoma, lung cancer, stomach cancer, and a number of other cancers. However, DOX has some serious side effects, the worst being lethal heart failure. Occasionally, its side effects result in the cessation of the anticancer treatment, thus having a serious adverse influence on prognosis. Agents that can be administered as alternative prophylactics or to ameliorate the side effects of DOX will be useful in increasing the safety and efficacy of anticancer therapy. Adrenomedullin (AM) is a peptide hormone secreted by many organs, including the heart; it has an organ-protective effect, including antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative stress. Blood AM levels increase with heart failure; endogenic AM has been suggested in order to protect the heart. Furthermore, exogenous AM administration has shown therapeutic effects for heart failure in patients. However, it is unclear whether AM can protect the heart against drug-induced cardiac injury in vivo. The present study was performed in order to investigate the effects of AM on DOX-induced cardiac damage. Male BALB/c mice were treated with DOX and/or AM. Exogenous AM improved the survival ratio of DOX-treated mice. In addition, AM reduced serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels following DOX treatment. On pathological examination, AM was shown to inhibit DOX-induced cardiac tissue damage, mitochondrial abnormality, and cell death. These findings suggest that AM has a protective effect against DOX-induced cardiac damage.", "journal": "Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin", "date": "2016-02-24", "authors": ["TakahiroYoshizawa", "ShoTakizawa", "ShinShimada", "TakeshiTokudome", "TakayukiShindo", "KiyoshiMatsumoto"], "doi": "10.1248/bpb.b15-00832"}
{"title": "Lactosylceramide contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetes.", "abstract": "Sphingolipids have been implicated as key mediators of cell-stress responses and effectors of mitochondrial function. To investigate potential mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction, an important contributor to diabetic cardiomyopathy, we examined alterations of cardiac sphingolipid metabolism in a mouse with streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes. Diabetes increased expression of desaturase 1, (dihydro)ceramide synthase (CerS)2, serine palmitoyl transferase 1, and the rate of ceramide formation by mitochondria-resident CerSs, indicating an activation of ceramide biosynthesis. However, the lack of an increase in mitochondrial ceramide suggests concomitant upregulation of ceramide-metabolizing pathways. Elevated levels of lactosylceramide, one of the initial products in the formation of glycosphingolipids were accompanied with decreased respiration and calcium retention capacity (CRC) in mitochondria from diabetic heart tissue. In baseline mitochondria, lactosylceramide potently suppressed state 3 respiration and decreased CRC, suggesting lactosylceramide as the primary sphingolipid responsible for mitochondrial defects in diabetic hearts. Moreover, knocking down the neutral ceramidase (NCDase) resulted in an increase in lactosylceramide level, suggesting a crosstalk between glucosylceramide synthase- and NCDase-mediated ceramide utilization pathways. These data suggest the glycosphingolipid pathway of ceramide metabolism as a promising target to correct mitochondrial abnormalities associated with type 1 diabetes.", "journal": "Journal of lipid research", "date": "2016-02-24", "authors": ["Sergei ANovgorodov", "Christopher LRiley", "JinYu", "Jarryd AKeffler", "Christopher JClarke", "An OVan Laer", "Catalin FBaicu", "Michael RZile", "Tatyana IGudz"], "doi": "10.1194/jlr.M060061"}
{"title": "CARD9 knockout ameliorates myocardial dysfunction associated with high fat diet-induced obesity.", "abstract": "Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation which plays a critical role in the development of cardiovascular dysfunction. Because the adaptor protein caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) in macrophages regulates innate immune responses via activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we hypothesize that CARD9 mediates the pro-inflammatory signaling associated with obesity en route to myocardial dysfunction. C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and CARD9(-/-) mice were fed normal diet (ND, 12% fat) or a high fat diet (HFD, 45% fat) for 5months. At the end of 5-month HFD feeding, cardiac function was evaluated using echocardiography. Cardiomyocytes were isolated and contractile properties were measured. Immunofluorescence was performed to detect macrophage infiltration in the heart. Heart tissue homogenates, plasma, and supernatants from isolated macrophages were collected to measure the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines using ELISA kits. Western immunoblotting analyses were performed on heart tissue homogenates and isolated macrophages to explore the underlying signaling mechanism(s). CARD9 knockout alleviated HFD-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, prevented myocardial dysfunction with preserved cardiac fractional shortening and cardiomyocyte contractile properties. CARD9 knockout also significantly decreased the number of infiltrated macrophages in the heart with reduced myocardium-, plasma-, and macrophage-derived cytokines including IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1. Finally, CARD9 knockout abrogated the increase of p38 MAPK phosphorylation, the decrease of LC3BII/LC3BI ratio and the up-regulation of p62 expression in the heart induced by HFD feeding and restored cardiac autophagy signaling. In conclusion, CARD9 knockout ameliorates myocardial dysfunction associated with HFD-induced obesity, potentially through reduction of macrophage infiltration, suppression of p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and preservation of autophagy in the heart.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2016-02-24", "authors": ["LiCao", "XingQin", "Matthew RPeterson", "Samantha EHaller", "Kayla AWilson", "NanHu", "XinLin", "SreejayanNair", "JunRen", "GuanglongHe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.02.014"}

The objective of this work is to fabricate GBR with an anti-infective electrospun scaffold by ornamenting segmented polyurethane (SPU) with two-dimensional Aloe vera wrapped mesoporous hydroxyapatite (Al-mHA) nanorods. The antimicrobial characteristic of the scaffold has been retrieved from the prepared Al-mHA frame with high aspect ratio (\u223c14.2) via biosynthesis route using Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis miller) extract. The Al-mHA frame was introduced into an unprecedented SPU matrix (solution polymerized) based on combinatorial soft segments of poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(ethylene carbonate) (PEC), and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), by an in situ technique followed by electrospinning to fabricate scaffolds. For comparison, pristine mHA nanorods are also ornamented into it. An enzymatic ring-opening polymerization technique was adapted to synthesize soft segment of (PCL-PEC-b-PDMS). Structure elucidation of the synthesized polymers is established by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Sparingly, Al-mHA ornamented scaffolds exhibit tremendous improvement (175%) in the mechanical properties with promising antimicrobial activity against various human pathogens. After confirmation of high osteoconductivity, improved biodegradation, and excellent biocompatibility against osteoblast-like MG63 cells (in vitro), the scaffolds were implanted in rabbits as an animal model by subcutaneous and intraosseous (tibial) sites. Improved in vivo biocompatibilities, biodegradation, osteoconductivity, and the ability to provide an adequate biomimetic environment for biomineralization for GBR of the scaffolds (SPU and ornamented SPUs) have been found from the various histological sections. Early cartilage formation, endochondral ossification, and rapid bone healing at 4 weeks were found in the defects filled with Al-mHA ornamented scaffold compared to pristine SPU scaffold. Organ toxicity studies further confirm the absence of appreciable tissue architecture abnormalities in the renal hepatic and cardiac tissue sections. The entire results of this study manifest the feasibility of fabricating a mechanically adequate tailored nanofibrous SPU scaffold based on combinatorial soft segments of PCL, PEC, and PDMS by a biomimetic approach and the advantages of an Aloe vera wrapped mHA frame in promoting osteoblast phenotype progression with microbial protection for potential GBR applications.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-02-19", "authors": ["MSelvakumar", "Harpreet SinghPawar", "Nimmy KFrancis", "BodhisatwaDas", "SantanuDhara", "SantanuChattopadhyay"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b01014"}

Here, we show for the first time that TRPV-1 activation through transient culture at 42\u2009\u00b0C in combination with agonists is a simple and useful strategy to eliminate iPS cells from bioengineered cardiac cell sheet tissues. When human iPS cells were cultured at 42\u2009\u00b0C, almost all cells disappeared by 48 hours through apoptosis. However, iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts maintained transcriptional and protein expression levels, and cardiac cell sheets were fabricated after reducing the temperature. TRPV-1 expression in iPS cells was upregulated at 42\u2009\u00b0C, and iPS cell death at 42\u2009\u00b0C was TRPV-1-dependent. Furthermore, TRPV-1 activation through thermal or agonist treatment eliminated iPS cells in cardiac tissues for a final concentration of 0.4% iPS cell contamination. These findings suggest that the difference in tolerance to TRPV-1 activation between iPS cells and iPS cell-derived cardiac cells could be exploited to eliminate remaining iPS cells in bioengineered cell sheet tissues, which will further reduce the risk of tumour formation.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-02-19", "authors": ["KatsuhisaMatsuura", "HiroyoshiSeta", "YujiHaraguchi", "KhaledAlsayegh", "HidekazuSekine", "TatsuyaShimizu", "NobuhisaHagiwara", "KenjiYamazaki", "TeruoOkano"], "doi": "10.1038/srep21747\n10.1002/term.1995"}
{"title": "Long noncoding RNA Chast promotes cardiac remodeling.", "abstract": "Recent studies highlighted long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to play an important role in cardiac development. However, understanding of lncRNAs in cardiac diseases is still limited. Global lncRNA expression profiling indicated that several lncRNA transcripts are deregulated during pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice. Using stringent selection criteria, we identified Chast (cardiac hypertrophy-associated transcript) as a potential lncRNA candidate that influences cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Cell fractionation experiments indicated that Chast is specifically up-regulated in cardiomyocytes in vivo in transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-operated mice. In accordance, CHAST homolog in humans was significantly up-regulated in hypertrophic heart tissue from aortic stenosis patients and in human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes upon hypertrophic stimuli. Viral-based overexpression of Chast was sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. GapmeR-mediated silencing of Chast both prevented and attenuated TAC-induced pathological cardiac remodeling with no early signs on toxicological side effects. Mechanistically, Chast negatively regulated Pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein family M member 1 (opposite strand of Chast), impeding cardiomyocyte autophagy and driving hypertrophy. These results indicate that Chast can be a potential target to prevent cardiac remodeling and highlight a general role of lncRNAs in heart diseases.", "journal": "Science translational medicine", "date": "2016-02-19", "authors": ["JanikaViereck", "RegallaKumarswamy", "ArianaFoinquinos", "KeXiao", "PetrosAvramopoulos", "MeikKunz", "MarcusDittrich", "TobiasMaetzig", "KarinaZimmer", "JanetRemke", "AnnetteJust", "JasminFendrich", "KristianScherf", "EmilianoBolesani", "AxelSchambach", "FrankWeidemann", "RobertZweigerdt", "Leon Jde Windt", "StefanEngelhardt", "ThomasDandekar", "SandorBatkai", "ThomasThum"], "doi": "10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf1475"}

We decellularized porcine heart tissue with trypsin, Triton X-100 or SDS, and analyzed the morphological characteristics of the remaining tissue by SEM, AFM and two-photon LSM. We further recellularized the scaffold with rat myocardial fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes separately. According to the H&E staining and DNA quantification, SDS decellularized more efficiently in comparison to the other two reagents. Moreover, we found distinct surface microarchitecture differences among groups. The changed structure of tissue might result in varied proliferation myocardial fibroblasts and biophysical performance of the engineered heart tissue.

The pathophysiologic changes following acute severe hemorrhage and tissue hypoxia lead to an imbalance of protein acetylation. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) were reported to restore the acetylation imbalance and serve as potential drugs for treating severe hemorrhage. However, the molecular mechanism of HDACI-mediated cytoprotection remains unclear. In this study, we examined the myocardial protective effects and respective mechanism of the HDACI valproic acid (VPA) administered during hemorrhagic and hypoxic stress in vivo and in vitro.\nIn vivo, the therapeutic effect of VPA was evaluated in acute severe hemorrhagic rats, and the expressions of BCL-2 signal pathway molecules were observed in rat heart tissues. To explore the molecular mechanism of VPA-mediated myocardial protection, a cobalt chloride (CoCl2)-induced hypoxia model of rat H9c2 cardiomyoblasts was applied to mimic hypoxic injury raised by acute hemorrhage.\nVPA administration significantly improved the 4-hour survival rate of hemorrhagic animals from 55% to 100% and protected H9c2 cells against CoCl2-induced hypoxic injury at a dose of between 12.5 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM. Increased expression of BCL-2 messenger RNA was observed following VPA treatment in the heart tissues of hemorrhagic rats (approximately 4.9-fold) and in H9c2 cells that survived CoCl2-induced hypoxia (approximately 4.9-fold). Western blot analysis showed a concomitant increase in BCL-2 protein expression and Akt phosphorylation following VPA treatment. The cytoprotective activity of VPA was diminished by triciribine-mediated inhibition of Akt activation and by silencing of BCL-2 gene expression.\nThese findings suggest that VPA protects myocardial cells from hemorrhagic and hypoxic stress through the Akt/BCL-2 survival pathway, indicating a potential use of HDACIs for acute severe hemorrhage treatment.", "journal": "The journal of trauma and acute care surgery", "date": "2016-02-18", "authors": ["ChunyanWang", "YuWang", "ZhixinQiao", "QiyuanKuai", "YanbingWang", "XuanlinWang", "MinHe", "WeijingLi", "YuezhongHe", "SupingRen", "QunYu"], "doi": "10.1097/TA.0000000000000987"}

Forty-eight male ICR mice were divided into four groups. Control group was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 200\u2009\u03bcL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Model group was intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of CTX (200\u2009mg/kg). FA (50\u2009mg/kg) and FA (100\u2009mg/kg) groups were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of CTX (200\u2009mg/kg) followed by the intragastric treatment with FA (50, 100\u2009mg/kg) for 7 consecutive days. After 12\u2009d, the mice were sacrificed to analyze the hematological, biochemical, histological parameters and mechanism research. The results indicated that FA significantly decreased the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in CTX-injected mice. In addition, FA effectively reduced the total numbers of white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin content.

{"title": "Electrical stimulation to optimize cardioprotective exosomes from cardiac stem cells.", "abstract": "Injured or ischemic cardiac tissue has limited intrinsic capacity for regeneration. While stem cell transplantation is a promising approach to stimulating cardiac repair, its success in humans has thus far been limited. Harnessing the therapeutic benefits of stem cells requires a better understanding of their mechanisms of action and methods to optimize their function. Cardiac stem cells (CSC) represent a particularly effective cellular source for cardiac repair, and pre-conditioning CSC with electrical stimulation (EleS) was demonstrated to further enhance their function, although the mechanisms are unknown. Recent studies suggest that transplanted stem cells primarily exert their effects through communicating with endogenous tissues via the release of exosomes containing cardioprotective molecules such as miRNAs, which upon uptake by recipient cells may stimulate survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Exosomes are also effective therapeutic agents in isolation and may provide a feasible alternative to stem cell transplantation. We hypothesize that EleS enhances CSC-mediated cardiac repair through its beneficial effects on production of cardioprotective exosomes. Moreover, we hypothesize that the beneficial effects of biventricular pacing in patients with heart failure may in part result from EleS-induced preconditioning of endogenous CSC to promote cardiac repair. With future research, our hypothesis may provide applications to optimize stem cell therapy and augment current pacing protocols, which may significantly advance the treatment of patients with heart disease.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2016-02-18", "authors": ["C RCampbell", "A EBerman", "N LWeintraub", "Y LTang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2015.12.022"}

However, its role in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains unknown. In this study, we sought to determine the role of NOD2 on cardiac I/R injury.\nMice were induced 30min ischemia followed by 24h of reperfusion. Histological examinations were performed on heart sections with Evans blue and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and protein levels were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis respectively.\nI/R injury markedly upregulated NOD2 expression in heart tissue. Treatment of WT mice with NOD2 ligand (MDP) significantly increased infarct size, the number of apoptotic cells and inflammatory cells, as compared with wild-type mice after I/R injury. Furthermore, MDP enhanced I/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation in vitro, and these effects were attenuated by NOD2-siRNA. The mechanism of NOD2 on cardiac I/R injury is partly associated with JNK, p38MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.\nNOD2 aggravates myocardial I/R injury by inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation through JNK, p38MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.

Differences in the amino acid sequence of rat and human ANG-(1-12) render the human angiotensinogen (hAGT) protein refractory to cleavage by renin. We used transgenic rats harboring the hAGT gene [TGR(hAGT)L1623] to assess the non-renin-dependent effects of increased hAGT expression on heart function and arterial pressure. Compared with Sprague-Dawley (SD) control rats (n= 11), male homozygous TGR(hAGT)L1623 (n= 9) demonstrated sustained daytime and nighttime hypertension associated with no changes in heart rate but increased heart rate lability. Increased heart weight/tibial length ratio and echocardiographic indexes of cardiac hypertrophy were associated with modest reduction of systolic function in hAGT rats. Robust human ANG-(1-12) immunofluorescence within myocytes of TGR(hAGT)L1623 rats was associated with a fourfold increase in cardiac ANG II content. Chymase enzymatic activity, using the rat or human ANG-(1-12) as a substrate, was not different in the cardiac tissue of SD and hAGT rats. Since both cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 activities were not different among the two strains, the changes in cardiac structure and function, blood pressure, and left ventricular ANG II content might be a product of an increased cardiac expression of ANG II generated through a non-renin-dependent mechanism. The data also underscore the existence in the rat of alternate enzymes capable of acting on hAGT protein.

Lack of consistent hiPSC-CM in vitro data can be largely attributed to the inability of conventional culture methods to mimic the structural, biochemical, and mechanical aspects of the myocardial niche accurately. Here, we present a nanogrid culture array comprised of nanogrooved topographies, with groove widths ranging from 350 to 2000 nm, to study the effect of different nanoscale structures on the structural development of hiPSC-CMs in vitro. Nanotopographies were designed to have a biomimetic interface, based on observations of the oriented myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers found in vivo. Nanotopographic substrates were integrated with a self-assembling chimeric peptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) cell adhesion motif. Using this platform, cell adhesion to peptide-coated substrates was found to be comparable to that of conventional fibronectin-coated surfaces. Cardiomyocyte organization and structural development were found to be dependent on the nanotopographical feature size in a biphasic manner, with improved development achieved on grooves in the 700-1000 nm range. These findings highlight the capability of surface-functionalized, bioinspired substrates to influence cardiomyocyte development, and the capacity for such platforms to serve as a versatile assay for investigating the role of topographical guidance cues on cell behavior.

Attenuation has been achieved by shortening the polycytidine tract in the 5' noncoding region (NCR). A poly(C)-truncated strain of mengovirus, vMC24, resulted in significant tumor regression in immunocompetent BALB/c mice bearing syngeneic MPC-11 plasmacytomas, but the associated toxicities were unacceptable. To enhance its safety profile, microRNA target sequences complementary to miR-124 or miR-125 (enriched in nervous tissue), miR-133 and miR-208 (enriched in cardiac tissue), or miR-142 (control; enriched in hematopoietic tissues) were inserted into the vMC24NCRs. The microRNA-detargeted viruses showed reduced replication and cell killing specifically in cells expressing the cognate microRNAs, but certain insertions additionally were associated with nonspecific suppression of viral fitnessin vivo. In vivotoxicity testing confirmed that miR-124 targets within the 5' NCR suppressed virus replication in the central nervous system while miR-133 and miR-208 targets in the 3' NCR suppressed viral replication in cardiac tissue. A dual-detargeted virus named vMC24-NC, with miR-124 targets in the 5' NCR and miR-133 plus miR-208 targets in the 3' NCR, showed the suppression of replication in both nervous and cardiac tissues but retained full oncolytic potency when administered by intratumoral (10(6)50% tissue culture infectious doses [TCID50]) or intravenous (10(7)to 10(8)TCID50) injection into BALB/c mice bearing MPC-11 plasmacytomas. Overall survival of vMC24-NC-treated tumor-bearing mice was significantly improved compared to that of nontreated mice. MicroRNA-detargeted mengoviruses offer a promising oncolytic virotherapy platform that merits further development for clinical translation.\nThe clinical potential of oncolytic virotherapy for cancer treatment has been well demonstrated, justifying the continued development of novel oncolytic viruses with enhanced potency. Here, we introduce mengovirus as a novel oncolytic agent. Mengovirus is appealing as an oncolytic virotherapy platform because of its small size, simple genome structure, rapid replication cycle, and broad cell/species tropism. However, mengovirus can cause encephalomyelitis and myocarditis. It can be partially attenuated by shortening the poly(C) tract in the 5' NCR but remains capable of damaging cardiac and nervous tissue. Here, we further enhanced the safety profile of a poly(C)-truncated mengovirus by incorporating muscle- and neuron-specific microRNA target sequences into the viral genome. This dual-detargeted virus has reduced pathogenesis but retained potent oncolytic activity.

{"title": "Design of a Novel Composite H2 S-Releasing Hydrogel for Cardiac Tissue Repair.", "abstract": "The design of 3D scaffolds is a crucial step in the field of regenerative medicine. Scaffolds should be degradable and bioresorbable as well as display good porosity, interconnecting pores, and topographic features; these properties favour tissue integration and vascularization. These requirements could be fulfilled by hybrid hydrogels using a combination of natural and synthetic components. Here, the mechanical and biological properties of a polyethylene glycol-fibrinogen hydrogel (PFHy) are improved in order to favour the proliferation and differentiation of human Sca-1(pos) cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs). PFHys are modified by embedding air- or perfluorohexane-filled bovine serum albumin microbubbles (MBs) and characterized. Changes in cell morphology are observed in MBs-PFHys, suggesting that MBs could enhance the formation of bundles of cells and influence the direction of the spindle growth. The properties of MBs as carriers of active macromolecules are also exploited. For the first time, enzyme-coated MBs have been used as systems for the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2 S)-releasing scaffolds. Novel H2 S-releasing PFHys are produced, which are able to improve the growth of hCPCs. This novel 3D cell-scaffold system will allow the assessment of the effects of H2 S on the cardiac muscle regeneration with its potential applications in tissue repair.", "journal": "Macromolecular bioscience", "date": "2016-02-10", "authors": ["AriannaMauretti", "AnnalisaNeri", "OlgaKossover", "DrorSeliktar", "Paolo DiNardo", "SoniaMelino"], "doi": "10.1002/mabi.201500430"}
{"title": "All-optical control of cardiac excitation: combined high-resolution optogenetic actuation and optical mapping.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue is an excitable system that can support complex spatiotemporal dynamics, including instabilities (arrhythmias) with lethal consequences. While over the last two decades optical mapping of excitation (voltage and calcium dynamics) has facilitated the detailed characterization of such arrhythmia events, until recently, no precise tools existed to actively interrogate cardiac dynamics in space and time. In this work, we discuss the combined use of new methods for space- and time-resolved optogenetic actuation and simultaneous fast, high resolution optical imaging of cardiac excitation waves. First, the mechanisms, limitations and unique features of optically induced responses in cardiomyocytes are outlined. These include the ability to bidirectionally control the membrane potential using depolarizing and hyperpolarizing opsins; the ability to induce prolonged sustained voltage changes; and the ability to control refractoriness and the shape of the cardiac action potential. At the syncytial tissue level, we discuss optogenetically enabled experimentation on cell-cell coupling, alteration of conduction properties and termination of propagating waves by light. Specific attention is given to space- and time-resolved application of optical stimulation using dynamic light patterns to perturb ongoing activation and to probe electrophysiological properties at desired tissue locations. The combined use of optical methods to perturb and to observe the system can offer new tools for precise feedback control of cardiac electrical activity, not available previously with pharmacological and electrical stimulation. These new experimental tools for all-optical electrophysiology allow for a level of precise manipulation and quantification of cardiac dynamics comparable in robustness to the computational setting, and can provide new insights into pacemaking, arrhythmogenesis and suppression or cardioversion.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2016-02-10", "authors": ["EmiliaEntcheva", "GilBub"], "doi": "10.1113/JP271559\n10.1101/023572"}

One of these promising approaches is myocardial tissue engineering, which refers to the creation of 3-dimensional engineered heart tissue in vitro.

{"title": "Tissue constructs: platforms for basic research and drug discovery.", "abstract": "The functions, form and mechanical properties of cells are inextricably linked to their extracellular environment. Cells from solid tissues change fundamentally when, isolated from this environment, they are cultured on rigid two-dimensional substrata. These changes limit the significance of mechanical measurements on cells in two-dimensional culture and motivate the development of constructs with cells embedded in three-dimensional matrices that mimic the natural tissue. While measurements of cell mechanics are difficult in natural tissues, they have proven effective in engineered tissue constructs, especially constructs that emphasize specific cell types and their functions, e.g. engineered heart tissues. Tissue constructs developed as models of disease also have been useful as platforms for drug discovery. Underlying the use of tissue constructs as platforms for basic research and drug discovery is integration of multiscale biomaterials measurement and computational modelling to dissect the distinguishable mechanical responses separately of cells and extracellular matrix from measurements on tissue constructs and to quantify the effects of drug treatment on these responses.

Their exhibited high surface area and three-dimensional nanofibrous network allows the electrospun fibers to resemble native extracellular matrices. These features of the nanofibers show that they have great potential in drug delivery and tissue engineering applications. Proteins, growth factors, antibiotics, and many other agents have been successfully encapsulated into coaxial fibers for drug delivery. A main advantage of the core-sheath design is that after the process of electrospinning and release, these drugs remain bioactive due to the protection of the sheath.

Decellularized and non-treated HVL and PER were processed for histological, biochemical and mechanical analysis to determine the effect of these agents on the structure, ECM components, and biomechanical properties.

The decline in contractile force was associated with an impairment of autophagy (LC3 Western blot) and appearance of autophagolysosomes (transmission electron microscopy).\nThis study demonstrates the feasibility to study TKI-mediated force effects in EHTs and identifies an association between a decline in contractility and inhibition of autophagic flux.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-02-04", "authors": ["FabianJacob", "Amina YYonis", "FriederikeCuello", "PradeepLuther", "ThomasSchulze", "AlexandraEder", "ThomasStreichert", "IngraMannhardt", "Marc NHirt", "SebastianSchaaf", "JustusStenzig", "ThomasForce", "ThomasEschenhagen", "ArneHansen"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0145937\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01255.x\n10.1111/bph.12979\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.206920\n10.1038/nm1446\n10.1113/jphysiol.2006.109389\n10.1177/0192623311419524\n10.1111/j.1752-8062.2008.00090.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.255695\n10.1074/jbc.270.21.12823\n10.1177/0192623310373775\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211458\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026397\n10.1007/s00395-012-0307-z\n10.1007/s00395-014-0436-7\n10.1016/j.addr.2006.05.003\n10.1093/toxsci/kfn157\n10.1093/toxsci/kfs233\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.09.004\n10.1172/JCI119452\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.009\n10.1016/j.taap.2010.07.007\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-0658\n10.1002/ijc.24030\n10.1172/JCI35660\n10.1254/jphs.12158FP\n10.1002/ijc.26374\n10.1093/toxsci/kfs192\n10.1007/s00246-010-9883-6\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.265819"}

Then, the effects of ISPS on the antioxidant activities in vitro, as well as the glycosylated serum protein concentration, malondialdehyde level, and total antioxidant capacity of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were studied.\nThe optimized conditions were as follows: sodium selenite concentration, 33.78 \u00b5g/L; incubation time, 8.24 days; and incubation temperature, 26.69\u00b0C. A maximum yield of 197.35 mg/g ISPS was obtained from the validation experiments, which was quite close to the predicted maximum yield of 198.6839 mg/g. FT-IR spectra indicated that ISPS has been successfully selenylation modified with similar structure to polysaccharide of intracellular polysaccharides. The in vitro scavenging effects of 1.0 mg/mL ISPS on hydroxyl, superoxide, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals were 74.62\u00b14.05, 71.45\u00b13.63, and 79.48\u00b14.75%, respectively. The reducing power of ISPS was 0.45\u00b10.01 (absorbance at 700 nm). Fasting blood glucose and glycosylated serum protein of group C (rats with diabetes that received drinking water with ISPS) were significantly lower than those of group B (rats with diabetes) (P<0.01) after treatment was administered for 2 and 4 weeks. Serum malonaldehyde content of group C was significantly lower than that of group B at 4 weeks (P<0.01). At 4 weeks, malonaldehyde contents in heart, liver, and kidney tissues of group C were significantly lower than those of group B; however, malonaldehyde content in pancreas tissue of group C was not significantly different. Total antioxidant capacities in liver, pancreas and kidney tissues of group C were significantly higher than those of group B, but total antioxidant capacity in heart tissue was not significantly different. Serum total antioxidant capacity was also increased compared with that of group B.\nThe result of these experiments indicated that RSM is a promising method for the optimization of ISPS production, and the ISPS of C. sinensis can reduce blood glucose level and improve antioxidant capacity of rats with diabetes induced by streptozotocin.", "journal": "Food & nutrition research", "date": "2016-02-04", "authors": ["ShengliYang", "HuiZhang"], "doi": "10.3402/fnr.v60.30153"}

This study investigated the frequency and effect of rs11515 genotypes in breast cancer. Genomic DNA samples from 400 women (200 with and 200 without a diagnosis of breast cancer) were genotyped for the rs11515 major (C) and minor (G) alleles. The rs11515 polymorphism was also investigated in 108 heart tissues to test for tissue-specific effects. Four 9p21 transcripts, p16 (INK4a) , p14 (ARF) , p15 (INK4b) , and ANRIL were measured in breast tumors and myocardium using quantitative PCR. Heterozygotes (CG genotype) were more frequent in women with breast cancer compared to the control population (P\u2009=\u20090.0039). In those with breast cancer, the CG genotype was associated with an older age (P\u2009=\u20090.016) and increased lymph node involvement (P\u2009=\u20090.007) compared to homozygotes for the major allele (CC genotype).

The CG genotype was not associated with altered 9p21 transcripts in heart tissue. In breast cancer, the rs11515 CG genotype is more frequent and associated with a more aggressive tumor that could be due to increased ANRIL and reduced p16 (INK4a) expression.

{"title": "Pathophysiological mechanism and therapeutic role of S100 proteins in cardiac failure: a systematic review.", "abstract": "S100 proteins are a family of highly acidic calcium-binding proteins involved in calcium handling in many tissues and organs. Some of these proteins are highly expressed in cardiac tissue, and an impairment of some specific S100 proteins has been related to heart failure. To check this hypothesis, we decided to review the literature since 2008 until May 2015. According to the studies collected, recovering S100A1 levels may enhance contractile/relaxing performance in heart failure, reverse negative force-frequency relationship, improve contractile reserve, reverse diastolic dysfunction and protect against pro-arrhythmic reductions of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium. The safety profile of gene therapy was also confirmed. Increased S100B protein levels were related to a worse outcome in chronic heart failure. S100A8/A9 complex plasma levels, as well as other inflammatory biomarkers, were significantly higher in chronic heart failure patients. S100A2 seems to increase both contractile and relaxation performance in animal cardiomyocytes. Otherwise, S100A6 cardiac expression seems to have no effects on contractility. S100A4 KO mice showed reduced cardiac interstitial fibrosis. Data collected encourage a potential prospective application in human. These proteins could be exploited as biomarkers in stadiation and prognosis of chronic heart failure, as well as therapeutic target to rescue failing heart.

{"title": "Perpetuation of torsade de pointes in heterogeneous hearts: competing foci or re-entry?", "abstract": "The underlying mechanism of torsade de pointes (TdP) remains of debate: perpetuation may be due to (1) focal activity or (2) re-entrant activity. The onset of TdP correlates with action potential heterogeneities in different regions of the heart. We studied the mechanism of perpetuation of TdP in silico using a 2D model of human cardiac tissue and an anatomically accurate model of the ventricles of the human heart. We found that the mechanism of perpetuation TdP depends on the degree of heterogeneity. If the degree of heterogeneity is large, focal activity alone can sustain a TdP, otherwise re-entrant activity emerges. This result can help to understand the relationship between the mechanisms of TdP and tissue properties and may help in developing new drugs against it.\nTorsade de pointes (TdP) can be the consequence of cardiac remodelling, drug effects or a combination of both. The mechanism underlying TdP is unclear, and may involve triggered focal activity or re-entry. Recent work by our group has indicated that both cases may exist, i.e. TdPs induced in the chronic atrioventricular block (CAVB) dog model may have a focal origin or are due to re-entry. Also it was found that heterogeneities might play an important role. In the current study we have used computational modelling to further investigate the mechanisms involved in TdP initiation and perpetuation, especially in the CAVB dog model, by the addition of heterogeneities with reduced repolarization reserve in comparison with the surrounding tissue. For this, the TNNP computer model was used for computations. We demonstrated in 2D and 3D simulations that ECGs with the typical TdP morphology can be caused by both multiple competing foci and re-entry circuits as a result of introduction of heterogeneities, depending on whether the heterogeneities have a large or a smaller reduced repolarization reserve in comparison with the surrounding tissue.

However, assessing the three-dimensional dynamics of these reentrant waves using experimental techniques has been limited to verifying stable scroll-wave dynamics in relatively thin preparations. We propose a different approach to recovering the three-dimensional dynamics of reentrant waves in the heart. By applying techniques commonly used in weather forecasting, we combine dual-surface observations from a particular experiment with predictions from a numerical model to reconstruct the full three-dimensional time series of the experiment. Here, we use model-generated surrogate observations from a numerical experiment to evaluate the performance of the ensemble Kalman filter in reconstructing such time series for a discordant alternans state in one spatial dimension and for scroll waves in three dimensions. We show that our approach is able to recover time series of both observed and unobserved variables matching the truth. Where nearby observations are available, the error is reduced below the synthetic observation error, with a smaller reduction with increased distance from observations.

Progressive disorganization of tissue morphology can lead to pathologic remodeling, necessitating the development of experimental and theoretical methods of analysis of the tolerance of normal tissue function to structural alterations. A systematic way to investigate the relationship of diverse cell organization to tissue function is to engineer two-dimensional cell monolayers replicating key aspects of the in vivo tissue architecture. However, it is still not clear how this can be accomplished on a tissue level scale in a parameterized fashion, allowing for a mathematically precise definition of the model tissue organization and properties down to a cellular scale with a parameter dependent gradual change in model tissue organization. Here, we describe and use a method of designing precisely parameterized, geometrically complex patterns that are then used to control cell alignment and communication of model tissues. We demonstrate direct application of this method to guiding the growth of cardiac cell cultures and developing mathematical models of cell function that correspond to the underlying experimental patterns. Several anisotropic patterned cultures spanning a broad range of multicellular organization, mimicking the cardiac tissue organization of different regions of the heart, were found to be similar to each other and to isotropic cell monolayers in terms of local cell-cell interactions, reflected in similar confluency, morphology and connexin-43 expression. However, in agreement with the model predictions, different anisotropic patterns of cell organization, paralleling in vivo alterations of cardiac tissue morphology, resulted in variable and novel functional responses with important implications for the initiation and maintenance of cardiac arrhythmias. We conclude that variations of tissue geometry and topology can dramatically affect cardiac tissue function even if the constituent cells are themselves similar, and that the proposed method can provide a general strategy to experimentally and computationally investigate when such variation can lead to impaired tissue function.", "journal": "Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro", "date": "2016-01-30", "authors": ["Jared MMolitoris", "SaurabhPaliwal", "Rajesh BSekar", "RobertBlake", "JinSeokPark", "Natalia ATrayanova", "LeslieTung", "AndreLevchenko"], "doi": "10.1039/c5ib00270b"}

Here we further assessed the cytocompatibility of the prepared samples with HL1-cell line, the electrophysiological properties and the patch clamp recording of the seeded cells over the selected electroactive sample. Presence of electroactive aniline tetramer in the structure of polyurethane/siloxane led to the increased expression of cardiac-specific genes of HL-1 cells involved in muscle contraction and electrical coupling. Our results showed that expression of Cx43, TrpT-2, and SERCA genes was significantly increased in conductive sample compared to tissue culture plate and the corresponding non-conductive analogous. The prepared materials were not only biocompatible in terms of cellular toxicity, but did not alter the intrinsic electrical characteristics of HL-1 cells. Embedding the electroactive moiety into the prepared films improved the properties of these polymeric cardiac construct through the enhanced transmission of electrical signals between the cells. Based on morphological observation, calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrated the potential applicability of these materials for cardiac tissue engineering. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We analyzed the coordinated role of 2 major mediators of efferocytosis, the myeloid-epithelial-reproductive protein tyrosine kinase (Mertk) and the milk fat globule epidermal growth factor (Mfge8), in directing cardiac remodeling by skewing the inflammatory response after myocardial infarction.\nWe generated double-deficient mice for Mertk and Mfge8 (Mertk(-/-)/Mfge8(-/-)) and challenged them with acute coronary ligature. Compared with wild-type, Mertk-deficient (Mertk(-/-)), or Mfge8-deficient (Mfge8(-/-)) animals, Mertk(-/-)/Mfge8(-/-) mice displayed greater alteration in cardiac function and remodeling. Mertk and Mfge8 were expressed mainly by cardiac Ly6C(High and Low) monocytes and macrophages. In parallel, Mertk(-/-)/Mfge8(-/-) bone marrow chimeras manifested increased accumulation of apoptotic cells, enhanced fibrotic area, and larger infarct size, as well as reduced angiogenesis. We found that the abrogation of efferocytosis affected neither the ability of circulating monocytes to infiltrate cardiac tissue nor the number of resident Ly6C(High) and Ly6C(How) monocytes/macrophages populating the infarcted milieu. In contrast, combined Mertk and Mfge8 deficiency in Ly6C(High)/Ly6C(Low) monocytes/macrophages either obtained from in vitro differentiation of bone marrow cells or isolated from infarcted hearts altered their capacity of efferocytosis and subsequently blunted vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) release.

Serum creatinine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also measured. The heart apex was prepared for histological (hematoxylin and eosin) and immunohistochemical examination. Intoxication of DOX was associated with a significant elevation in serum CK-MB and LDH, reduction in cardiac GSH, and increased TBARS and TNF-\u03b1 compared to the controls. Administration of Met or Sitg to DOX-intoxicated rats suppressed serum CK-MB and LDH. Moreover, cardiac GSH was elevated with decreased TBARS and TNF-\u03b1. These results were confirmed by histological study. Met and Sitg caused inhibition of caspase 3 and upregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression in DOX-intoxicated animals.

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) to drive cardiomyocytes derived from BMMSCs to a more mature state. BMMSCs were divided into 3 groups: untreated controls, differentiated, and T3 treated. The differentiation potential was evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.

The mRNA levels of these specific markers of cardiomyocytes were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The levels of cardiomyocytes markers protein and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4) were determined by Western blot analyses. Our data demonstrate that T3 treatment leads to a significant increase in cells positive for cTnI, GATA4, Cx-43, and \u03b1-actinin. The mRNA and protein expression levels of these specific markers of cardiomyocytes were also increased after T3 treatment. At the same time, the protein expression level of Oct-4 was substantially downregulated in T3-treated cells.

Our platform, composed of arrays of muscular thin films (MTF), allows for functional comparisons of healthy and diseased tissues by tracking film deflections resulting from contracting tissues. To test our model, we measured gene expression profiles, morphological remodeling, calcium transients, and contractile stress generation in response to ANG II exposure and compared against previous experimental and clinical results. We found that ANG II induced pathological gene expression profiles including over-expression of natriuretic peptide B, Rho GTPase 1, and T-type calcium channels.

Data banks like PSIAConline (www.psiac.de), individualization of drug prescription by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) combined with a clinical pharmacological report (www.konbest.de), as well as drug information systems such as AGATE (www.amuep-agate.de) are today of help not just to recognize such drug risks, but also to find professional and evidence based solutions for it.\nZum Wirkmechanismus vieler Medikamente geh\u00f6rt die Beeinflussung vitaler K\u00f6rperfunktionen \u00fcber das sympathische und parasympathische System.

{"title": "Using Skewness and the First-Digit Phenomenon to Identify Dynamical Transitions in Cardiac Models.", "abstract": "Disruptions in the normal rhythmic functioning of the heart, termed as arrhythmia, often result from qualitative changes in the excitation dynamics of the organ. The transitions between different types of arrhythmia are accompanied by alterations in the spatiotemporal pattern of electrical activity that can be measured by observing the time-intervals between successive excitations of different regions of the cardiac tissue. Using biophysically detailed models of cardiac activity we show that the distribution of these time-intervals exhibit a systematic change in their skewness during such dynamical transitions. Further, the leading digits of the normalized intervals appear to fit Benford's law better at these transition points. This raises the possibility of using these observations to design a clinical indicator for identifying changes in the nature of arrhythmia. More importantly, our results reveal an intriguing relation between the changing skewness of a distribution and its agreement with Benford's law, both of which have been independently proposed earlier as indicators of regime shift in dynamical systems.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2016-01-23", "authors": ["PavithraaSeenivasan", "SoumyaEaswaran", "SeshanSridhar", "SitabhraSinha"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2015.00390\n10.1103/PhysRevA.42.2489\n10.1063/1.166069\n10.1161/01.CIR.93.12.2142\n10.1109/10.376135\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.017483\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.068102\n10.1209/0295-5075/95/50008\n10.1063/1.1504242\n10.1198/tast.2009.0005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036624\n10.1172/JCI119159\n10.1038/35065745\n10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.02.004\n10.1016/S0197-4580(01)00266-4\n10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01160.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.11.1095\n10.1098/rsta.2011.0622\n10.1016/0002-9149(87)90795-8\n10.1063/1.166090\n10.3389/fphys.2011.00095\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.1.8\n10.1161/01.RES.68.6.1501\n10.1126/science.267326\n10.1142/S0218127410028264\n10.1511/1998.31.815\n10.1114/1.1289474\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2010.09.016\n10.1029/2010GL044830\n10.1038/nature08227\n10.1016/S0022-0736(98)90300-4\n10.1016/j.physrep.2009.12.003\n10.1016/S0960-0779(01)00168-0\n10.1103/PhysRevE.64.026222\n10.1209/0295-5075/103/50003\n10.1152/ajpheart.00109.2006\n10.1063/1.166498\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970913\n10.1098/rsta.2008.0232\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.21.2819\n10.1152/ajpheart.00608.2002\n10.1161/hc4301.098254"}

{"title": "Human Engineered Cardiac Tissues Created Using Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Reveal Functional Characteristics of BRAF-Mediated Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death that often goes undetected in the general population. HCM is also prevalent in patients with cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS), which is a genetic disorder characterized by aberrant signaling in the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade. Understanding the mechanisms of HCM development in such RASopathies may lead to novel therapeutic strategies, but relevant experimental models of the human condition are lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop the first 3D human engineered cardiac tissue (hECT) model of HCM. The hECTs were created using human cardiomyocytes obtained by directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with CFCS due to an activating BRAF mutation. The mutant myocytes were directly conjugated at a 3:1 ratio with a stromal cell population to create a tissue of defined composition. Compared to healthy patient control hECTs, BRAF-hECTs displayed a hypertrophic phenotype by culture day 6, with significantly increased tissue size, twitch force, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) gene expression. Twitch characteristics reflected increased contraction and relaxation rates and shorter twitch duration in BRAF-hECTs, which also had a significantly higher maximum capture rate and lower excitation threshold during electrical pacing, consistent with a more arrhythmogenic substrate. By culture day 11, twitch force was no longer different between BRAF and wild-type hECTs, revealing a temporal aspect of disease modeling with tissue engineering. Principal component analysis identified diastolic force as a key factor that changed from day 6 to day 11, supported by a higher passive stiffness in day 11 BRAF-hECTs. In summary, human engineered cardiac tissues created from BRAF mutant cells recapitulated, for the first time, key aspects of the HCM phenotype, offering a new in vitro model for studying intrinsic mechanisms and screening new therapeutic approaches for this lethal form of heart disease.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-01-20", "authors": ["Timothy JCashman", "RebeccaJosowitz", "Bryce VJohnson", "Bruce DGelb", "Kevin DCosta"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0146697\n10.1097/HCO.0b013e3283375698\n10.1016/j.yapd.2013.04.015\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.05.003\n10.4330/wjc.v6.i12.1245\n10.1038/nature09005\n10.1096/fj.13-228007\n10.1007/s00395-012-0307-z\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.242354\n10.2119/molmed.2011.00512\n10.1146/annurev-genom-091212-153523\n10.1042/CS20070430\n10.1002/ajmg.c.30295\n10.1002/humu.20955\n10.1016/S0076-6879(07)38019-1\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0278\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026397\n10.1038/nbt0308-303\n10.1038/nbt.2005\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.03.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.07.039\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237206\n10.1073/pnas.1311120110\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.10.052\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227512\n10.1038/nm.3545\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300522\n10.1093/europace/eus269\n10.1371/journal.pone.0087457"}
{"title": "Improving Cell Engraftment in Cardiac Stem Cell Therapy.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) affects millions of people worldwide. MI causes massive cardiac cell death and heart function decrease. However, heart tissue cannot effectively regenerate by itself. While stem cell therapy has been considered an effective approach for regeneration, the efficacy of cardiac stem cell therapy remains low due to inferior cell engraftment in the infarcted region. This is mainly a result of low cell retention in the tissue and poor cell survival under ischemic, immune rejection and inflammatory conditions. Various approaches have been explored to improve cell engraftment: increase of cell retention using biomaterials as cell carriers; augmentation of cell survival under ischemic conditions by preconditioning cells, genetic modification of cells, and controlled release of growth factors and oxygen; and enhancement of cell survival by protecting cells from excessive inflammation and immune surveillance.

The precise mechanism underlying DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity is still not completely elucidated, but cardiac inflammation seems to be involved. Effects of DOXO on proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory cell infiltration, and necrosis have been proven only when a functional impairment has already occurred, so this study aimed to investigate the acute effect of DOXO administration in mouse heart. The results of our study demonstrated alterations in cardiac function parameters assessed by ultrasound within 24h after a single injection of DOXO, with a cumulative effect along the increase of the dose and the number of DOXO administrations. At the same time, DOXO causes a significant production of proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) with a concomitant reduction of IL-10, a well-known antiinflammatory cytokine. Furthermore, overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in heart tissue and increased levels of serum nitrite in DOXO-treated mice were detected. Notably, DOXO administration significantly increased nitrotyrosine expression in mouse heart. Our data support the hypothesis that these early events, could be responsible for the later onset of more severe deleterious remodeling leading to DOXO induced cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Toxicology and applied pharmacology", "date": "2016-01-19", "authors": ["MichelaPecoraro", "MariagiovannaDel Pizzo", "StefaniaMarzocco", "RosalindaSorrentino", "MicheleCiccarelli", "GuidoIaccarino", "AldoPinto", "AdaPopolo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.taap.2016.01.006"}

Histopathological examination of cardiac tissues after infection showed a gradual increase of myocardial injury to the maximum degree at 8 dpi (days post infection), followed by a recovery process with reduced viral replication. We also measured expression changes of innate immune genes in heart after 4, 8 and 12 days of infection using innate immune real-time PCR array. The results showed expression alterations in many Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) genes upon CVB3 infection, which activated multiple important signaling pathways during recovery process. The expression of TLRs, RLRs, PKR and cytokines were strongly induced and reached the peak at 4 dpi in early myocarditis stage, followed by a gradual reduction in recovery stage, during which the levels were even lower than normal at 12 dpi. The strong correlation between cardiac histopathology score and chemokine expression level suggested that the chemokines might play a role in pathological changes during early myocarditis stage. In addition, we also found that both cell survival signaling pathways (AKT1, p38MAPK) and antiviral signaling pathways (IKK\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b5) were activated and promoted the recovery during late myocarditis stage.

{"title": "Strategies to Enhance the Effectiveness of Adult Stem Cell Therapy for Ischemic Heart Diseases Affecting the Elderly Patients.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarctions and chronic ischemic heart disease both commonly and disproportionately affect elderly patients more than any other patient population. Despite available treatments, heart tissue is often permanently damaged as a result of cardiac injury. This review aims to summarize recent literature proposing the use of modified autologous adult stem cells to promote healing of post-infarct cardiac tissue. This novel cellular treatment involves isolation of adult stem cells from the patient, in vitro manipulation of these stem cells, and subsequent transplantation back into the patient's own heart to accelerate healing. One of the hindrances affecting this process is that cardiac issues are increasingly common in elderly patients, and stem cells recovered from their tissues tend to be pre-senescent or already in senescence. As a result, harsh in vitro manipulations can cause the aged stem cells to undergo massive in vivo apoptosis after transplantation. The consensus in literature is that inhibition or reversal of senescence onset in adult stem cells would be of utmost benefit. In fact, it is believed that this strategy may lower stem cell mortality and coerce aged stem cells into adopting more resilient phenotypes similar to that of their younger counterparts. This review will discuss a selection of the most efficient and most-recent strategies used experimentally to enhance the effectiveness of current stem cell therapies for ischemic heart diseases.", "journal": "Stem cell reviews and reports", "date": "2016-01-19", "authors": ["RoshniKhatiwala", "ChuanxiCai"], "doi": "10.1007/s12015-016-9642-z"}

However, few CSRP2 and CSRP3 genes have been functionally characterized in sheep. In this study, the full-length cDNAs of the CSRP2 and CSRP3 genes were cloned from Small-tail Han sheep by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR. The GenBank accession numbers of the full-length CSRP2 and CSRP3 cDNA sequences are KJ743957 and KJ743958, respectively. The full-length cDNA of ovine CSRP2 was 917bp, with a 582-bp open reading frame encoding 193 amino acids. The complete ovine CSRP3 cDNA was 917bp, with a 585-bp open reading frame encoding 194 amino acids. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses revealed that their amino acid sequences are highly similar to those of other vertebrates, all of which contain two conserved LIM-only domains and a relatively conserved nuclear targeting sequence. To further validate the functions of the two genes, their mRNA expression patterns were evaluated in various Small-tail Han and Dorper sheep tissues using qRT-PCR analyses. CSRP2 was mainly detected in the aorta, whereas CSRP3 was highly concentrated in the heart and the muscle. CSRP3 was expressed to a higher level in the hearts of Small-tail Han sheep than in Dorper sheep (P<0.05). However, the opposite was found in the muscle (the longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris); CSRP3 was expressed to a higher level in Dorper sheep than in Small-tail Han sheep (P<0.05). We quantified the CRP3 protein (coded by the CSRP3 gene) levels in different tissues in Small-tail Han and Dorper sheep.

In vivo hemodynamics, cardiac function, serum cardiac enzymes, myocardial antioxidant, inflammatory and apoptotic biomarkers as well as histopathological parameters were studied in IPS-injured Wistar rat heart tissues.\nAJLE (250\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) attenuated the cytotoxicity and enhanced the H9C2 proliferation by up to 40%. Oral administration of AJLE (250 and 500 mg/kg.bw) prevented the depletion of endogenous antioxidants (CAT, SOD, NP-SH and NO) and myocyte injury marker enzymes, and inhibited lipid peroxidation (MDA, MPO). Moreover, AJLE downregulated the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF\u03b1) and apoptotic markers (caspase-3 and Bax), and upregulated the anti-apototic protein Bcl2. Histological data showed that AJLE pretreatment reduced myonecrosis, edema, and infiltration of inflammatory cells and restored the cardiomyocytes architecture.\nTaken together, our data revealed that AJLE had strong antioxidant, hypolipidimic, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic potential against myocardial damage.

This is the first evaluation of vitamin B2 for use in 3D bioprinting. The developed printing process offers easy control of the width of printed lines, and can therefore ensure that functional living tissue in printed with high fidelity. Using a dECM bioink combination that mimics a native microenvironment, a bioconstruct was designed to match the biomechanical properties of native cardiac tissue. The printed bioconstruct supported high cell viability and active proliferation of cardiac progenitor cells, and ultimately increased cardiomyogenic differentiation. This printing strategy is an additional tool for regulating biomechanical cues, and therefore provides new approaches to dECM-based cell printing.\n3D cell printing is an emerging strategy to create an engineered tissue construct by depositing biological components. The printable material used while printing cells is called \"bioink\"; to prevent cell damage during printing process. Recent development of printable tissue-specific dECM bioink has enabled 3D fabrication of tissues that are much more functionally matched than their predecessors. Demand for a method to tailor the mechanical properties of dECM bioink to improve both printability and tissue function has increased; thus, we here describe mechanical tailoring of dECM bioink by using vitamin B2 and UVA irradiation.

In this study, we injected a relatively stiff, thermoresponsive and bioabsorbable hydrogel in rat hearts at 3 different time points - immediately after MI (IM), 3 d post-MI (3D), and 2 w post-MI (2W), corresponding to the beginnings of the necrotic, fibrotic and chronic remodeling phases. The employed left anterior descending coronary artery ligation model showed expected infarction responses including functional loss, inflammation and fibrosis with distinct time dependent patterns. Changes in LV geometry and contractile function were followed by longitudinal echocardiography for 10 w post-MI. While all injection times positively affected LV function and wall thickness, the 3D group gave better functional outcomes than the other injection times and also exhibited more local vascularization and less inflammatory markers than the earlier injection time. The results indicate an important role for injection timing in the increasingly explored concept of post-MI biomaterial injection therapy and suggest that for hydrogels with mechanical support as primary function, injection at the beginning of the fibrotic phase may provide improved outcomes.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-01-18", "authors": ["TomoYoshizumi", "YangZhu", "HongbinJiang", "AntonioD'Amore", "HirokazuSakaguchi", "JasonTchao", "KimimasaTobita", "William RWagner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.002"}
{"title": "Inhibition of human anthracycline reductases by emodin - A possible remedy for anthracycline resistance.", "abstract": "The clinical application of anthracyclines, like daunorubicin and doxorubicin, is limited by two factors: dose-related cardiotoxicity and drug resistance. Both have been linked to reductive metabolism of the parent drug to their metabolites daunorubicinol and doxorubicinol, respectively. These metabolites show significantly less anti-neoplastic properties as their parent drugs and accumulate in cardiac tissue leading to chronic cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we aimed to identify novel and potent natural inhibitors for anthracycline reductases, which enhance the anticancer effect of anthracyclines by preventing the development of anthracycline resistance. Human enzymes responsible for the reductive metabolism of daunorubicin were tested for their sensitivity towards anthrachinones, in particular emodin and anthraflavic acid. Intense inhibition kinetic data for the most effective daunorubicin reductases, including IC50- and Ki-values, the mode of inhibition, as well as molecular docking, were compiled. Subsequently, a cytotoxicity profile and the ability of emodin to reverse daunorubicin resistance were determined using multiresistant A549 lung cancer and HepG2 liver cancer cells. Emodin potently inhibited the four main human daunorubicin reductases in vitro. Further, we could demonstrate that emodin is able to synergistically sensitize human cancer cells towards daunorubicin at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, emodin may yield the potential to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of anthracyclines by preventing anthracycline resistance via inhibition of the anthracycline reductases. In symphony with its known pharmacological properties, emodin might be a compound of particular interest in the management of anthracycline chemotherapy efficacy and their adverse effects.", "journal": "Toxicology and applied pharmacology", "date": "2016-01-17", "authors": ["JanHintzpeter", "Jan MoritzSeliger", "JakubHofman", "Hans-JoergMartin", "VladimirWsol", "EdmundMaser"], "doi": "10.1016/j.taap.2016.01.003"}

Archived samples from horses treated with a prolonged insulin infusion or a balanced electrolyte solution were used. All treated horses developed marked hyperinsulinemia and clinical laminitis. Protein expression was compared across tissues for the insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) by immunoblotting. Gene expression of metabolic insulin-signaling markers (insulin receptor substrate 1, Akt2, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta [GSK-3\u03b2]) and glucose transport (basal glucose transporter 1 and insulin-sensitive glucose transporter 4) was evaluated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Lamellar tissue contained significantly more IGF-1R protein than skeletal muscle, indicating the potential significance of IGF-1R signaling for this tissue. Gene expression of the selected markers of insulin signaling and glucose transport in skeletal muscle and lamellar tissues was unaffected by prolonged hyperinsulinemia. In contrast, the significant upregulation of Akt2, GSK-3\u03b2, GLUT1, and GLUT4 gene expression in cardiac tissue suggested that the prolonged hyperinsulinemia induced an increase in insulin sensitivity and a transcriptional activation of glucose transport.

Atrial inflammation has been suggested to play an important role in the pathophysiology of AF. However, little is known about the occurrence of atrial inflammation in myocarditis patients. Here, we analyzed inflammatory cell numbers in the atria of myocarditis patients without symptomatic AF.\nCardiac tissue was obtained postmortem from lymphocytic myocarditis patients (n=6), catecholamine-induced myocarditis patients (n=5), and control patients without pathological evidence of heart disease (n=5). Tissue sections of left and right ventricle and left and right atrium were stained for myeloperoxidase (neutrophilic granulocytes), CD45 (lymphocytes), and CD68 (macrophages). These cells were subsequently quantified in atrial and ventricular myocardium and atrial adipose tissue.\nIn lymphocytic myocarditis patients, a significant increase was observed for lymphocytes in the left atrial adipose tissue. In catecholamine-induced myocarditis patients, significant increases were found in the atria for all three inflammatory cell types. Infiltrating inflammatory cell numbers in the atrial myocardium correlated positively with those in the ventricles, especially in catecholamine-induced myocarditis patients.\nTo a varying extent, atrial myocarditis occurs concurrently with ventricular myocarditis in patients diagnosed with myocarditis of different etiology.

Argonaute proteins are essential components of miRNA-induced silencing complex and play important roles during miRNA biogenesis and function. However, the expression pattern of four AGO family members has not yet been detected in the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis tissue samples. In this study, we detected the expression of four AGOs in the CVB3-infected mouse heart tissues and found that AGO1 and AGO3 up-regulated significantly at 4 and 8h after CVB3 infection. Further in vitro research indicated that up-regulated AGO1 and AGO3 are related to the down-regulated TNFAIP3, which is a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB pathway. Subsequently, we confirmed that TNFAIP3 is a direct target of miR-19a/b, and during CVB3 infection, the expression of miR-19a/b and miR-125a/b is not significantly changed. TNFAIP3 level is mainly reduced by up-regulated AGO1 and AGO3.

In this study, we generated fibrin-based mini-EHTs from a transgenic mouse line (Cdh5-CreERT2 \u00d7 Rosa26-LacZ), in which ECs were specifically and inducibly labeled by applying tamoxifen (EC(iLacZ)). EHTs were generated from an unpurified cell mix of newborn mouse hearts and were cultured under standard serum-containing conditions. Cre expression in 15-day-old EHTs was induced by addition of o-hydroxytamoxifen to the culture medium for 48 h, and ECs were visualized by X-gal staining. EC(iLacZ) EHTs showed a dense X-gal-positive vessel-like network with distinct tubular structures. Immunofluorescence revealed that ECs were mainly associated with cardiomyocytes within the EHT. EC(iLacZ) EHT developed spontaneous and regular contractility with forces up to 0.1 mN. Coherent contractility and the presence of an extensive vessel-like network were both dependent on the presence of animal sera in the culture medium. Contractile EC(iLacZ) EHTs successfully served as grafts in implantation studies onto the hearts of immunodeficient mice. Four weeks after implantation, EHTs showed X-gal-positive lumen-forming vessel structures connected to the host myocardium circulation as they contained erythrocytes on a regular basis. Taken together, genetic labeling of ECs revealed the extensive formation of vessel-like structures in EHTs in vitro.

{"title": "Novel EGFR inhibitors attenuate cardiac hypertrophy induced by angiotensin II.", "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is an important risk factor for heart failure. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this current study was to examine the role of EGFR in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we observed that both Ang II and EGF could increase the phospohorylation of EGFR and protein kinase B (AKT)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and then induce cell hypertrophy in H9c2 cells. Both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic silencing significantly reduced Ang II-induced EGFR signalling pathway activation, hypertrophic marker overexpression, and cell hypertrophy. In addition, our results showed that Ang II-induced EGFR activation is mediated by c-Src phosphorylation. In vivo, Ang II treatment significantly led to cardiac remodelling including cardiac hypertrophy, disorganization and fibrosis, accompanied by the activation of EGFR signalling pathway in the heart tissues, while all these molecular and pathological alterations were attenuated by the oral administration with EGFR inhibitors. In conclusion, the c-Src-dependent EGFR activation may play an important role in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and inhibition of EGFR by specific molecules may be an effective strategy for the treatment of Ang II-associated cardiac diseases.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2016-01-15", "authors": ["KesongPeng", "XinqiaoTian", "YuanyuanQian", "MelissaSkibba", "ChunpengZou", "ZhiguoLiu", "JingyingWang", "ZhengXu", "XiaokunLi", "GuangLiang"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.12763"}
{"title": "Beating heart on a chip: a novel microfluidic platform to generate functional 3D cardiac microtissues.", "abstract": "In the past few years, microfluidic-based technology has developed microscale models recapitulating key physical and biological cues typical of the native myocardium. However, the application of controlled physiological uniaxial cyclic strains on a defined three-dimension cellular environment is not yet possible. Two-dimension mechanical stimulation was particularly investigated, neglecting the complex three-dimensional cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. For this purpose, we developed a heart-on-a-chip platform, which recapitulates the physiologic mechanical environment experienced by cells in the native myocardium. The device includes an array of hanging posts to confine cell-laden gels, and a pneumatic actuation system to induce homogeneous uniaxial cyclic strains to the 3D cell constructs during culture. The device was used to generate mature and highly functional micro-engineered cardiac tissues (\u03bcECTs), from both neonatal rat and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM), strongly suggesting the robustness of our engineered cardiac micro-niche. Our results demonstrated that the cyclic strain was effectively highly uniaxial and uniformly transferred to cells in culture. As compared to control, stimulated \u03bcECTs showed superior cardiac differentiation, as well as electrical and mechanical coupling, owing to a remarkable increase in junction complexes. Mechanical stimulation also promoted early spontaneous synchronous beating and better contractile capability in response to electric pacing. Pacing analyses of hiPSC-CM constructs upon controlled administration of isoprenaline showed further promising applications of our platform in drug discovery, delivery and toxicology fields.

{"title": "Myocardial Infarction Causes Transient Cholinergic Transdifferentiation of Cardiac Sympathetic Nerves via gp130.", "abstract": "Sympathetic and parasympathetic control of the heart is a classic example of norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) triggering opposing actions. Sympathetic NE increases heart rate and contractility through activation of \u03b2 receptors, whereas parasympathetic ACh slows the heart through muscarinic receptors. Sympathetic neurons can undergo a developmental transition from production of NE to ACh and we provide evidence that mouse cardiac sympathetic nerves transiently produce ACh after myocardial infarction (MI). ACh levels increased in viable heart tissue 10-14 d after MI, returning to control levels at 21 d, whereas NE levels were stable. At the same time, the genes required for ACh synthesis increased in stellate ganglia, which contain most of the sympathetic neurons projecting to the heart. Immunohistochemistry 14 d after MI revealed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in stellate sympathetic neurons and vesicular ACh transporter immunoreactivity in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cardiac sympathetic fibers. Finally, selective deletion of the ChAT gene from adult sympathetic neurons prevented the infarction-induced increase in cardiac ACh. Deletion of the gp130 cytokine receptor from sympathetic neurons prevented the induction of cholinergic genes after MI, suggesting that inflammatory cytokines induce the transient acquisition of a cholinergic phenotype in cardiac sympathetic neurons. Ex vivo experiments examining the effect of NE and ACh on rabbit cardiac action potential duration revealed that ACh blunted both the NE-stimulated decrease in cardiac action potential duration and increase in myocyte calcium transients. This raises the possibility that sympathetic co-release of ACh and NE may impair adaptation to high heart rates and increase arrhythmia susceptibility.\nSympathetic neurons normally make norepinephrine (NE), which increases heart rate and the contractility of cardiac myocytes. We found that, after myocardial infarction, the sympathetic neurons innervating the heart begin to make acetylcholine (ACh), which slows heart rate and decreases contractility. Several lines of evidence confirmed that the source of ACh was sympathetic nerves rather than parasympathetic nerves that are the normal source of ACh in the heart. Global application of NE with or without ACh to ex vivo hearts showed that ACh partially reversed the NE-stimulated decrease in cardiac action potential duration and increase in myocyte calcium transients. That suggests that sympathetic co-release of ACh and NE may impair adaptation to high heart rates and increase arrhythmia susceptibility.", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "date": "2016-01-14", "authors": ["AntoinetteOlivas", "Ryan TGardner", "LianguoWang", "Crystal MRipplinger", "William RWoodward", "Beth AHabecker"], "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3556-15.2016\n10.1016/j.npep.2010.10.002\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1218\n10.1016/j.mcn.2007.03.014\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3502-10.2010\n10.1002/neu.10308\n10.1113/expphysiol.2009.048215\n10.1073/pnas.160080697\n10.1006/mcne.2001.1093\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2011.05.004\n10.1038/nature01844\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.08.004\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243162\n10.1038/emboj.2013.85\n10.1073/pnas.73.11.4225\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5866-12.2013\n10.1016/j.cyto.2006.10.004\n10.1006/dbio.1998.8929\n10.1097/00001756-199512000-00009\n10.1007/s10741-010-9170-x\n10.1016/0079-6107(88)90014-4\n10.1016/j.neulet.2012.08.089\n10.1016/j.brainres.2012.07.033\n10.1002/path.878\n10.1016/j.mcn.2004.04.003\n10.1038/nm1570\n10.1172/JCI39778\n10.1016/0306-4522(95)00551-X\n10.1073/pnas.73.11.4220\n10.1152/ajpheart.00768.2003\n10.1152/ajpheart.01128.2009\n10.1016/j.autneu.2011.05.002\n10.1007/s00441-006-0215-3\n10.2220/biomedres.31.353\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.262345\n10.1113/expphysiol.2005.031070\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.887\n10.1016/0165-1838(89)90146-X\n10.1152/ajpheart.00409.2009\n10.1016/j.mcn.2013.06.005\n10.1016/0896-6273(93)90229-K\n10.1038/270147a0\n10.1073/pnas.94.8.4149\n10.1038/335637a0\n10.1016/0896-6273(90)90037-G\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07539.x\n10.1292/jvms.10-0081\n10.1056/NEJMoa043938\n10.1242/dev.02189\n10.1002/dvg.20773\n10.1536/jhj.44.257\n10.1007/s12031-013-0007-7\n10.1126/science.2512641\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb46157.x"}

Autophagy, an evolutionarily ancient response to cellular stress, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide range of cardiovascular pathologies, including heart failure. We report direct evidence indicating that TPCs are involved in regulating autophagy in cardiomyocytes, and that TPC knockout mice show alterations in the cardiac lysosomal system. TPC downregulation implies a decrease in the viability of cardiomyocytes under starvation conditions. In cardiac tissues from both humans and rats, TPC transcripts and protein levels were higher in females than in males, and correlated negatively with markers of autophagy. We conclude that the endolysosomal channels TPC1 and TPC2 are essential for appropriate basal and induced autophagic flux in cardiomyocytes, and also that they are differentially expressed in male and female hearts.\nAutophagy participates in physiological and pathological remodelling of the heart. The endolysosomal two-pore channels (TPCs), TPC1 and TPC2, have been implicated in the regulation of autophagy. The present study aimed to investigate the role of TPC1 and TPC2 in basal and induced cardiac autophagic activity. In cultured cardiomyocytes, starvation induced a significant increase in TPC1 and TPC2 transcripts and protein levels that paralleled the increase in autophagy identified by increased LC3-II and decreased p62 levels. Small interfering RNA depletion of TPC2 alone or together with TPC1 increased both LC3II and p62 levels under basal conditions and in response to serum starvation, suggesting that, under conditions of severe energy depletion (serum plus glucose starvation), changes in the autophagic flux (as assessed by use of bafilomycin A1) occurred either when TPC1 or TPC2 were downregulated. The knockdown of TPCs diminished cardiomyocyte viability under starvation and simulated ischaemia. Electron micrographs of hearts from TPC1/2 double knockout mice showed that cardiomyocytes contained large numbers of immature lysosomes with diameters significantly smaller than those of wild-type mice. In cardiac tissues from humans and rats, TPC1 and TPC2 transcripts and protein levels were higher in females than in males. Furthermore, transcript levels of TPCs correlated negatively with p62 levels in heart tissues.

The recent demonstrations that the SDF1/CXCR4 axis is implicated in NC chemotactic guidance and impaired in cortical interneurons of mouse DGS models prompted us to search for genetic interactions between Tbx1, Sdf1 (Cxcl12) and Cxcr4 in pharyngeal NCs and to investigate the effect of altering CXCR4 signaling on the ontogeny of their derivatives, which are affected in DGS.

This study sought to investigate whether cardiovascular cells associate, internalize, and traffic a nanoplatform called mesoporous silicon vector (MSV), and determine its intravenous accumulation in cardiac tissue in a murine model of heart failure.\nIn vitro cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of MSVs was examined by scanning electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, time-lapse microscopy, and flow cytometry in cardiac myocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. The MSVs were internalized within the first hours, and trafficked to perinuclear regions in all the cell lines. Cytotoxicity was investigated by annexin V and cell cycle assays. No significant evidence of toxicity was found. In vivo intravenous cardiac accumulation of MSVs was examined by high content fluorescence and confocal microscopy, with results showing increased accumulation of particles in failing hearts compared with normal hearts. Similar to observations in vitro, MSVs were able to associate, internalize, and traffic to the perinuclear region of cardiomyocytes in vivo.\nResults show that MSVs associate, internalize, and traffic in cardiovascular cells without any significant toxicity. Furthermore, MSVs accumulate in failing myocardium after intravenous administration, reaching intracellular regions of the cardiomyocytes.

Serum samples from 108 free-range chickens were obtained from ten different districts, and submitted to the modified agglutination test (MAT) for the presence of anti-T. gondii antibodies, and brain and heart tissue samples from infected chickens were processed for mouse bioassay. An overall seroprevalence of 71\u00b73% was found and antibody titres ranged from 16 to 4096. After confirmation of seropositivity by mouse bioassay, the determination of the T. gondii genotypes of two isolates was performed by PCR-RFLP, using primers for the following markers: SAG1, SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1, new SAG2, Apico and CS3. These T. gondii isolates, designated TgChBrUD1and TgChBrUD2, were obtained from heart samples of free-range chickens. The TgChBrUD1 isolate belonged to ToxoDB PCR-RFLP genotype 11 and the TgChBrUD2 isolate belonged to ToxoDB PCR-RFLP genotype 6. Both isolates demonstrated high virulence in a rodent model, with the TgChBrUD1 isolate able to induce brain cysts, in accord with its pattern of multiplication rates in human fibroblast culture. Taken together, these results reveal high prevalence of T. gondii infection in free-range chickens throughout Uberl\u00e2ndia, indicating an important degree of oocyst environmental contamination and the existence of considerable risk for T. gondii transmission to humans by consumption of free-range chicken as a food source.", "journal": "Epidemiology and infection", "date": "2016-01-09", "authors": ["C SLopes", "P SFranco", "N MSilva", "D A OSilva", "E A VFerro", "H F JPena", "R MSoares", "S MGennari", "J RMineo"], "doi": "10.1017/S0950268815003295"}

Echium oil (EO) represents a non-genetically-modified source of SDA available commercially. This study compared EO and FO in relation to alterations in plasma and tissue fatty acids, and for their ability to afford protection against ischemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Rats were fed (12 weeks) diets supplemented with either EO or FO at three dose levels (1, 3 and 5% w/w; n = 18 per group). EO failed to influence C22:6n-3 (DHA) but increased C22:5n-3 (DPA) in tissues dose-dependently, especially in heart tissue. Conversely, DHA in hearts of FO rats showed dose-related elevation; 14.8%-24.1% of total fatty acids. Kidney showed resistance for incorporation of LC n-3 PUFA. Overall, FO provided greater cardioprotection than EO. At the highest dose level, FO rats displayed lower (p < 0.05) episodes of VF% (29% vs. 73%) and duration (22.7 \u00b1 12.0 vs. 75.8 \u00b1 17.1 s) than the EO group but at 3% EO was comparable to FO.

The inverse problem, inferring the intrinsic APDs from an APD map, is proved to have a unique solution (if any). Perturbation analysis leads to an efficient and accurate Newton-based solver for this specific inverse problem.

The changes with destructive character include, firstly, those of the ultrastructure of biological bar- riers such as, in particular, hyperhydration of barriers on the whole and their separate layers, which deteriorates the conditions of oxygen diffusion; second, the destructive changes in mitochondria (it increased the number of damaged lung organelles by 4.1 times, in the heart - at 4.5-5.5 times depending on subpopulations and in muscle - by 3.5-12.2 times also depending on the subpopulation of mitochondria), which are accompanied by a decrease in the energy potential of the mitochondrial apparatus, are observed.

{"title": "Nanomaterials for Cardiac Myocyte Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Since their synthesizing introduction to the research community, nanomaterials have infiltrated almost every corner of science and engineering. Over the last decade, one such field has begun to look at using nanomaterials for beneficial applications in tissue engineering, specifically, cardiac tissue engineering. During a myocardial infarction, part of the cardiac muscle, or myocardium, is deprived of blood. Therefore, the lack of oxygen destroys cardiomyocytes, leaving dead tissue and possibly resulting in the development of arrhythmia, ventricular remodeling, and eventual heart failure. Scarred cardiac muscle results in heart failure for millions of heart attack survivors worldwide. Modern cardiac tissue engineering research has developed nanomaterial applications to combat heart failure, preserve normal heart tissue, and grow healthy myocardium around the infarcted area.

{"title": "miR-200b Mediates Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Hyperglycemia-induced endothelial injury is a key pathogenetic factor in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Endothelial injury may lead to a phenotypic change (i.e., endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition [EndMT]), causing cardiac fibrosis. Epigenetic mechanisms, through specific microRNA, may regulate such a process. We investigated the mechanisms for such changes in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells and in the heart of genetically engineered mice with chemically induced diabetes. Cardiac tissues and isolated mouse heart endothelial cells (MHECs) from animals with or without endothelial-specific overexpression of miR-200b, with or without streptozotocin-induced diabetes, were examined at the mRNA and protein levels for endothelial and mesenchymal markers. Expression of miR-200b and its targets was quantified. Cardiac functions and structures were analyzed. In the hearts of wild-type diabetic mice, EndMT was observed, which was prevented in the miR-200b transgenic diabetic mice. Expression of specific markers such as vascular endothelial growth factor, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox, transforming growth factor-\u03b21, and p300 were increased in the hearts of diabetic mice and were prevented following miR-200b overexpression. MHECs showed similar changes. miR-200b overexpression also prevented diabetes-induced cardiac functional and structural changes. These data indicate that glucose-induced EndMT in vivo and in vitro in the hearts of diabetic mice is possibly mediated by miR-200b and p300.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2016-01-01", "authors": ["BiaoFeng", "YananCao", "ShaliChen", "XuranChu", "YanhuiChu", "SubrataChakrabarti"], "doi": "10.2337/db15-1033"}
{"title": "Expression and function of Kv7.4 channels in rat cardiac mitochondria: possible targets for cardioprotection.", "abstract": "Plasmalemmal Kv7.1 (KCNQ1) channels are critical players in cardiac excitability; however, little is known on the functional role of additional Kv7 family members (Kv7.2-5) in cardiac cells. In this work, the expression, function, cellular and subcellular localization, and potential cardioprotective role against anoxic-ischaemic cardiac injury of Kv7.4 channels have been investigated.\nExpression of Kv7.1 and Kv7.4 transcripts was found in rat heart tissue by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Western blots detected Kv7.4 subunits in mitochondria from Kv7.4-transfected cells, H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, freshly isolated adult cardiomyocytes, and whole hearts. Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that Kv7.4 subunits co-localized with mitochondrial markers in cardiac cells, with \u223c 30-40% of cardiac mitochondria being labelled by Kv7.4 antibodies, a result also confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy experiments. In isolated cardiac (but not liver) mitochondria, retigabine (1-30 \u00b5M) and flupirtine (30 \u00b5M), two selective Kv7 activators, increased Tl(+) influx, depolarized the membrane potential, and inhibited calcium uptake; all these effects were antagonized by the Kv7 blocker XE991. In intact H9c2 cells, reducing Kv7.4 expression by RNA interference blunted retigabine-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization; in these cells, retigabine decreased mitochondrial Ca(2+) levels and increased radical oxygen species production, both effects prevented by XE991. Finally, retigabine reduced cellular damage in H9c2 cells exposed to anoxia/re-oxygenation and largely prevented the functional and morphological changes triggered by global ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts.\nKv7.4 channels are present and functional in cardiac mitochondria; their activation exerts a significant cardioprotective role, making them potential therapeutic targets against I/R-induced cardiac injury.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2016-01-01", "authors": ["LaraTestai", "VincenzoBarrese", "Maria VirginiaSoldovieri", "PaoloAmbrosino", "AlmaMartelli", "IolandaVinciguerra", "FrancescoMiceli", "Iain AndrewGreenwood", "Michael JohnCurtis", "Maria CristinaBreschi", "Maria Jos\u00e8Sisalli", "AntonellaScorziello", "Miren JosuneCanduela", "PedroGrandes", "VincenzoCalderone", "MaurizioTaglialatela"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvv281"}

Some studies have demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key mediator of the cardiac growth in response to elevated TH levels. Although some of the main RAS components are changed in cardiac tissue on hyperthyroid state, the potential modulation of the counter regulatory components of the RAS, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2), angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) levels and Mas receptor induced by hyperthyroidism is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hyperthyroidism on cardiac Ang 1-7, ACE2 and Mas receptor levels.\nHyperthyroidism was induced in Wistar rats by daily intraperitoneal injections of T4 for 14 days.\nAlthough plasma Ang 1-7 levels were unchanged by hyperthyroidism, cardiac Ang 1-7 levels were increased in TH-induced cardiac hypertrophy. ACE2 enzymatic activity was significantly increased in hearts from hyperthyroid animals, which may be contributing to the higher Ang 1-7 levels observed in the T4 group.

{"title": "Prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy in diabetic rats by combined therapy of aFGF-loaded nanoparticles and ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction technique.", "abstract": "Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) has shown the great potential to prevent the structural and functional injuries caused by diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). The present study sought to investigate the preclinical performance and mechanism of the combination therapy of aFGF-nanoparticles (aFGF-NP) and ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) technique for DCM prevention. From Mason staining and TUNEL staining, aFGF-NP+UTMD group showed significant differences from the diabetes group and other groups treated with aFGF or aFGF-NP. The cardiac collagen volume fraction (CVF) and cardiac myocyte apoptosis index in aFGF-NP+UTMD group reduced to 4.15% and 2.31% respectively, compared with those in the diabetes group (20.5% and 11.3% respectively). Myocardial microvascular density (MCD) in aFGF-NP+UTMD group was up to 35n/hpf, much higher than that in the diabetes group (14n/hpf). The diabetes group showed similar results (MCD, CVF and cardiac myocyte apoptosis index) to other aFGF treatment groups (free aFGF\u00b1UTMD or aFGF-NP). Indexes from transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic evaluation also proved the same conclusion.

{"title": "FoxO1 signaling plays a pivotal role in the cardiac telomere biology responses to calorie restriction.", "abstract": "This study examined whether the forkhead transcription factors of O group 1 (FoxO1) might be involved in telomere biology during calorie restriction (CR). We used FoxO1-knockout heterozygous mice (FoxO1(+/-)) and wild-type mice (WT) as a control. Both WT and FoxO1(+/-) were subjected to ad libitum (AL) feeding or 30% CR compared to AL for 20 weeks from 15 weeks of age. The heart-to-body weight ratio, blood glucose, and serum lipid profiles were not different among all groups of mice at the end of the study. Telomere size was significantly lower in the FoxO1(+/-)-AL than the WT-AL, and telomere attrition was not observed in either WT-CR or FoxO1(+/-)-CR. Telomerase activity was elevated in the heart and liver of WT-CR, but not in those of FoxO1(+/-)-CR. The phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited and Sirt 1 was activated in heart tissues of WT-CR and FoxO1(+/-)-CR. However, the ratio of conjugated to cytosolic light chain 3 increased and the level of p62 decreased in WT-CR, but not in FoxO1(+/-)-CR. A marker of oxidative DNA damage, 8-OhdG, was significantly lower in WT-CR only. The level of MnSOD and eNOS increased, and the level of cleaved caspase-3 decreased in WT-CR, but not FoxO1(+/-)-CR. Echocardiography showed that the left ventricular end-diastolic and systolic dimensions were significantly lower in WT-CR or FoxO1(+/-)-CR than WT-AL or FoxO1(+/-)-AL, respectively. The present studies suggest that FoxO1 plays beneficial roles by inducing genes involved in telomerase activity, as well as anti-oxidant, autophagic, and anti-apoptotic genes under conditions of CR, and suggest that FoxO1 signaling may be an important mediator of metabolic equilibrium during CR.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2015-12-29", "authors": ["NMakino", "JOyama", "TMaeda", "MKoyanagi", "YHiguchi", "IShimokawa", "NMori", "TFuruyama"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-015-2615-8\n10.1016/j.mad.2005.03.012\n10.1152/ajpheart.00685.2011\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.154732\n10.1016/S0047-6374(96)01824-6\n10.1152/ajpheart.01236.2007\n10.1038/nrm1616\n10.1101/gad.1052903\n10.1093/emboj/18.11.2950\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2006.00224.x\n10.1161/01.RES.0000251281.00845.18\n10.1128/MCB.22.22.8056-8066.2002\n10.1126/science.289.5487.2126\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.029\n10.1042/BJ20070140\n10.1007/s11892-009-0034-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.163428\n10.1089/ars.2005.7.752\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.246108\n10.1038/cddis.2009.8\n10.1074/jbc.M314214200\n10.1152/ajpheart.00421.2009\n10.1007/s11010-015-2327-0\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.12.014\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.246488\n10.1093/cvr/cvn337\n10.1073/pnas.0400593101\n10.1161/01.RES.0000267723.65696.4a\n10.1371/journal.pone.0053760\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.08.014\n10.1073/pnas.0610290104\n10.1038/nrm2190\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.02093\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.08.014"}

In the present study, we investigated the effect of metformin on myocardial dysfunction and TLR4 activity in LPS-induced sepsis. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=6): control received normal saline (0.5ml), LPS group received lipopolysaccharide (0.5mg/kg; i.p), and metformin treated group received LPS (0.5mg/kg)+metformin (100mg/kg; i.p). 9h later the hemodynamic parameters were recorded, blood samples were collected, and the hearts were removed and weighted. The concentration of TNF-\u03b1, content of MYD88, the phosphorylation of AMPK, and the rate of TLR4 expression in the heart were assessed. In the animals treated with metformin, the preservation of left ventricular function was associated with the reduction of myeloperoxidase activity (31%, P<0.01) in the heart and decrease of TNF-\u03b1 level both in the serum and heart tissue (20%, P<0.01 and 42%, P<0.05, respectively). It was found that the level of phosphorylated AMPK in heart was significantly upregulated by 43% (P<0.001) in the metformin group while the content of TLRs adapter protein of MyD88 was reduced by 45% (P<0.05). This was associated with a remarkable decrease in the expression of myocardial TLR4. Furthermore, in a mice model of sepsis, coadministration of compound C (20mg/kg) as an AMPK inhibitor reversed the suppressive effects of metformin on TLR4 expression and MYD88 protein level.

However, the precise mechanism of baicalein against myocardial remodeling remains poorly understood. The aim of our study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of baicalein treatment in rats model of heart failure (HF) and rat myocardial cells (H9C2).\nHF model was established by abdominal aorta constriction in rats and incubation with 50\u03bcM isoproterenol for 48h in H9C2 cells. Various molecular biological experiments were performed to assess the effects of baicalein on cardiac function, myocardial remodeling, apoptosis and Ca(2+) handling proteins.\nIn the present study, first we found that baicalein alleviated HF in vivo. Additionally, treatment with baicalein inhibited the myocardial fibrosis, restrained the expression and activity of MMP2 and MMP9, and suppressed apoptosis in heart tissue. Moreover, baicalein could inhibit the cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis induced by isoproterenol in vitro. Finally we found that baicalein could modulate the expressions and activities of Ca(2+) handling proteins, including downregulation of phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and expression of Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchangers (NCX1), upregulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2 (SERCA2) and ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2).

{"title": "Na/K-ATPase signaling regulates collagen synthesis through microRNA-29b-3p in cardiac fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is accompanied by cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and dysfunction, which are commonly referred to as uremic cardiomyopathy. Our previous studies found that Na/K-ATPase ligands or 5/6th partial nephrectomy (PNx) induces cardiac fibrosis in rats and mice. The current study used in vitro and in vivo models to explore novel roles for microRNA in this mechanism of cardiac fibrosis formation. To accomplish this, we performed microRNA profiling with RT-qPCR based arrays on cardiac tissue from rats subjected to marinobufagenin (MBG) infusion or PNx. The analysis showed that a series of fibrosis-related microRNAs were dysregulated. Among the dysregulated microRNAs, microRNA (miR)-29b-3p, which directly targets mRNA of collagen, was consistently reduced in both PNx and MBG-infused animals. In vitro experiments demonstrated that treatment of primary cultures of adult rat cardiac fibroblasts with Na/K-ATPase ligands induced significant increases in the fibrosis marker, collagen protein, and mRNA expression compared with controls, whereas miR-29b-3p expression decreased >50%. Transfection of miR-29b-3p mimics into cardiac fibroblasts inhibited cardiotonic steroids-induced collagen synthesis. Moreover, a specific Na/K-ATPase signaling antagonist, pNaKtide, prevented ouabain-induced increases in collagen synthesis and decreases in miR-29b-3p expression in these cells. In conclusion, these data are the first to indicate that signaling through Na/K-ATPase regulates miRNAs and specifically, miR-29b-3p expression both in vivo and in vitro.

We examined the differentiation of rat BMMSCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells when induced with a combined low dose treatment of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and 5-azacytidine (5-AZA). Results showed that cell proliferation in the combined low dose treatment group of TGF-\u03b21 and 5-AZA was increased compared with the TGF-\u03b21 group or the 5-AZA group. The cell apoptosis was relieved by combined TGF-\u03b21 and 5-AZA treatment compared to 5-AZA treatment alone.

Here, we determine the age-associated changes in mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) signaling in the liver, muscle, adipose, and heart of C57BL/6J.Nia mice, the lifespan of which can be extended by rapamycin treatment.

Tissue and substrate-specific results were observed in the livers of HET3 and DBA/2 mouse strains, and in liver, muscle and adipose tissue of F344 rats.

A unique feature of our work was that we performed extensive in vitro biological analyses to assess the functionalities of cardiomyocytes (CMs) alone and in co-culture with cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) (2:1 ratio) within the hydrogel matrix.

{"title": "Stem cell death and survival in heart regeneration and repair.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are major causes of mortality and morbidity. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis disrupts cardiac function and leads to cardiac decompensation and terminal heart failure. Delineating the regulatory signaling pathways that orchestrate cell survival in the heart has significant therapeutic implications. Cardiac tissue has limited capacity to regenerate and repair. Stem cell therapy is a successful approach for repairing and regenerating ischemic cardiac tissue; however, transplanted cells display very high death percentage, a problem that affects success of tissue regeneration. Stem cells display multipotency or pluripotency and undergo self-renewal, however these events are negatively influenced by upregulation of cell death machinery that induces the significant decrease in survival and differentiation signals upon cardiovascular injury. While efforts to identify cell types and molecular pathways that promote cardiac tissue regeneration have been productive, studies that focus on blocking the extensive cell death after transplantation are limited. The control of cell death includes multiple networks rather than one crucial pathway, which underlies the challenge of identifying the interaction between various cellular and biochemical components. This review is aimed at exploiting the molecular mechanisms by which stem cells resist death signals to develop into mature and healthy cardiac cells. Specifically, we focus on a number of factors that control death and survival of stem cells upon transplantation and ultimately affect cardiac regeneration.

{"title": "Evidence for MOR on cell membrane, sarcoplasmatic reticulum and mitochondria in left ventricular myocardium in rats.", "abstract": "Cardiac function is one important determinant to maintain tissue oxygenation and is thus highly regulated. In this context, it is interesting that centrally mediated opioidergic influence on cardiac function has long been known. Only recently, KOR and DOR have been found to be expressed in healthy left ventricular myocardium in rats and colocalized with parts of the excitation-contraction-coupling system. However, several comments in literature exist doubting the existence of MOR in cardiac tissue. We, therefore, aimed to detect MOR in rat left ventricular cardiomyocytes, and to evaluate whether MOR and POMC are regulated during heart failure. After IRB approval, heart failure was induced using a modified infrarenal aortocaval fistula (ACF) in male Wistar rats. All rats of the control and ACF group were characterized by their morphometrics and hemodynamics and the existence of MOR and POMC was investigated by means of radioligand binding, double immunofluorescence confocal analysis, RT-PCR and Western blot. Membrane MOR selective binding sites were detected in the left ventricular myocardium, however, they were lower in abundance than KOR- and DOR-specific binding sites and B max of MOR could not be determined. In left ventricular cardiomyocytes, MOR colocalized with parts of the excitation-coupling mechanism, e.g., Cav1.2 of the cell membrane and invaginated T-tubules as well as the ryanodine receptor of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum. More importantly, MOR strongly colocalized with mitochondria of left ventricular cardiomyocytes. Volume overload was not associated with an altered expression of MOR and POMC on both mRNA and protein level. These findings provide evidence for the existence of MOR on the cell membrane, sarcoplasmatic reticulum and mitochondria in left ventricular cardiomyocytes in rats. However, heart failure does not result in an altered expression of the cardiac MOR-opioid system.

{"title": "DNA methylation in an engineered heart tissue model of cardiac hypertrophy: common signatures and effects of DNA methylation inhibitors.", "abstract": "DNA methylation affects transcriptional regulation and constitutes a drug target in cancer biology. In cardiac hypertrophy, DNA methylation may control the fetal gene program. We therefore investigated DNA methylation signatures and their dynamics in an in vitro model of cardiac hypertrophy based on engineered heart tissue (EHT). We exposed EHTs from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to a 12-fold increased afterload (AE) or to phenylephrine (PE 20 \u00b5M) and compared DNA methylation signatures to control EHT by pull-down assay and DNA methylation microarray. A 7-day intervention sufficed to induce contractile dysfunction and significantly decrease promoter methylation of hypertrophy-associated upregulated genes such as Nppa (encoding ANP) and Acta1 (\u03b1-skeletal actin) in both intervention groups. To evaluate whether pathological consequences of AE are affected by inhibiting de novo DNA methylation we applied AE in the absence and presence of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors: 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza, 100 \u00b5M, nucleosidic inhibitor), RG108 (60 \u00b5M, non-nucleosidic) or methylene disalicylic acid (MDSA, 25 \u00b5M, non-nucleosidic). Aza had no effect on EHT function, but RG108 and MDSA partially prevented the detrimental consequences of AE on force, contraction and relaxation velocity. RG108 reduced AE-induced Atp2a2 (SERCA2a) promoter methylation.

Some, such as frequent atrial or ventricular premature beats, may require long-term anti-arrhythmic therapy. In humans and small animals, sotalol hydrochloride (STL) is often used for chronic oral anti-arrhythmic therapy.

Electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed at different time points before and after IV STL administration. Mean peak plasma concentrations after IV and PO administration of STL were 1624\u2009ng/mL and 317\u2009ng/mL, respectively. The oral bioavailability was intermediate (48%) with maximal absorption after 0.94\u2009h, a moderate distribution and a mean elimination half-life of 15.24\u2009h. After IV administration, there was a significant increase in QT interval, but no significant changes in other electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters. Transient transpiration was observed after IV administration, but no adverse effects were noted after a single oral dose of 1\u2009mg/kg STL in any of the horses.

{"title": "Fibrous scaffolds for building hearts and heart parts.", "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and biochemistry provide cell-instructive cues that promote and regulate tissue growth, function, and repair. From a structural perspective, the ECM is a scaffold that guides the self-assembly of cells into distinct functional tissues. The ECM promotes the interaction between individual cells and between different cell types, and increases the strength and resilience of the tissue in mechanically dynamic environments. From a biochemical perspective, factors regulating cell-ECM adhesion have been described and diverse aspects of cell-ECM interactions in health and disease continue to be clarified. Natural ECMs therefore provide excellent design rules for tissue engineering scaffolds. The design of regenerative three-dimensional (3D) engineered scaffolds is informed by the target ECM structure, chemistry, and mechanics, to encourage cell infiltration and tissue genesis. This can be achieved using nanofibrous scaffolds composed of polymers that simultaneously recapitulate 3D ECM architecture, high-fidelity nanoscale topography, and bio-activity. Their high porosity, structural anisotropy, and bio-activity present unique advantages for engineering 3D anisotropic tissues. Here, we use the heart as a case study and examine the potential of ECM-inspired nanofibrous scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering. We asked: Do we know enough to build a heart? To answer this question, we tabulated structural and functional properties of myocardial and valvular tissues for use as design criteria, reviewed nanofiber manufacturing platforms and assessed their capabilities to produce scaffolds that meet our design criteria.

{"title": "\u03b1-MHC MitoTimer mouse: In vivo mitochondrial turnover model reveals remarkable mitochondrial heterogeneity in the heart.", "abstract": "In order to maintain an efficient, energy-producing network in the heart, dysfunctional mitochondria are cleared through the mechanism of autophagy, which is closely linked with mitochondrial biogenesis; these, together with fusion and fission comprise a crucial process known as mitochondrial turnover. Until recently, the lack of molecular tools and methods available to researchers has impeded in vivo investigations of turnover. To investigate the process at the level of a single mitochondrion, our laboratory has developed the MitoTimer protein. Timer is a mutant of DsRed fluorescent protein characterized by transition from green fluorescence to a more stable red conformation over 48 h, and its rate of maturation is stable under physiological conditions. We fused the Timer cDNA with the inner mitochondrial membrane signal sequence and placed it under the control of a cardiac-restricted promoter. This construct was used to create the alpha-MHC-MitoTimer mice. Surprisingly, initial analysis of the hearts from these mice demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity in the ratio of red-to-green fluorescence of MitoTimer in cardiac tissue. Further, scattered solitary mitochondria within cardiomyocytes display a much higher red-to-green fluorescence (red-shifted) relative to other mitochondria in the cell, implying a block in import of newly synthesized MitoTimer likely due to lower membrane potential. These red-shifted mitochondria may represent older, senescent mitochondria. Concurrently, the cardiomyocytes also contain a subpopulation of mitochondria that display a lower red-to-green fluorescence (green-shifted) relative to other mitochondria, indicative of germinal mitochondria that are actively engaged in import of newly-synthesized mito-targeted proteins. These mitochondria can be isolated and sorted from the heart by flow cytometry for further analysis. Initial studies suggest that these mice represent an elegant tool for the investigation of mitochondrial turnover in the heart.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["AleksandrStotland", "Roberta AGottlieb"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.032"}

Overstimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs) leads to the development of heart failure and is associated with the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in the heart. However, the mechanisms by which sustained \u03b2AR stimulation affects insulin resistance in the heart are incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that sustained \u03b2AR stimulation resulted in the inhibition of insulin-induced glucose uptake, and a reduction of insulin induced glucose transporter (GLUT)4 expression that were mediated by the \u03b22AR subtype in cardiomyocytes and heart tissue. Overstimulation of \u03b22AR inhibited the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes. Additionally, \u03b2AR mediated cardiac insulin resistance by reducing glucose uptake and GLUT4 expression via the cAMP-dependent and protein kinase A-dependent pathways. Treatment with \u03b2-blockers, including propranolol and metoprolol antagonized isoproterenol-mediated insulin resistance in the heart.

H9C2 cardiomyocyte cells were cultured on the scaffolds for one day, and electrical stimulation was applied to improve cell communication and interaction in neighboring pores. Cells on scaffolds were examined by fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, revealing that the combination of scaffold design and electrical stimulation significantly increased cell confluency of H9C2 cells on the scaffolds. Furthermore, we showed that the gene expression levels of Nkx2.5, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANF) and natriuretic peptide precursor B (NPPB), which are functional genes of the myocardium, were up-regulated by the incorporation of gold nanotubes/nanowires into the polyurethane scaffolds, in particular after electrical stimulation.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

{"title": "Shensongyangxin protects against pressure overload\u2011induced cardiac hypertrophy.", "abstract": "Shensongyangxin (SSYX) is a medicinal herb, which has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine. Various pharmacological activities of SSYX have been identified. However, the role of SSYX in cardiac hypertrophy remains to be fully elucidated. In present study, aortic banding (AB) was performed to induce cardiac hypertrophy in mice. SSYX (520 mg/kg) was administered by daily gavage between 1 and 8 weeks following surgery. The extent of cardiac hypertrophy was then evaluated by pathological and molecular analyses of heart tissue samples. In addition, in vitro experiments were performed to confirm the in vivo results. The data of the present study demonstrated that SSYX prevented the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis induced by AB, as assessed by measurements of heart weight and gross heart size, hematoxylin and eosin staining, cross\u2011sectional cardiomyocyte area and the mRNA expression levels of hypertrophic markers. SSYX also inhibited collagen deposition and suppressed the expression of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), connective tissue growth factor, fibronectin, collagen \u2160\u03b1 and collagen \u2162\u03b1, which was mediated by the inhibition of the TGF\u03b2/small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) signaling pathway. The inhibitory action of SSYX on cardiac hypertrophy was mediated by the inhibition of Akt signaling. In vitro investigations in the rat H9c2 cardiac cells also demonstrated that SSYX attenuated angiotensin II\u2011induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. These findings suggested that SSYX attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in the pressure overloaded mouse heart.

Appropriate patient preparation is important because the diagnostic accuracy of this procedure depends on adequate suppression of physiologic glucose uptake. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the effect of different patient preparations on the diagnostic accuracy of F-FDG PET/CT in cardiac sarcoidosis.\nWe searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cinicaltrials.gov databases. Sixteen studies (n = 559) were identified to be suitable for this systemic review. Studies were stratified according to fasting duration and means of physiologic suppression of F-FDG by cardiac tissue, which involves the use of heparin infusion or high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet before imaging. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Forest plots of sensitivity and specificity were calculated in Review Manager 5.3, and a random-effects hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model was created using MetaDiSc. Meta-regression was performed to investigate sources of heterogeneity.\nPET/CT had an overall Specificity of 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.80) and specificity of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85) for the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis. This modest diagnostic accuracy was attributed to the inclusion of large single study in which a short fasting duration before scanning likely influenced its sensitivity. Its exclusion resulted in an overall sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.86) and specificity of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.77-0.86).

Oxylipin levels in plasma and tissue were quantified by means of LC-MS. Moreover, clinical chemistry parameters were determined in plasma and interleukin levels (MCP-1 and IL-6) were determined in kidney and liver.\nElevation of liver function plasma parameters at 24 h revealed that both models were successful in the induction of sepsis. LPS induced sepsis resulted in a dramatic increase of plasma PGE2 (2,100% change in comparison to control) and other cyclooxygenase metabolites, whereas this effect was less pronounced in CLP induced sepsis (97% increase of PGE2). Plasma epoxy-fatty acids (FAs) and hydroxy-FAs and most of the dihydroxy-FAs were elevated in both models of sepsis. Changes of tissue oxylipin concentrations were organ dependent. Only few changes were detected in the lung and liver tissue, epoxy-FAs were elevated in the kidney. In the heart tissue a trend towards lower levels of hydroxy-FAs and epoxy-FAs was observed.\nBoth murine models of sepsis are characterized by changes of oxylipins formed in all branches of the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade.

Metformin is a drug with antihyperglycemic effects, and it has been shown to have a cardioprotective effect on left ventricular function in experimental animal models of myocardial ischemia. The present study investigated the cardioprotective effect of metformin in rats with doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.\nWistar albino rats were used in the study. Forty male, 10-week-old Wistar albino rats were randomly divided four groups. The control group rats were intraperitoneally administered saline solution twice a week, four doses in total. The doxorubicin group rats received doxorubicin (4 mg/kg, twice a week, cumulative dose: 16 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. The metformin group rats received metformin (250 mg/kg/day, every day for 14 days) via gavage. The doxorubicin + metformin group rats received doxorubicin and metformin at the same dose. Left ventricular functions were evaluated by using M-mode echocardiography one day after the last dose of doxorubicin. Heart tissue samples were histopathologically examined. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected using in situ terminal deoxynucleotide transferase assay (TUNEL). Serum brain natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide levels were measured. Catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were analyzed in the heart tissue. The assumptions of equality of variances and normal distribution were checked for all variables (Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Q graphics).To identify intergroup differences, one-way variant analysis or the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. A p<0.05 value was accepted as statistically significant.\nOur results showed that doxorubicin treatment caused significant deterioration in left ventricular functions by echocardiography, histological heart tissue damage, and increase in cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

{"title": "Dkk3 prevents familial dilated cardiomyopathy development through Wnt pathway.", "abstract": "To date, the role of Dickkopf 3 (Dkk3) on the pathogenesis of familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDCM), and whether and how Dkk3 interferes with Wnt signaling in heart tissues remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that strong Dkk3 expression was markedly downregulated in adult hearts from WT mice, and Dkk3 expression was upregulated suddenly in hearts from DCM mouse models. Using Dkk3 transgenic and knockout mice, as well as cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice, which manifests progressive chamber dilation and contractile dysfunction and has pathologic phenotypes similar to human DCM patients, we determined that transgenic expression of Dkk3 increased survival rate, improved cardiac morphology breakage and dysfunction, and ameliorated cardiac pathological changes in the cTnT(R141W) mice. In contrast, Dkk3 knockout reduced the survival rate and aggravated the pathological phenotypes of the cTnT(R141W) mice. The protective effects of Dkk3 appeared clearly at 3 months of age, peaked at 6 months of age, and decreased at 10 months of age in the cTnT(R141W) mice. Furthermore, we determined that Dkk3 upregulated Dvl1 (Dishevelled 1) and key proteins of the canonical Wnt pathway (cytoplasmic and nuclear \u03b2-catenin, c-Myc, and Axin2) and downregulated key proteins of the noncanonical Wnt pathway (c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII), and histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4)). In contrast, Dkk3 knockout reversed these changes in the cTnT(R141W) mice. In summary, Dkk3 could prevent FDCM development in mice, especially in the compensatory stage, and probably through activation of the canonical and inhibition of the noncanonical Wnt pathway, which suggested that Dkk3 could serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiomyopathy and heart failure.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2015-12-08", "authors": ["DanLu", "DanBao", "WeiDong", "NingLiu", "XuZhang", "ShanGao", "WenpingGe", "XiangGao", "LianfengZhang"], "doi": "10.1038/labinvest.2015.145"}

Hence, tyramine intake is suspected to have toxicological consequences in humans, while its administration to type 1 diabetic rodents has been reported to improve glucose tolerance. We investigated in mice whether prolonged tyramine ingestion could alter glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue physiology or cardiovascular functions. Tyramine was added at 0.04 or 0.14\u00a0% in the drinking water since this was estimated to increase by 10- to 40-fold the spontaneous tyramine intake of control mice fed a standard diet. Ten to 12\u00a0weeks of such tyramine supplementation did not influence body weight gain, adiposity or food consumption. Both doses (reaching approx. 300 and 1100\u00a0\u03bcmol tyramine/kg bw/day) decreased nonfasting blood glucose but did not modify glucose tolerance or fasting levels of glucose, insulin or circulating lipids. Blood pressure was not increased in tyramine-drinking mice, while only the higher tested dose moderately increased heart rate without change in its variability. Markers of cardiac tissue injury or oxidative stress remained unaltered, except an increased hydrogen peroxide production in heart preparations. In isolated adipocytes, tyramine inhibited lipolysis similarly in treated and control groups, as did insulin.

{"title": "The role of Wnt regulation in heart development, cardiac repair and disease: A tissue engineering perspective.", "abstract": "Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling has proven to be a fundamental mechanism in cardiovascular development as well as disease. Understanding its particular role in heart formation has helped to develop pluripotent stem cell differentiation protocols that produce relatively pure cardiomyocyte populations. The resultant cardiomyocytes have been used to generate heart tissue for pharmaceutical testing, and to study physiological and disease states. Such protocols in combination with induced pluripotent stem cell technology have yielded patient-derived cardiomyocytes that exhibit some of the hallmarks of cardiovascular disease and are therefore being used to model disease states. While FDA approval of new treatments typically requires animal experiments, the burgeoning field of tissue engineering could act as a replacement.

Here we report that uterine-derived CD11b cells significantly increase vasculogenesis and promote myocardial healing in ischemic cardiomyopathy.

The isolated fresh CD11b cells were transplanted into ischemic rat hearts 5 days after injury. Following transplantation, vasculogenesis significantly increased in ischemic cardiac tissue, which reduced infarct size and restored myocardial function and perfusion compared with controls. Thus, uterine CD11b cells have the potential to promote functional healing when implanted after ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Experiments were carried out on 33 Wistar rats. To evaluate cardiovascular effects of HPBCD, rats were infused with dextrose or HPBCD. In the poisoning model, amitriptyline (0.94\u00a0mg/kg/min) was infused until the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) dropped to 50\u00a0% of the baseline. Following amitriptyline infusion, dextrose, low-dose HPBCD (4.19\u00a0mg/kg/min), or high-dose HPBCD (16.76\u00a0mg/kg/min) was infused, and MAP, heart rate (HR), and electrocardiogram were recorded for 60\u00a0min. Hearts were examined for tissue damage and apoptosis. HPBCD infusion alone did not yield significant difference for MAP, HR, QRS duration, QT interval, and cardiac tissue damage when compared to dextrose (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In the poisoning model, MAP and HR decreased, while QRS duration and QT interval prolonged significantly following amitriptyline infusion (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0167).

IL-12 was mainly produced by CD11b(+) monocytes. Cardiac functions were significantly improved in IL-12p35 knockout (p35-KO) mice compared with wild-type (WT) littermates in response to AMI. IL-12p35 deficiency attenuated the infarct scar and hypertrophy compared with WT mice. RNA transcriptome sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of CD11b(+) monocytes isolated from WT and p35-KO ischaemic hearts revealed a distinct transcriptional profile in p35-KO CD11b(+) monocytes, displaying pro-angiogenesis and anti-inflammation properties. Angiogenesis was enhanced in p35-KO mice with AMI and hindlimb ischaemia. Moreover, tube formation assay and Matrigel plug analysis demonstrated that IL-12 inhibition of angiogenesis was dependent on monocytes.

Twelve week old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a lab chow (LC), HF (40% fat), or a HF diet supplemented with 10\u00a0mg/kg/day BM in drinking water. After 21 weeks, the left ventricles of hearts and cortex of kidneys of mice were collected for analysis. Histological analysis revealed that BM prevented HF diet-induced development of structural changes in the heart and kidneys. BM prevented HF diet-induced decreases in myocyte number in cardiac tissue, although this treatment also elevated cardiac endothelin signalling molecules. In the kidneys, BM administration prevented HF diet-induced renal corpuscle hypertrophy and attenuated endothelin signalling. Furthermore, in both the hearts and kidneys of mice fed a HF diet, BM administration prevented HF diet-induced increases in fat accumulation, macrophage infiltration and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) gene expression.

Autopsy series document cardiac inflammation and endomyocardial fibrosis in the HIV+ treatment na\u00efve, and gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging has identified prominent myocardial fibrosis in the majority of HIV+ individuals despite use of suppressive antiretroviral therapies (ART). The extent of such disease may correlate with specific ART regimens. For example, HIV-infected patients receiving ritonavir (RTV)-boosted protease inhibitors have the highest prevalence of CVD, and RTV-exposed rodents exhibit cardiac dysfunction coupled with cardiac and vascular fibrosis, independent of RTV-mediated lipid alterations. We recently showed that platelet transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 is a key contributor to cardiac fibrosis in murine models. We hypothesize that in the HIV+/ART na\u00efve, cardiac fibrosis is a consequence of proinflammatory cytokine and/or ART-linked platelet activation with release of TGF-\u03b21. Resultant TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling would promote collagen synthesis and organ fibrosis. We document these changes in a pilot immunohistochemical evaluation of cardiac tissue from two ART-naive pediatric AIDS patients. In terms of ART, we showed that RTV inhibits immunoproteasome degradation of TRAF6, a nuclear adapter signaling molecule critical to the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathways involved in osteoclast differentiation and accelerated osteoporosis. We now present a model illustrating how RTV could similarly amplify TGF-\u03b21 signaling in the promotion of cardiac fibrosis and accelerated CVD.

We studied lymphangiogenesis and LVD upon chronic concentric and chronic eccentric muscle contractions in both rat skeletal (Mm.

These observations were supported by opposing local remodelling of lymphatic vessel-specific extracellular matrix components in skeletal and cardiac muscles and protein levels of lymphatic markers (Lyve-1, Pdpn, Vegf-C/D). Confocal microscopy further revealed transformations of lymphatic vessels into vessels expressing both blood (Cav-1) and lymphatic (Vegfr-3) markers upon eccentric training specifically in skeletal muscles.

Thus, optimal tissue repair following injury requires tight control over myofibroblast activation. It is now recognized that inflammation plays a critical role in regulating fibrosis. In this review we will highlight how advances in the field of innate immunity have led to a better understanding of the role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease and, in particular, in the regulation of fibrosis. Specifically, we will discuss how the innate immune system recognizes tissue damage in settings of acute injury and chronic cardiovascular disease.

However, there is no report concerning the expression of NPY and its receptors in the heart during postnatal development. In the current study, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis was used to label NPY, and Y1R, Y2R, and Y5R receptors in the heart tissue and intramural cardiac ganglia from rats of different ages (newborn, 10 days old, 20 days old, 30 days old, 60 days old, 1 year old, and 2 years old).The obtained data suggest age-dependent changes of NPY-mediated heart innervation. The density of NPY-immunoreactive (IR) fibers was the least in newborn animals and increased in the first 20 days of life. In the atria of newborn and 10-day-old rats, NPY-IR fibers were more abundant compared with the ventricles. The vast majority of NPY-IR fibers also contained tyrosine hydroxylase, a key enzyme in catecholamine synthesis.The expression of Y1R increased between 10 and 20 days of life. Faint Y2R immunoreactivity was observed in the atria and ventricles of 20-day-old and older rats. In contrast, the highest level of the expression of Y5R was found in newborn pups comparing with more adult rats. All intramural ganglionic neurons were also Y1R-IR and Y5R-IR and Y2R-negative in all studied animals.Thus, the increasing of density of NPY-containing nerve fibers accompanies changes in relation of different subtypes of NPY receptors in the heart during development.", "journal": "Neuropeptides", "date": "2015-11-22", "authors": ["Petr MMasliukov", "KonstantinMoiseev", "Andrey IEmanuilov", "Tatyana AAnikina", "Alexey AZverev", "Alexandr DNozdrachev"], "doi": "10.1016/j.npep.2015.10.007"}

Using a 3D patterning technology that allows for the precise spatial distribution of cells within the device, we created an array of 3D cardiac microtissues from neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. We integrated the 3D micropatterning technology with microfluidics to achieve perfused cell-laden structures. The cells were encapsulated within a degradable gelatin methacrylate hydrogel, which was sandwiched between two polyacrylamide hydrogels. The polyacrylamide hydrogels were used as \"stress sensors\" to acquire the contractile stresses generated by the beating cardiac cells. The cardiac-specific response of the engineered 3D system was examined by exposing it to epinephrine, an adrenergic neurotransmitter known to increase the magnitude and frequency of cardiac contractions. In response to exogenous epinephrine the engineered cardiac tissues exhibited an increased beating frequency and stress magnitude.

Matricellular proteins are described as extracellular matrix-associated proteins that do not serve classical structural roles in the matrix such as those ascribed to laminins and collagens. The family of matricellular proteins modulates cell:extracellular matrix interactions and is actively expressed during tissue remodeling. Functional activities attributed to SPARC in cultured cells include regulation of cell adhesion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, proliferation, and matrix assembly. The primary phenotype characteristic of SPARC-null mice is a deficit in amounts of fibrillar collagen and fibril morphology. Strikingly, SPARC-null mice demonstrate a blunted fibrotic response in a number of different tissue settings. The role of monocyte/macrophages as an important component of tissue fibrosis is becoming increasingly appreciated. Expression of SPARC by bone marrow derived inflammatory cells raises the interesting proposition that SPARC produced by infiltrating leukocytes might contribute to the course of inflammation and tissue fibrosis in the heart. This review will summarize results from studies defining the function of SPARC in myocardial repair and fibrosis and results from other non-cardiac tissues that shed light onto possible consequences of SPARC expression by monocyte/macrophages in the setting of heart disease.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2015-11-20", "authors": ["Amy DBradshaw"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.014"}

Thus, this study has been designed to investigate the role and pharmacological potential of sphingosine-1-phosphate in diabetic rat heart. Diabetes was produced in Wistar rats by administration of a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (35 mg/kg, i.p., once) and feeding a high fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks. Isolated rat heart was subjected to 30 min ischaemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion (I/R). The heart was subjected to pre-ischaemic treatment (before ischaemia for 20 min) and pharmacological preconditioning with the S1P agonist FTY720 (0.6 \u03bcmol/L) with and without atractyloside (an mPTP opener; in the last episode of reperfusion before I/R). Myocardial infarction was assessed in terms of increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB), myeloperoxidase (MPO) level and infarct size (triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining). Immunohistochemistry analysis was done for assessment of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2 level in cardiac tissue. Pre-ischaemic treatment and pharmacological preconditioning with FTY720 significantly decreased I/R-induced myocardial infarction, TNF-alpha, GSK-3\u03b2 level and release of LDH and CK-MB as compared to control group. The cardioprotective effect of S1P agonist was significantly attenuated by atractyloside.

{"title": "Analysis of Mitochondrial Proteins in the Surviving Myocardium after Ischemia Identifies Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier Expression as Possible Mediator of Tissue Viability.", "abstract": "The endogenous mechanisms contributing to tissue survival following myocardial infarction are not fully understood. We investigated the alterations in the mitochondrial proteome after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and its possible implications on cell survival. Mitochondrial proteomic analysis of cardiac tissue from an in vivo porcine I/R model found that surviving tissue in the peri-infarct border zone showed increased expression of several proteins. Notably, these included subunits of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), namely MPC1 and MPC2. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA analysis corroborated the elevated expression of MPC in the surviving tissue. Furthermore, MPC1 and MPC2 protein levels were found to be markedly elevated in the myocardium of ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. These findings led to the hypothesis that increased MPC expression is cardioprotective due to enhancement of mitochondrial pyruvate uptake in the energy-starved heart following I/R. To test this, isolated mouse hearts perfused with a modified Krebs buffer (containing glucose, pyruvate, and octanoate as metabolic substrates) were subjected to I/R with or without the MPC transport inhibitor UK5099. UK5099 increased myocardial infarction and attenuated post-ischemic recovery of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. However, aerobically perfused control hearts that were exposed to UK5099 did not modulate contractile function, although pyruvate uptake was blocked as evidenced by increased cytosolic lactate and pyruvate levels. Our findings indicate that increased expression of MPC leads to enhanced uptake and utilization of pyruvate during I/R.

In this study we generated three COS-7 clones with different expression levels of Kv1.2 channel, and confirmed their functional variations with patch clamp analysis. Time-lapse imaging analysis showed that EF-induced cell migration response was Kv1.2 channel expression level depended. Inhibition of Kv1.2 channels with charybdotoxin (ChTX) constrained the sensitivity of COS-7 cells to EF stimulation more than their motility. Immunocytochemistry and pull-down analyses demonstrated association of Kv1.2 channels with actin-binding protein cortactin and its re-localization to the cathode-facing membrane at EF stimulation, which confirms the mechanism of EF-induced directional migration. This study displays that Kv1.2 channels represent an important physiological link in EF-induced cell migration.

We reported earlier that a specific proteasome isoform, the immunoproteasome, prevents exacerbation of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocardial destruction and preserves cell vitality in heart tissue inflammation. Following the aim to decipher molecular targets of immunoproteasome-dependent proteolysis, we investigated the function and regulation of the soluble PRR Pentraxin3 (PTX3). We show that the ablation of PTX3 in mice aggravated CVB3-triggered inflammatory injury of heart tissue, without having any significant effect on viral titers. Thus, there might be a role of PTX3 in preventing damage-associated molecular pattern-induced cell death. We found that the catalytic activity of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 regulates the timely availability of factors controlling PTX3 production. We report on immunoproteasome-dependent alteration of ERK1/2 and p38MAPKs, which were both found to be involved in PTX3 expression control. Our finding of a cardioprotective function of immunoproteasome-dependent PTX3 expression revealed a crucial mechanism of the stress-induced damage response in myocardial inflammation.

The aim of the study was to establish the role of these in the human heart in living patients. For this, polyamines (by high performance liquid chromatography) and the activity of ODC and N(1)-acetylpolyamine oxidases (APAO) were determined in the right atrial appendage of 17 patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation to correlate with clinical parameters. There existed enzymatic activity associated with the homeostasis of polyamines. Left atria size was positively associated with ODC (r = 0.661, P = 0.027) and negatively with APAO-N(1) -acetylspermine (r = -0.769, P = 0.026), suggesting that increased levels of polyamines are associated with left atrial hemodynamic overload.

In the present study, we elucidate that physical forces exerted by electroactuated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have a strong influence in regulating the lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). A novel platform that combines intracellular and extracellular GNPs as nano-manipulators was designed to trigger neurogenic/cardiomyogenic differentiation in hMSCs, in electric field stimulated culture condition. In order to mimic the native microenvironment of nerve and cardiac tissues, hMSCs were treated with physiologically relevant direct current electric field (DC EF) or pulsed electric field (PEF) stimuli, respectively. When exposed to regular intermittent cycles of DC EF stimuli, majority of the GNP actuated hMSCs acquired longer filopodial extensions with multiple branch-points possessing neural-like architecture. Such morphological changes were consistent with higher mRNA expression level for neural-specific markers. On the other hand, PEF elicited cardiomyogenic differentiation, which is commensurate with the tube-like morphological alterations along with the upregulation of cardiac specific markers. The observed effect was significantly promoted even by intracellular actuation and was found to be substrate independent. Further, we have substantiated the participation of oxidative signaling, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)]i elevation as the key upstream regulators dictating GNP assisted hMSC differentiation. Thus, by adopting dual stimulation protocols, we could successfully divert the DC EF exposed cells to differentiate predominantly into neural-like cells and PEF treated cells into cardiomyogenic-like cells, via nanoactuation of GNPs.

However, there is still no study that systemically elucidates the role of GAS6 in cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we found that GAS6 was upregulated in human dilated cardiomyopathic hearts, hypertrophic murine hearts, and angiotensin II-treated cardiomyocytes. Next, we examined the influence of GAS6 expression in response to a cardiac stress by inducing chronic pressure overload with aortic banding in wild-type and GAS6-knockout mice or cardiac-specific GAS6 overexpressing mice. Under basal conditions, the GAS6-knockout mice had normal left ventricular structure and function but after aortic banding, the mice demonstrated less hypertrophy, fibrosis, and contractile dysfunction when compared with wild-type mice. Conversely, cardiac-specific overexpression of GAS6 exacerbated aortic banding-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GAS6 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway during pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and the pharmacological mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 inhibitor U0126 almost completely reversed GAS6 overexpression-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, resulting in improved cardiac function.

Here we have investigated the effects of trimetazidine (TMZ) on pro-inflammatory responses of macrophages in endotoxin-induced myocardial dysfunction.\nMice pretreated with TMZ were injected i.p. with LPS and cardiac function evaluated. Levels of macrophage infiltration, macrophage inflammatory response and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were measured using immunohistochemical staining, elisa, real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, TUNEL and flow cytometry assays.\nPretreatment with TMZ prevented LPS-induced myocardial dysfunction and apoptosis. TMZ also lowered levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and cardiac tissue and myocardial macrophage infiltration. Bone marrow transplantation indicated that TMZ alleviated LPS-induced myocardial dysfunction via decreasing macrophage infiltration. TMZ reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated cardiac and peritoneal macrophages. Co-culture of TMZ-pretreated macrophages with cardiomyocytes and conditioned media from TMZ-pretreated macrophages both decreased LPS-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The anti-apoptosis effects of TMZ resulted from decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines, partly due to normalizing the sirtuin 1 (Sirt1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Nrf2/haem oxygenase-1 and Sirt1/PPAR\u03b1 pathways in macrophages.

The bilateral renal nerves were surgically denervated 3 days after MI had been induced by coronary artery ligation. Left ventricular function was assessed using echocardiography and a Millar catheter at 6 weeks post-MI. Plasma noradrenaline, angiotensin II and aldosterone, collagen volume fraction, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), MMP2, MMP9 and TIMP1 in heart tissue were measured 6 weeks after MI. In rats with MI3d+RSD compared with MI rats, RSD improved systolic and diastolic function, resulting in an improvement in ejection fraction (P < 0.05), fractional shortening (P < 0.05) and LV internal dimension in systole (P < 0.05) and diastole (P < 0.05). Additionally, RSD treatment decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (P < 0.05) and increased LV systolic pressure (P < 0.05) and maximal and minimal rate of LV pressure (both P < 0.05). Meanwhile, RSD reduced collagen content (P < 0.01). TIMP1 was upregulated (P < 0.05), whereas MMP2, MMP9 and TGF-\u03b21 were downregulated in the LV of RSD-treated animals (P < 0.05). Renal sympathetic denervation has therapeutic effects on post-MI LV remodelling, probably owing to effects on the extracellular matrix by regulation of the MMP9-TIMP1 balance in the TGF-\u03b21 signalling pathway. Renal sympathetic denervation may be considered as a non-pharmacological approach for the improvement of post-MI cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "Experimental physiology", "date": "2015-11-12", "authors": ["Xiao-XinZheng", "Xiao-YanLi", "Yong-NanLyu", "Yi-YuHe", "Wei-GuoWan", "Hong-LingZhu", "Xue-JunJiang"], "doi": "10.1113/EP085302"}

Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in rats, and cells were directly transplanted into the border regions of ischemic heart tissue.\nCulture of UCB mononuclear cells yielded two distinct types of cells by morphology after 2 weeks in the same culture conditions. These cells were identified as late EPC and MSC, and each was intramyocardially injected into rat hearts after induction of MI. Echocardiography and histologic analyses demonstrated that both EPC and MSC improved cardiac function and enhanced vascularization, although fibrosis was reduced only in the EPC transplanted hearts. Different paracrine factors were enriched in EPC and MSC. However, once injected into the hearts, they induced similar types of paracrine factors in the heart. Transplanted EPC or MSC were mostly localized at the perivascular areas. This study demonstrated that EPC and MSC can be simultaneously derived from UCB under the same initial culture conditions, and that common paracrine factors are involved in the repair of MI.\nLate EPC and MSC are effective for infarct repair, apparently mediated through common humoral mechanisms.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2015-11-10", "authors": ["Sung-WhanKim", "Hong LianJin", "Seok-MinKang", "SinyoungKim", "Kyung-JongYoo", "YangsooJang", "Hyun OkKim", "Young-supYoon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.10.110"}

This study was to explore the toxic effect and mechanisms of low-dose exposure of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) on cardiac function in zebrafish embryos via the intravenous microinjection. The dosage of SiNPs was based on the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of malformation assessment in zebrafish embryos. The mainly cardiac toxicity phenotypes induced by SiNPs were pericardial edema and bradycardia but had no effect on atrioventricular block. Using o-Dianisidine for erythrocyte staining, the cardiac output of zebrafish embryos was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Microarray analysis and bioinformatics analysis were performed to screen the differential expression genes and possible pathway involved in cardiac function. SiNPs induced whole-embryo oxidative stress and neutrophil-mediated cardiac inflammation in Tg(mpo:GFP) zebrafish. Inflammatory cells were observed in atrium of SiNPs-treated zebrafish heart by histopathological examination. In addition, the expression of TNNT2 protein, a cardiac contraction marker in heart tissue had been down-regulated compared to control group using immunohistochemistry. Confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot assays, results showed that SiNPs inhibited the calcium signaling pathway and cardiac muscle contraction via the down-regulated of related genes, such as ATPase-related genes (atp2a1l, atp1b2b, atp1a3b), calcium channel-related genes (cacna1ab, cacna1da) and the regulatory gene tnnc1a for cardiac troponin C.

Ultrasound thermography has been proposed as a non-invasive technique for temperature measurement, and accurate calibration of the temperature-dependent ultrasound signal changes against temperature is required. Here we report a method that uses infrared thermography for calibration and validation of ultrasound thermography. Using phantoms and cardiac tissue specimens subjected to high-intensity focused ultrasound heating, we simultaneously acquired ultrasound and infrared imaging data from the same surface plane of a sample. The commonly used echo time shift-based method was chosen to compute ultrasound thermometry. We first correlated the ultrasound echo time shifts with infrared-measured temperatures for material-dependent calibration and found that the calibration coefficient was positive for fat-mimicking phantom (1.49 \u00b1 0.27) but negative for tissue-mimicking phantom (-0.59 \u00b1 0.08) and cardiac tissue (-0.69 \u00b1 0.18\u00b0C-mm/ns). We then obtained the estimation error of the ultrasound thermometry by comparing against the infrared-measured temperature and revealed that the error increased with decreased size of the heated region. Consistent with previous findings, the echo time shifts were no longer linearly dependent on temperature beyond 45\u00b0C-50\u00b0C in cardiac tissues.

{"title": "In vitro maturation of large-scale cardiac patches based on a perfusable starter matrix by cyclic mechanical stimulation.", "abstract": "The ultimate goal of tissue engineering is the generation of implants similar to native tissue. Thus, it is essential to utilize physiological stimuli to improve the quality of engineered constructs. Numerous publications reported that mechanical stimulation of small-sized, non-perfusable, tissue engineered cardiac constructs leads to a maturation of immature cardiomyocytes like neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or induced pluripotent stem cells/embryonic stem cells derived self-contracting cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of mechanical stimulation and perfusion on the maturation process of large-scale (2.5\u00d74.5cm), implantable cardiac patches based on decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) or Biological Vascularized Matrix (BioVaM) and a 3-dimensional construct containing neonatal rat heart cells. Application of cyclic mechanical stretch improved contractile function, cardiomyocyte alignment along the stretch axis and gene expression of cardiomyocyte markers. The development of a complex network formed by endothelial cells within the cardiac construct was enhanced by cyclic stretch. Finally, the utilization of BioVaM enabled the perfusion of the matrix during stimulation, augmenting the beneficial influence of cyclic stretch. Thus, this study demonstrates the maturation of cardiac constructs with clinically relevant dimensions by the application of cyclic mechanical stretch and perfusion of the starter matrix.\nConsidering the poor endogenous regeneration of the heart, engineering of bioartificial cardiac tissue for the replacement of infarcted myocardium is an exciting strategy. Most techniques for the generation of cardiac tissue result in relative small-sized constructs insufficient for clinical applications. Another issue is to achieve cardiomyocytes and tissue maturation in culture. Here we report, for the first time, the effect of mechanical stimulation and simultaneous perfusion on the maturation of cardiac constructs of clinical relevant dimensions, which are based on a perfusable starter matrix derived from porcine small intestine. In response to these stimuli superior organization of cardiomyocytes and vascular networks was observed in contrast to untreated controls.

The aim of our study was to investigate the possible cardiovascular effects of nandrolone decanoate on young rabbits using echocardiography, histology and monitoring of telomerase activity, oxidative stress and biochemical markers. Fourteen rabbits were divided into three administration groups and the control group. Doses of 4mg/kg and 10mg/kg of nandrolone decanoate, given intramuscularly and subcutaneously, two days per week for six months were applied. A 4-months wash-out period followed.

Thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS) levels were significantly increased in the high dose groups, while catalase activity decreased. Myocardial Performance Index (MPI) is the main echocardiographic index primarily affected by nandrolone administration in rabbits. Despite the preserved systolic performance, histological lesions observed associated with distorted MPI values, point to diastolic impairment of the thickened myocardium due to nandrolone treatment.

{"title": "Bioengineering Human Myocardium on Native Extracellular Matrix.", "abstract": "More than 25 million individuals have heart failure worldwide, with \u22484000 patients currently awaiting heart transplantation in the United States. Donor organ shortage and allograft rejection remain major limitations with only \u22482500 hearts transplanted each year. As a theoretical alternative to allotransplantation, patient-derived bioartificial myocardium could provide functional support and ultimately impact the treatment of heart failure.\nThe objective of this study is to translate previous work to human scale and clinically relevant cells for the bioengineering of functional myocardial tissue based on the combination of human cardiac matrix and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.\nTo provide a clinically relevant tissue scaffold, we translated perfusion-decellularization to human scale and obtained biocompatible human acellular cardiac scaffolds with preserved extracellular matrix composition, architecture, and perfusable coronary vasculature. We then repopulated this native human cardiac matrix with cardiomyocytes derived from nontransgenic human induced pluripotent stem cells and generated tissues of increasing 3-dimensional complexity. We maintained such cardiac tissue constructs in culture for 120 days to demonstrate definitive sarcomeric structure, cell and matrix deformation, contractile force, and electrical conduction. To show that functional myocardial tissue of human scale can be built on this platform, we then partially recellularized human whole-heart scaffolds with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Under biomimetic culture, the seeded constructs developed force-generating human myocardial tissue and showed electrical conductivity, left ventricular pressure development, and metabolic function.\nNative cardiac extracellular matrix scaffolds maintain matrix components and structure to support the seeding and engraftment of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and enable the bioengineering of functional human myocardial-like tissue of multiple complexities.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2015-10-28", "authors": ["Jacques PGuyette", "Jonathan MCharest", "Robert WMills", "Bernhard JJank", "Philipp TMoser", "Sarah EGilpin", "Joshua RGershlak", "TatsuyaOkamoto", "GabrielGonzalez", "David JMilan", "Glenn RGaudette", "Harald COtt"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306874"}
{"title": "Immunohistochemical determination of the extracellular matrix modulation in a rat model of choline-deprived myocardium: the effects of carnitine.", "abstract": "Choline has been identified as an essential nutrient with crucial role in many vital biological functions. Recent studies have demonstrated that heart dysfunction can develop in the setting of choline deprivation even in the absence of underlying heart disease. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are responsible for extracellular matrix degradation, and the dysregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 has been involved in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular disorders. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of MMPs and their inhibitors (TIMPs), in the pathogenesis of choline deficiency-induced cardiomyopathy, and the way they are affected by carnitine supplementation. Male Wistar Albino adult rats were divided into four groups and received standard or choline-deficient diet with or without L-carnitine in drinking water (0.15% w/v) for 1 month. Heart tissue immunohistochemistry for MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 was performed. Choline deficiency was associated with suppressed immunohistochemical expression of MMP-2 and an increased expression of TIMP-2 compared to control, while it had no impact on TIMP-1. MMP-9 expression was decreased without, however, reaching statistical significance. Carnitine did not affect MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 expression. The pattern of TIMP and MMP modulation observed in a choline deficiency setting appears to promote fibrosis. Carnitine, although shown to suppress fibrosis, does not seem to affect MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 expression.

{"title": "Extracardiac-Lodged Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Propel an Inflammatory Response Against Myocardial Infarction via Paracrine Effects.", "abstract": "Transplantation of stem cells, including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), improves the recovery of cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI) in experimental studies using animal models and in patients. However, the improvement of cardiac function following MSC transplantation remains suboptimal in both preclinical and clinical studies. Understanding the mechanism of cell therapy may improve its therapeutic outcomes, but the mode of action mediating stem cell promotion of cardiac repair is complex and not fully understood. Recent studies suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs on the macrophage M1/M2 subtype transition allow the transplanted stem cells to inhibit inflammation-induced injury and promote cardiac repair in acute MI. However, equally compelling evidence shows that there is poor survival and minimal graft persistence of transplanted MSCs within the infarcted heart tissues, negating the view that graft survival per se is required for the observed high rate and long duration of the transition from proinflammatory M1 to reparative M2 macrophages in the infarcted myocardium. Therefore, we raised a novel hypothesis that the therapeutic effects of MSC transplantation for acute MI depends not primarily on the grafted cells in infarct myocardium, but that MSCs migrating to and being lodged in the extracardiac organs, demonstrating good graft survival and persistence, may render the therapeutic effects in MI. More specifically, MSC transplantation promotes the transition from M1 to M2 in extracardiac organs, such as spleen and bone marrow, and therapeutic effects are conferred to the infarcted myocardium via paracrine effects. In MSC transplantation, the conversion from proinflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 monocytes may occur remotely from the heart and may serve as one of the major pathways in regulating the dual effects of inflammation. This hypothesis, if proven valid, may represent an important new mechanism of action to be considered for the future of MSC transplantation in the treatment of MI.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2015-10-27", "authors": ["YiPeng", "WeiPan", "YaliOu", "WeifangXu", "SussannahKaelber", "Cesario VBorlongan", "MeiqinSun", "GuolongYu"], "doi": "10.3727/096368915X689758"}

Limited cell derivation and cell number in cardiac tissue makes it difficult to study the cardiovascular disease using the existing cardiac cell model. Regarding the neurodegenerative disorders, the most potential sources of cell therapeutics such as fetal-derived primary neurons and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are associated with ethical or technical limitations. The successful derivation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by de-differentiation of somatic cells offers significant potential to overcome hurdles in the field of the replacement therapy. Human iPSCs are functionally similar to human embryonic stem cells, and can be derived autologously without the ethical challenges associated with human ESCs. The iPSCs can, in turn, be differentiated into all cell types including neurons, cardiac cells, blood and liver cells, etc. Recently, target tissues derived from human iPSCs such as cardiomyocytes (CMs) or neurons have been used for new disease modeling and regenerative medicine therapies.

We speculated that the concentration of donepezil in heart tissue might be increased as a result of interaction with cilostazol at efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2), which are expressed in many tissues including the heart, and our study tested this hypothesis. First, donepezil was confirmed to be a substrate of both BCRP and P-glycoprotein in transporter-transfected cells in vitro. Cilostazol inhibited BCRP and P-glycoprotein with half-inhibitory concentrations of 130 nM and 12.7 \u03bcM, respectively. Considering the clinically achievable unbound plasma concentration of cilostazol (about 200 nM), it is plausible that BCRP-mediated transport of donepezil would be affected by cilostazol in vivo. Indeed, in an in vivo rat study, we found that coadministration of cilostazol significantly increased the concentrations of donepezil in the heart and brain, where BCRP functions as a part of the blood-tissue barrier, whereas the plasma concentration of donepezil was unaffected. In addition, in vitro accumulation of donepezil in heart tissue slices of rats was significantly increased in the presence of cilostazol. These results indicate that donepezil-cilostazol interaction at BCRP may be clinically relevant in heart and brain tissues. In other words, the tissue distribution of drugs can be influenced by drug-drug interaction (DDI) at efflux transporters in certain tissues (local DDI) without any apparent change in plasma concentration (systemic DDI).", "journal": "Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals", "date": "2015-10-16", "authors": ["RyotaTakeuchi", "KohkiShinozaki", "TakeoNakanishi", "IkumiTamai"], "doi": "10.1124/dmd.115.066654"}

Clinical data were registered and patient follow-up was conducted.\nPatients with permanent AF had significantly higher SDF-1\u03b1 levels (2199.5\u2009pg/ml) than the patients with paroxysmal AF (1982.0\u2009pg/ml) and persistent AF (1906.0\u2009pg/ml), p\u2009<\u20090.0005. Higher SDF-1\u03b1 level was associated with longer time spent in the hospital per readmission, p\u2009<\u20090.05.\nIn AF patients, a higher SDF-1\u03b1 level was found in patients with a more progressive state of arrhythmia and was associated with longer hospitalizations. These findings suggest that SDF-1\u03b1 could prove valuable in risk stratification and evaluating the disease burden in AF patients.", "journal": "Scandinavian cardiovascular journal : SCJ", "date": "2015-10-07", "authors": ["DanaLi", "LouiseBj\u00f8rnager", "AnneLangkilde", "OveAndersen", "ChristianJ\u00f8ns", "Bue F RAgner", "UlrikDixen", "Nadia LLandex"], "doi": "10.3109/14017431.2015.1103892"}
{"title": "Pharmacological identification of cholinergic receptor subtypes on Drosophila melanogaster larval heart.", "abstract": "The Drosophila melanogaster heart is a popular model in which to study cardiac physiology and development. Progress has been made in understanding the role of endogenous compounds in regulating cardiac function in this model. It is well characterized that common neurotransmitters act on many peripheral and non-neuronal tissues as they flow through the hemolymph of insects. Many of these neuromodulators, including acetylcholine (ACh), have been shown to act directly on the D. melanogaster larval heart. ACh is a primary neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates and at the neuromuscular junctions on skeletal and cardiac tissue. In insects, ACh is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter of sensory neurons and is also prominent in the CNS. A full understanding regarding the regulation of the Drosophila cardiac physiology by the cholinergic system remains poorly understood. Here we use semi-intact D. melanogaster larvae to study the pharmacological profile of cholinergic receptor subtypes, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), in modulating heart rate (HR). Cholinergic receptor agonists, nicotine and muscarine both increase HR, while nAChR agonist clothianidin exhibits no significant effect when exposed to an open preparation at concentrations as low as 100\u00a0nM. In addition, both nAChR and mAChR antagonists increase HR as well but also display capabilities of blocking agonist actions. These results provide evidence that both of these receptor subtypes display functional significance in regulating the larval heart's pacemaker activity.", "journal": "Journal of comparative physiology.

Although reperfusion therapy is the treatment to increase blood supply to the ischemic myocardium, this intervention potentially causes cardiac tissue damage and instigates arrhythmias, processes known as reperfusion injury. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are glycemic control drugs commonly used in T2DM patients. Growing evidence from basic and clinical studies demonstrates that a DPP-4 inhibitor could exert cardioprotection and improve left ventricular function by reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and increasing reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) activity. However, recent reports also showed potentially adverse cardiac events due to the use of a DPP-4 inhibitor.

The increase speed of depth became quite slowly in the model with fat layer after 30\u2009s. When ablation depth needed fixed, there are no significant effect on effectively ablation depth whether fat layer over or not.

These models are, however, inappropriate in the context of large scale simulations, which have been traditionally performed by the use of continuum and macroscopic models, such as the monodomain and the bidomain models. However, continuum models may fail to reproduce many important physiological and physiopathological aspects of cardiac electrophysiology, for instance, those related to slow conduction. In this study, we develop a new mathematical model that combines characteristics of both continuum and discrete models. The new model was evaluated in scenarios of low gap-junctional coupling, where slow conduction is observed, and was able to reproduce conduction block, increase of the maximum upstroke velocity and of the repolarization dispersion. None of these features can be captured by continuum models.

{"title": "Finite element implementation of a new model of slight compressibility for transversely isotropic materials.", "abstract": "Modelling transversely isotropic materials in finite strain problems is a complex task in biomechanics, and is usually addressed by using finite element (FE) simulations. The standard method developed to account for the quasi-incompressible nature of soft tissues is to decompose the strain energy function (SEF) into volumetric and deviatoric parts. However, this decomposition is only valid for fully incompressible materials, and its use for slightly compressible materials yields an unphysical response during the simulation of hydrostatic tension/compression of a transversely isotropic material. This paper presents the FE implementation as subroutines of a new volumetric model solving this deficiency in two FE codes: Abaqus and FEBio. This model also has the specificity of restoring the compatibility with small strain theory. The stress and elasticity tensors are first derived for a general SEF.

However, the functionality of these tissues is still unable to match that of native cardiac tissue and many of the stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes display an immature, fetal like phenotype. In this review, we seek to elucidate the biological underpinnings of both mechanical and electrical signaling, as identified via studies related to cardiac development and those related to an evaluation of cardiac disease progression. Next, we review the different types of bioreactors developed to individually deliver electrical and mechanical stimulation to cardiomyocytes in vitro in both two and three-dimensional tissue platforms. Reactors and culture conditions that promote functional cardiomyogenesis in vitro are also highlighted. We then cover the more recent work in the development of bioreactors that combine electrical and mechanical stimulation in order to mimic the complex signaling environment present in vivo.

Several in vivo studies have shown that ZEN is haematotoxic and hepatotoxic and causes several alterations of immunological parameters. Meantime, the available information on the cardiotoxic effects of ZEN is very much limited. In the present study, we investigated the toxic effects of ZEN in heart tissues of Balb/c mice. We demonstrated that ZEN (40 mg kg(-1) body weight (b.w.)) increased creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and induced oxidative stress as monitored by measuring the malondialdehyde level, the generation of protein carbonyls, the catalase and superoxide dismutase activity and the expression of the heat shock proteins (Hsp 70). We also demonstrated that acute administration of ZEN triggers apoptosis in cardiac tissue. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of crocin (CRO), a natural carotenoid, to prevent ZEN-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. In fact, combined treatment of ZEN with different doses of CRO (50, 100, and 250 mg kg(-1) b.w.) showed a significant reduction of ZEN-induced toxicity for all tested markers in a dose-dependent manner.

A potentially ideal cECM scaffold would be immunologically acceptable while preserving the native cECM niche. Production of such a scaffold necessitates removal of cellular and antigenic components from cardiac tissue while preserving cECM structure/function properties. Existing decellularization methodologies predominantly utilize denaturing detergents which might irreversibly alter cECM material properties. To overcome potential deficiencies of current approaches, the effect of sarcomere relaxation and disassembly on resultant cECM scaffold cellularity was investigated. Additionally, the ability of sequential differential protein solubilization (antigen removal-AR) to reduce cECM scaffold antigenicity was examined. Sarcomeric relaxation and disassembly were necessary to achieve scaffold acellularity. All groups in which AR was employed displayed statistically significant decreases in residual antigenicity regardless of their degree of acellularity. AR combined with sarcomeric disassembly preserved structural, biochemical, mechanical and recellularization properties of the cECM scaffold. However, sodium dodecyl sulfate significantly altered cECM properties.

However, FEM is only as good as the underlying constitutive model, which remains a major challenge to the biomechanics community. In this study, a recently developed structurally based constitutive model was implemented to model healthy left ventricular myocardium during passive diastolic filling. This model takes into account the orthotropic response of the heart under loading. In-vivo strains were measured from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of porcine hearts, along with synchronous catheterization pressure data, and used for parameter identification of the passive constitutive model. Optimization was performed by minimizing the difference between MRI measured and FE predicted strains and cavity volumes. A similar approach was followed for the parameter identification of a widely used phenomenological constitutive law, which is based on a transversely isotropic material response. Results indicate that the parameter identification with the structurally based constitutive law is more sensitive to the assigned fiber architecture and the fit between the measured and predicted strains is improved with more realistic sheet angles. In addition, the structurally based model is capable of generating a more physiological end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship in the ventricle.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2015-07-29", "authors": ["AmirNikou", "Shauna MDorsey", "Jeremy RMcGarvey", "Joseph HGorman", "Jason ABurdick", "James JPilla", "Robert CGorman", "Jonathan FWenk"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-015-1403-7"}

This study was performed to adjust the hypothesis that PPAR-\u03b1 receptor inhibition protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction in mice. Male Balb/c mice were used in this study. Left atria were isolated, and their contractility was measured in response to electrical field stimulation in a standard organ bath.

In hearts from donors without DS, DNA methylation status at CpG site -865 correlated with AKR7A2 mRNA (Pearson's regression coefficient, r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.4051, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0264) and AKR7A2 protein expression (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.5818, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0071). In heart tissue from donors with DS, DNA methylation status at CpG site -232 correlated with AKR7A2 protein expression (r\u00a0=\u00a00.8659, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0025). Multiple linear regression modeling revealed that methylation at several CpG sites is associated with the synthesis of cardiotoxic daunorubicinol. AKR7A2 methylation status in lymphoblastoid cell lines from donors with and without DS was examined to explore potential parallelisms between cardiac tissue and lymphoid cells. These results suggest that DNA methylation impacts AKR7A2 expression and the synthesis of cardiotoxic daunorubicinol.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2015-05-13", "authors": ["Carrie CHoefer", "AdolfoQui\u00f1ones-Lombra\u00f1a", "Rachael HagemanBlair", "Javier GBlanco"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-015-9327-x"}

{"title": "Electrospun type 1 collagen matrices preserving native ultrastructure using benign binary solvent for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Electrospinning is a well-established technique that uses a high electric field to fabricate ultrafine fibrous scaffolds from both natural and synthetic polymers to mimic the cellular microenvironment. Collagen is one of the most preferred biopolymers, due to its widespread occurrence in nature and its biocompatibility. Electrospinning of collagen alone has been reported, with fluoroalcohols such as hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and trifluoroethanol (TFE), but the resultant collagen lost its characteristic ultrastructural integrity of D-periodicity 67 nm banding, confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the fluoroalcohols used were toxic to the environment. In this study, we describe the use of glacial acetic acid and DMSO to dissolve collagen and generate electrospun nanofibers of collagen type 1, which is non-toxic and economical. TEM analysis revealed the characteristic feature of native collagen triple helical repeats, showing 67 nm D-periodicity banding pattern and confirming that the ultrastructural integrity of the collagen was maintained. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed fiber diameters in the range of 200-1100 nm. Biocompatibility of the three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds was established by MTT assays using rat skeletal myoblasts (L6 cell line) and confocal microscopic analysis of immunofluorescent-stained sections of collagen scaffolds for muscle-specific markers such as desmin and actin. Primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCM) seeded onto the collagen scaffolds were able to maintain their contractile function for a period of 17 days and also expressed higher levels of desmin when compared with 2D cultures. We report for the first time that collagen type 1 can be electrospun without blending with copolymers using the novel benign solvent combination, and the method can be potentially explored for applications in tissue engineering.", "journal": "Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology", "date": "2015-05-12", "authors": ["AnuradhaElamparithi", "Alan MPunnoose", "SarahKuruvilla"], "doi": "10.3109/21691401.2015.1029629"}

This technique allows for the generation of a complex three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix scaffold, with the preservation of the intrinsic 3D basket-weave macroarchitecture of the heart itself. The decellularized scaffold can then be recellularized by seeding it with cells and incubating it in perfusion bioreactors in order to create functional organ constructs for transplantation.

The animal groups included the control group, exercise group (EX), nandrolone group (Nan), vehicle group (Arach), trained vehicle group (Arach + Ex) and trained nandrolone group (Nan + Ex) that treated for 8 weeks. Then, arrhythmia induction was performed by intravenous infusion of aconitine and electrocardiogram recorded.

Chronic administration of nandrolone with low-intensity endurance swimming exercise had no significant effect on blood pressure, heart rate and basal ECG parameters except RR interval that showed increase (P < 0.05). Low-intensity exercise could prevent the incremental effect of nandrolone on MDA and HYP significantly.

Nandrolone along with exercise significantly increased the duration of VF (P < 0.05) and reduced the VF latency (P < 0.05).

{"title": "In vivo vascularization of cell sheets provided better long-term tissue survival than injection of cell suspension.", "abstract": "Cell sheets have shown a remarkable ability for repairing damaged myocardium in clinical and preclinical studies. Although they demonstrate a high degree of viability as engrafted cells in vivo, the reason behind their survivability is unclear. In this study, the survival and vascularization of rat cardiac cell sheets transplanted in the subcutaneous tissue of athymic rats were investigated temporally. The cell sheets showed significantly higher survival than cell suspensions for up to 12 months, using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system to detect luciferase-positive transplanted cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay also showed a smaller number of apoptotic cells in the cell sheets than in the cell suspensions at 1 day. Rapid vascular formation and maturation were observed inside the cell sheets using an in vivo imaging system. Leaky vessels appeared at 6 h, red blood cells flowing through functional vessels appeared at 12 h, and morphologically matured vessels appeared at 7 days. In addition, immunostaining of cell sheets with nerve/glial antigen-2 (NG2) showed that vessel maturity increased over time. Interestingly, these results correlated with the dynamics of cell sheet mRNA expression. Genes related to endothelial cells (ECs) proliferation, migration and vessel sprouting were highly expressed within 1 day, and genes related to pericyte recruitment and vessel maturation were highly expressed at 3 days or later. This suggested that the cell sheets could secrete appropriate angiogenic factors in a timely way after transplantation, and this ability might be a key reason for their high survival.

{"title": "Effects of electromagnetic field exposure on the heart: a systematic review.", "abstract": "The use of electrical devices has gradually increased throughout the last century, and scientists have suggested that electromagnetic fields (EMF) generated by such devices may have harmful effects on living creatures. This work represents a systematic review of collective scholarly literature examining the effects of EMFs on the heart. Although most works describing effects of EMF exposure have been carried out using city electric frequencies (50-60 Hz), a consensus has not been reached about whether long- or short-term exposure to 50-60 Hz EMF negatively affects the heart. Studies have indicated that EMFs produced at cell-phone frequencies cause no-effect on the heart. Differences between results of studies may be due to a compensatory response developed by the body over time. At greater EMF strengths or shorter exposures, the ability of the body to develop compensation mechanisms is reduced and the potential for heart-related effects increases. It is noteworthy that diseases of heart tissues such as myocardial ischemia can also be successfully treated using EMF. Despite the substantial volume of data that has been collected on heart-related effects of EMFs, additional studies are needed at the cellular and molecular level to fully clarify the subject. Until the effects of EMF on heart tissue are more fully explored, electronic devices generating EMFs should be approached with caution.", "journal": "Toxicology and industrial health", "date": "2013-09-12", "authors": ["OnurElmas"], "doi": "10.1177/0748233713498444"}
