Very little is known on the expression of these two growth factors in the avian ovary. The aim of this study was to determine for the first time the localization of VEGF and FGF-2 in the ovary of the ostrich using immunohistochemical techniques to investigate the vascularization of the rapidly growing huge ostrich oocyte. At the oocyte periphery, distinct VEGF-positive granules are visible. In our opinion, the expression of VEGF in the growing oocytes, which does not occur in mammals such as bovines, does not significantly contribute to angiogenesis in the theca interna and externa, where all the original and developing vessels are located, but may contribute to the mitoses and survival of granulosa cells during folliculogenesis. A different immunostaining can be demonstrated for FGF-2: from late pre-vitellogenic follicles, FGF-2 immunopositivity can be observed at the inner perivitelline layer area. In the stroma, the smooth muscle cells of small arteries and the endothelial cells of venules and veins are positively stained for FGF-2. Another interesting finding of this study is the occurrence of a significant number of VEGF- and FGF-2 positive heterophilic granulocytes within the ovarian stroma, which migrate from the periphery of the ovary towards the growing follicles. We assume that the growth factors of the heterophilic granulocytes contribute significantly to the angiogenesis seen in both theca layers.", "journal": "Anatomia, histologia, embryologia", "date": "2016-11-04", "authors": ["DRodler"], "doi": "10.1111/ahe.12211"}

Tumor-hypoxia leads to advanced but dysfunctional vascularization and acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype resulting in cell mobility and metastasis. Hypoxia alters cancer cell metabolism and contributes to therapy resistance by inducing cell quiescence. Hypoxia stimulates a complex cell signaling network in cancer cells, including the HIF, PI3K, MAPK, and NF\u0138B pathways, which interact with each other causing positive and negative feedback loops and enhancing or diminishing hypoxic effects. This review provides background knowledge on the role of tumor hypoxia and the role of the HIF cell signaling involved in tumor blood vessel formation, metastasis, and development of the resistance to therapy.

{"title": "Surface modification by plasma etching impairs early vascularization and tissue incorporation of porous polyethylene (Medpor", "abstract": "Porous polyethylene (Medpor\u00ae) is commonly used in craniofacial reconstructive surgery. Rapid vascularization and tissue incorporation are crucial for the prevention of migration, extrusion, and infection of the biomaterial. Therefore, we analyzed whether surface modification by plasma etching may improve the early tissue response to Medpor\u00ae. Medpor\u00ae samples were treated in a plasma chamber at low (20 W; LE-PE) and high energy levels (40 W; HE-PE). The samples and non-treated controls were implanted into mouse dorsal skinfold chambers to analyze angiogenesis, inflammation, and granulation tissue formation over 14 days using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses revealed that elevating energy levels of plasma etching progressively increase the oxygen surface content and surface roughness of Medpor\u00ae. This did not affect the leukocytic response to the implants. However, LE-PE and HE-PE samples exhibited an impaired vascularization. This was associated with a reduced formation of a collagen-rich granulation tissue at the implantation site. Additional in vitro experiments showed a reduced cell attachment on plasma-etched Medpor\u00ae. Thus, plasma etching may not be recommended to improve the clinical outcome of reconstructive interventions using Medpor\u00ae. However, it may be beneficial for temporarily implanted polyethylene-based biomedical devices for which tissue incorporation is undesirable. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Prevascularized silicon membranes for the enhancement of transport to implanted medical devices.", "abstract": "Recent advances in drug delivery and sensing devices for in situ applications are limited by the diffusion-limiting foreign body response of fibrous encapsulation. In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 \u03bcm were created using materials (50 \u03bcm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 \u03bcm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 \u03bcm. This study lays the foundation for creating a prevascularized port that can be used to reduce fibrous encapsulation and thus enhance diffusion to implanted medical devices and sensors. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Therefore, it was elevated as a skin flap and a neourethra was reconstructed up to the glans region using the diverticular tissue.\nPostoperative complications were not observed, and micturition was satisfactory.\nA urethral diverticulum is one of the often encountered complications of hypospadias surgery. However, there are only a few literature reports related to the treatment of urethral diverticulum. In addition, there are almost no reports on reconstructions using urethral diverticular tissue.

{"title": "Methotrexate Locally Released from Poly(e-Caprolactone) Implants: Inhibition of the Inflammatory Angiogenesis Response in a Murine Sponge Model and the Absence of Systemic Toxicity.", "abstract": "In this study, the methotrexate (MTX) was incorporated into the poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) to design implants (MTX PCL implants) aiming the local treatment of inflammatory angiogenesis diseases without causing systemic side effects. Sponges were inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of mice as a framework for fibrovascular tissue growth. After 4days, MTX PCL implants were also introduced, and anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and antifibrogenic activities of the MTX were determined. MTX reduced the vascularization (hemoglobin content), the neutrophil, and monocyte/macrophage infiltration (MPO and NAG activities, respectively), and the collagen deposition in sponges. MTX reduced tumor necrosis factor-a and IL-6 levels, demonstrating its local antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and myelotoxicity, which could be induced by the drug, were evaluated. However, MTX did not promote toxicity to these organs, as the levels of AST and ALT (hepatic markers) and creatinine and urea (renal markers) were not increased, and the complete blood count was not decreased. In conclusion, MTX PCL implants demonstrated to be effective in regulating the components of the inflammatory angiogenesis locally established, and presented an acceptable safety profile. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 104:3731-3742, 2015.", "journal": "Journal of pharmaceutical sciences", "date": "2016-08-16", "authors": ["Leandro GonzagaDe Oliveira", "Let\u00eecia AparecidaFigueiredo", "Gabriella MariaFernandes-Cunha", "De MirandaMarina Barcelos", "Laser AntonioMachado", "Gisele RodriguesDasilva", "De MouraSandra Aparecida Lima"], "doi": "10.1002/jps.24569"}

Cases are often notoriously difficult to treat and manage owing to associated comorbidities of the patient, post irradiation fibrosis and decreased vascularity at the site, which complicates free tissue flap and graft transfer, that subsequently succumb to failure. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), in which 100\u00a0% oxygen is administered by mask under 2.4\u00a0atm pressure, in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, helps by increasing local vascularity.\nIt was the aim of this study to show that a particularly refractory, compromised and challenging case of osteoradionecrosis can be managed successfully even without HBOT, by mandibular segmental resection followed by reconstruction using a titanium reconstruction plate enveloped within a pedicled Pectoralis Major Myocutaneous flap.\nPost operative recovery of the patient was excellent with good functional and esthetic rehabilitation of the patient with and practically nil donor site morbidity.\nIt is important to have a thorough knowledge of the clinical, radiographic, histopathologic, CT and MRI features of osteoradionecrosis of the jaws in order to make a quick and accurate confirmatory diagnosis and to overcome possible diagnostic dilemmas.

Critical-sized defects are unable to heal via natural regenerative processes and require surgical intervention, traditionally involving autologous bone (mainly in the form of nonvascularized grafts) or alloplasts. Autologous bone grafts remain the gold standard of care in spite of the associated risk of donor site morbidity. Tissue engineering approaches represent a promising alternative that would serve to facilitate bone regeneration even in large craniofacial skeletal defects. This strategy has been tested in a myriad of iterations by utilizing a variety of osteoconductive scaffold materials, osteoblastic stem cells, as well as osteoinductive growth factors and small molecules. One of the major challenges facing tissue engineers is creating a scaffold fulfilling the properties necessary for controlled bone regeneration. These properties include osteoconduction, osetoinduction, biocompatibility, biodegradability, vascularization, and progenitor cell retention.

{"title": "TIE-2-expressing monocytes are lymphangiogenic and associate specifically with lymphatics of human breast cancer.", "abstract": "In experimental mouse models of cancer, increasingly compelling evidence point toward a contribution of tumor associated macrophages (TAM) to tumor lymphangiogenesis. Corresponding experimental observations in human cancer remain scarce although lymphatic metastasis is widely recognized as a predominant route for tumor spread. We previously showed that, in malignant tumors of untreated breast cancer (BC) patients, TIE-2-expressing monocytes (TEM) are highly proangiogenic immunosuppressive cells and that TIE-2 and VEGFR signaling pathways drive TEM immunosuppressive function.

The standard for diagnosing and differentiating arthritis is based on clinical examination, laboratory exams, and imaging findings, such as synovitis, bone edema, or joint erosions. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) examination of the small joints is emerging as a sensitive tool for assessing vascularization and disease activity. Quantitative assessment is mostly performed at the region of interest level, where the mean intensity curve is fitted with an exponential function. We showed that using a more physiologically motivated perfusion curve, and by estimating the kinetic parameters separately pixel by pixel, the quantitative information gathered is able to more effectively characterize the different perfusion patterns. In particular, we demonstrated that a random forest classifier based on pixelwise quantification of the kinetic contrast agent perfusion features can discriminate rheumatoid arthritis from different arthritis forms (psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritis, and arthritis in connective tissue disease) with an average accuracy of 97%.

{"title": "[Placenta percreta--a severe obstetric complication despite correct diagnosis--a case report].", "abstract": "This paper presents a case of a pregnant woman with a history of two cesarean sections. The patient was admitted to the hospital because of vaginal bleeding. The ultrasound revealed a placenta covering the internal os. The placenta was characterized by heterogeneous echogenicity with visible irregular hypoechogenic areas and blurred border between the placenta and the cervix. Rich vascularity was observed on the border of the placenta, urethra and the urinary bladder. Cystoscopy showed severe congestion around the urethra. On the back wall of the bladder a slightly increased vascularity was seen, which did not allow to confirm or exclude placental ingrowth in the urinary bladder. At 38 weeks, the patient was scheduled for an elective cesarean section. A classic perpendicular incision and leaving the placenta in the uterine cavity were proposed. After opening the abdomen, a strong vascularization in the region of lower part of the uterus and the urinary bladder was seen. Uterine incision in the fundus and the posterior wall was performed. A female fetus (weight: 2950g, Apgar: 10,10) was born. Then, the umbilical cord was ligated with non-absorbable suture and inserted back into the uterus. However, due to the presence of abundant and persistent vaginal bleeding during the next few minutes, conversion to obstetric hysterectomy was required. During relaparotomy fragments of the placenta appeared on the right side after sliding the urinary bladder. The bladder and the left ureter were damaged during surgery. The urinary bladder was sewn after removal of the uterus. Next, the urologist anastomosed end-to-end the left ureter on the pigtail catheter In the third hour of operation, cardiac arrest was caused by ventricular fibrillation. Immediate resuscitation with defibrillation allowed to restore normal function of the cardiovascular system. Total blood loss during the operation was 3000-4000 ml. During surgery 10 units of packed RBCs, 7 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 4 units of cryoprecipitate were transfused. The patient received antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy. Polyuria was diagnosed in the following days of puerperium, accompanied by electrolyte disturbances in serum and urine. The patient was treated with vasopressin and the electrolyte disturbances were corrected. On day 10 postpartum, the urinary catheter was removed, and clear significant improvement and stabilization of renal function and patient health were obtained. The patient was discharged from the hospital on day 19 of the puerperium. In summary it is clear that the steadily increasing rate of cesarean deliveries may result in the future in an increased number of abnormal placentation cases. Abnormal placentation is one of the most important risk factors of severe obstetric complications, including perinatal massive hemorrhage, which can lead to abnormal organ perfusion with cardiac arrest. Therefore, prenatal diagnosis and identification of abnormal placentation are vital in order to plan adequately the date, place, and mode of delivery as well as to ensure the availability of highly qualified specialists in the field of obstetrics and anesthesia, and organize sufficient amount of blood products and blood substitutes.", "journal": "Ginekologia polska", "date": "2016-03-22", "authors": ["KarolinaGruca-Stryjak", "MariolaRopacka-Lesiak", "GrzegorzBreborowicz"], "doi": "10.17772/gp/60833"}

{"title": "The Role of Muscle Flaps for Salvage of Failed Perforator Free Flaps.", "abstract": "Despite the most heroic efforts, sometimes free flaps fail. Perforator free flaps are not invincible and can suffer the same fate. The real challenge is how to decide what is the next best choice for achieving the desired outcome.\nOver the past decade, 298 free perforator flaps were used in our institution. Total failure occurred in 16 patients, and partial failure requiring a second free flap occurred in an additional 6 patients for a true success rate of 93%. All failures had some form of secondary vascularized tissue transfer, which included the use of muscle flaps in 9 (41%) different patients.\nInitial flap salvage after a failed perforator free flap was attempted with 12 perforator and 5 muscle free flaps as well as 1 perforator and 2 muscle local flaps. These were not all successful, with loss of 3 muscle free flaps and 3 perforator flaps. Tertiary free flap coverage was successful in 3 cases using 2 muscle flaps and 1 perforator free flap. Local fasciocutaneous flaps or primary wound closure was used in the remaining individuals.\nMicrosurgical tissue transfers can be the most rewarding and at the same time the most challenging reconstructive endeavor. Persistence in achieving the desired outcome can require multiple steps. Perforator flaps are an important asset to obtain this goal. However, muscle flaps can still be a useful alternative, and the message is that they should not be overlooked as sometimes a viable option.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

{"title": "Reconstruction of Chopart's Amputation Stump Using Artificial Dermis Combined with Free Anterolateral Thigh Flap.", "abstract": "A 63-year-old man dropped a metal chunk onto his left foot during his work and suffered a crush injury of the left forefoot. He underwent Chopart's amputation followed by stump coverage with sole skin at the orthopedic department on the same day. He was referred to our department for reconstruction because of poor vascularization and subsequent necrosis of tissue at the stump. After the necrotic tissue was debrided, exposure of the talus bone was noted. An artificial dermis was then applied to the stump wound, followed by local negative pressure wound therapy. After 3 weeks, the generation of a strong dermis-like tissue was observed at the site of artificial dermis grafting. We then performed flow-through free anterolateral thigh flap grafting to reconstruct the stump wound. This procedure involved suturing of the peroneal muscle group and tibialis anterior muscle, which were cut off during Chopart's amputation, and suturing the soft tissue surrounding the calcaneus firmly to the fascia lata of the anterolateral thigh flap, followed by suturing of the flap to the skin defect of the left foot. There were neither postoperative complications, such as skin ulcer and equinus/varus deformity, nor need for secondary repair of the grafted flap, so the patient was able to smoothly enter a rehabilitation program including gait training. The current reconstruction technique for the tissue defect following Chopart's amputation, consisting of artificial dermis grafting, negative pressure wound therapy, and flow-through free anterolateral thigh flap grafting, enabled safe and smooth gait rehabilitation with a forefoot prosthesis.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

{"title": "Effect of local insulin injection on wound vascularization in patients with diabetic foot ulcer.", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of local insulin injection on granulation tissue formation in the wounds of patients with diabetic foot ulcer. Thirty-two patients with diabetic foot ulcer were randomly divided into an insulin (n=18) and a control (n=14) group. In the diabetic foot ulcer wound, the insulin group were administered insulin and the control group were administered an equal volume of saline. Prior to injection and at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 h after injection, the fingertip blood glucose levels were determined. The growth of granulation tissue was assessed continuously for 12 days. Wound tissue was harvested at 0, 5, 7 and 12 days for the detection of CD34 expression by immunohistochemistry. The microvessel density (MVD) was calculated. No significant difference in the fasting blood glucose level was found between the two groups at any time-point (P>0.05). Growth of granulation tissue in the insulin group was more marked from 7 days after local insulin injection (24.87\u00b10.24) and was significantly different from that in the control group (18.66\u00b10.45) (P<0.01). New vessels were observed in the insulin group 3 days after insulin injection; however, there was no significant difference in MVD compared with the control group (P>0.05). The MVD in the insulin group increased markedly from 5 days after treatment, and the difference between the two groups was significant (P<0.01). In conclusion, local injection of insulin into the base of a diabetic foot ulcer has a significant effect on systemic blood glucose and may promote wound healing by improving the growth of granulation tissue.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2016-02-20", "authors": ["ZhaoxinZhang", "LeiLv"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2015.2917\n10.1186/2251-6581-11-24\n10.1016/j.jaad.2013.07.048\n10.1016/S0022-4804(02)00036-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036974\n10.2337/dc10-S011\n10.1111/j.1524-475X.2007.00213.x\n10.1016/j.jss.2006.10.034\n10.1177/1534734606292281\n10.1002/med.10024\n10.1073/pnas.0506352103\n10.1016/S0022-5347(05)64025-6\n10.1172/JCI26045\n10.1172/JCI25385\n10.1016/j.jss.2009.12.004\n10.12968/jowc.2011.20.9.440\n10.1016/j.ijsu.2015.01.023\n10.1210/jc.86.7.3257\n10.1210/jcem.87.3.8462\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000116762.77804.FC\n10.1016/j.biochi.2014.10.004\n10.1146/annurev.ph.56.030194.001541\n10.1172/JCI119868"}
{"title": "Efficacy and safety of bevacizumab for the treatment of glioblastoma.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and devastating primary malignant intracranial tumor in adults. The current first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed GBM is surgical resection followed by radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide.

GBM is a type of highly vascularized tumor with increased expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a significant mediator of angiogenesis. Since angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth, anti-angiogenic therapies hold potential for the treatment of GBM, and targeting VEGF has demonstrated promising results in previous studies. Bevacizumab (BEV) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits VEGF and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a monotherapy treatment for patients with recurrent GBM and is associated with manageable toxicity.

Hematologic disorders comprise one group of potential causes. These include sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, aplastic anemia, thalassemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Depending on the stage of disease, treatment options include non-operative management, joint-preserving procedures (percutaneous drilling, core decompression, and vascularized or non-vascularized bone grafting), and joint arthroplasty (resurfacing arthroplasty and THA).

{"title": "Endothelial differentiation of canine yolk sac cells transduced with VEGF.", "abstract": "Yolk sac (YS) is the site of blood-cell production where primitive erythroid cells originate and complete their maturation. YS is a source of precursor cells, however its differentiation potential and suitability for cell therapies are not well described. YS can be a cell source when neovascularization is required. This study characterized YS canine cells, transduced with VEGF, to analyze then using Immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and real time PCR. Immunocytochemistry: positive expression for CD105, PCNA, VEGF and vWF, flow cytometry for CD105, VEGF, PCNA, OCT-4 and RT-qPCR for VEGF, CD31, CD105, PCNA and FLT - 1, indicating that these cells have characteristics of endothelial progenitor and pluripotency. After transduction, the YS cells changed their morphology and showed endothelial-like cells. We suggest, because of their cell surface phenotype as well as their capacity to differentiate into endothelial-like cells, that canine YS represents a source of cells for neovascularization therapies.", "journal": "Research in veterinary science", "date": "2016-02-07", "authors": ["PaulaFratini", "Ana Claudia OliveiraCarreira", "DayaneAlc\u00e2ntara", "Fernanda Menezesde Oliveira e Silva", "Marcio NogueiraRodrigues", "Maria AngelicaMiglino"], "doi": "10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.11.010"}

The aim of this study was to describe a new cervical lymph node-adipo-cutaneous flap model in the rat for future experimental studies.\nFifteen Wistar rats were used. In four, neck anatomy was investigated with special focus on cervical lymph nodes. In eleven rats, a lymph node flap with a skin paddle of 1.5 \u00d7 0.5 cm centered along the surface projection of the innominate septum was harvested and transferred to the inguinal region. The rats were followed-up for 7 d. At 30-d postoperatively, the lymphatic flow restoration with the recipient limb lymphatics was assessed with methylene blue, and histology was performed on excised flaps.\nAccording to the anatomic findings, the flap was based on an innominate septum which was a well-defined adipofascial structure containing glandular vessels to the surrounding tissues and located between submandibular-sublingual glandular complex and parotid gland. Flap's microvascular and lymph node anatomy (two to three lymph nodes) was constant. Donor-site morbidity was minimal, and all flaps survived. At 30-d postoperatively, the restoration of the lymphatic flow with the recipient limb lymphatics was observed, and histology revealed viable lymph nodes.\nThe constant anatomy, the possibility to include a skin paddle and the minimal donor-site morbidity, make this flap a safe, reliable, and versatile lymph node flap supermicrosurgical model for autologous transplant in the rat for future experimental studies.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2016-02-07", "authors": ["GiuseppeVisconti", "ChiaraBrunelli", "AntoninoMul\u00e8", "GianlucaFranceschini", "Hung-ChiChen", "RiccardoMasetti", "MarziaSalgarello"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2015.09.027"}

Skin biopsies were prepared for microscopic analyses. Inflammation, granulation tissue formation, ulceration, epithelization, wound closure rate, fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and vascularization were studied criteria.\nThe results revealed that besides improving the wound healing by its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and epithelization inducing effects, NA also improved tissue regeneration through the increment of fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and vascularization.\nIn spite of the few reported side effects, NA can be introduced as an effective agent on the wound healing process, an adjuvant therapy and possibly a treatment by itself.

This article gives an overview over the various possibilities of breast reconstruction, including implant- and expander-based reconstruction, flap-based reconstruction (vascularized autologous tissue), the combination of implant and flap, reconstruction using non-vascularized autologous fat, as well as refinement surgery after breast reconstruction.", "journal": "Frontiers in surgery", "date": "2016-02-03", "authors": ["DanielSchmauss", "Hans-G\u00fcntherMachens", "YvesHarder"], "doi": "10.3389/fsurg.2015.00071\n10.3322/caac.21262\n10.1111/j.1365-2354.2008.01060.x\n10.1038/bjc.1967.28\n10.1056/NEJM198503143121102\n10.1016/j.breast.2015.02.037\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181ccdac5\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61629-2\n10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70386-3\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3182729cde\n10.1097/00006534-199109000-00001\n10.1245/ASO.2003.01.910\n10.1016/S0039-6109(03)00035-5\n10.1056/NEJM199901143400201\n10.1016/j.bjps.2013.07.034\n10.1023/A:1006441018271\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000156974.69184.5E\n10.1016/j.bjps.2004.12.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0125655\n10.1097/SAP.0b013e31822ed5ce\n10.1016/j.amjsurg.2015.03.019\n10.1007/s00268-012-1450-2\n10.1097/00006534-197046010-00001\n10.1097/00006534-197701000-00001\n10.1056/NEJM199703063361001\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000000021\n10.1097/00006534-198202000-00001\n10.1111/tbj.12395\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e31829586e2\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e318230c29e\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000117194.21748.02\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181ab112d\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e318199eef3\n10.1016/j.bjps.2014.05.020\n10.1097/00006534-198312000-00037\n10.1097/00006534-197609000-00004\n10.1097/00006534-197760030-00003\n10.1016/0007-1226(77)90117-5\n10.1016/0007-1226(76)90036-9\n10.1097/01.prs.0000207396.22527.68\n10.1097/00006534-198701000-00010\n10.1097/00006534-200209010-00005\n10.1097/00006534-198202000-00006\n10.1016/0007-1226(88)90007-0\n10.1097/00006534-198905000-00009\n10.1016/S0007-1226(03)00132-2\n10.1097/00000637-199401000-00007\n10.1016/0007-1226(94)90033-7\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182426757\n10.1097/01.SAP.0000041489.11933.03\n10.1016/j.bjps.2006.01.005\n10.1097/01.sap.0000237635.05337.a1\n10.1055/s-0032-1313773\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e318177436c\n10.1016/j.anplas.2007.09.005\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181aeeadd\n10.1097/SAP.0b013e3182920ad0\n10.1016/j.anplas.2012.10.007\n10.3205/000185\n10.1007/s00266-014-0406-3\n10.1097/01.prs.0000234610.81672.e7\n10.1097/SAP.0000000000000561\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e31824a2a8e\n10.1016/j.anplas.2007.09.003\n10.1155/2015/120949\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000001321\n10.1016/j.breast.2011.01.003\n10.1002/bjs.8722\n10.1093/annonc/mdr158"}
{"title": "Personalized development of human organs using 3D printing technology.", "abstract": "3D printing is a technique of fabricating physical models from a 3D volumetric digital image. The image is sliced and printed using a specific material into thin layers, and successive layering of the material produces a 3D model. It has already been used for printing surgical models for preoperative planning and in constructing personalized prostheses for patients. The ultimate goal is to achieve the development of functional human organs and tissues, to overcome limitations of organ transplantation created by the lack of organ donors and life-long immunosuppression. We hypothesized a precision medicine approach to human organ fabrication using 3D printed technology, in which the digital volumetric data would be collected by imaging of a patient, i.e. CT or MRI images followed by mathematical modeling to create a digital 3D image. Then a suitable biocompatible material, with an optimal resolution for cells seeding and maintenance of cell viability during the printing process, would be printed with a compatible printer type and finally implanted into the patient. Life-saving operations with 3D printed implants were already performed in patients. However, several issues need to be addressed before translational application of 3D printing into clinical medicine. These are vascularization, innervation, and financial cost of 3D printing and safety of biomaterials used for the construct.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2016-01-31", "authors": ["DinaRadenkovic", "AtefehSolouk", "AlexanderSeifalian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2015.12.017"}
{"title": "Histopathological Effects of Tissue Adhesives on Experimental Peripheral Nerve Transection Model in Rats.", "abstract": "Our aim was to evaluate the histopathological effects of tissue adhesives on peripheral nerve regeneration after experimental sciatic nerve transection in rats and to search whether these tissue adhesives may possess a therapeutic potential in peripheral nerve injuries.\nThis experimental study was performed using 42 female Wistar-Albino rats distributed in 6 groups subsequent to transection of right sciatic nerves. Group I underwent external circumferential neurolysis; Group II received suture repair; Group III had local polymeric hydrogel based tissue adhesive administration; Group IV received suture repair and polymeric hydrogel based tissue adhesive application together; Group V had gelatin based tissue adhesive application and Group VI had suture repair and gelatin based tissue adhesive together. After a 6-week follow-up period, biopsies were obtained from site of neural injury and groups were compared with respect to histopathological scoring based on inflammatory, degenerative, necrotic and fibrotic changes.\nThere were remarkable differences between control group and study groups with respect to inflammation (p=0.001), degeneration (p=0.002), necrosis (p=0.007), fibrosis (p<0.001) and vascularity (p=0.001). Histopathological scores were similar between study groups and the only noteworthy difference was that Group V displayed a lower score for necrosis and higher score in terms of vascularization.\nOur results imply that tissue adhesives can be useful in repair of peripheral nerve injuries by decreasing the surgical trauma and shortening the duration of intervention. Results with gelatin based tissue adhesive are especially promising since more intense vascularity was observed in tissue after application. However, trials on larger series with longer durations of follow-up are essential for reaching more reliable conclusions.", "journal": "Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society", "date": "2016-01-29", "authors": ["IdirisAltun", "Harun\u00c7\u0131ral\u0131k"], "doi": "10.3340/jkns.2015.58.6.504"}

{"title": "Management of radiation-induced urethral strictures.", "abstract": "Radiation as a treatment option for prostate cancer has been chosen by many patients. One of the side effects encountered are radiation-induced urethral strictures which occur in up to 11% of patients. Radiation damage has often left the irradiated field fibrotic and with poor vascularization which make these strictures a challenging entity to treat. The mainstay of urologic management remains an urethroplasty procedure for which several approaches exist with variable optimal indication. Excision and primary anastomoses are ideal for shorter bulbar strictures that comprise the majority of radiation-induced urethral strictures. One advantage of this technique is that it does not require tissue transfers and success rates of 70-95% have consistently been reported. Substitution urethroplasty using remote graft tissue such as buccal mucosa are indicated if the length of the stricture precludes a tension-free primary anastomosis. Despite the challenge of graft survival in radiation-damaged and poorly vascularized recipient tissue, up to 83% of patients have been treated successfully although the numbers described in the literature are small. The most extensive repairs involve the use of tissue flaps, for example gracilis muscle, which may be required if the involved periurethral tissue is unable to provide sufficient vascular support for a post-operative urethral healing process. In summary, radiation-induced urethral strictures are a challenging entity. Most strictures are amenable to excision and primary anastomosis (EPA) with encouraging success rates but substitution urethroplasty may be indicated when extensive repair is needed.", "journal": "Translational andrology and urology", "date": "2016-01-28", "authors": ["Matthias DHofer", "Chris MGonzalez"], "doi": "10.3978/j.issn.2223-4683.2015.01.04"}
{"title": "Augmented urethroplasty with pseudospongioplasty in the treatment of penile strictures.", "abstract": "Strictures involving the penile urethra generally require tissue transfer techniques. Ventral graft placement usually is avoided in the penile urethra because of the relative paucity of viable corpus spongiosal tissue necessary for vascularization and support. Instead, grafts are commonly placed dorsally using either an onlay or inlay technique. However, the successful use of ventrally placed grafts in the penile urethra supported by a pseudospongioplasty has recently been reported. The incorporation of a pseudospongioplasty provides a well-vascularized milieu for successful graft take in the penile urethra. This technique incorporates periurethral flaps of tunica dartos and Buck's fascia for graft coverage. Pseudospongioplasty in the penile urethra has been shown to have a similar efficacy to standard spongioplasty in the bulbar urethra. Additionally, pseudospongioplasty outcomes are comparable to other graft augmentation techniques performed in the penile urethra. In penile strictures, where there is a paucity of spongiosal tissue, pseudospongioplasty for coverage of a ventral graft is a reliable option.", "journal": "Translational andrology and urology", "date": "2016-01-28", "authors": ["Billy HCordon", "Noel AArmenakas"], "doi": "10.3978/j.issn.2223-4683.2015.01.01"}
{"title": "Shear wave elastography in medullary thyroid carcinoma diagnostics.", "abstract": "Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a modern method for the assessment of tissue stiffness. There has been a growing interest in the use of this technique for characterizing thyroid focal lesions, including preoperative diagnostics.\nThe aim of the study was to assess the clinical usefulness of SWE in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) diagnostics.\nA total of 169 focal lesions were identified in the study group (139 patients), including 6 MTCs in 4 patients (mean age: 45 years). B-mode ultrasound and SWE were performed using Aixplorer (SuperSonic, Aix-en-Provence), with a 4-15 MHz linear probe. The ultrasound was performed to assess the echogenicity and echostructure of the lesions, their margin, the halo sign, the height/width ratio (H/W ratio), the presence of calcifications and the vascularization pattern. This was followed by an analysis of maximum and mean Young's (E) modulus values for MTC (EmaxLR, EmeanLR) and the surrounding thyroid tissues (EmaxSR, EmeanSR), as well as mean E-values (EmeanLRz) for 2 mm region of interest in the stiffest zone of the lesion. The lesions were subject to pathological and/or cytological evaluation.\nThe B-mode assessment showed that all MTCs were hypoechogenic, with no halo sign, and they contained micro- and/ or macrocalcifications. Ill-defined lesion margin were found in 4 out of 6 cancers; 4 out of 6 cancers had a H/W ratio > 1. Heterogeneous echostructure and type III vascularity were found in 5 out of 6 lesions. In the SWE, the mean value of EmaxLR for all of the MTCs was 89.5 kPa and (the mean value of EmaxSR for all surrounding tissues was) 39.7 kPa Mean values of EmeanLR and EmeanSR were 34.7 kPa and 24.4 kPa, respectively. The mean value of EmeanLRz was 49.2 kPa.\nSWE showed MTCs as stiffer lesions compared to the surrounding tissues. The lesions were qualified for fine needle aspiration biopsy based on B-mode assessment. However, the diagnostic algorithm for MTC is based on the measurement of serum calcitonin levels, B-mode ultrasound and FNAB.\nElastografia fali poprzecznej jest nowoczesn\u0105 metod\u0105 oceny sztywno\u015bci tkanek.

{"title": "Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells in Stromal Evolution and Cancer Progression.", "abstract": "The study of cancer biology has mainly focused on malignant epithelial cancer cells, although tumors also contain a stromal compartment, which is composed of stem cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs), endothelial cells, immune cells, adipocytes, cytokines, and various types of macromolecules comprising the extracellular matrix (ECM). The tumor stroma develops gradually in response to the needs of epithelial cancer cells during malignant progression initiating from increased local vascular permeability and ending to remodeling of desmoplastic loosely vascularized stromal ECM. The constant bidirectional interaction of epithelial cancer cells with the surrounding microenvironment allows damaged stromal cell usage as a source of nutrients for cancer cells, maintains the stroma renewal thus resembling a wound that does not heal, and affects the characteristics of tumor mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). Although MSCs have been shown to coordinate tumor cell growth, dormancy, migration, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance, recently they have been successfully used in treatment of hematopoietic malignancies to enhance the effect of total body irradiation-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy. Hence, targeting the stromal elements in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics and usage of MSCs to attenuate graft-versus-host disease may offer new strategies to overcome cancer treatment failure and relapse of the disease.", "journal": "Stem cells international", "date": "2016-01-23", "authors": ["FrancescaCammarota", "Mikko OLaukkanen"], "doi": "10.1155/2016/4824573\n10.1084/jem.4.5-6.559\n10.1084/jem.16.2.149\n10.1084/jem.18.4.397\n10.1002/path.1711530209\n10.1002/1097-0142(19871015)60:8<1757::AID-CNCR2820600814>3.0.CO;2-W\n10.1038/bjc.1992.14\n10.1182/blood-2005-08-3210\n10.1002/path.1711230306\n10.1038/nm1101-1194\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1231\n10.1038/nm0797-730\n10.1038/nature03128\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.05.007\n10.1158/1541-7786.mcr-12-0274\n10.1016/j.canlet.2014.07.047\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.01.040\n10.1016/0304-419x(89)90004-8\n10.1074/jbc.m109.009894\n10.1016/j.tcb.2005.05.001\n10.1073/pnas.041359198\n10.1007/bf00717735\n10.1073/pnas.1018438108\n10.1182/blood-2011-07-358432\n10.1056/nejm198612253152606\n10.1371/journal.pone.0012180\n10.1515/bchm3.1992.373.2.611\n10.1101/cshperspect.a006544\n10.1055/s-0034-1370766\n10.1038/ncb3015\n10.1007/s00268-005-0391-4\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2011.03791.x\n10.1007/s00428-013-1484-3\n10.1002/emmm.201000073\n10.1016/j.matbio.2008.10.001\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.06.034\n10.1016/j.tcb.2012.08.009\n10.1073/pnas.95.21.12468\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2464\n10.1038/nature06188\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0538\n10.1172/JCI45273\n10.1242/jcs.02932\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1406\n10.1002/stem.187\n10.1155/2013/130763\n10.1371/journal.pone.0004992\n10.1186/1475-2867-14-41\n10.1007/s10555-012-9415-3\n10.1093/molehr/gag064\n10.1002/ijc.28848\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-08-1357\n10.1074/jbc.m308083200\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-12-0877\n10.1091/mbc.E08-03-0321\n10.1371/journal.pone.0035036\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010088\n10.1182/blood.v99.10.3838\n10.1038/sj.leu.2404489\n10.1309/ajcpqzqn50hkiaha\n10.1016/j.lungcan.2008.08.007\n10.1016/j.orthres.2004.05.003\n10.1038/nature05372\n10.14343/JCSCR.2014.2e1003\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.10.001\n10.1073/pnas.1310501111\n10.1089/scd.2011.0691\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.024\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2372\n10.1038/ni.2026\n10.1073/pnas.1120358109\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.02.020\n10.1073/pnas.0510511103\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033739\n10.1002/stem.1361\n10.1089/scd.2013.0249\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.07.023\n10.1016/0014-4827(61)90348-2\n10.1084/jem.131.4.863\n10.1073/pnas.011417098\n10.1038/nm.2385\n10.1002/stem.559\n10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.11.001\n10.1038/bmt.2008.348\n10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.02.001\n10.1158/2159-8290.cd-13-0040\n10.1126/science.1171362\n10.4049/jimmunol.165.10.5502\n10.1002/1097-0215(200102)9999:9999&lt;::AID-IJC1170>3.0.CO;2-U\n10.1159/000069863\n10.1186/1479-5876-11-187\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2805\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082658\n10.1172/jci26532\n10.1159/000309252\n10.1053/gast.2003.50147\n10.1002/ijc.22217"}

Defect etiology was posttraumatic in 19 patients; 14 defects were due to oncological resections and seven sternal osteomyelitis; three patients presented with radiation ulcers, two with aseptic femoral head necrosis, and one with defects caused by acne inversa and hip joint prosthesis infection. Long-term follow-up was 45 months (range: 0-126). We performed arterial revascularization with 36 AV loops, eight bypass grafts, and three venous interposition grafts. Subsequent tissue transfer comprised 24 latissimus dorsi, two vastus lateralis, one gracilis, one anterior lateral thigh (ALT), 16 rectus abdominis, one radialis forearm, and two osteocutaneous vascularized fibula flaps.\nComplications occurred in 25/47 patients (53%).

{"title": "Acute Limb Shortening for Major Near and Complete Upper Extremity Amputations with Associated Neurovascular Injury: A Review of the Literature.", "abstract": "In the setting a near or complete upper extremity amputations with significant soft tissue loss and neurovascular compromise, upper extremity surgeons are faced with the challenge of limb salvage. There are a multitude of treatment options for managing skeletal and soft tissue injuries including provisional fixation, staged reconstruction, and an acute shortening osteotomy with primary rigid internal fixation. However, many complications are associated with these techniques. Complications of provisional fixation include pin tract infection and loosening, tethering of musculotendinous units, nonunion, and additional surgeries. Staged reconstruction includes a variety of techniques: distraction osteogenesis, bone transport, or vascularized and non-vascularized structural autograft or allograft, but the risks often outweigh the benefits. Risks include nonunion, postoperative vascular complications necessitating reoperation, and the inability to return to the previous level of function at an average of 24 months. Acute shortening osteotomy with internal fixation offers the advantage of a single-stage procedure that provides for decreasing the soft tissue loss, provides a rigid platform to protect the delicate neurovascular repair, and alleviates unwanted tension at the repair sites. This review discusses the literature on the surgical treatment of severe upper extremity trauma with associated neurovascular injury over the past 75 years, and aims to evaluate the indications, surgical techniques, clinical and functional outcomes, and complications associated with acute shortening osteotomy with rigid internal fixation. Although this technique is not without risks, it is well-tolerated in the acute setting with a complication profile comparable to other techniques of fixation while remaining a single procedure.", "journal": "Orthopaedic surgery", "date": "2016-01-23", "authors": ["NicholasKusnezov", "John CDunn", "JeremyStewart", "Justin SMitchell", "MiguelPirela-Cruz"], "doi": "10.1111/os.12213"}

A major obstacle has been low islet cell survival due largely to the innate inflammatory response. Connexin43 (Cx43) channels play a key role in early inflammation and have proven to be viable therapeutic targets. Even if cell death due to early inflammation is avoided, insufficient vascularization is a primary obstacle to maintaining the viability of implanted cells. We have invented technologies targeting the inflammatory response and poor vascularization: a Cx43 mimetic peptide that inhibits inflammation and a novel prevascularized tissue engineered construct. We combined these technologies with isolated islets to create a prevascularized bioartificial pancreas that is resistant to the innate inflammatory response. Immunoconfocal microscopy showed that constructs containing islets express insulin and possess a vascular network similar to constructs without islets. Glucose stimulated islet-containing constructs displayed reduced insulin secretion compared to islets alone. However, labeling for insulin post-glucose stimulation revealed that the constructs expressed abundant levels of insulin. This discrepancy was found to be due to the expression of insulin degrading enzyme. These results suggest that the prevascularized bioartificial pancreas is potentially a tool for improving long-term islet cell survival in vivo.", "journal": "Journal of diabetes research", "date": "2016-01-21", "authors": ["J MatthewRhett", "HongjunWang", "HeatherBainbridge", "LiliSong", "Michael JYost"], "doi": "10.1155/2016/7262680\n10.1053/j.gastro.2013.02.008\n10.1038/ctg.2015.2\n10.2337/diabetes.51.1.66\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2005.01157.x\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2011.12.040\n10.1001/archsurg.135.9.1106\n10.1208/s12248-010-9175-3\n10.1097/SAP.0b013e3182012597\n10.1023/a:1008965826397\n10.1097/01.sap.0000151459.07978.fa\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.078\n10.1016/j.cub.2003.09.007\n10.1189/jlb.0802406\n10.1002/bdrc.21019\n10.2217/17460751.4.2.205\n10.1097/prs.0b013e3181a0741d\n10.2337/diabetes.48.10.1907\n10.1111/j.1399-3089.2007.00419.x\n10.1111/ajt.12558\n10.1126/science.1195491\n10.1126/science.1132559\n10.1089/ten.teb.2013.0554\n10.1042/bj20082319\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.10.003\n10.1007/s00232-012-9465-z\n10.1016/j.brainres.2012.08.042\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.12.005\n10.1161/01.RES.0000250174.31269.70\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002801\n10.1167/iovs.04-1181\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07210.x\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2011.06.005\n10.1097/01.tp.0000229023.38873.c0\n10.1038/jid.2014.318\n10.1111/wrr.12275\n10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0651\n10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00424-9\n10.1080/cac.10.4-6.431.435\n10.1089/ten.teb.2013.0541\n10.1007/s10439-014-0986-8\n10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0183\n10.1097/sap.0000000000000439\n10.1073/pnas.97.24.13003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050265\n10.2337/diabetes.54.5.1400\n10.1016/S1054-8807(02)00166-7\n10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.035\n10.1002/dvdy.10339\n10.1002/dvdy.20101\n10.1073/pnas.92.17.7657\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.01.013\n10.2337/db08-0814\n10.1155/2013/352315\n10.1172/jci36209\n10.1038/nature06063\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026379\n10.1002/ar.a.20232\n10.1186/s12885-015-1229-6\n10.1091/mbc.E10-06-0548\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.01.012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.235747\n10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.047\n10.1016/j.neulet.2004.07.034\n10.1002/jnr.20809\n10.1186/1750-1326-4-4\n10.1038/nbt.2842\n10.2337/db07-0981\n10.1126/science.6776628\n10.3389/fncel.2014.00306\n10.1007/s00232-012-9488-5"}
{"title": "Promising Technique for Facial Nerve Reconstruction in Extended Parotidectomy.", "abstract": "Malignant tumors of the parotid gland account scarcely for 5% of all head and neck tumors. Most of these neoplasms have a high tendency for recurrence, local infiltration, perineural extension, and metastasis. Although uncommon, these malignant tumors require complex surgical treatment sometimes involving a total parotidectomy including a complete facial nerve resection. Severe functional and aesthetic facial defects are the result of a complete sacrifice or injury to isolated branches becoming an uncomfortable distress for patients and a major challenge for reconstructive surgeons.\nA case of a 54-year-old, systemically healthy male patient with a 4 month complaint of pain and swelling on the right side of the face is presented. The patient reported a rapid increase in the size of the lesion over the past 2 months. Imaging tests and histopathological analysis reported an adenoid cystic carcinoma. A complete parotidectomy was carried out with an intraoperative notice of facial nerve infiltration requiring a second intervention for nerve and defect reconstruction. A free ALT flap with vascularized nerve grafts was the surgical choice. A 6 month follow-up showed partial facial movement recovery and the facial defect mended.\nIt is of critical importance to restore function to patients with facial nerve injury. Vascularized nerve grafts, in many clinical and experimental studies, have shown to result in better nerve regeneration than conventional non-vascularized nerve grafts. Nevertheless, there are factors that may affect the degree, speed and regeneration rate regarding the free fasciocutaneous flap. In complex head and neck defects following a total parotidectomy, the extended free fasciocutaneous ALT (anterior-lateral thigh) flap with a vascularized nerve graft is ideally suited for the reconstruction of the injured site.

Immunofluorescence microscopy with five monoclonal antibodies was used to detect specific sulfation motifs on chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans, previously identified in association with progenitor cells and their matrix in cartilage tissue.\nIn the rabbit limbal cornea, while no palisades of Vogt were present, the basal epithelial cells stained differentially with Toluidine blue, and extended lobed protrusions proximally into the stoma, which were associated with interruptions of the basal lamina. Elongate processes of the mesenchymal cells in the superficial vascularized stroma formed direct contact with the basal lamina and basal epithelial cells. From a panel of antibodies that recognize native, sulfated chondroitin sulfate structures, one (6-C-3) gave a positive signal restricted to the region of the mesenchymal-epithelial cell associations.\nThis study showed interactions between basal epithelial cells and subjacent mesenchymal cells in the rabbit corneal limbus, similar to those that have been observed in the human stem cell niche.

{"title": "Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a marker of angiogenesis in the necrotic area of human medulloblastoma.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis plays a key role in the progression of malignant tumors. In recent years, anti-angiogenic drugs have been shown to be effective against tumors. However, some tumors are able to adopt escape mechanisms, suggesting that the vascular network in these tumors may be formed or may function in a different way. Medulloblastomas are tumors characterized by poor prognosis and low patient survival rates. These tumors rarely metastasize, but the reason why they almost always recur locally is not known. Central to mediating neoplastic changes is the interaction between cell surface receptors and their cognate ligands, which through intracellular signaling induce alternations in gene expression. In this context, the aim of our present study was to examine in medulloblastoma the distribution of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and receptor for advanced glycosylation end-product (RAGE), and mast cells associated with the tumor neovascularization process. Immunohistochemical study with a battery of specific antibodies was used. The results show that in the tumor necrotic area, TLR2 participates in all steps of vascular network formation, but in regions where the tumor was not affected by necrosis, the capillary network was TLR2 immunonegative. The TLR2 vascular network of the necrotic area was not associated with RAGE and mast cells. However, in the region of the medulloblastoma not affected by necrosis, the RAGE receptor was present in the endothelium of all capillaries, and mast cells were numerous only in the perivascular space of large brain and meningeal vessels at the border of the tumor. In conclusion, our results show that the receptor of innate immunity TLR2 plays an important role in recognition of ligands delivered by dying necrotic medulloblastoma cells and participates in tumor neovascularization. Moreover, the results show that the RAGE receptor and mast cells operate in different medulloblastoma regions and influence different parts of the tumor vascular network.", "journal": "Folia neuropathologica", "date": "2016-01-20", "authors": ["DanutaMaslinska", "MilenaLaure-Kamionowska", "S\u0142awomirMaslinski", "DariuszSzukiewicz"], "doi": "10.5114/fn.2015.56549"}
{"title": "Computed Tomography and Optical Imaging of Osteogenesis-angiogenesis Coupling to Assess Integration of Cranial Bone Autografts and Allografts.", "abstract": "A major parameter determining the success of a bone-grafting procedure is vascularization of the area surrounding the graft. We hypothesized that implantation of a bone autograft would induce greater bone regeneration by abundant blood vessel formation. To investigate the effect of the graft on neovascularization at the defect site, we developed a micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) approach to characterize newly forming blood vessels, which involves systemic perfusion of the animal with a polymerizing contrast agent. This method enables detailed vascular analysis of an organ in its entirety. Additionally, blood perfusion was assessed using fluorescence imaging (FLI) of a blood-borne fluorescent agent. Bone formation was quantified by FLI using a hydroxyapatite-targeted probe and \u00b5CT analysis. Stem cell recruitment was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of transgenic mice that express luciferase under the control of the osteocalcin promoter. Here we describe and demonstrate preparation of the allograft, calvarial defect surgery, \u00b5CT scanning protocols for the neovascularization study and bone formation analysis (including the in vivo perfusion of contrast agent), and the protocol for data analysis. The 3D high-resolution analysis of vasculature demonstrated significantly greater angiogenesis in animals with implanted autografts, especially with respect to arteriole formation. Accordingly, blood perfusion was significantly higher in the autograft group by the 7(th) day after surgery. We observed superior bone mineralization and measured greater bone formation in animals that received autografts. Autograft implantation induced resident stem cell recruitment to the graft-host bone suture, where the cells differentiated into bone-forming cells between the 7(th) and 10(th) postoperative day. This finding means that enhanced bone formation may be attributed to the augmented vascular feeding that characterizes autograft implantation. The methods depicted may serve as an optimal tool to study bone regeneration in terms of tightly bounded bone formation and neovascularization.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2016-01-19", "authors": ["DoronCohn Yakubovich", "WafaTawackoli", "DmitriySheyn", "IlanKallai", "XiaoyuDa", "GadiPelled", "DanGazit", "ZulmaGazit"], "doi": "10.3791/53459"}
{"title": "Timing effect of intramyocardial hydrogel injection for positively impacting left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Intramyocardial injection of various injectable hydrogel materials has shown benefit in positively impacting the course of left ventricular (LV) remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). However, since LV remodeling is a complex, time dependent process, the most efficacious time of hydrogel injection is not clear. In this study, we injected a relatively stiff, thermoresponsive and bioabsorbable hydrogel in rat hearts at 3 different time points - immediately after MI (IM), 3 d post-MI (3D), and 2 w post-MI (2W), corresponding to the beginnings of the necrotic, fibrotic and chronic remodeling phases. The employed left anterior descending coronary artery ligation model showed expected infarction responses including functional loss, inflammation and fibrosis with distinct time dependent patterns. Changes in LV geometry and contractile function were followed by longitudinal echocardiography for 10 w post-MI. While all injection times positively affected LV function and wall thickness, the 3D group gave better functional outcomes than the other injection times and also exhibited more local vascularization and less inflammatory markers than the earlier injection time. The results indicate an important role for injection timing in the increasingly explored concept of post-MI biomaterial injection therapy and suggest that for hydrogels with mechanical support as primary function, injection at the beginning of the fibrotic phase may provide improved outcomes.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-01-18", "authors": ["TomoYoshizumi", "YangZhu", "HongbinJiang", "AntonioD'Amore", "HirokazuSakaguchi", "JasonTchao", "KimimasaTobita", "William RWagner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.002"}

Ovulations were induced on Day 0, and cows were inseminated. Ovulated cows were assigned to receive placebo (LF/control group, n\u00a0=\u00a014; and SF/control group, n\u00a0=\u00a09) or 150\u00a0mg of long-acting P4 on Day 4.5 (LF/P4 group, n\u00a0=\u00a013; and SF/P4 group, n\u00a0=\u00a012). Diameter of POF, blood flow in POF wall, ovulation rate, and size and vascularization of CL were greater (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in LF group. In experiments 2 (unknown cyclic status) and 4 (noncycling), ovulations were synchronized, and beef cows received placebo or 150\u00a0mg of long-acting P4 on Day 4 after timed-artificial insemination. In experiment 2, pregnancy/AI (P/AI) did not differ (P\u00a0>\u00a00.1) between P4-treated (53.2%; 209/393) and control cows (56.2%; 219/390), but P/AI was greater in cows with a CL\u00a0<\u00a00.9\u00a0cm(2) on Day 4 that were P4-treated (57.9%, 22/38) versus placebo-treated (40.4%, 21/52; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

The histological analyses highlighted the morphological details of the new tissue, which was well vascularized throughout its thickness. The new bone formation ensured not only the coverage of the implant hole, but also the continuity with the adjacent bone. The chemical stability is suggested by the XRD (X-rays diffraction) pattern, as the implant did not showed erosion marks at the surface, not even discrete ones. Moreover, the XRD pattern recorded on the surface of femoral bone showed the fingerprints of hydroxyapatite indicating that the new bone covered the surface of the implanted area.

Aseptic osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a condition whose pathogenesis remains unclear despite many theories developed so far, and the discovery of numerous risk factors. The objective of this study is to emphasize the role of imaging techniques and correlating histology and immunohistochemistry methods in order to more accurately stage the disease. This retrospective study was performed on a total of 103 patients with clinical and radiological suspicion of unilateral or bilateral osteonecrosis. For the diagnosis criteria, we used clinical information, pelvic X-ray images, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). For the inclusion of patients in a disease stage, we used the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification system. For patients diagnosed at an advanced stage, who underwent hip arthroplasty, we harvested biological material necessary for the histopathological study. There were differences in the appearance and extent of the lesion on the histological samples compared to macroscopic examination and even those obtained through imaging means, particularly for patients in evolutionary stage III. Aspects such as the extension of the area of fibrosis, bone tissue remodeling, the density of the newly formed vascular network and degree of impairment of the cartilage, are determined more accurately using histology and immunohistochemistry techniques. Before classifying patients in a certain stage, after correlating clinical and imaging data, histopathological aspects have to be considered, particularly in patients in stages III and IV, in which total hip arthroplasty could be delayed.", "journal": "Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie", "date": "2016-01-09", "authors": ["Magdalena RodicaTr\u0103istaru", "DianaKamal", "Kamal ConstantinKamal", "Otilia ConstantinaRogoveanu", "MihaiPopescu", "SimonaBondari", "Drago\u015f OvidiuAlexandru", "NinaIonovici", "Dan CristianGrecu"], "doi": null}

The SFC amount and VD were determined and compared. Srigley patterns were divided in two redefined behavioral groups: \"solid\" group (Srigley I, Srigley III, Srigley IV) and \"necrotizing\" group (Srigley II with subdivisions: Gleason 3A, 3C and 5A).\nSFC mean values had an ascending trend in both \"solid\" and \"necrotizing\" groups. VD mean values had an ascending trend in \"solid\" group but a descending trend in \"necrotizing\" group towards Gleason 5A pattern. SFC and VD values had a direct, ascending correlation for all determinations (p=0.0006), but also for \"solid\" (p=0.005) and \"necrotizing\" (p=0.026) groups. The two stromal elements had different behaviors both individually and in their correlation that seem to be related with their interaction with different tumor cellular populations.\nOur results could plead for the hypothesis that the different subtypes of tumor architecture represent steps of a continuous process from well-differentiated status to poorly or undifferentiated status but who is accomplished by two different tumor cells populations with different distinct behavior in their relationship with the stromal microenvironment.", "journal": "Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie", "date": "2016-01-09", "authors": ["GeorgeMitroi", "R\u0103zvan MihailPle\u015fea", "Oltin TiberiuPop", "Drago\u015f ViorelCiovic\u0103", "Mircea Sebastian\u015eerb\u0103nescu", "Drago\u015f OvidiuAlexandru", "AdrianStoiculescu", "Iancu EmilPle\u015fea"], "doi": null}

For this purpose vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) production was measured in MSC-conditioned medium (CM); besides, branching vessels as well as vessel end points (ramification) in the chorioallantoic membrane of Japanese quail eggs (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were counted following MSC-CM application. During the standard cultivation (20% O2; 10% FCS) the total number of vessels was 1.6 times higher comparing with hypoxic condition (5% O2; 10% FCS) due to increase in ramification, the number of branching vessels did not change. Maximal (double) increase in the total vessel number was observed when CM from MSCs after hypoxia plus serum deprivation was added. VEGF-A synthesis linearly increased with FCS concentration both at 20% and 5% O2. In all cases VEGF-A level was higher at hypoxia. No direct correlation between the VEGF-A concentration and total number of vessels was noted indicating that hypoxia possibly stimulates synthesis of additional angiogenic factors to enhance vascular growth despite the drastic serum deprivation. At 20% oxygen, exponentially growing MSCs showed the highest angiogenic activity and the ramification increased in 1.6 times. Depending on O2, MSCs produced angiogenic factors required at different stages of vascularization. Specifically, mediators of ramification were accumulated in the standard conditions (20% O2) and factors stimulating growth of branching vessels--in hypoxia.", "journal": "Aviakosmicheskaia i ekologicheskaia meditsina = Aerospace and environmental medicine", "date": "2016-01-08", "authors": ["M IEzdakova", "E RAndreeva", "T SGurieva", "O ADadasheva", "V SOrlova", "L BBuravkova"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Optimization of coil geometries for bone fracture healing via dielectrophoretic force stimulation - a simulation study.", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel technique for shortening fracture healing times based on the use of dielectrophoretic forces (DEPFs). If a non-uniform electromagnetic field is applied around a fracture site, red blood cells within the blood will be polarized; creating electrical dipoles. The dielectrophoretic forces resulting from the interaction of these dipoles and the electromagnetic field, can be used to manipulate blood flow at a fracture site, promote vascularization, increase transmembrane signaling, increase supply of nutrients, necessary hormones and growth factors at the fracture site and thus may help bone healing. For the generation of non-uniform fields we considered three different coil designs (linear, parabolic and square root) and using Mathcad numerically studied the dielectrophoretic forces for a long bone fracture where the main arteries are vertically-oriented and the blood flow is downward. The gravitational force and the drag force on the red blood cells determine the steady state blood flow. The dielectrophoretic force added to the force balance is functional in increasing the blood flow. The ratio of the velocity in the presence of dielectrophoresis to the velocity without dielectrophoresis (called here as the Dielectrophoretic Force Factor, K(DEpF)) is a good measure of the performance of the dielectrophoresis, since it indicates the increase in blood flow. It was found that the dielectorophoretic force reaches peak levels at a frequency range between 5-15 Hz. At 5 Hz, the average value of dielectrophoretic force factor is 1.90, 2.51 and 1.61 for the linear, parabolic and the square root coils, respectively. The parabolic coil results in the best DEPF and therefore would be the configuration to use in an experimental study to determine if DEPF is useful for bone healing.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Retinal vessel structure is segmented using a Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) based model. Prior to that, k-means clustering is used to obtain initial parameter set and labels for HMRF. Final parameter set for HMRF is estimated using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and final labeling is achieved using maximum aposteriori (MAP) algorithm. Clique energy for HMRF is computed from eigenvalue analysis of structure tensor for each pixel. This helps to get connectivity in the direction of strongest tangents in its neighborhood, facilitating the tracking of fine vessels in retinal vascular network. Quantitative evaluation shows an average vessel segmentation accuracy of 96.41% in normal condition with substantial improvement in tracking capability of fine vessels. Changes in blood flow can be tracked and observed at segmented output; particularly applicable for the study of different pathological conditions.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The anastomosis of the vascular network of the flap to the blood vessels adjacent to the recipient site has associated risks of arterial and/or venous occlusions that must be promptly detected to avoid temporary or permanent tissue damage. In this work, we present a skin-contact diffusion optical imaging (DOI) system able to continuously provide a three-dimensional representation of the flap oxygenation to promptly detect vascular occlusions potentially occurring in the flap. Multiple near-infrared LEDs and photodetectors were embedded into a self-contained optical sensor for prolonged monitoring of concentration changes of oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) at multiple locations and depths. A time-efficient algorithm mapped measured oxygenation changes in a three-dimensional volume to allow surgeons and clinical personnel to detect and localize abnormal blood perfusion changes during or after surgery, in time for corrective intervention. The image reconstruction algorithm was validated using computerized flap models in which oxygenation was synthetically altered, whereas the optical system was preliminarily tested on a healthy forearm simulating a flap undergoing arterial and venous occlusions, proving the feasibility of implementing DOI in the form of a wearable patch for prolonged perfusion monitoring.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "A new tool to connect blood vessels in fundus retinal images.", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel tool that allows a user to reconstruct the retinal vascular network from fundus images. The retinal vasculature consists of trees of arteries and veins. Common segmentation algorithms are not able to completely segment out the blood vessels in fundus images. This failure results in a set of disconnected or broken up vascular segments. Reconstructing the whole network has crucial importance because it can offer insight into global features not considered so far, including retinal fluid dynamics. This tool uses implicit neural cost functions to join vessel segments. Results have shown that the quality of the segmentation affects the outcome of connectivity algorithms and by enhancing the segmentation the connectivity can be improved.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Several assays have been developed to mimic the angiogenic process in vitro and in vivo. Here we propose a technique for the quantification of the pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic responses induced by different molecules when implanted in vivo on the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). At day 11 of development CAM is completely vascularized and neo-vessels induced by exogenous molecules converge radially to the implant. Our algorithm is an effective and rapid tool to characterize molecules endowed with proor anti-angiogenic effects by means of the quantification of the vessels present in the CAM macroscopic images. Based on conventional and dedicated image morphology tools, the proposed technique is able to discriminate radial from non-radial vessels, excluding the last ones from the count.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Is Doppler ultrasound useful for evaluating gestational trophoblastic disease?", "abstract": "Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive method for evaluating vascularization and is widely used in clinical practice. Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia includes a group of highly vascularized malignancies derived from placental cells. This review summarizes data found in the literature regarding the applications of Doppler ultrasound in managing patients with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane and LILACS databases were searched for articles published in English until 2014 using the following keywords: \"Gestational trophoblastic disease AND Ultrasonography, Doppler.\" Twenty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria and were separated into the 4 following groups according to the aim of the study. (1) Doppler ultrasound does not seem to be capable of differentiating partial from complete moles, but it might be useful when evaluating pregnancies in which a complete mole coexists with a normal fetus. (2) There is controversy in the role of uterine artery Doppler velocimetry in the prediction of development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. (3) Doppler ultrasound is a useful tool in the diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia because abnormal myometrial vascularization and lower uterine artery Doppler indices seem to be correlated with invasive disease. (4) Lower uterine artery Doppler indices in the diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia are associated with methotrexate resistance and might play a role in prognosis.\nSeveral studies support the importance of Doppler ultrasound in the management of patients with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, particularly the role of Doppler velocimetry in the prediction of trophoblastic neoplasia and the chemoresistance of trophoblastic tumors.

Adverse perinatal exposure to infection/inflammation with added insults like invasive mecha nical ventilation, exposure to hyperoxia, and sepsis causes persistent immune dysregulation. In this review article, we have attempted to analyze and consolidate current knowledge about the role played by persistent prenatal and postnatal inflammation in the pathogenesis of BPD. While some parameters of the early inflammatory response (neutrophils, cytokines, etc.) may not be detectable after days to weeks of exposure to noxious stimuli, they have already initiated the signaling pathways of the inflammatory process/immune cascade and have affected permanent defects structurally and functionally in the BPD lungs. Hence, translational research aimed at prevention/amelioration of BPD needs to focus on dampening the inflammatory response at an early stage to prevent the cascade of events leading to lung injury with impaired healing resulting in the pathologic pulmonary phenotype of alveolar simplification and dysregulated vascularization characteristic of BPD.", "journal": "Frontiers in medicine", "date": "2016-01-07", "authors": ["JhernaBalany", "VineetBhandari"], "doi": "10.3389/fmed.2015.00090\n10.1002/bdra.23220\n10.1136/fn.82.1.F69\n10.1152/physrev.00028.2006\n10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2007.09.007\n10.1152/ajplung.00354.2006\n10.1152/ajplung.00159.2014\n10.1016/j.jpeds.2004.12.023\n10.1097/CPM.0b013e318218a071\n10.1542/peds.2008-1962\n10.1053/j.semperi.2006.05.005\n10.1016/j.ajog.2013.08.030\n10.1055/s-2002-35612\n10.1038/ni1004-971\n10.1038/ni1153\n10.1016/S0952-7915(99)00056-4\n10.1016/0167-5699(92)90157-3\n10.1038/346425a0\n10.1016/j.prrv.2013.02.008\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.01.027\n10.1165/rcmb.2011-0023OC\n10.1371/journal.pone.0031336\n10.1164/rccm.200608-1240OC\n10.1165/rcmb.2012-0381OC\n10.1165/rcmb.2010-0058OC\n10.1164/ajrccm.164.10.2101140\n10.1164/ajrccm.164.10.2012036\n10.3109/01902148.2012.663454\n10.1164/rccm.200212-1434OC\n10.1164/rccm.201203-0406OC\n10.1164/rccm.200912-1793OC\n10.1038/nm1494\n10.1038/sj.jp.7211886\n10.1016/j.placenta.2009.11.012\n10.1016/j.placenta.2005.02.009\n10.1080/00016340601022793\n10.1093/infdis/145.1.1\n10.1016/j.siny.2011.08.002\n10.1016/j.siny.2008.08.011\n10.1016/j.ajog.2013.01.008\n10.1053/j.semperi.2013.01.005\n10.1016/j.ajog.2013.11.032\n10.1002/ppul.22881\n10.1136/adc.2008.150458\n10.1159/000320170\n10.1016/j.prrv.2013.09.004\n10.1038/jp.2012.154\n10.1055/s-0032-1321501\n10.1055/s-0034-1393936\n10.1152/ajplung.00140.2001\n10.1203/01.PDR.0000181377.78061.3E\n10.1164/rccm.200608-1162OC\n10.1152/ajplung.00230.2011\n10.1186/1465-9921-12-134\n10.1152/ajplung.00294.2010\n10.5935/0103-507X.20130054\n10.1152/ajplung.00162.2013\n10.1203/PDR.0b013e318181e05e\n10.1203/PDR.0b013e318163a8cc\n10.1203/00006450-201011001-00120\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016910\n10.1016/j.resp.2008.04.010\n10.1152/ajplung.00362.2007\n10.1152/ajplung.00251.2009\n10.1164/rccm.201012-2010OC\n10.1152/ajplung.00405.2011\n10.1164/ajrccm.159.3.9804027\n10.1152/ajplung.00367.2006\n10.1164/rccm.200802-359OC\n10.1038/pr.2011.687\n10.1164/ajrccm.160.4.9810071\n10.1002/ppul.20135\n10.1152/ajplung.00325.2001\n10.2310/6650.2005.53508\n10.1164/rccm.2510002\n10.1172/JCI2329\n10.1164/rccm.200611-1734OC\n10.1164/rccm.200309-1276OC\n10.1542/peds.2006-0622\n10.1542/peds.2003-0572-L\n10.1056/NEJMoa072788\n10.1053/j.semperi.2013.01.007\n10.1038/jp.2014.100\n10.3109/14767058.2015.1059809\n10.1056/NEJMoa1214533\n10.1042/CBI20110447\n10.1165/rcmb.2012-0381OC\n10.1152/ajplung.00023.2009\n10.1164/rccm.200712-1839OC\n10.1186/1471-2121-12-54\n10.1152/ajplung.00026.2012\n10.1164/ajrccm.164.9.2011071\n10.1002/ppul.23063\n10.1203/PDR.0b013e31820bcb2a\n10.1165/rcmb.2006-0116OC\n10.1165/rcmb.2008-0480OC\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.04.012\n10.3109/01902149709039242\n10.1080/019021499270187\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2003.12.007\n10.1152/ajplung.90392.2008\n10.1002/ar.20921\n10.1159/000187651\n10.1016/j.taap.2011.06.018\n10.1016/j.nut.2012.04.001\n10.1152/ajplung.00257.2012\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2013.03.004\n10.1152/ajplung.00233.2014\n10.1053/j.semperi.2013.01.010\n10.1164/rccm.201412-2142PP\n10.1542/peds.2014-2651\n10.1055/s-0034-1371702\n10.1164/ajrccm.164.3.2010127\n10.1152/ajplung.00393.2002\n10.1164/rccm.200310-1417OC\n10.1164/rccm.200408-1053OC\n10.1165/ajrcmb.23.5.4016\n10.1006/cyto.2001.0894\n10.1093/infdis/171.1.134\n10.1152/ajplung.00434.2006\n10.1165/rcmb.2007-0024OC\n10.2741/bhan"}
{"title": "Astrocytes and M\u00fcller Cell Alterations During Retinal Degeneration in a Transgenic Rat Model of Retinitis Pigmentosa.", "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa includes a group of progressive retinal degenerative diseases that affect the structure and function of photoreceptors. Secondarily to the loss of photoreceptors, there is a reduction in retinal vascularization, which seems to influence the cellular degenerative process. Retinal macroglial cells, astrocytes, and M\u00fcller cells provide support for retinal neurons and are fundamental for maintaining normal retinal function. The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of macroglial changes during retinal degeneration in P23H rats.\nHomozygous P23H line-3 rats aged from P18 to 18 months were used to study the evolution of the disease, and SD rats were used as controls. Immunolabeling with antibodies against GFAP, vimentin, and transducin were used to visualize macroglial cells and cone photoreceptors.\nIn P23H rats, increased GFAP labeling in M\u00fcller cells was observed as an early indicator of retinal gliosis. At 4 and 12 months of age, the apical processes of M\u00fcller cells in P23H rats clustered in firework-like structures, which were associated with ring-like shaped areas of cone degeneration in the outer nuclear layer. These structures were not observed at 16 months of age. The number of astrocytes was higher in P23H rats than in the SD matched controls at 4 and 12 months of age, supporting the idea of astrocyte proliferation. As the disease progressed, astrocytes exhibited a deteriorated morphology and marked hypertrophy. The increase in the complexity of the astrocytic processes correlated with greater connexin 43 expression and higher density of connexin 43 immunoreactive puncta within the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of P23H vs. SD rat retinas.\nIn the P23H rat model of retinitis pigmentosa, the loss of photoreceptors triggers major changes in the number and morphology of glial cells affecting the inner retina.", "journal": "Frontiers in cellular neuroscience", "date": "2016-01-07", "authors": ["LauraFern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez", "PedroLax", "LauraCampello", "IsabelPinilla", "Nicol\u00e1sCuenca"], "doi": "10.3389/fncel.2015.00484\n10.2147/OPTH.S3967\n10.1002/cne.21974\n10.1001/archopht.1991.01080010094039\n10.3389/fendo.2013.00048\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2009.07.001\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2006.05.003\n10.1159/000328979\n10.1016/j.exer.2014.12.009\n10.1097/ICU.0000000000000125\n10.1111/j.1444-0938.2012.00741.x\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2014.07.001\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.04.042\n10.1002/glia.20900\n10.1038/343364a0\n10.1016/S0042-6989(02)00680-6\n10.4172/2155-9899.1000188\n10.1167/iovs.13-12643\n10.1016/j.exer.2010.10.003\n10.1016/S0165-3806(98)00101-1\n10.1002/cne.21144\n10.1167/iovs.04-0860\n10.1016/S0306-4522(03)00599-2\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.09.054\n10.1371/journal.pone.0120415\n10.1074/jbc.M204955200\n10.1002/glia.20516\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btv097\n10.1167/iovs.14-15398\n10.1007/s10384-012-0147-2\n10.1016/j.exer.2005.03.006\n10.1002/cne.10703\n10.1021/bi00186a011\n10.1167/iovs.09-4847\n10.1016/j.jocn.2010.06.002\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2013.02.001\n10.1016/j.nbd.2009.12.025\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2012.04.004\n10.1002/glia.21183\n10.1002/cne.20567\n10.1016/S0074-7696(03)30005-1\n10.1017/S0952523813000011\n10.1242/jcs.01221\n10.1167/iovs.11-7879\n10.1097/00006982-199401000-00014\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00402.x\n10.1385/MN:28:2:139\n10.1016/S1350-9462(03)00039-9\n10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00066-1\n10.1002/glia.20399\n10.1167/iovs.06-1398\n10.1186/s12974-014-0186-3\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2008.05.001\n10.1016/j.exer.2008.09.004\n10.1002/cne.902190309\n10.1016/j.exer.2015.10.012\n10.1016/j.neulet.2005.02.055\n10.1007/978-1-4419-1399-9_60\n10.1006/exer.2001.1061\n10.1007/s00441-009-0916-5\n10.1002/glia.22477\n10.1016/S1350-9462(98)00009-3\n10.1016/S0166-2236(97)01139-9\n10.1002/jnr.22317\n10.1177/1073858405278321\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2015.06.003\n10.1167/iovs.07-1474\n10.1006/cbir.1998.0388\n10.1371/journal.pone.0061631\n10.1002/cne.902950113\n10.1002/cne.10524"}

Forty patients with stage 2-3 sacral bedsores, preferably paraplegic, quadriplegic, and/or hemiplegic, were allocated into two groups of experiment and control. Under local anesthesia and sedation, ulcers of the experiment and control groups were dressed with pure extract of kiwifruit and normal saline, respectively, on a daily basis for 21\u00a0days. The ulcers were examined and photographed weekly. Pre- and postintervention biopsies were taken from the ulcers to perform microbiological and histological study. Mean reduction in surface area of bedsore in the experiment group was significantly higher than the control group (486.47 vs. 117.38\u00a0mm, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

{"title": "Cutaneous vascularization of the femoral triangle in\u00a0respect to groin incisions.", "abstract": "The purpose of this anatomic study was to describe the cutaneous vascularization of the femoral triangle and its variation to evaluate the potential consequences of the classic incisions used in vascular surgery. The ultimate goal was to suggest surgical approaches that would take into account the vascularization of the inguinal region to potentially reduce the vascular lesions and wound complications at the groin.\nThe cutaneous arteries of the femoral triangle were studied in 11 lower limbs from 6 human embalmed cadavers. The technique included embalming of the cadavers, radiopaque latex injection, radiographs, and anatomic dissection.\nThe comparison of the vascular patterns revealed that despite the high variability of the arborization of the cutaneous arteries, their distribution patterns share many characteristics. The main vascularization of the femoral triangle comes from three arteries: the superficial circumflex iliac, the superficial epigastric, and the external pudendal. The first two arteries originate generally through a common trunk that buds laterally from the femoral artery at about 1.5\u00a0cm below the inguinal ligament. This study shows that the classic vertical incision at the groin would lead to damage of the cutaneous branches that cross over the femoral artery in its proximal part (the superficial epigastric artery in 82% and the common trunk of the superficial epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries in 18%); these lesions could lead to the postsurgical disruption of the dermal blood flow.\nThe classic incisions could disrupt the cutaneous blood supply and thus increase the risk of tissue necrosis around the wound, explaining the observed postsurgical complications and infections. We propose to lower the vertical incision to start 2\u00a0cm under the inguinal ligament to reduce lesions of the cutaneous arteries and the potential devascularization of the wounds.", "journal": "Journal of vascular surgery", "date": "2016-01-05", "authors": ["C\u00e9ciliaTremblay", "DetlevGrabs", "DanielBourgouin", "GillesBronchti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jvs.2015.04.385"}

{"title": "Vascularized bone grafting fixed by biodegradable magnesium screw for treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head.", "abstract": "Hip-preserving surgery with vascularized bone graft implantation has been widely practiced in treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). However, the current approach presents a drawback, in which the implanted bone graft without screw fixation may slip or exhibit a certain degree of displacement postoperatively. This study was designed to investigate the application potential of biodegradable magnesium (Mg) screws for the fixation of vascularized bone graft in ONFH patients. Forty-eight patients were randomly divided into two groups: the Mg screw group (vascularized bone grafting fixed by Mg screws) and the control group (vascularized bone grafting without fixation). During 12 month follow-up period after surgery, treatment outcomes in patients were assessed by multiple imaging techniques including x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scanning as well as functional recovery Harris hip score (HHS). The temporal changes in serum levels of Mg, Ca, and P as well as in\u00a0vivo degradation rate of Mg screws were determined. The absence of potential adverse effects induced by degradation products from Mg screws on surrounding bone tissue was validated via CT imaging analysis. HHS was significantly improved in the Mg screw group when compared to the control group. X-ray imaging analysis showed that the screw shape did not show significant alteration due to the diameter of Mg screws measured with approximate 25% reduction within 12 months post-surgically. The postoperative serum levels of Ca, Mg, and P, which are relevant for liver and kidney function, were all within normal physiological range in all patients of both groups. The use of biodegradable Mg screws may provide a promising bone graft-screw fixation route in treating ONFH and present considerable potential for orthopedic applications.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-01-03", "authors": ["DeweiZhao", "ShiboHuang", "FaqiangLu", "BenjieWang", "LeiYang", "LingQin", "KeYang", "YangdeLi", "WeirongLi", "WeiWang", "SimiaoTian", "XiuzhiZhang", "WenbinGao", "ZongpuWang", "YuZhang", "XinhuiXie", "JialiWang", "JunleiLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.038"}

Although free-tissue transfer of a vascularized free flap is often preferred, the clinical benefits of the PMMC flap should not be overlooked. The conventional technique of harvesting a PMMC flap involves a single vascular supply from the pectoral branch of the thoracoacromial artery. However, this approach compromises the distal skin island of the flap, and requires an indirect blood supply via communicating vessels, which increases the potential risk of partial distal flap necrosis. When harvesting a PMMC flap for oral and maxillofacial reconstruction, preservation of the lateral thoracic artery and use of the subclavian route are alternatives that ensure sufficient blood supply and an increased rotation arc. Such an approach enables the harvesting of a PMMC flap that can reach the entire oral cavity, including the infraorbital region, palate, middle pterygopalatine fossa and nasopharynx, with no risk of vascular insufficiency to the distal skin island.

The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of spatial and temporal release of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on the extent of osteogenic and vasculogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) encapsulated in a patterned hydrogel. Nanogels (NGs) based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) macromers chain-extended with short lactide (L) and glycolide (G) segments were used for grafting and timed-release of BMP2 and VEGF. NGs with 12kDa PEG molecular weight (MW), 24 LG segment length, and 60/40L/G ratio (P12-II, NG(10)) released the grafted VEGF in 10days. NGs with 8kDa PEG MW, 26 LG segment length, and 60/40L/G ratio (P8-I, NG(21)) released the grafted BMP2 in 21days. hMSCs and NG-BMP2 were encapsulated in a patterned matrix based on acrylate-functionalized lactide-chain-extended star polyethylene glycol (SPELA) hydrogel and microchannel patterns filled with a suspension of hMSCs+ECFCs and NG-VEGF in a crosslinked gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel. Groups included patterned constructs without BMP2/VEGF (None), with directly added BMP2/VEGF, and NG-BMP2/NG-VEGF. Based on the results, timed-release of VEGF in the microchannels in 10days from NG(10) and BMP2 in the matrix in 21days from NG(21) resulted in highest extent of osteogenic and vasculogenic differentiation of the encapsulated hMSCs and ECFCs compared to direct addition of VEGF and BMP2. Further, timed-release of VEGF from NG(10) in hMSC+ECFC encapsulating microchannels and BMP2 from NG(21) in hMSC encapsulating matrix sharply increased bFGF expression in the patterned constructs.

However, in brain tumors the function of these immune cells is not sufficiently clarified. In our study, we investigated differential pro-angiogenic activities of resident microglia and peripheral macrophages and their impact on glioma vascularization and progression. Our data demonstrate stable accumulation of microglia/macrophages during tumor growth. These cells often interact with tumor blood vessels correlating with vascular remodeling. Here, we identified resident microglia as well as peripheral macrophages as part of the perivascular niche, primarily contacting endothelial cells. We found overexpression of a variety of pro-angiogenic molecules within freshly isolated microglia/macrophages from glioma. CXCL2, until now a poorly described chemokine, was strongly up-regulated and showed better angiogenic activity than VEGF in vitro. Blocking the CXCL2-CXCR2 signaling pathway resulted in considerably diminished glioma sizes. Additionally, the importance of microglia/macrophages in tumor angiogenesis was confirmed by depletion of these cells in vivo. Vessel density decreased by 50% leading to significantly smaller tumor volumes. Remarkably, selective reduction of resident microglia affected tumoral vessel count comparable to ablation of the whole myeloid cell fraction. These results provide evidence that resident microglia are the crucial modulatory cell population playing a central role in regulation of vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis in brain tumors.

An experimental study in mouse retinas was conducted. Using a dual immunolabeling with antibodies to Dp71 and anti-GFAP for astrocytes on retinal sections and isolated astrocytes, it was found that Dp71 was expressed in wild-type (WT) mouse astrocytes from early developmental stages to adult stage. In Dp71-null mice, a reduction in GFAP-immunopositive astrocytes was observed as early as postnatal day 6 (P6) compared with WT mice.

Furthermore, what effects re-endothelialization have on vascular patency and function are not well understood. We investigated the use of ultrasound-guided photoacoustic (US/PA) imaging as a technique to visualize the distribution of microvascular endothelial cells within an optimized acellular construct upon re-endothelialization and perfusion conditioning. We also evaluated the vascular performance of the re-endothelialized scaffold using quantitative vascular corrosion casting (qVCC) and whole-blood perfusion. We found US/PA imaging was an effective technique to visualize the distribution of cells. Cellular retention following perfusion conditioning was also detected with US/PA imaging. Finally, we demonstrated that a partial recovery of vascular performance is possible following re-endothelialization-confirmed by fewer extravasations in qVCC and improved blood clearance following whole-blood perfusion.\nRe-endothelialization is a method that enables decellularized tissue to become useful as a tissue engineering construct by creating a nutrient delivery and waste removal system for the entire construct. Our approach utilizes a decellularization method that retains the basement ECM of a highly vascularized tissue upon which endothelial cells can be injected to form an endothelium. The US/PA method allows for rapid visualization of cells within a construct several cm thick.

Although these compounds show a good efficacy in vitro and in vivo, no data on monitoring and predicting treatment response are currently available. We therefore investigated the effect of the pan-deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) on gastrointestinal cancer models and the suitability of 2-[(18)F]FGlc-RGD as a specific agent for imaging integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression during tumor angiogenesis using small animal positron emission tomography (PET).\nThe effect of panobinostat on cell viability in vitro was assessed with a label-free impedance based real-time analysis. Nude mice bearing HT29 and HepG2 tumors were treated with daily i.p. injections of 10mg/kg panobinostat for 4 weeks. During this time, tumor size was determined with a calliper and mice were repeatedly subjected to PET imaging. Tumor tissues were analyzed immunohistochemically with a focus on proliferation and endothelial cell markers (Ki-67, Meca-32) and by Western blot applying specific markers of apoptosis.\nIn vitro, panobinostat inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and HT29 cells. Contrary to the situation in HepG2 tumors in vivo, where panobinostat treatment is known to reduce proliferation and vascularization resulting in a decreased tumor growth, HT29 tumors did not show any effect on these parameters. We demonstrated by Western blotting, that panobinostat induced apoptosis in HT29 tumors in vivo. Longitudinal PET imaging studies in HepG2 tumor-bearing mice using 2-[(18)F]FGlc-RGD demonstrated that the standard uptake value (SUVmax) in HepG2 tumors was significantly decreased by 39% at day 7 after treatment. The comparative PET study using HT29 tumor-bearing animals did not reveal any response of the tumors to panobinostat treatment.\nSmall-animal PET imaging using 2-[(18)F]FGlc-RGD was successfully applied to the non-invasive monitoring of the HepG2-tumor response to panobinostat in nude mice early after begin of treatment. Thus, PET imaging of angiogenesis using 2-[(18)F]FGlc-RGD could be a valuable tool to monitor panobinostat therapy in further preclinical studies.\nWhen successfully translated to the clinical surrounding, PET imaging of angiogenesis could therefore facilitate therapy planning and monitoring of therapy success with panobinostat in hepatocellular carcinoma.", "journal": "Nuclear medicine and biology", "date": "2015-12-26", "authors": ["SimoneMaschauer", "SusanneGahr", "MuktheshwarGandesiri", "PhilippTripal", "RegineSchneider-Stock", "TorstenKuwert", "MatthiasOcker", "OlafPrante"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2015.10.003"}
{"title": "Controlled Dual Growth Factor Delivery From Microparticles Incorporated Within Human Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Aggregates for Enhanced Bone Tissue Engineering via Endochondral Ossification.", "abstract": "Bone tissue engineering via endochondral ossification has been explored by chondrogenically priming cells using soluble mediators for at least 3 weeks to produce a hypertrophic cartilage template. Although recapitulation of endochondral ossification has been achieved, long-term in vitro culture is required for priming cells through repeated supplementation of inductive factors in the media. To address this challenge, a microparticle-based growth factor delivery system was engineered to drive endochondral ossification within human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) aggregates. Sequential exogenous presentation of soluble transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) at various defined time courses resulted in varying degrees of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis as demonstrated by glycosaminoglycan and calcium content. The time course that best induced endochondral ossification was used to guide the development of the microparticle-based controlled delivery system for TGF-\u03b21 and BMP-2. Gelatin microparticles capable of relatively rapid release of TGF-\u03b21 and mineral-coated hydroxyapatite microparticles permitting more sustained release of BMP-2 were then incorporated within hMSC aggregates and cultured for 5 weeks following the predetermined time course for sequential presentation of bioactive signals. Compared with cell-only aggregates treated with exogenous growth factors, aggregates with incorporated TGF-\u03b21- and BMP-2-loaded microparticles exhibited enhanced chondrogenesis and alkaline phosphatase activity at week 2 and a greater degree of mineralization by week 5. Staining for types I and II collagen, osteopontin, and osteocalcin revealed the presence of cartilage and bone. This microparticle-incorporated system has potential as a readily implantable therapy for healing bone defects without the need for long-term in vitro chondrogenic priming. Significance: This study demonstrates the regulation of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis with regard to endochondral bone formation in high-density stem cell systems through the controlled presentation of inductive factors from incorporated microparticles. This work lays the foundation for a rapidly implantable tissue engineering system that promotes bone repair via endochondral ossification, a pathway that can delay the need for a functional vascular network and has an intrinsic ability to promote angiogenesis. The modular nature of this system lends well to using different cell types and/or growth factors to induce endochondral bone formation, as well as the production of other tissue types.", "journal": "Stem cells translational medicine", "date": "2015-12-25", "authors": ["Phuong NDang", "NehaDwivedi", "Lauren MPhillips", "XiaohuaYu", "SamuelHerberg", "CaitlinBowerman", "Loran DSolorio", "William LMurphy", "EbenAlsberg"], "doi": "10.5966/sctm.2015-0115"}

{"title": "Delphinidin Inhibits Tumor Growth by Acting on VEGF Signalling in Endothelial Cells.", "abstract": "The vasculoprotective properties of delphinidin are driven mainly by its action on endothelial cells. Moreover, delphinidin displays anti-angiogenic properties in both in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis models and thereby might prevent the development of tumors associated with excessive vascularization. This study was aimed to test the effect of delphinidin on melanoma-induced tumor growth with emphasis on its molecular mechanism on endothelial cells. Delphinidin treatment significantly decreased in vivo tumor growth induced by B16-F10 melanoma cell xenograft in mice. In vitro, delphinidin was not able to inhibit VEGFR2-mediated B16-F10 melanoma cell proliferation but it specifically reduced basal and VEGFR2-mediated endothelial cell proliferation. The anti-proliferative effect of delphinidin was reversed either by the MEK1/2 MAP kinase inhibitor, U-0126, or the PI3K inhibitor, LY-294002. VEGF-induced proliferation was reduced either by U-0126 or LY-294002. Under these conditions, delphinidin failed to decrease further endothelial cell proliferation. Delphinidin prevented VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK and decreased the expression of the transcription factors, CREB and ATF1. Finally, delphinidin was more potent in inhibiting in vitro cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), PDE1 and PDE2, compared to PDE3-PDE5. Altogether delphinidin reduced tumor growth of melanoma cell in vivo by acting specifically on endothelial cell proliferation. The mechanism implies an association between inhibition of VEGF-induced proliferation via VEGFR2 signalling, MAPK, PI3K and at transcription level on CREB/ATF1 factors, and the inhibition of PDE2.

Among the key players in the initial phase of bone regeneration are mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) that are in close contact in many tissues. Additionally, the generation of tissue constructs for in vivo transplantations has included the use of ECs since insufficient vascularization is one of the bottlenecks in (bone) tissue engineering. Here, 3D cocultures of human bone marrow derived MSCs (hBM-MSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in synthetic biomimetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based matrices are directed toward vascularized bone mimicking tissue constructs. In this environment, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) or fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) promotes the formation of vascular networks. However, while osteogenic differentiation is achieved with BMP-2, the treatment with FGF-2 suppressed osteogenic differentiation.

In in\u00a0vitro study, human fibroblast pretreated by IFN-\u03b3 showed phosphorylation of STAT1, and this phosphorylation was down-regulated by adding tofacitinib to the culture medium.

{"title": "Blockade of CCR7 leads to decreased dendritic cell migration to draining lymph nodes and promotes graft survival in low-risk corneal transplantation.", "abstract": "The chemokine receptor CCR7 is essential for migration of mature dendritic cells (DCs) to the regional lymph nodes, and it has been shown that blocking of CCR7 improves graft survival after high-risk corneal transplantation in vascularized recipient corneas. However, it is so far unknown whether blocking of CCR7 reduces migration of DCs from the avascular cornea to the draining lymph nodes and whether this leads to improved graft survival also in the low-risk setting of corneal transplantation, which accounts for the majority of perforating transplantations performed. Therefore, in this study, pellets containing Freund's adjuvant and bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated to Alexa488 fluorescent dye were implanted into the corneal stroma of BALB/c mice to analyze antigen uptake by corneal DCs and their migration to the regional lymph nodes. After pellet implantation, mice were either treated by local administration of a CCR7 blocking fusion protein that consisted of CCL19 fused to the Fc part of human IgG1 or a control-IgG. In\u00a0vivo fluorescence microscopy showed uptake of Alexa488-conjugated BSA by corneal DCs within 8\u00a0h. Furthermore, analysis of single cell suspensions of draining lymph nodes prepared after 48\u00a0h revealed that 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3% of CD11c(+) cells were also Alexa488(+).

{"title": "A prosurvival and proangiogenic stem cell delivery system to promote ischemic limb regeneration.", "abstract": "Stem cell therapy is one of the most promising strategies to restore blood perfusion and promote muscle regeneration in ischemic limbs. Yet its therapeutic efficacy remains low owing to the inferior cell survival under the low oxygen and nutrient environment of the injured limbs. To increase therapeutic efficacy, high rates of both short- and long-term cell survival are essential, which current approaches do not support. In this work, we hypothesized that a high rate of short-term cell survival can be achieved by introducing a prosurvival environment into the stem cell delivery system to enhance cell survival before vascularization is established; and that a high rate of long-term cell survival can be attained by building a proangiogenic environment in the system to quickly vascularize the limbs. The system was based on a biodegradable and thermosensitive poly(N-Isopropylacrylamide)-based hydrogel, a prosurvival and proangiogenic growth factor bFGF, and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). bFGF can be continuously released from the system for 4weeks. The released bFGF significantly improved MSC survival and paracrine effects under low nutrient and oxygen conditions (0% FBS and 1% O2) in vitro. The prosurvival effect of the bFGF on MSCs was resulted from activating cell Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) pathway. When transplanted into the ischemic limbs, the system dramatically improved MSC survival. Some of the engrafted cells were differentiated into skeletal muscle and endothelial cells, respectively. The system also promoted the proliferation of host cells. After only 2weeks of implantation, tissue blood perfusion was completely recovered; and after 4weeks, the muscle fiber diameter was restored similarly to that of the normal limbs. These pronounced results demonstrate that the developed stem cell delivery system has a potential for ischemic limb regeneration.\nStem cell therapy is a promising strategy to restore blood perfusion and promote muscle regeneration in ischemic limbs.

In this study, we demonstrated the tracing behavior and cell cycle of endothelial cells using Fucci-labeled (Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator) endothelial cells. Here, we observed the co-culture of Fucci-labeled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) together with normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) using time-lapse imaging and analyzed by multicellular concurrent tracking. In the G0/G1 period, HUVECs migrate faster than in the S/G2/M period, because G0/G1 is the mobile phase and S/G2/M is the proliferation phase in the cell cycle. When HUVECs are co-cultured, they tend to move randomly until they find existing tracks that they then follow to form clusters. Extracellular matrix (ECM) staining showed that collagen IV, laminin and thrombospondin deposited in accordance with endothelial cell networks. Therefore the HUVECs may migrate on the secreted ECM and exhibit tracing behavior, where the HUVECs migrate toward each other.

Doxorubicin (Dox) is commonly used as a model of cardiomyopathy, a condition that often precedes cardiovascular remodeling and heart failure. In 7-8-week-old C57Bl/6 male mice treated with Dox we found decreased capillary density, increased levels of ALK4/5 ligand and Smad2/3 transcripts, and increased expression of Smad2/3 transcriptional targets. Human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMVEC) treated with Dox also showed increased levels of ALK4/5 ligands, Smad2/3 transcriptional targets, a decrease in proliferation and suppression of vascular network formation in a HCMVEC and human cardiac fibroblasts co-culture assay. Our hypothesis is that the deleterious effects of Dox on endothelial cells are mediated in part by the activation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway. We used the inhibitor of ALK4/5 kinases SB431542 (SB) in concert with Dox to ascertain the role of TGF-\u03b2 pathway activation in doxorubicin induced endothelial cell defects. SB prevented the suppression of HCMVEC proliferation in the presence of TGF-\u03b22 and activin A, and alleviated the inhibition of HCMVEC proliferation by Dox. SB also prevented the suppression of vascular network formation in co-cultures of HCMVEC and human cardiac fibroblasts treated with Dox. Our results show that the inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway alleviates the detrimental effects of Dox on endothelial cells in vitro.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2015-12-22", "authors": ["ZuyueSun", "JillSchriewer", "MingxinTang", "JerryMarlin", "FrederickTaylor", "Ralph VShohet", "Eugene AKonorev"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.010"}

The patients were evaluated at presentation and during follow-up at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months. The parameters evaluated were the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Schirmer test, tear film breakup time (TBUT), conjunctival congestion, corneal haze, vascularization, conjunctivalization, and limbal stem cell involvement. Lid edema, symblepharon, ankyloblepharon, ectropion, entropion, trichiasis, and metaplastic lashes also were analyzed.\nMaintenance of BCVA and stable ocular surface.\nAt the end of 6 months, the mean BCVA was significantly better in the AMT group (0.068\u00b10.10 logMAR units) compared with the MT group (0.522\u00b10.52 logMAR units; P = 0.042). The mean TBUT in the AMT and MT groups was 9.92\u00b14.1 and 6.96\u00b14.5 seconds, respectively (P = 0.015).

Hybrid TECs composed of relatively rigid porous scaffolds for structural and mechanical integrity and soft hydrogels for cell- and growth factor-loading have a tremendous potential to tissue regeneration under mechanical loading. However, despite excessive progress in the field, the current 3D bioprinting techniques and systems fall short in integration of such soft and rigid multifunctional components. Here we present a novel 3D hybrid bioprinting technology (Hybprinter) and its capability enabling integration of soft and rigid components for TECs. Hybprinter employs digital light processing-based stereolithography (DLP-SLA) and molten material extrusion techniques for soft and rigid materials, respectively. In this study, poly-ethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and poly-(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) were used as a model material for soft hydrogel and rigid scaffold, respectively. It was shown that geometrical accuracy, swelling ratio and mechanical properties of the hydrogel component can be tailored by DLP-SLA module. We have demonstrated the printability of variety of complex hybrid construct designs using Hybprinter technology and characterized the mechanical properties and functionality of such constructs. The compressive mechanical stiffness of a hybrid construct (90% hydrogel) was significantly higher than hydrogel itself (\u223c6 MPa versus 100 kPa). In addition, viability of cells incorporated within the bioprinted hybrid constructs was determined approximately 90%. Furthermore, a functionality of a hybrid construct composed of porous scaffold with an embedded hydrogel conduit was characterized for vascularized tissue engineering applications. High material diffusion and high cell viability in about 2.5 mm distance surrounding the conduit indicated that culture media effectively diffused through the conduit and fed the cells. The results suggest that the developed technology is potent to form functional TECs composed of rigid and soft biomaterials.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-12-20", "authors": ["YShanjani", "C CPan", "LElomaa", "YYang"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045008"}

In contrast to white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) is well vascularized, rich in mitochondria, and highly oxidative. While it is known that the angiogenic factor VEGF-A is required for brown adipocyte development, the functional consequences and exact mechanism remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that VEGF-A plays an essential autocrine role in the function of BAT.\nMouse models were generated with an adipose-specific and macrophage-specific ablation of VEGF-A. Adipose tissue characteristics and thermogenic response were analyzed in vivo, and mitochondrial morphology and oxidative respiration were analyzed in vitro to assess effects of endogenous VEGF-A ablation.\nVEGF-A expression levels are highest in adipocyte precursors compared to immune or endothelial cell populations within both WAT and BAT. Loss of VEGF-A in adipocytes, but not macrophages, results in decreased adipose tissue vascularization, with remarkably diminished thermogenic capacity in vivo. Complete ablation of endogenous VEGF-A decreases oxidative capacity of mitochondria in brown adipocytes. Further, acute ablation of VEGF-A in brown adipocytes in vitro impairs mitochondrial respiration, despite similar mitochondrial mass compared to controls.\nThese data demonstrate that VEGF-A serves to orchestrate the acquisition of thermogenic capacity of brown adipocytes through mitochondrial function in conjunction with the recruitment of blood vessels.", "journal": "Metabolism: clinical and experimental", "date": "2015-12-20", "authors": ["KianaMahdaviani", "DavidChess", "YuanyuanWu", "OrianShirihai", "Tamar RAprahamian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.metabol.2015.09.012"}

The sizes of the MTF and inferior turbinate flap (ITF) and these distances up to the frontal base were analyzed by computed tomography (CT) using a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) in 20 patients. The minimum flap measurement to reconstruct the skull base was defined as the distance from the basal plate to the medial slope or lateral slope edge of the MTF and the ITF on the coronal view. Next, we reviewed clinical data from three patients with dural deficits who underwent endoscopic vascularized MTF reconstruction. The distance to the frontal base from the ITF was significantly longer than that from the MTF. The minimum length of the MTF measured by coronal CT was similar to the distance to the frontal base. In contrast, the minimum length of the ITF was shorter than the distance to the frontal base. These results suggest that the MTF might be superior to the ITF for coverage of the anterior frontal base.

Here, the oxygen-sensing system (PHD-HIF) has recently been put into focus, since the prolyl-hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD) and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are considered as potential therapeutic targets to treat ischemia, cancers or age-related macula degeneration. While the oxygen-sensing system (PHD-HIF) has been studied intensively in this respect, only little is known from developing vertebrate embryos since mutations within this pathway led to an early decease of embryos due to placental defects. During vertebrate embryogenesis, a progenitor cell called hemangioblast is assumed to give rise to blood cells and blood vessels in a process called hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis, respectively. Xenopus provides an ideal experimental system to address these processes in vivo, as its development does not depend on a functional placenta and thus allows analyzing the role of oxygen directly. To this end, we adopted a computer-controlled four-channel system, which allowed us to culture Xenopus embryos under defined oxygen concentrations. Our data show that the development of vascular structures and blood cells is strongly impaired under hypoxia, while general development is less compromised. Interestingly, suppression of Phd2 function using specific antisense morpholinos or a chemical inhibitor resulted in mostly overlapping vascular defects; nevertheless, blood cell was formed almost normally. Our results provide the first evidence that oxygen via Phd2 has a decisive influence on the formation of the vascular network during vertebrate embryogenesis.

Tumor vascularization and growth as well as tumor cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis were studied repetitively over 14 days using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry.\nDPO did not influence tumor cell migration and apoptosis. In addition, DPO did not stimulate tumor cell infiltration or vascularization; however, significantly increased tumor cell proliferation was detected in hepatectomized animals.\nDPO increases cell proliferation in established extrahepatic colorectal metastases after major hepatectomy.

Vascularization indices were elevated in cases of newly diagnosed benign thyroid diseases. Musculoskeletal changes i.e. lateral tension and idiopathic moving toes, as well as situations of physical and psychological stress and minor trauma and infection led to an increase of vascularization. Magnesium levels correlated negatively with these two conditions. The supplementation brought a reduction of the vascularization indices and reduced the incidence of idiopathic moving toes. Treatment of lateral tension required manual medicine methods and acupuncture (gastrocnemius). A small subgroup of patients showed a further reduction of hyper-vascularization after receiving coenzyme Q10.\nWe interpret the elevated thyroid vascularization and low magnesium levels as signs of an inflammatory process related to the musculoskeletal changes. Improvement of thyroid function and morphology can be achieved after correcting the influence of stressors together with the supplementation regime.

{"title": "A Hypothesis Concerning the Biphasic Dose-response of Tumors to Angiostatin and Endostatin.", "abstract": "This manuscript proposes a hypothesis to explain the U-shaped dose-response observed for angiostatin and other high-molecular-weight drugs in various anti-cancer bio-assays. The dose-response curves for angiostatin and endostatin (measured as suppression of tumor growth) go through an optimum (i.e., minimum tumor growth) and then becomes less effective at higher doses. The literature suggests that at lower doses the primary action of these high-molecular-weight drugs is to counteract the angiogenic effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To do this, the drugs must pass out of the blood vessel and enter the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) where VEGF induces the growth and fusion of tip cells. Ironically, VEGF actually facilitates access of the drugs to the ECM by making the vascular endothelium leaky. At higher doses, the high-molecular-weight drugs seem to reverse VEGF-induced permeability of the endothelium. Thus, at high dose rates, it is hypothesized that the drugs are not able to enter the ECM and block the angiogenic effects of VEGF there. As a result, high doses of the drugs do not suppress vascularization of the tumor or tumor growth. Moreover, if the permeability of the vessels is suppressed, the VEGF released by the stroma is concentrated in the ECM where it amplifies the angiogenic activity around the tumor.", "journal": "Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society", "date": "2015-12-18", "authors": ["George EParris"], "doi": "10.2203/dose-response.14-020.Parris"}

This, in turn, is a major prerequisite for the constructs' long-term function. 'Prevascularization' has emerged as a promising concept in tissue engineering, aiming at the generation of a preformed microvasculature in tissue constructs prior to their implantation. This should shorten the time period during which the constructs are avascular and suffer hypoxic conditions. Herein, we provide an overview of current strategies for the generation of preformed microvascular networks within tissue constructs. In vitro approaches use cell seeding, spheroid formation or cell sheet technologies. In situ approaches use the body as a natural bioreactor to induce vascularization by angiogenic ingrowth or flap and arteriovenous (AV)-loop techniques. In future, these strategies may be supplemented by the transplantation of adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments or the in vitro generation of highly organized microvascular networks by means of sophisticated microscale technologies and microfluidic systems.

{"title": "Intra-abdominal fat. Part I. The images of the adipose tissue localized beyond organs.", "abstract": "Unaltered fat is a permanent component of the abdominal cavity, even in slim individuals. Visceral adiposity is one of the important factors contributing to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and certain neoplasms. Moreover, the adipose tissue is an important endocrine and immune organ of complex function both when normal and pathological. Its role in plastic surgery, reconstruction and transplantology is a separate issue. The adipose tissue has recently drawn the attention of research institutes owing to being a rich source of stem cells. This review, however, does not include these issues. The identification of fat is relatively easy using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. It can be more difficult in an ultrasound examination for several reasons. The aim of this paper is to present various problems associated with US imaging of unaltered intra-abdominal fat located beyond organs. Based on the literature and experience, it has been demonstrated that the adipose tissue in the abdominal cavity has variable echogenicity, which primarily depends on the amount of extracellular fluid and the number of connective tissue septa, i.e. elements that potentiate the number of areas that reflect and scatter ultrasonic waves. The normal adipose tissue presents itself on a broad gray scale: from a hyperechoic area, through numerous structures of lower reflection intensity, to nearly anechoic regions mimicking the presence of pathological fluid collections. The features that facilitate proper identification of this tissue are: sharp margins, homogeneous structure, high compressibility under transducer pressure, no signs of infiltration of the surrounding structures and no signs of vascularization when examined with the color and power Doppler. The accumulation of fat tissue in the abdominal cavity can be generalized, regional or focal. The identification of the adipose tissue in the abdominal cavity using ultrasonography is not always easy. When in doubt, the diagnostic process should be extended to include computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, or sometimes biopsy (preferably the core-needle one).\nNiezmieniony t\u0142uszcz to sta\u0142y sk\u0142adnik jamy brzusznej nawet u os\u00f3b szczup\u0142ych.

The diagnosis was confirmed in all patients by pathomorphological examinations. All retrospectively analyzed patients (n =17) had an abdominal US examination conducted in accordance with the previously mentioned protocol.\nPrimary neuroendocrine tumors were visualized ultrasonography in 13 of 17 patients (76.5%). In the remaining 4 patients, tumors in the small bowel were diagnosed in CT enteroclysis (n = 3) and conventional enteroclysis (n = 1). Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and CT enteroclysis supplemented the ultrasound result by providing information about the stage of the disease in 7 cases. In most of the 17 patients with a neuroendocrine tumor diagnosed by ultrasound (n = 11, 64.7%), changes in the mesentery were prevailing pathological signs that raised suspicion and, consequently, helped localize the primary lesion. The hypoechoic mesenteric lymph nodes were the greatest (9-18 mm), well-circumscribed, and the largest of them showed signs of vascularization.

{"title": "Tasquinimod triggers an early change in the polarization of tumor associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment.", "abstract": "Tasquinimod (a quinoline-3-carboxyamide) is a small molecule immunotherapy with demonstrated effects on the tumor microenvironment (TME) involving immunomodulation, anti-angiogenesis and inhibition of metastasis. A target molecule of tasquinimod is the inflammatory protein S100A9 which has been shown to affect the accumulation and function of suppressive myeloid cell subsets in tumors. Given the major impact of myeloid cells to the tumor microenvironment, manipulation of this cell compartment is a desirable goal in cancer therapeutics.\nTo understand the consequences of tasquinimod treatment on the TME, we evaluated early treatment effects in tumor infiltrating myeloid cells. Cellular phenotypes were studied by flow cytometry while gene expression both in tumor tissue and in isolated CD11b(+) cells or tumor cells were measured by real time-PCR. Effects on angiogenesis were monitored by changes in CD31 levels and by gene expression in tumor tissue. Effects on cytokine levels in tumor tissue and serum were determined by multiplex analysis.\nThe MC38-C215 colon carcinoma tumors showed a substantial infiltration of primarily myeloid cells that were dominated by Ly6C(low)F4/80(+)CD206(+) M2-polarized tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), an immuno-suppressive and pro-angiogenic cell population. Here, we show that tasquinimod treatment induces an anti-tumor effect which is subsequent to a reduction in tumor infiltrating CD206(+) M2 macrophages and a simultaneous increase in M1 macrophages expressing MHC class II and CD86. The tasquinimod-induced changes in TAM polarization were evident within 24\u00a0h of exposure, emphasizing the ability of tasquinimod to rapidly reprogram the tumor microenvironment. This change in the tumor associated myeloid compartment preceded an increased IL12-production within the tumor and a decrease in tumor neovascularization. The switch in TAM polarization by tasquinimod was confirmed in the 4T1 breast cancer model where tasquinimod also reduce lung metastasis development.\nOur data show that tasquinimod affects tumor infiltrating myeloid cells early after exposure, leading to a change in phenotype from pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive M2-like TAMs to pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages. These changes are consistent with the effects of tasquinimod seen on tumor vascularization, immune suppression and metastasis giving further insights to the anti-tumor mechanism of action of tasquinimod.", "journal": "Journal for immunotherapy of cancer", "date": "2015-12-18", "authors": ["AndersOlsson", "JessicaNakhl\u00e9", "AnetteSundstedt", "PascalePlas", "Anne-LaureBauchet", "Val\u00e9riePierron", "LuceBruetschy", "AdnanDeronic", "MarieT\u00f6rngren", "DavidLiberg", "FabienSchmidlin", "TomasLeanderson"], "doi": "10.1186/s40425-015-0098-5\n10.1084/jem.20150295\n10.1016/j.ccr.2013.02.013\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0661\n10.1038/nri3175\n10.1186/2045-824X-4-14\n10.1038/nm.3394\n10.1016/S1471-4906(02)02302-5\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.021908.132532\n10.1038/nri1668\n10.1172/JCI31422\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-2825\n10.1016/j.ccr.2005.08.002\n10.1016/j.coi.2010.01.009\n10.1073/pnas.0609028104\n10.1093/jnci/87.8.581\n10.1038/ni.1937\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1867\n10.1084/jem.20080108\n10.1248/bpb.b13-00659\n10.1371/journal.pone.0034207\n10.1002/pros.20509\n10.1186/1476-4598-9-107\n10.1002/pros.21495\n10.1200/JCO.2011.35.6295\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1000097\n10.1084/jem.20080132\n10.4049/jimmunol.181.7.4666\n10.1038/ki.2014.216\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2730\n10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-14-0076\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4672\n10.1021/pr400879c\n10.4161/onci.26860\n10.1182/blood-2007-12-130609\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1196\n10.1172/JCI59643\n10.1007/978-1-62703-128-8_14\n10.1007/s12307-011-0091-6\n10.1111/j.1365-2567.2012.03619.x\n10.1038/nrc3239\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1227\n10.1084/jem.20100587\n10.4161/onci.27561\n10.1111/1523-1747.ep12340161\n10.1189/jlb.0602325"}
{"title": "Ghrelin Promotes Functional Angiogenesis in a Mouse Model of Critical Limb Ischemia Through Activation of Proangiogenic MicroRNAs.", "abstract": "Current therapeutic strategies for the treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI) have only limited success. Recent in vitro evidence in the literature, using cell lines, proposes that the peptide hormone ghrelin may have angiogenic properties. In this study, we aim to investigate if ghrelin could promote postischemic angiogenesis in a mouse model of CLI and, further, identify the mechanistic pathway(s) that underpin ghrelin's proangiogenic properties. CLI was induced in male CD1 mice by femoral artery ligation. Animals were then randomized to receive either vehicle or acylated ghrelin (150 \u03bcg/kg sc) for 14 consecutive days. Subsequently, synchrotron radiation microangiography was used to assess hindlimb perfusion. Subsequent tissue samples were collected for molecular and histological analysis. Ghrelin treatment markedly improved limb perfusion by promoting the generation of new capillaries and arterioles (internal diameter less than 50 \u03bcm) within the ischemic hindlimb that were both structurally and functionally normal; evident by robust endothelium-dependent vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine. Molecular analysis revealed that ghrelin's angiogenic properties were linked to activation of prosurvival Akt/vascular endothelial growth factor/Bcl-2 signaling cascade, thus reducing the apoptotic cell death and subsequent fibrosis. Further, ghrelin treatment activated proangiogenic (miR-126 and miR-132) and antifibrotic (miR-30a) microRNAs (miRs) while inhibiting antiangiogenic (miR-92a and miR-206) miRs. Importantly, in vitro knockdown of key proangiogenic miRs (miR-126 and miR-132) inhibited the angiogenic potential of ghrelin. These results therefore suggest that clinical use of ghrelin for the early treatment of CLI may be a promising and potent inducer of reparative vascularization through modulation of key molecular factors.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2015-12-18", "authors": ["RajeshKatare", "ShrutiRawal", "Pujika EmaniMunasinghe", "HirotsuguTsuchimochi", "TadakatsuInagaki", "YutakaFujii", "ParulDixit", "KeijiUmetani", "KenjiKangawa", "MikiyasuShirai", "Daryl OSchwenke"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2015-1799"}
{"title": "A Comprehensive Study of Soft Palate Development in Mice.", "abstract": "Cleft palate is one of the most common congenital birth defects. Tremendous efforts have been made over the last decades towards understanding hard palate development. However, little is known about soft palate morphogenesis and myogenesis. Finding an appropriate surgical repair to restore physiological functions of the soft palate in patients with cleft palate is a major challenge for surgeons, and complete restoration is not always achievable. Here, we first analyzed the morphology, orientation and attachments of the four muscles of the murine soft palate and found that they are very similar to their counterparts in humans, validating the use of mus musculus as a model for future studies. Our data suggests that muscle differentiation extends from the lateral region to the midline following palatal fusion. We also detected an epithelial seam in the fusing soft palatal shelves, consistent with the process of fusion of the posterior palatal shelves, followed by degradation of the epithelial remnants. Innervation and vascularization are present mainly in the oral side of the soft palate, complementing the differentiated muscles. Cell lineage tracing using Wnt1-Cre;Zsgreenfl/fl mice indicated that all the tendons and mesenchyme embedding the soft palate muscles are neural crest-derived. We propose that the posterior attachment of the soft palate to the pharyngeal wall is an interface between the neural crest- and mesoderm-derived mesenchyme in the craniofacial region, and thus can serve as a potential model for the study of boundaries during development. Taken together, our study provides a comprehensive view of the development and morphology of the murine soft palate and serves as a reference for further molecular analyses.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-12-17", "authors": ["AlexandreGrimaldi", "CarolinaParada", "YangChai"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0145018\n10.1016/j.cps.2013.12.010\n10.3389/fphys.2012.00488\n10.1242/dev.067082\n10.1242/dev.103093\n10.1369/0022155411427059\n10.1002/lary.24067\n10.1007/s00276-015-1444-5\n10.1038/ncomms2493\n10.1126/science.1192046\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.12.013\n10.1089/ten.TEB.2012.0049\n10.1159/000329253\n10.1002/bdrc.21075\n10.1128/MCB.00623-14\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.02.030\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.02.017"}

In the vaso-obliteration model (VO), rat pups were exposed to 80% O2 from postnatal day (P) 5 to P10. In the preretinal neovascularization (NV) model, rat pups were exposed to cycling O2 (50% and 10%) from P1 to P14, followed by room air until P18. Animals were intravitreally or orally treated with BIBF1120. Retinal vasculature, VO, and NV were evaluated in retinal flat mounts. Retinal expression of VEGF, Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), Netrin-1, Ephrin-B2, and EphB4 was analyzed by quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis.\nBIBF1120 interfered with normal retinal vascular development and microvessel branching in the aortic assay. However, in VO model BIBF1120 did not accrue VO. On the contrary, in the NV model BIBF1120 accelerated normal retinal vascularization and robustly diminished preretinal neovascularization compared to vehicle (by ~80%). The expression levels of VEGF negative regulator Dll4 and repulsive cues EphrinB2 and EphB4 mRNA in the retina of vehicle-treated OIR animals were markedly increased compared to normoxia, but were normalized by BIBF1120.\nData reveal efficacy of BIBF1120 on preretinal neovascularization and, of greater interest, on acceleration of normal vascularization, consistent with interference of major repulsive cues expressed in the retina during OIR.

To model the human condition, a high-fat Western diet that includes liquid sugar consumption has been used in mice. Even though liver pathophysiology has been well characterized in the model, little is known about the metabolic phenotype (e.g., energy expenditure, activity, or food intake). Furthermore, whether the consumption of liquid sugar exacerbates the development of glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and adipose tissue dysfunction in the model is currently in question. In our study, a high-fat Western diet (HFWD) with liquid sugar [fructose and sucrose (F/S)] induced acute hyperphagia above that observed in HFWD-fed mice, yet without changes in energy expenditure. Liquid sugar (F/S) exacerbated HFWD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance and impaired the storage capacity of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). Hepatic TG, plasma alanine aminotransferase, and normalized liver weight were significantly increased only in HFWD+F/S-fed mice. HFWD+F/S also resulted in increased hepatic fibrosis and elevated collagen 1a2, collagen 3a1, and TGF\u03b2 gene expression. Furthermore, HWFD+F/S-fed mice developed more profound eWAT inflammation characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy, macrophage infiltration, a dramatic increase in crown-like structures, and upregulated proinflammatory gene expression. An early hypoxia response in the eWAT led to reduced vascularization and increased fibrosis gene expression in the HFWD+F/S-fed mice.

The laser parameters were: power output 60\u2009mW for both lasers, 40\u2009J/cm(2) of energy density, total energy 1.1\u2009J, power density 2.14\u2009W/cm(2), and application time 18.6\u2009sec. This study evaluated the vascular constitution of healthy and injured calcaneous tendons. The tendons of each animal were processed to be embedded in Paraplast and, after that, they were divided into three parts: proximal, medial, and distal. Afterwards, they were cut in slices of 6\u2009\u03bcm were made, then they were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Using an ocular lens reticulated with magnification\u2009\u00d7\u2009400, we analyzed the number and the area density of the blood vessels using morphometric methods. Data were analyzed with the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by Tukey, considering p as <0.05.\nThe area density and the number of blood vessels in the proximal part were 36% and 42%, respectively, of the values found in the medial part. The distal part had 64% more vessels and 52.8% more area density (p < 0.05) than the medial part.\nLow-level laser therapy (LLLT) had no effect on the studied parameters. The vascularization of rat tendon is similar to that of humans, which contributes to the studies of therapies that have been applied in humans.", "journal": "Photomedicine and laser surgery", "date": "2015-12-17", "authors": ["RafaelaFerreira", "RosangelaSilva", "Roberta A CFolha", "Maria Luiza OPolacow", "Rosana MacherTeodori", "Carlos EduardoPinfildi"], "doi": "10.1089/pho.2015.3974"}
{"title": "[Role of tumour cell invasion/migration in the vascularisation of experimental lung metastases].", "abstract": "Treatment of patients with lung metastases remains a major challenge. A possible target for therapies is the inhibition of vascularization of metastases. Our study aimed to determine the possible mechanisms of the experimental lung metastasis vascularisation for tumours of various origins. We created lung metastases by intravenous injection of five tumour cell lines (HT1080, HT25, B16, C26 and MATB). Each cell line showed the same vascularisation type. Tumours gained vasculature by advancing through the alveolar spaces thereby incorporating the pre-existing alveolar capillaries (i.e. vessel co-option). From the alveolar spaces tumours entered into the alveolar walls. The tumour cells during the invasion/migration separated the pneumocytes from the capillaries. During this process the basement membrane was split into an epithelial and an endothelial layer. The heavily compressed pneumocytes inside the tumour became fragmented but the incorporated and stripped vessels remained functional, so they were able to provide blood supply for the metastases.\nNapjainkban is nagy kih\u00edv\u00e1st jelent a t\u00fcd\u00f5\u00e1tt\u00e9tes betegek kezel\u00e9se.

While restoration of median nerve sensation is consistently reported, recovery of significant motor function is less frequently observed. The authors report a case involving a previously healthy man who sustained upper arm segmental median and ulnar nerve injuries and, after failure of sural nerve grafts, was treated with a pedicled vascularized ulnar nerve graft to restore median nerve function. Long-term follow-up showed near full fist, with 12 kg of grip strength, key pinch with 1.5 kg of strength and protective sensation in the median nerve distribution. The present case demonstrates that pedicled ulnar vascularized nerve grafts can provide significant improvements to median nerve sensory and motor function in a heavily scarred environment.\nUne greffe du nerf cubital vascularis\u00e9 pour reconduire le nerf m\u00e9dian est une solution viable lorsque le nerf cubital ne peut pas \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9.

{"title": "Hypoxia Created Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Sheet for Prevascularized 3D Tissue Construction.", "abstract": "3D tissue based on human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) sheets offers many interesting opportunities for regenerating multiple types of connective tissues. Prevascularizing hMSC sheets with endothelial cells (ECs) will improve 3D tissue performance by supporting cell survival and accelerating integration with host tissue. It is hypothesized that hypoxia cultured hMSC sheets can promote microvessel network formation and preserve stemness of hMSCs. This study investigates the vascularization of hMSC sheets under different oxygen tensions. It is found that the HN condition, in which hMSC sheets formed under physiological hypoxia (2% O2 ) and then cocultured with ECs under normoxia (20% O2 ), enables longer and more branched microvessel network formation. The observation is corroborated by higher levels of angiogenic factors in coculture medium. Additionally, the hypoxic hMSC sheet is more uniform and less defective, which facilitates fabrication of 3D prevascularized tissue construct by layering the prevascularized hMSC sheets and maturing in rotating wall vessel bioreactor. The hMSCs in the 3D construct still maintain multilineage differentiation ability, which indicates the possible application of the 3D construct for various connective tissues regeneration. These results demonstrate that hypoxia created hMSC sheets benefit the microvessel growth and it is feasible to construct 3D prevascularized tissue construct using the prevascularized hMSC sheets.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["LijunZhang", "QiXing", "ZichenQian", "MitchellTahtinen", "ZhaoqiangZhang", "EmilyShearier", "ShaohaiQi", "FengZhao"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201500744"}
{"title": "Allogeneic adipose-derived stem cells promote survival of fat grafts in immunocompetent diabetic rats.", "abstract": "Autologous adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) can protect fat grafts in cell-assisted lipotransfer (CAL). However, diabetes alters the intrinsic properties of ADSCs and impairs their function so that they lack these protective effects. We investigate whether allogeneic ADSCs from healthy donors could protect fat grafts in immunocompetent diabetic rats. Syngeniec adipose tissues and ADSCs were derived from diabetic Lewis (LEW) rats, whereas allogeneic ADSCs were from healthy brown-Norway rats. A grafted mixture containing 0.7\u00a0ml granule fat and 0.3\u00a0ml 6\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6) allogeneic/syngeneic ADSCs was injected subcutaneously on the skulls of diabetic LEW rats. Fat samples were harvested to evaluate the levels of injury and vascularization as shown by perilipin A, CD34 and VEGF at 14\u00a0days. The immune response was evaluated with a lymphocytotoxicity test and the CD4/CD8 ratio in peripheral blood at 14\u00a0days. The volume retention of fat grafts was measured at 3\u00a0months. Healthy allogeneic ADSCs increased the expression levels of perilipin A, CD34 and VEGF at 14\u00a0days. The volume retention of fat grafts was improved by allogeneic ADSCs at 3\u00a0months. ADSCs were demonstrated to have low immunogenicity by the lymphocyte proliferation test and immunophenotype including MHC and co-stimulatory markers. The lymphocytotoxicity test and CD4/CD8 ratio indicated no obvious immune response elicited by allogeneic ADSCs. Thus, healthy allogeneic ADSCs can promote the survival of fat grafts in this immunocompetent diabetic rat model, with little or no obvious immune rejection.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["JunZhang", "XiaozhiBai", "BinZhao", "YunchuanWang", "LinlinSu", "PengChang", "XujieWang", "ShichaoHan", "JianxinGao", "XiaolongHu", "DahaiHu", "XiaoyanLiu"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-015-2334-1"}

Achieving a partial nephrectomy without renal ischemia and limiting operative bleeding is the subject of numerous researches. Since 2010, hybrid operating rooms have been used to perform both interventional radiology and surgical procedures at the same place and time. We used this latest technology to treat 3 patients with localized kidney tumors. The tumors were of moderate complexity and all were treated after immediate hyperselective embolization by laparoscopic surgery without dissection and clamping of the renal pedicle. The embolization of tumor vessels could be performed using image-stitching software. After embolization, operative time was 50, 70 and 80 minutes and blood loss was less than 100 ml for each case. Postoperative control 3D arteriography confirmed the respect of the vascularization of the healthy renal parenchyma. No postoperative complications occurred. Combined approach including hyperselective embolization and partial nephrectomy in the same time in a dedicated operating room is a new approach of zero ischemia during partial nephrectomy which reduces the difficulty of the surgery, limits injury to the kidney and increases patient safety.", "journal": "Journal of surgical oncology", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["PierreBigot", "AntoineBouvier", "PaulPanayotopoulos", "ChristopheAub\u00e9", "Abdel Rahm\u00e8neAzzouzi"], "doi": "10.1002/jso.24120"}
{"title": "Self-contained image mapping of placental vasculature in 3D ultrasound-guided fetoscopy.", "abstract": "Surgical navigation technology directed at fetoscopic procedures is relatively underdeveloped compared with other forms of endoscopy. The narrow fetoscopic field of views and the vast vascular network on the placenta make examination and photocoagulation treatment of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome challenging. Though ultrasonography is used for intraoperative guidance, its navigational ability is not fully exploited. This work aims to integrate 3D ultrasound imaging and endoscopic vision seamlessly for placental vasculature mapping through a self-contained framework without external navigational devices.\nThis is achieved through development, integration, and experimentation of novel navigational modules. Firstly, a framework design that addresses the current limitations based on identified gaps is conceptualized. Secondly, integration of navigational modules including (1) ultrasound-based localization, (2) image alignment, and (3) vision-based tracking to update the scene texture map is implemented. This updated texture map is projected to an ultrasound-constructed 3D model for photorealistic texturing of the 3D scene creating a panoramic view of the moving fetoscope. In addition, a collaborative scheme for the integration of the modular workflow system is proposed to schedule updates in a systematic fashion. Finally, experiments are carried out to evaluate each modular variation and an integrated collaborative scheme of the framework.\nThe modules and the collaborative scheme are evaluated through a series of phantom experiments with controlled trajectories for repeatability. The collaborative framework demonstrated the best accuracy (5.2\u00a0% RMS error) compared with all the three single-module variations during the experiment. Validation on an ex vivo monkey placenta shows visual continuity of the freehand fetoscopic panorama.\nThe proposed developed collaborative framework and the evaluation study of the framework variations provide analytical insights for effective integration of ultrasonography and endoscopy. This contributes to the development of navigation techniques in fetoscopic procedures and can potentially be extended to other applications in intraoperative imaging.", "journal": "Surgical endoscopy", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["LiangjingYang", "JunchenWang", "TakehiroAndo", "AkihiroKubota", "HiromasaYamashita", "IchiroSakuma", "ToshioChiba", "EtsukoKobayashi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00464-015-4690-z"}

{"title": "Differential expression of mitotic regulators and tumor microenvironment influences the regional growth pattern of solid sarcoma along the cranio-caudal axis.", "abstract": "Soft tissue sarcomas are relatively rare, unusual, anatomically diverse group of malignancies. According to the recent literature and medical bulletins, tumor growth and aggressiveness immensely relies on its anatomical locations. However, it is unclear whether the cranio-caudal anatomical axis of the mammalian body can influence sarcoma development and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet deciphered. Here, we investigated the growth pattern of solid sarcoma implanted into the murine cranial and caudal anatomical locations and tried to explore the location specific expression pattern of crucial mammalian mitotic regulators such as Aurora kinase A, Histone H3 and c-Myc in the cranio-caudally originated solid tumors. In addition, the influence of local tumor microenvironment on regional sarcoma growth was also taken into consideration. We found that solid sarcoma developed differentially when implanted into two different anatomical locations and most notably, enhanced tumor growth was observed in case of cranially implanted sarcoma than the caudal sarcoma. Interestingly, Aurora kinase A and c-Myc expression and histone H3 phosphorylation level were comparatively higher in the cranial tumor than the caudal. In addition, variation of tumor stroma in a location specific manner also facilitated tumor growth. Cranial sarcoma microenvironment was well vascularized than the caudal one and consequently, a significantly higher microvessel density count was observed which was parallel with low hypoxic response with sign of local tumor inflammation in this region. Taken together, our findings suggest that differential gradient of mitotic regulators together with varied angiogenic response and local tumor microenvironment largely controls solid sarcoma growth along the cranio-caudal anatomical axis.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["SukalpaChattopadhyay", "MalayChaklader", "RitamChatterjee", "AdityaLaw", "SujataLaw"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2015.11.027"}
{"title": "Reck enables cerebrovascular development by promoting canonical Wnt signaling.", "abstract": "The cerebral vasculature provides the massive blood supply that the brain needs to grow and survive. By acquiring distinctive cellular and molecular characteristics it becomes the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a selectively permeable and protective interface between the brain and the peripheral circulation that maintains the extracellular milieu permissive for neuronal activity. Accordingly, there is great interest in uncovering the mechanisms that modulate the formation and differentiation of the brain vasculature. By performing a forward genetic screen in zebrafish we isolated no food for thought (nft\u2009(y72)), a recessive late-lethal mutant that lacks most of the intracerebral central arteries (CtAs), but not other brain blood vessels. We found that the cerebral vascularization deficit of nft\u2009(y72) mutants is caused by an inactivating lesion in reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs [reck; also known as suppressor of tumorigenicity 15 protein (ST15)], which encodes a membrane-anchored tumor suppressor glycoprotein. Our findings highlight Reck as a novel and pivotal modulator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway that acts in endothelial cells to enable intracerebral vascularization and proper expression of molecular markers associated with BBB formation. Additional studies with cultured endothelial cells suggest that, in other contexts, Reck impacts vascular biology via the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) cascade.

{"title": "Putative CD133+ melanoma cancer stem cells induce initial angiogenesis in vivo.", "abstract": "Tumor angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis, and is regulated by a complex network of various types of cells, chemokines, and stimulating factors. In contrast to sprouting angiogenesis, tumor angiogenesis is also influenced by hypoxia, inflammation, and the attraction of bone-marrow-derived cells. Recently, cancer stem cells have been reported to mimic vascularization by differentiating into endothelial cells and inducing vessel formation. In this study, the influence of cancer stem cells on initial angiogenesis was evaluated for the metastatic melanoma cell line D10. Following flow cytometry, CD133+ and CD133- cells were isolated using magnetic cell separation and different cell fractions were transferred to porcine gelatin sponges, which were implanted into the dorsal skinfold chamber of immunocompromised mice. Angiogenesis was analyzed based on microvessel density over a 10-day period using in vivo fluorescence microscopy, and the results were verified using immunohistology. CD133+ D10 cells showed a significant induction of early angiogenesis in vivo, contrary to CD133- D10 cells, unsorted D10 cells, and negative control. Neovascularization was confirmed by visualizing endothelial cells by immunohistology using an anti-CD31 antibody. Because CD133+ cells are rare in clinical specimens and hardly amenable to functional assays, the D10 cell line provides a suitable model to study the angiogenic potential of putative cancer stem cells and the leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction in the dorsal skinfold chamber in vivo. This cancer stem cell model might be useful in the development and evaluation of therapeutic agents targeting tumors.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["R\u00fcdiger MZimmerer", "PeterMatthiesen", "FritjofKreher", "AndreasKampmann", "SimonSpalthoff", "PhilippJehn", "GidoBittermann", "Nils-ClaudiusGellrich", "FrankTavassol"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2015.12.001"}
{"title": "Multiple Beneficial Roles of Repressor of Estrogen Receptor Activity (REA) in Suppressing the Progression of Endometriosis.", "abstract": "Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent, inflammation-driven gynecologic disorder in which endometrial tissue creates inflammatory lesions at extrauterine sites, leading to pelvic pain and impaired fertility. Although dysregulated estrogen receptor (ER) signaling has been implicated, understanding of this disease is incomplete and current therapies are of limited benefit. Using an immunocompetent syngeneic murine model, we used combinations of donor uterine tissue and/or recipient host mice with partial genetic deletion of the ER coregulator, repressor of ER activity (REA) (also known as prohibitin 2), to investigate roles of REA in the contributions of donor uterine tissue and host cell influences on endometriosis establishment and progression. Ectopic lesions derived from donor tissue with half the wild-type gene dosage of REA (REA(+/-)) grown in REA(+/-) hosts displayed enhanced proliferation, vascularization, and markedly increased neuron innervation and inflammatory responses, including elevated cytokine production, nuclear factor kappa B activation, cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and immune cell infiltration. Although lesion progression was greatest when REA was reduced in both donor tissue and host animals, other donor/host combinations indicated that distinct stimulatory inputs were derived from ectopic tissue (proliferative signals) and host cells (inflammatory signals). Importantly, depletion of REA in primary human endometriotic stromal cells led to elevated proliferation and expression of cell cycle regulators. Notably, REA was significantly lower in human endometriotic tissue versus normal human endometrium. Thus, REA modulates cross talk among multiple cell types in the uterine tissue and host background, serving as a brake on the estradiol-ER axis and restraining multiple aspects that contribute to the pathologic progression of endometriosis.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["YuechaoZhao", "YiruChen", "YeKuang", "Milan KBagchi", "Robert NTaylor", "John AKatzenellenbogen", "Benita SKatzenellenbogen"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2015-1324"}

The bone healing process and vascularization depend upon the endothelial cells, which speed up implant osteointegration. Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPC) are a population of stem cells that can reproduce, migrate and acquire mature endothelial phenotype. Their recruitment occurs in the tissue lesion to enhance neovascularization. Trabecular TitaniumTM (TTTM) is a new biomaterial with very interesting biomechanical characteristics and fast osteointegration. This study has investigated adhesion, proliferation and characteristics of EPC on three types of biomaterial: unmodified trabecular titanium, trabecular titanium coated with the ECM deposited by human mesenchymal stem cells isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue and decellularized and trabecular titanium coated with type I collagen (control scaffold). MTT assay showed similar percentages of EPCs seeded on the different kinds of scaffold: 67% on TT, 70% on decellularized scaffolds and 82% on collagen-coated scaffolds. There were no statistically significant differences between the three groups. We therefore conclude that TTTM allows EPC adhesion and proliferation and, consequently, by permitting vascularization, it favours prosthesis osteointegration.", "journal": "Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["GGastaldi", "LCaliogna", "LBotta", "MGhiara", "FBenazzo"], "doi": null}

The recipient cornea typically displays a highly vascularized pannus that must be dissected before graft placement. Extensive pannus dissection, however, can result in corneal thinning and increase the risk of ectasia and ultimately, of perforation. We aimed to examine the value of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) intraoperatively during pannus resection and long-term postoperative follow-up of CLET surgery.\nThis was a prospective observational case series.\nThis study was performed on 8 eyes of 8 patients who underwent CLET surgery. Intraoperative OCT was performed before dissection and at several time points during dissection and after placement of the ex vivo cultivated graft. During the postoperative follow-up period, OCT was performed to image the graft integration and corneal thickness.\nAnterior segment optical coherence tomography provided high-resolution images of the corneal pannus, including the blood vessel lumen. Imaging of the pannus depth and cleavage plane was possible intraoperatively, with the patient supine. Postoperative imaging displayed the transplanted graft, temporary amniotic membrane patch, and overlying bandage contact lens. The grafts were also visible after removal of the temporary membrane patch. Four months postoperatively, the grafts were integrated into the cornea, and all 8 participants showed the presence of an epithelial layer.\nDuring CLET surgery, AS-OCT offers a noncontact method for rapid, intraoperative scanning and pachymetry mapping.

{"title": "Anastomotic leakage in rectal cancer surgery: The role of blood perfusion.", "abstract": "Anastomotic leakage after anterior resection for rectal cancer remains a common and often devastating complication. Preoperative risk factors for anastomotic leakage have been studied extensively and are used for patient selection, especially whether to perform a diverting stoma or not. From the current literature, data suggest that perfusion in the rectal stump rather than in the colonic limb may be more important for the integrity of the colorectal anastomosis. Moreover, available research suggests that the mid and upper rectum is considerably more vascularized than the lower part, in which the posterior compartment seems most vulnerable. These data fit neatly with the observation that anastomotic leaks are far more frequent in patients undergoing total compared to partial mesorectal excision, and also that most leaks occur dorsally. Clinical judgment has been shown to ineffectively assess anastomotic viability, while promising methods to measure blood perfusion are evolving. Much interest has recently been turned to near-infrared light technology, enhanced with fluorescent agents, which enables intraoperative perfusion assessment. Preliminary data are promising, but large-scale controlled trials are lacking. With maturation of such technology, perfusion measurements may in the future inform the surgeon whether anastomoses are at risk. In high colorectal anastomoses, anastomotic revision might be feasible, while a diverting stoma could be fashioned selectively instead of routinely for low anastomoses.", "journal": "World journal of gastrointestinal surgery", "date": "2015-12-10", "authors": ["MartinRuteg\u00e5rd", "J\u00f6rgenRuteg\u00e5rd"], "doi": "10.4240/wjgs.v7.i11.289"}

{"title": "Placental growth factor deficiency is associated with impaired cerebral vascular development in mice.", "abstract": "Placental growth factor (PGF) is expressed in the developing mouse brain and contributes to vascularization and vessel patterning.\nPGF is dynamically expressed in fetal mouse brain, particularly forebrain, and is essential for normal cerebrovascular development.\nPGF rises in maternal plasma over normal human and mouse pregnancy but is low in many women with the acute onset hypertensive syndrome, pre-eclampsia (PE). Little is known about the expression of PGF in the fetus during PE. Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) mice appear normal but recently cerebral vascular defects were documented in adult Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) mice.\nHere, temporal-spatial expression of PGF is mapped in normal fetal mouse brains and cerebral vasculature development is compared between normal and congenic Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) fetuses to assess the actions of PGF during cerebrovascular development. Pgf/PGF, Vegfa/VEGF, Vegf receptor (Vegfr)1 and Vegfr2 expression were examined in the brains of embryonic day (E)12.5, 14.5, 16.5 and 18.5 C57BL/6 (B6) mice using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. The cerebral vasculature was compared between Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) and B6 embryonic and adult brains using whole mount techniques. Vulnerability to cerebral ischemia was investigated using a left common carotid ligation assay.\nPgf/PGF and Vegfr1 are highly expressed in E12.5-14.5 forebrain relative to VEGF and Vegfr2. Vegfa/VEGF is relatively more abundant in hindbrain (HB). PGF and VEGF expression were similar in midbrain. Delayed HB vascularization was seen at E10.5 and 11.5 in Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) brains. At E14.5, Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) circle of Willis showed unilateral hypoplasia and fewer collateral vessels, defects that persisted post-natally. Functionally, adult Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) mice experienced cerebral ischemia after left common carotid arterial occlusion while B6 mice did not.\nSince Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) mice were used, consequences of complete absence of maternal and fetal PGF were defined. Therefore, the effects of maternal versus fetal PGF deficiency on cerebrovascular development cannot be separated. However, as PGF was strongly expressed in the developing brain at all timepoints, we suggest that local PGF has a more important role than distant maternal or placental sources. Full PGF loss is not expected in PE pregnancies, predicting that the effects of PGF deficiency identified in this model will be more severe than any effects in PE-offspring.\nThese studies provoke the question of whether PGF expression is decreased and cerebral vascular maldevelopment occurs in fetuses who experience a preeclamptic gestation. These individuals have already been reported to have elevated risk for stroke and cognitive impairments.\nN/A.\nThis work was supported by awards from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the Canada Research Chairs Program and the Canadian Foundation for Innovation to B.A.C. and by training awards from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Brazil to R.L.L.; Queen's University to V.R.K. and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to M.T.R.

{"title": "Enhanced brain distribution of carboplatin in a primate model after blood-brain barrier disruption using an implantable ultrasound device.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma is both the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Carboplatin chemotherapy has shown only modest efficacy in progressive high-grade gliomas. The limited clinical efficacy of carboplatin may be due to its low concentration in tissue when the drug is delivered intravenously. The aim of this study was to assess whether the tissue concentration of intravenously administered carboplatin could be enhanced by ultrasound-induced blood-brain disruption in a primate model.\nCarboplatin was administered intravenously for 60 min to a single primate following blood-brain barrier opening induced by an implantable ultrasound device. Blood and brain samples were collected after animal killing, which occurred 60 min after the end of carboplatin administration. Platinum quantification in ultrafiltrate plasma and brain samples was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.\nThe brain concentration of platinum was highly enhanced (5.2\u00d7) in the 3.9 cm(3) region sonicated by the US beam, with a higher concentration in more vascularized anatomical structures. At 5 and 10 mm from the US beam axis, platinum concentrations were slightly enhanced (2.2\u00d7 and 1.3\u00d7 respectively).\nThis study demonstrates that BBB opening using an implantable ultrasound transducer enhances the brain distribution of carboplatin in a loco-regional manner. Such a treatment approach is of significant interest for the treatment of primary brain tumors and is under current evaluation in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02253212).", "journal": "Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology", "date": "2015-12-10", "authors": ["LaurianeGoldwirt", "MichaelCanney", "CatherineHorodyckid", "JoelPoupon", "SamiaMourah", "AlexandreVignot", "Jean-YvesChapelon", "AlexandreCarpentier"], "doi": "10.1007/s00280-015-2930-5"}
{"title": "Role of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection and characterization of solid pancreatic nodules: An update.", "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the pancreas. The remaining pancreatic tumors are a diverse group of pancreatic neoplasms that comprises cystic pancreatic neoplasms, endocrine tumors and other uncommon pancreatic tumors. Due to the excellent soft tissue contrast resolution, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently able to readily separate cystic from noncystic tumors. Cystic tumors are often easy to diagnose with MRI; however, noncystic non-adenocarcinoma tumors may show a wide spectrum of imaging features, which can potentially mimic ductal adenocarcinoma. MRI is a reliable technique for the characterization of pancreatic lesions. The implementation of novel motion-resistant pulse sequences and respiratory gating techniques, as well as the recognized benefits of MR cholangiopancreatography, make MRI a very accurate examination for the evaluation of pancreatic masses. MRI has the distinctive ability of non-invasive assessment of the pancreatic ducts, pancreatic parenchyma, neighbouring soft tissues, and vascular network in one examination. MRI can identify different characteristics of various solid pancreatic lesions, potentially allowing the differentiation of adenocarcinoma from other benign and malignant entities. In this review we describe the MRI protocols and MRI characteristics of various solid pancreatic lesions. Recognition of these characteristics may establish the right diagnosis or at least narrow the differential diagnosis, thus avoiding unnecessary tests or procedures and permitting better management.", "journal": "World journal of radiology", "date": "2015-12-09", "authors": ["Najwa AlAnsari", "MiguelRamalho", "Richard CSemelka", "ValeriaBuonocore", "SilviaGigli", "FrancescaMaccioni"], "doi": "10.4329/wjr.v7.i11.361"}

The aim of this paper would be to give you an update in this new technology and to try to define its place in the diagnosis of cystic and solid pancreatic masses. The material used was a 19G EUS-needle in which the stylet was replaced by the Confocal mini-probe. The mini-probe (0.632 mm of diameter) is pre-loaded and screwed by a locking device in the EUS-Needle and guided endosonographically in the target. Regarding pancreatic cystic lesion, the presence of epithelial villous structures based on nCLE was associated with pancreatic cystic neoplasm (IPMN) (P = 0.004) and provided a sensitivity of 59%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 50%. A superficial vascular network pattern visualized on nCLE was identified in serous cystadenomas. It corresponded on pathological specimen to a dense and subepithelial capillary vascularization. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of this sign for the diagnosis of SCA were 87%, 69%, 100%, 100%, and 82%, respectively. In pancreatic adenocarcinomas, nCLE found vascular leakage with irregular vessels with leakage of fluorescein into the tumor, large dark clumps which correspond to humps of malignant cells. These criteria correlate with the histological structure of those tumors which are characterized by tumoral glands, surrounded by fibrosis in case of fibrous stroma tumor. Neuroendocrine tumors showed a dense network of small vessels on a dark background, which fits with the histological structure based on cord of cells surrounded by vessels and by fibrosis. nCLE is feasible during a EUS examination; these preliminary results are very encouraging and may be used in the future in case of inconclusive EUS-FNA.", "journal": "Endoscopic ultrasound", "date": "2015-12-09", "authors": ["MarcGiovannini"], "doi": "10.4103/2303-9027.170405"}
{"title": "Contribution of synovial lining cells to synovial vascularization of the rat temporomandibular joint.", "abstract": "The lining layer of the synovial membrane in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) contains two types of lining cells: macrophage-like type A and fibroblast-like type B cells. The type B cells are particularly heterogeneous in their morphology and immunoreactivity, so that details of their functions remain unclear. Some of the type B cells exhibit certain resemblances in their ultrastructure to those of an activated capillary pericyte at the initial stage of the angiogenesis. The articular surface, composed of cartilage and the disc in the TMJ, has few vasculatures, whereas the synovial lining layer is richly equipped with blood capillaries to produce the constituent of synovial fluid. The present study investigated at both the light and electron microscopic levels the immunocytochemical characteristics of the synovial lining cells in the adult rat TMJ, focusing on their contribution to the synovial vascularization. It also employed an intravascular perfusion with Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) lectin to identify functional vessels in\u00a0vivo. Results showed that several type B cells expressed desmin, a muscle-specific intermediate filament which is known as the earliest protein to appear during myogenesis as well as being a marker for the immature capillary pericyte. These desmin-positive type B cells showed immunoreactions for vimentin and pericyte markers (neuron-glial 2; NG2 and PDGFR\u03b2) but not for the other markers of myogenic cells (MyoD and myogenin) or a contractile apparatus (\u03b1SMA and caldesmon). Immunoreactivity for RECA-1, an endothelial marker, was observed in the macrophage-like type A cells. The arterioles and venules inside the synovial folds extended numerous capillaries with RECA-1-positive endothelial cells and desmin-positive pericytes to distribute densely in the lining layer. The distal portion of these capillaries showing RECA-1-immunoreactivity lacked lectin-staining, indicating a loss of blood-circulation due to sprouting or termination in the lining layer. The desmin-positive type B and RECA-1-positive type A cells attached to this portion of the capillaries. Some capillaries in the lining layer also expressed ninein, a marker for sprouting endothelial cells, called tip cells. Since an activated pericyte, macrophage and tip cell are known to act together at the forefront of the vessel sprout during angiogenesis, the desmin-positive type B cell and RECA-1-positive type A cell might serve as these angiogenic cells in the synovial lining layer. Tomato lectin perfusion following decalcification would be a highly useful tool for research on the vasculature of the mineralized tissue. Use of this technique combined with immunohistochemistry should permit future extensive investigations on the presence of the physiological angiogenesis and on the function of the lining cells in the synovial membrane.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2015-12-09", "authors": ["KayokoNozawa-Inoue", "FumikoHarada", "JinMagara", "AtsushiOhazama", "TakeyasuMaeda"], "doi": "10.1111/joa.12426\n10.1155/2014/732720"}

In 4 dogs (6 eyes), CAI treatment was discontinued. Three dogs (4 eyes) underwent enucleation because of end-stage corneal disease. One dog was treated differently in each eye and thus was represented in both aforementioned groups.\nFollowing initiation of treatment with a CAI (ie, brinzolamide or dorzolamide), the median time to development of severe ocular signs was 266 days (range, 133 to 679 days). Clinically severe ocular signs included ulcerative and nonulcerative perilimbal keratitis or severe diffuse keratitis with marked vascularization. The keratitis was refractory to treatment with anti-inflammatory medications. Histologic and immunohistochemical examination of enucleated globes was performed in 3 affected dogs and in 1 dog with keratitis that recovered. Corneal lesions included 2 distinct inflammatory infiltrates with plasma cells predominating in the anterior stroma and both T cells and neutrophils in the epithelium. Stromal plasma cells and overlying epithelium exhibited strong positive immunoreactivity for IgG.\nTopical CAI treatment was discontinued in 4 dogs after a median of 209 days (range, 44 to 433 days), and in these dogs, clinical improvement was evident within 2 to 4 days of CAI treatment cessation. Signs of keratitis resolved in 12 to 25 days in these 4 dogs, and median follow-up time after CAI discontinuation was 25.5 months (range, 6 to 42 months), during which time signs of corneal disease did not recur.\nOn the basis of this small series, presumed topical CAI-associated keratitis in dogs appeared to be an uncommon immune-mediated disease that was not responsive to corticosteroid treatment. Affected patients improved rapidly, but only after discontinuation of CAI treatment. In dogs with glaucoma, clinicians should consider the development of punctate keratopathy and severe diffuse keratitis as potential adverse effects related to topical administration of CAIs, even after previously uneventful long-term use.", "journal": "Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association", "date": "2015-12-08", "authors": ["BillieBeckwith-Cohen", "EllisonBentley", "David JGasper", "Gillian JMcLellan", "Richard RDubielzig"], "doi": "10.2460/javma.247.12.1419"}

We used a Lewis rat sarcoma model in which subcutaneous tumours developed after inoculation of the R5-28/clone C4 cells. Rats with tumour progression showed splenomegaly and anaemia. Tumour growth was associated with leucocytosis, granulocytosis, decrease in lymphocyte and CD161(+) population in peripheral blood and increase in serum MCP1 concentration. Animals with spontaneous regression of tumours initially showed an increase in white blood cells number and proportion of granulocytes. Between the 42nd and 49th day, however, values of these parameters dropped in correlation with reduction of tumour size. In spontaneously regressed tumours, vascularization was higher and on the contrary, progressive tumours had more necrotic areas with a high number of infiltrating granulocytes. In conclusion, progression and spontaneous regression of tumours in the Lewis rat sarcoma model is associated with distinct changes in populations of blood cells and immune cells which participate in these completely different processes of tumourigenesis.", "journal": "Anticancer research", "date": "2015-12-08", "authors": ["JanaKovalsk\u00e1", "RajbardhanMishra", "Luk\u00e1\u0161Jebav\u00fd", "PeterMakovick\u00fd", "JosefJanda", "DanielaPl\u00e1nsk\u00e1", "Monika\u010cervinkov\u00e1", "VratislavHor\u00e1k"], "doi": null}

We aimed to perform a comparative analysis of tumor cells and blood vessels from renal cell carcinoma on endostatin-treated and non-treated chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) implants by the assessment of endoglin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and smooth muscle actin expression. Endostatin triple action on tumor, endothelial and perivascular cells was observed in the present study. Differential impact of endostatin treatment on intratumor and peritumor blood vessels was noticed on the VEGF expression and behaviour of tumor cells between clear cell and papillary components of RCC. Based on our findings, a high tumor heterogenity response to endostatin has been highlighted. Interplay between VEGF, endoglin and endostatin in RCC could support a combined targeted therapy to improve prognosis of patients with RCC and reduce therapy resistance often developed by monotherapy.", "journal": "Anticancer research", "date": "2015-12-08", "authors": ["OvidiuFerician", "Anca MariaCimpean", "StefanaAvram", "MariusRaica"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Overcoming physical constraints in bone engineering: 'the importance of being vascularized'.", "abstract": "Bone plays several physiological functions and is the second most commonly transplanted tissue after blood. Since the treatment of large bone defects is still unsatisfactory, researchers have endeavoured to obtain scaffolds able to release growth and differentiation factors for mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts and endothelial cells in order to obtain faster mineralization and prompt a reliable vascularization. Nowadays, the application of osteoblastic cultures spans from cell physiology and pharmacology to cytocompatibility measurement and osteogenic potential evaluation of novel biomaterials. To overcome the simple traditional monocultures in\u00a0vitro, co-cultures of osteogenic and vasculogenic precursors were introduced with very interesting results. Increasingly complex culture systems have been developed, where cells are seeded on proper scaffolds and stimulated so as to mimic the physiological conditions more accurately. These bioreactors aim at enabling bone regeneration by incorporating different cells types into bio-inspired materials within a surveilled habitat.

{"title": "Desert Hedgehog/Patch2 Axis Contributes to Vascular Permeability and Angiogenesis in Glioblastoma.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) constitutes the most common and the most aggressive type of human tumors affecting the central nervous system. Prognosis remains dark due to the inefficiency of current treatments and the rapid relapse. Paralleling other human tumors, GBM contains a fraction of tumor initiating cells with the capacity to self-renew, initiate and maintain the tumor mass. These cells were found in close proximity to brain vasculature, suggesting functional interactions between brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) and endothelial cells within the so-called vascular niche. However, the mechanisms by which these cells impact on the endothelium plasticity and function remain unclear. Using culture of BTICs isolated from a cohort of 14 GBM patients, we show that BTICs secretome promotes brain endothelial cell remodeling in a VEGF-independent manner. Gene array analysis unmasked that BTICs-released factors drove the expression of Ptch2 in endothelial cells. Interestingly, BTICs produce desert hedgehog (DHH) ligand, enabling a paracrine DHH/Ptch2 signaling cascade that conveys elevated permeability and angiogenesis. Finally, DHH silencing in BTICs dramatically reduced tumor growth, as well as vascularization and intra-tumor permeability. Collectively, our data unveil a role for DHH in exacerbated tumor angiogenesis and permeability, which may ultimately favor glioblastoma growth, and thus place the DHH/Ptch2 nexus as a molecular target for novel therapies.", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2015-12-05", "authors": ["SandyAzzi", "LucasTreps", "H\u00e9lo\u00efse MLeclair", "Hai-MiNgo", "ElizabethHarford-Wright", "JulieGavard"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2015.00281\n10.1016/B978-0-12-394622-5.00002-X\n10.1242/dev.110056\n10.1126/science.1206936\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016001\n10.1038/nature05236\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0166\n10.1016/j.intimp.2005.08.004\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.034\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.11.020\n10.1038/nrd3455\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.021\n10.1056/NEJMoa1308345\n10.1016/j.devcel.2015.09.008\n10.1182/blood-2013-05-504019\n10.1371/journal.pone.0045562\n10.1016/0092-8674(93)90627-3\n10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80221-X\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1736\n10.1038/nm.3328\n10.1146/annurev.med.57.121304.131306\n10.1038/embor.2011.39\n10.1038/ncb1486\n10.1038/nrn2175\n10.1016/j.ccr.2014.01.008\n10.1002/stem.1955\n10.1186/s12860-014-0038-0\n10.3892/ijmm.19.3.445\n10.1242/jcs.108282\n10.1038/nrm1911\n10.1126/science.1254257\n10.3390/cancers7030867\n10.1038/nature09557\n10.1016/0092-8674(93)90626-2\n10.1038/nature03128\n10.1093/hmg/8.2.291\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0814\n10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70025-7\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2015.61\n10.1038/onc.2015.317\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.12.020\n10.1038/sj.onc.1201340\n10.1038/nature09624\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.11.012\n10.1097/MPA.0000000000000532"}

{"title": "Endothelial Rictor is crucial for midgestational development and sustained and extensive FGF2-induced neovascularization in the adult.", "abstract": "To explore the general requirement of endothelial mTORC2 during embryonic and adolescent development, we knocked out the essential mTORC2 component Rictor in the mouse endothelium in the embryo, during adolescence and in endothelial cells in vitro. During embryonic development, Rictor knockout resulted in growth retardation and lethality around embryonic day 12. We detected reduced peripheral vascularization and delayed ossification of developing fingers, toes and vertebrae during this confined midgestational period. Rictor knockout did not affect viability, weight gain, and vascular development during further adolescence. However during this period, Rictor knockout prevented skin capillaries to gain larger and heterogeneously sized diameters and remodeling into tortuous vessels in response to FGF2. Rictor knockout strongly reduced extensive FGF2-induced neovascularization and prevented hemorrhage in FGF2-loaded matrigel plugs. Rictor knockout also disabled the formation of capillary-like networks by FGF2-stimulated mouse aortic endothelial cells in vitro. Low RICTOR expression was detected in quiescent, confluent mouse aortic endothelial cells, whereas high doses of FGF2 induced high RICTOR expression that was associated with strong mTORC2-specific protein kinase C\u03b1 and AKT phosphorylation.

{"title": "Keratins 17 and 19 expression as prognostic markers in oral squamous cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "Five-year survival rates for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are 30% and the mortality rate is 50%. Immunohistochemistry panels are used to evaluate proliferation, vascularization, apoptosis, HPV infection, and keratin expression, which are important markers of malignant progression. Keratins are a family of intermediate filaments predominantly expressed in epithelial cells and have an essential role in mechanical support and cytoskeleton formation, which is essential for the structural integrity and stability of the cell. In this study, we analyzed the expressions of keratins 17 and 19 (K17 and K19) by immunohistochemistry in tumoral and non-tumoral tissues from patients with OSCC. The results show that expression of these keratins is higher in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. Positive K17 expression correlates with lymph node metastasis and multivariate analysis confirmed this relationship, revealing a 6-fold increase in lymph node metastasis when K17 is expressed. We observed a correlation between K17 expression with disease-free survival and disease-specific death in patients who received surgery and radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that low expression of K17 was an independent marker for early disease relapse and disease-specific death in patients treated with surgery and radiotherapy, with an approximately 4-fold increased risk when compared to high K17 expression.

{"title": "Mast Cell Proteases 6 and 7 Stimulate Angiogenesis by Inducing Endothelial Cells to Release Angiogenic Factors.", "abstract": "Mast cell proteases are thought to be involved with tumor progression and neo-vascularization. However, their exact role is still unclear. The present study was undertaken to further elucidate the function of specific subtypes of recombinant mouse mast cell proteases (rmMCP-6 and 7) in neo-vascularization. SVEC4-10 cells were cultured on Geltrex\u00ae with either rmMCP-6 or 7 and tube formation was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, the capacity of these proteases to induce the release of angiogenic factors and pro and anti-angiogenic proteins was analyzed. Both rmMCP-6 and 7 were able to stimulate tube formation. Scanning electron microscopy showed that incubation with the proteases induced SVEC4-10 cells to invade the gel matrix.

{"title": "The Whitening of Brown Fat and Its Implications for Weight Management in Obesity.", "abstract": "Systemic inflammation resulting from dysfunction of white adipose tissue (WAT) accelerates the pathologies of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast to WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is abundant in mitochondria that produce heat by uncoupling respiratory chain process of ATP synthesis. Besides BAT's role in thermogenesis, accumulating evidence has shown that it is involved in regulating systemic metabolism. Studies have analyzed the \"browning\" processes of WAT as a means to combat obesity, whereas few studies have focused on the impact and molecular mechanisms that contribute to obesity-linked BAT dysfunction--a process that is associated with the \"whitening\" of this tissue. Compared to WAT, a dense vascular network is required to support the high energy consumption of BAT. Recently, vascular rarefaction was shown to be a significant causal factor in the whitening of BAT in mouse models. Vascular insufficiency leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and loss in BAT and contributes to systemic insulin resistance. These data suggest that BAT \"whitening,\" resulting from vascular dysfunction, can impact obesity and obesity-linked diseases.

Hypothetically, a laboratory grown autologous skin analog with near normal architecture might be a suitable approach to yield both satisfactory functional and cosmetic long-term results. In this study, we explored the use of human endothelial cells derived from freshly isolated adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture model of vascularized bio-engineered skin substitute.\nThe SVF was isolated from human white adipose tissue samples and keratinocytes from human skin biopsies. The SVF, in particular endothelial cells, were characterized using flow cytometry and immuofluorescence analysis. Endothelial and mesenchymal progenitors from the SVF formed blood capillaries after seeding into a 3D collagen type I hydrogel in vitro. Subsequently, human keratinocytes were seeded on the top of those hydrogels to develop a vascularized dermo-epidermal skin substitute.\nFlow cytometric analysis of surface markers of the freshly isolated SVF showed the expression of endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, CD146), mesenchymal/stromal cell-associated markers (CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105), stem cell markers (CD49f, CD117, CD133), and additionally hematopoietic markers (CD14, CD15, CD45). Further analysis of white adipose-derived endothelial cells (watECs) revealed the co-expression of CD31, CD34, CD90, CD105, and partially CD146 on these cells. WatECs were separated from adipose-stromal cells (watASCs) using FACS sorting. WatASCs and watECs cultured separately in a 3D hydrogel for 3\u00a0weeks did not form any vascular structures. Only if co-cultured, both cell types aligned to develop a ramified vascular network in vitro with continuous endothelial lumen formation. Transplantation of those 3D-hydrogels onto immuno-incompetent rats resulted in a rapid connection of human capillaries with the host vessels and formation of functional, blood-perfused mosaic human-rat vessels within only 3-4\u00a0days.\nAdipose tissue represents an attractive cell source due to the ease of isolation and abundance of endothelial as well as mesenchymal cell lineages.

The course is usually self-limiting and in most cases resolves spontaneously within a 3-month period, with visual acuity usually recovering to 20/30 or better. However, chronic CSC may develop as a consequence of recurrences or persistent neurosensory detachment, and can result in progressive RPE atrophy and permanent visual loss.

{"title": "Automatic tracking of vessel-like structures from a single starting point.", "abstract": "The identification of vascular networks is an important topic in the medical image analysis community. While most methods focus on single vessel tracking, the few solutions that exist for tracking complete vascular networks are usually computationally intensive and require a lot of user interaction. In this paper we present a method to track full vascular networks iteratively using a single starting point. Our approach is based on a cloud of sampling points distributed over concentric spherical layers. We also proposed a vessel model and a metric of how well a sample point fits this model. Then, we implement the network tracking as a min-cost flow problem, and propose a novel optimization scheme to iteratively track the vessel structure by inherently handling bifurcations and paths. The method was tested using both synthetic and real images. On the 9 different data-sets of synthetic blood vessels, we achieved maximum accuracies of more than 98%. We further use the synthetic data-set to analyze the sensibility of our method to parameter setting, showing the robustness of the proposed algorithm. For real images, we used coronary, carotid and pulmonary data to segment vascular structures and present the visual results. Still for real images, we present numerical and visual results for networks of nerve fibers in the olfactory system. Further visual results also show the potential of our approach for identifying vascular networks topologies. The presented method delivers good results for the several different datasets tested and have potential for segmenting vessel-like structures. Also, the topology information, inherently extracted, can be used for further analysis to computed aided diagnosis and surgical planning.

While the success in producing tissue-specific units and organoids has been remarkable, the maintenance of an aggregation of such units in vitro is still a major challenge. While cell cultures are maintained by diffusion of oxygen and nutrients, three- dimensional in vitro organoids are generally limited in lifespan, size, and maturation due to the lack of a vascular system. Several groups have attempted to improve vascularization of organoids. Upon transplantation into a host, ramification of blood supply of host origin was observed within these organoids. Moreover, sustained circulation allows cells of an in vitro established renal organoid to mature and gain functionality in terms of absorption, secretion and filtration. Thus, the coordination of tissue differentiation and vascularization within developing organoids is an impending necessity to ensure survival, maturation, and functionality in vitro and tissue integration in vivo. In this review, we inquire how the foundation of circulation is laid down during the course of organogenesis, with special focus on the kidney. We will discuss whether nature offers a clue to assist the generation of a nephro-vascular unit that can attain functionality even prior to receiving external blood supply from a host. We revisit the steps that have been taken to induce nephrons and provide vascularity in lab grown tissues. We also discuss the possibilities offered by advancements in the field of vascular biology and developmental nephrology in order to achieve the long-term goal of producing transplantable kidneys in vitro.", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2015-12-01", "authors": ["KrithikaHariharan", "AndreasKurtz", "Kai MSchmidt-Ott"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2015.00070\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.1998.06702.x\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.2002.00164.x\n10.1111/j.1432-0436.2006.00149.x\n10.1038/nbt1163\n10.1038/ncb2828\n10.1038/nature09941\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.09.002\n10.5966/sctm.2014-0208\n10.1126/science.118.3054.52\n10.1016/0012-1606(61)90032-X\n10.1016/0014-4827(61)90266-X\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.02.034\n10.1093/ndt/gfr785\n10.1053/trre.2002.29160\n10.1101/gad.10.12.1467\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2014.08.002\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.05.015\n10.1002/jez.1400950203\n10.1371/journal.pone.0088400\n10.1508/cytologia.31.89\n10.1006/dbio.2002.0863\n10.1634/stemcells.2006-0562\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2008.09.005\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.05.020\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.136\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.039\n10.1038/nature12298\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1681/ASN.2013080831\n10.1126/science.1247125\n10.1038/nature12517\n10.1023/A:1018357116559\n10.1038/ncomms2378\n10.1038/nmat3357\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.10.148\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.09.010\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.02.008\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.05.009\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0602\n10.1038/ki.2012.442\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.071\n10.1242/dev.006155\n10.1002/aja.1001590103\n10.1093/abbs/gmq046\n10.1126/science.100.2588.105\n10.1152/ajprenal.00208.2014\n10.1017/CBO9780511565083\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.07.026\n10.1242/dev.006544\n10.1371/journal.pone.0065993\n10.1371/journal.pone.0046453\n10.1038/nm.3154\n10.1038/nature09691\n10.1007/BF00219767\n10.1002/jez.1401730406\n10.1016/S0140-6736(78)92957-4\n10.1073/pnas.0908381106\n10.1016/j.stem.2013.11.010\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1038/ncb2894\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.03.004\n10.1038/nature12271\n10.1126/science.282.5391.1145\n10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00450-7\n10.1002/jez.1401280105\n10.1038/ki.2009.482\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.03.007\n10.1681/ASN.2006101078\n10.1073/pnas.46.9.1177\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.03.034\n10.1681/ASN.2008020243\n10.1038/ncb2872\n10.1038/nprot.2014.182\n10.1681/ASN.2012050505\n10.1073/pnas.1507803112\n10.1097/MOT.0b013e32835f070d"}

A 53-year-old woman with granuloma caused by silicone injection underwent bilateral nipple-sparing mastectomies and immediate reconstruction with \"mini-flow-through\" DIEP flaps. The flaps were dissected based on the single largest perforator with a short segment of the lateral branch of the deep inferior epigastric vessel that was transected as a free flap for breast reconstruction. The short segments of the donor deep inferior epigastric vessel branch are primarily end-to-end anastomosed to each other. A short T-shaped pedicle mini-flow-through DIEP flap is interposed in the incised recipient's internal mammary vessels with two arterial and four concomitant venous anastomoses. Although it requires multiple vascular anastomoses and a short pedicle for the flap setting, the mini-flow-through DIEP flap provides a large pedicle caliber, enabling safer microsurgical anastomosis and well-vascularized tissue for creating a natural breast without consuming time or compromising the rectus muscle components and vascular flow of both the deep inferior epigastric and internal mammary vessels.", "journal": "Archives of plastic surgery", "date": "2015-12-01", "authors": ["ToshihikoSatake", "JunSugawara", "KazunoriYasumura", "TaroMikami", "ShinjiKobayashi", "JiroMaegawa"], "doi": "10.5999/aps.2015.42.6.783"}

{"title": "Longitudinal three-dimensional visualisation of autoimmune diabetes by functional optical coherence imaging.", "abstract": "It is generally accepted that structural and functional quantitative imaging of individual islets would be beneficial to elucidate the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. We here introduce functional optical coherence imaging (FOCI) for fast, label-free monitoring of beta cell destruction and associated alterations of islet vascularisation.\nNOD mouse and human islets transplanted into the anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) were imaged with FOCI, in which the optical contrast of FOCI is based on intrinsic variations of the index of refraction resulting in a faster tomographic acquisition. In addition, the phase sensitivity allows simultaneous label-free acquisition of vascularisation.\nWe demonstrate that FOCI allows longitudinal quantification of progressive autoimmune insulitis, including the three-dimensional quantification of beta cell volume, inflammation and vascularisation. The substantially increased backscattering of islets is dominated by the insulin-zinc nanocrystals in the beta cell granules. This translates into a high specificity for the functional beta cell volume of islets. Applying FOCI to a spontaneous mouse model of type 1 diabetes, we quantify the modifications of the pancreatic microvasculature accompanying the progression of diabetes and reveal a strong correlation between increasing insulitis and density of the vascular network of the islet.\nFOCI provides a novel imaging technique for investigating functional and structural diabetes-induced alterations of the islets. The label-free detection of beta cell volume and infiltration together with vascularisation offers a unique extension to study ACE-transplanted human islets.

Drug-eluting biomaterial implants can be used to tune the endogenous repair process by the preferential recruitment of pro-regenerative cells. To enhance recruitment of AMs during inflammatory injury, a novel N-desulfated heparin-containing poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) hydrogel was engineered to deliver exogenous stromal derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1), utilizing the natural capacity of heparin to sequester and release growth factors. SDF-1\u03b1 released from the hydrogels maintained its bioactivity and stimulated chemotaxis of bone marrow cells in\u00a0vitro. Intravital microscopy and flow cytometry demonstrated that SDF-1\u03b1 hydrogels implanted in a murine dorsal skinfold window chamber promoted spatially-localized recruitment of AMs relative to unloaded internal control hydrogels. SDF-1\u03b1 delivery stimulated arteriolar remodeling that was correlated with AM enrichment in the injury niche. SDF-1\u03b1, but not unloaded control hydrogels, supported sustained arteriogenesis and microvascular network growth through 7 days. The recruitment of AMs correlated with parameters of vascular remodeling suggesting that tuning the innate immune response by biomaterial SDF-1\u03b1 release is a promising strategy for promoting vascular remodeling in a spatially controlled manner.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-11-28", "authors": ["J RKrieger", "M EOgle", "JMcFaline-Figueroa", "C ESegar", "J STemenoff", "E ABotchwey"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.10.045"}

METHODS The surgical anatomy of various tissue flaps and their vascular pedicles was studied in 5 colored silicone-injected anatomical specimens. Medical records were reviewed of 11 consecutive patients who underwent repair of extensive skull base defects with a combination of various vascularized flaps. RESULTS The supraorbital, supratrochlear, superficial temporal, greater auricular, and occipital arteries contribute to the vascular supply of the pericranium. The pericranial flap can be designed based on an axial blood supply. Laterally, various flaps are supplied by the deep or superficial temporal arteries. The nasoseptal flap is a vascular pedicled flap based on the nasoseptal artery. Patients with extensive skull base defects can undergo effective repair with dual flaps or triple flaps using these pedicled vascularized flaps. CONCLUSIONS Multiple pedicled flaps are available for reconstitution of the skull base. Knowledge of the surgical anatomy of these flaps is crucial for the skull base surgeon. These vascularized tissue flaps can be used effectively as single or combination flaps.

We generated a pre-vascularized buccal mucosa equivalent in a tri-culture of primary buccal epithelial cells, fibroblasts and microvascular endothelial cells, using a native collagen membrane as a scaffold. A successful pre-vascularization and dense formation of capillary-like structures at superficial areas was demonstrated. The lumen size of pre-formed blood vessels corresponded to the capillary size in\u00a0vivo (10-30\u00a0\u03bcm). Comparing native with a highly cross-linked collagen membrane we found a distinct higher formation of capillary-like structures on the native membrane, apparently caused by higher secretion of angiogenic factors such as PDGF, IL-8 and angiopoietin by the cells. These capillary-like structures became functional blood vessels through anastomosis with the host vasculature after implantation in nude mice.

The perfusion fraction f, diffusion coefficient D and perfusion-related diffusion coefficient D* were estimated using a bi-exponential function to fit the DWI data. DCE MRI was acquired with a temporal resolution of 3-5\u2009s. Maps of the initial area under the gadolinium concentration curve (IAUGC), time to peak (TTP) and maximum slope of increase (MSI) were derived using commercial software. The relationships between the DCE MRI and IVIM DWI measurements were assessed by Spearman's test. To exclude false positive results under multiple testing, the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was applied. The Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate the differences between all variables in patients with non-myxoid and myxoid STT.

An important question in validating tumor angiogenesis is what proportion of the tumor vascular network is represented by pre-existing parent tissue vessels and newly formed vessels. CD105 (endoglin) represents a proliferation-associated endothelial cell adhesion molecule. In contrast to pan-endothelial markers, such as CD31, CD105 is preferentially expressed in activated endothelial cells that participate in neovascularization. Thus, we evaluated CD105 and CD31 expression from samples of ten patients with primary rectal adenocarcinoma, using a dedicated endomicroscopy system. A imaging software was used to obtain the Z projection of the confocal serial images from each biopsy sample previously combined into stacks. Vascular density and vessel diameters were measured within two 50 \u03bcm x 475 \u03bcm rectangular regions of interest centered in the middle of each image in the horizontal and vertical direction. The results were averaged over all the patients and were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SE.\nThe use of an anti-CD105 antibody was found to be suitable for the detection of blood vessels in colon cancer. Whereas anti-CD31 antibodies stained blood vessels in both normal and pathologic colon equally, CD105 expression was observed primarily in malignant lesions, with little or no expression in the vessels of the normal mucosa (244.21 \u00b1 130.7 vessels/mm(3) in only four patients). The average diameter of anti-CD105 stained vessels was 10.97 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcm in tumor tissue, and the vessel density was 2787.40 \u00b1 134.8 vessels/mm(3). When using the anti-CD31 antibody, the average diameter of vessels in the normal colon tissue was 7.67 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcm and the vessel density was 3191.60 \u00b1 387.8 vessels/mm(3), while in the tumors we obtained an average diameter of 10.88 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcm and a vessel density of 4707.30 \u00b1 448.85 vessels/mm(3). Thus, there were more vessels stained with CD31 than CD105 (P < 0.05). The average vessel diameter was similar for both CD31 and CD105 staining.

We intended to explore preclinically the potential of regorafenib against solid pediatric malignancies alone and in combination with anticancer agents to guide the pediatric development plan. In vitro effects on cell proliferation were screened against 33 solid tumor cell lines of the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer (ITCC) panel covering five pediatric solid malignancies. Regorafenib inhibited cell proliferation with a mean half maximal growth inhibition of 12.5 \u03bcmol/L (range 0.7 \u03bcmol/L to 28 \u03bcmol/L). In vivo, regorafenib was evaluated alone at 10 or 30 mg/kg/d or in combination with radiation, irinotecan or the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor refametinib against various tumor types, including patient-derived brain tumor models with an amplified platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) gene. Regorafenib alone significantly inhibited tumor growth in all xenografts derived from nervous system and connective tissue tumors. Enhanced effects were observed when regorafenib was combined with irradiation and irinotecan against PDGFRA amplified IGRG93 glioma and IGRM57 medulloblastoma respectively, resulting in 100% tumor regressions. Antitumor activity was associated with decreased tumor vascularization, inhibition of PDGFR signaling, and induction of apoptotic cell death.

{"title": "Immune-modulating properties of ionizing radiation: rationale for the treatment of cancer by combination radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) utilizes the DNA-damaging properties of ionizing radiation to control tumor growth and ultimately kill tumor cells. By modifying the tumor cell phenotype and the tumor microenvironment, it may also modulate the immune system. However, out-of-field reactions of RT mostly assume further immune activation. Here, the sequence of the applications of RT and immunotherapy is crucial, just as the dose and fractionation may be. Lower single doses may impact on tumor vascularization and immune cell infiltration in particular, while higher doses may impact on intratumoral induction and production of type I interferons. The induction of immunogenic cancer cell death seems in turn to be a common mechanism for most RT schemes. Dendritic cells (DCs) are activated by the released danger signals and by taking up tumor peptides derived from irradiated cells. DCs subsequently activate T cells, a process that has to be tightly controlled to ensure tolerance. Inhibitory pathways known as immune checkpoints exist for this purpose and are exploited by tumors to inhibit immune responses. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on T cells are two major checkpoints. The biological concepts behind the findings that RT in combination with anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-L1 blockade stimulates CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity are reviewed in detail. On this basis, we suggest clinically significant combinations and sequences of RT and immune checkpoint inhibition. We conclude that RT and immune therapies complement one another.", "journal": "Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII", "date": "2015-11-23", "authors": ["AnjaDerer", "BenjaminFrey", "RainerFietkau", "Udo SGaipl"], "doi": "10.1007/s00262-015-1771-8"}
{"title": "Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Podocytes Mature into Vascularized Glomeruli upon Experimental Transplantation.", "abstract": "Glomerular podocytes express proteins, such as nephrin, that constitute the slit diaphragm, thereby contributing to the filtration process in the kidney. Glomerular development has been analyzed mainly in mice, whereas analysis of human kidney development has been minimal because of limited access to embryonic kidneys. We previously reported the induction of three-dimensional primordial glomeruli from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Here, using transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated homologous recombination, we generated human iPS cell lines that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the NPHS1 locus, which encodes nephrin, and we show that GFP expression facilitated accurate visualization of nephrin-positive podocyte formation in vitro These induced human podocytes exhibited apicobasal polarity, with nephrin proteins accumulated close to the basal domain, and possessed primary processes that were connected with slit diaphragm-like structures. Microarray analysis of sorted iPS cell-derived podocytes identified well conserved marker gene expression previously shown in mouse and human podocytes in vivo Furthermore, we developed a novel transplantation method using spacers that release the tension of host kidney capsules, thereby allowing the effective formation of glomeruli from human iPS cell-derived nephron progenitors. The human glomeruli were vascularized with the host mouse endothelial cells, and iPS cell-derived podocytes with numerous cell processes accumulated around the fenestrated endothelial cells. Therefore, the podocytes generated from iPS cells retain the podocyte-specific molecular and structural features, which will be useful for dissecting human glomerular development and diseases.", "journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "date": "2015-11-21", "authors": ["SaziaSharmin", "AtsuhiroTaguchi", "YusukeKaku", "YasuhiroYoshimura", "TomokoOhmori", "TetsushiSakuma", "MasashiMukoyama", "TakashiYamamoto", "HidetakeKurihara", "RyuichiNishinakamura"], "doi": "10.1681/ASN.2015010096"}

A 42-year-old man sought medical consult for hematuria, disabling dizziness and balance disorders lasting for two months. The neurological examination revealed the presence of a kinetic cerebellar syndrome. The cerebro-spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple hemangioblastomas, both encephalic and medullar. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a big solid mass in the left kidney and multiple intra-parenchymal cystic lesions in the right kidney and the pancreas. The diagnosis of VHL disease was strongly suspected. The operative indication of brain damage and renal mass have been submitted.

{"title": "Lipid transport to avian oocytes and to the developing embryo.", "abstract": "Studies of receptor-mediated lipoprotein metabolic pathways in avian species have revealed that physiological intricacies of specific cell types are highly analogous to those in mammals. A prime example for the power of comparative studies across different animal kingdoms, elucidated in the chicken, is that the expression of different lipoprotein receptors in somatic cells and oocytes are the key to oocyte growth. In avian species, yolk precursor transport from the hen's liver to rapidly growing oocytes and the subsequent transfer of yolk nutrients via the yolk sac to the developing embryo are highly efficient processes. Oocytes grow from a diameter of 5 mm to 2.5-3 cm in only 7 days, and the yolk sac transfers nutrients from the yolk stored in the mature oocyte to the embryo within just 2 weeks. The underlying key transport mechanism is receptor-mediated endocytosis of macromolecules, i.e., of hepatically synthesized yolk precursors for oocyte growth, and of mature yolk components for embryo nutrition, respectively. Recently, the receptors involved, as well as the role of lipoprotein synthesis in the yolk sac have been identified. As outlined here, lipoprotein degradation/resynthesis cycles and the expression of lipoprotein receptors are not only coordinated with the establishment of the follicular architecture embedding the oocyte, but also with the generation of the yolk sac vasculature essential for nutrient transfer to the embryo.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical research", "date": "2015-11-21", "authors": ["Wolfgang JSchneider"], "doi": "10.7555/JBR.30.20150048"}

We propose a novel role for survivin in cancer, whereby expression of the protein in tumor cells promotes VEGF synthesis, secretion and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, we propose the existence of a positive feed-back loop involving PI3-kinase/Akt activation and enhanced \u03b2-Catenin-TCF/LEF-dependent VEGF expression followed by secretion.

{"title": "Reduced voluntary running performance is associated with impaired coordination as a result of muscle satellite cell depletion in adult mice.", "abstract": "Satellite cells, or muscle stem cells, have been thought to be responsible for all muscle plasticity, but recent studies using genetically modified mouse models that allow for the conditional ablation of satellite cells have challenged this dogma. Results have confirmed the absolute requirement of satellite cells for muscle regeneration but surprisingly also showed that they are not required for adult muscle growth. While the function of satellite cells in muscle growth and regeneration is becoming better defined, their role in the response to aerobic activity remains largely unexplored. The purpose of the current study was to assess the involvement of satellite cells in response to aerobic exercise by evaluating the effect of satellite cell depletion on wheel running performance.\nFour-month-old female Pax7/DTA mice (n\u2009=\u20098-12 per group) were satellite cell depleted via tamoxifen administration; at 6\u00a0months of age, mice either remained sedentary or were provided with running wheels for 8\u00a0weeks. Plantaris muscles were significantly depleted of Pax7+cells (\u226590\u00a0% depleted), and 8\u00a0weeks of wheel running did not result in an increase in Pax7+ cells, or in myonuclear accretion. Interestingly, satellite cell-depleted animals ran ~27\u00a0% less distance and were 23\u00a0% slower than non-depleted animals. Wheel running was associated with elevated succinate dehydrogenase activity, muscle vascularization, lipid accumulation, and a significant shift toward more oxidative myosin heavy chain isoforms, as well as an increase in voltage dependent anion channel abundance, a marker of mitochondrial density. Importantly, these changes were independent of satellite cell content. Interestingly, depletion of Pax7+ cells from intra- as well as extrafusal muscle fibers resulted in atrophy of intrafusal fibers, thickening of muscle spindle-associated extracellular matrix, and a marked reduction of functional outcomes including grip strength, gait fluidity, and balance, which likely contributed to the impaired running performance.\nDepletion of Pax7-expressing cells in muscle resulted in reduced voluntary wheel running performance, without affecting markers of aerobic adaptation; however, their absence may perturb proprioception via disruption of muscle spindle fibers resulting in loss of gross motor coordination, indicating that satellite cells have a yet unexplored role in muscle function.", "journal": "Skeletal muscle", "date": "2015-11-19", "authors": ["Janna RJackson", "Tyler JKirby", "Christopher SFry", "Robin LCooper", "John JMcCarthy", "Charlotte APeterson", "Esther EDupont-Versteegden"], "doi": "10.1186/s13395-015-0065-3\n10.1242/jcs.02908\n10.1007/s11357-013-9583-2\n10.1242/dev.068858\n10.1242/dev.067595\n10.1242/dev.064162\n10.1242/dev.067587\n10.1152/ajpcell.00207.2012\n10.1096/fj.13-229799\n10.1111/j.1748-1716.2011.02350.x\n10.1096/fj.13-239426\n10.1038/nm.3710\n10.1016/0304-3940(87)90625-2\n10.1096/fj.08-128116\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-1017\n10.1016/0165-0270(95)00049-6\n10.1007/BF00401402\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3699-14.2015\n10.1152/ajpcell.00247.2004\n10.1073/pnas.1419045111\n10.1038/ncomms8087\n10.1113/expphysiol.2011.063008\n10.1152/ajpheart.00085.2005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0013307\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.085\n10.1091/mbc.E06-08-0693\n10.1007/BF00643744\n10.3389/fnagi.2015.00085\n10.1016/S1357-2725(97)00023-X\n10.1369/jhc.2008.951608\n10.1369/0022155411426780\n10.1002/ar.1092160202"}
{"title": "Free Vascularized Medial Femoral Condyle Structural Flaps for Septic Terminal Digital Bone Loss.", "abstract": "A unique clinical problem exists when the majority of distal bone stock in a digit is destroyed by osteomyelitis, leaving a residual soft tissue envelope with tenuous, random perfusion surrounding a nidus of scar tissue. Pulp pinch is lost in the absence of bony support, and limited options exist. Apart from toe transfer or revision amputation with shortening, non-vascularized bone grafting inside the residual soft tissue envelope risks graft resorption and reactivation of infection. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of free vascularized medial femoral condyle structural bone flaps to restore lost pulp pinch in such cases. Nine patients (8 males, 1 female) with a mean age of 43\u00a0years sustained extensive terminal bone loss near digital tips following osteomyelitis. The mean length of bone defect was 28\u00a0mm (\u00b1 8.4). The patients were reconstructed at a mean of 12\u00a0weeks from initial trauma/infection, having undergone a mean of two prior surgeries. A structural block of vascularized bone from the medial femoral condyle replaced the missing bone at the digital tip defect, temporarily fixed with K-wires. The bone flap was encased by the residual soft tissue envelope after removing scar tissue from the prior trauma and infection. All bone flaps incorporated fully, restoring pulp pinch function to the respective digits with a mean time to union of 8.6 (\u00b1 2.1) weeks; range 6-11\u00a0weeks. With few alternative solutions able to address this unique and difficult problem, the structural block of vascularized bone proved able to resist resorption, nonunion, and reactivation of infection; the problems normally encountered under this scenario.", "journal": "Journal of hand and microsurgery", "date": "2015-11-19", "authors": ["MarkHenry"], "doi": "10.1007/s12593-015-0207-1\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2006.02.020\n10.1097/01.prs.0000279476.29055.5f\n10.1177/1753193413508689\n10.3109/2000656X.2013.816512\n10.1007/s11552-011-9340-x\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2009.01.009\n10.1177/1753193408090392\n10.1016/j.jhsb.2003.12.004\n10.1016/j.injury.2008.08.036\n10.1097/SAP.0b013e318056d6b5\n10.1097/00006534-199102000-00011\n10.1002/micr.1920150505\n10.1002/micr.20843\n10.1002/micr.20671\n10.1016/j.jhsb.2006.10.015\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181d1808c\n10.1016/j.bjps.2005.04.015\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2010.08.006\n10.1186/1749-799X-9-21\n10.1142/S0218810407003651\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2013.01.036\n10.1055/s-0033-1351789\n10.1055/s-0034-1372484\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2014.03.040\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2008.12.016\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2011.07.015\n10.1177/1753193410364484"}
{"title": "The role of transvaginal power Doppler ultrasound in the differential diagnosis of benign intrauterine focal lesions.", "abstract": "The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the role of power Doppler imaging in the differential diagnosis of benign intrauterine focal lesions such as endometrial polyps and submucous myomas using the characteristics of power Doppler flow mapping.\nA total of 480 premenopausal patients with abnormal uterine bleeding were evaluated by transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) searching for intrauterine pathology. Sixty-four patients with a suspicious focal endometrial lesion received saline infusion sonography (SIS) after TVS. Fifty-eight patients with focal endometrial lesions underwent power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS). Three different vascular flow patterns were defined: Single vessel pattern, multiple vessel pattern, and circular flow pattern. Finally, hysteroscopic resection was performed in all cases, and Doppler flow characteristics were then compared with the final histopathological findings.\nHistopathological results were as follows: endometrial polyp: 40 (69 %), submucous myoma: 18 (31 %). Of the cases with endometrial polyps, 80 % demonstrated a single vessel pattern, 7.5 % a multiple vessel pattern, and 0 % a circular pattern. Vascularization was not observed in 12.5 % of patients with polyps. Of the cases with submucousal myomas, 72.2 % demonstrated a circular flow pattern, 27.8 % a multiple vessel pattern, and none of them showed a single vessel pattern. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the single vessel pattern in diagnosing endometrial polyps were 80, 100, 100, and 69.2 %, respectively; and for the circular pattern in diagnosing submucous myoma, these were 72.2, 100, 100, and 88.9 %, respectively.\nPower Doppler blood flow mapping is a useful, practical, and noninvasive diagnostic method for the differential diagnosis of benign intrauterine focal lesions.

{"title": "Mesenchymal Stem Cells: Rising Concerns over Their Application in Treatment of Type One Diabetes Mellitus.", "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disorder that leads to beta cell destruction and lowered insulin production. In recent years, stem cell therapies have opened up new horizons to treatment of diabetes mellitus. Among all kinds of stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to be an interesting therapeutic option based on their immunomodulatory properties and differentiation potentials confirmed in various experimental and clinical trial studies. In this review, we discuss MSCs differential potentials in differentiation into insulin-producing cells (IPCs) from various sources and also have an overview on currently understood mechanisms through which MSCs exhibit their immunomodulatory effects. Other important issues that are provided in this review, due to their importance in the field of cell therapy, are genetic manipulations (as a new biotechnological method), routes of transplantation, combination of MSCs with other cell types, frequency of transplantation, and special considerations regarding diabetic patients' autologous MSCs transplantation. At the end, utilization of biomaterials either as encapsulation tools or as scaffolds to prevent immune rejection, preparation of tridimensional vascularized microenvironment, and completed or ongoing clinical trials using MSCs are discussed.

{"title": "Porous polymer scaffold for on-site delivery of stem cells--Protects from oxidative stress and potentiates wound tissue repair.", "abstract": "Wound healing by cell transplantation techniques often suffer setbacks due to oxidative stress encountered at injury sites. A porous polyethyleneglycol-polyurethane (PEG-PU) scaffold that facilitates cell delivery and boosts tissue repair was developed through semi-interpenetrating polymer network approach. The key physico-chemical properties assessed confirms these polymeric matrices are highly thermostable, barostable, degrade at an acidic pH (5.8), biodegradable, cytocompatible and possess excellent porosity. Mechanism of cellular penetration into porous polymer networks was evident by a \u22656 - fold increase in gene expression of MMP-13 and MMP-2 via activation of Akt and Erk. H2O2-induced apoptosis of mouse bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) was abrogated in presence of polymer networks indicating a protective effect from oxidative stress. Transplantation of BMSC\u00a0+\u00a0PEG-PU at murine excisional splint wound site depicted significant increase in fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, anti-oxidant enzyme activities of catalase, SOD and GPx. Furthermore it significantly decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, etc) with a concomitant increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-13) at an early healing period of day 7. Finally, immunostaining revealed an enhanced engraftment and vascularity indicating an accelerated wound tissue closure. This pre-clinical study demonstrates the proof-of-concept and further necessitates their clinical evaluation as potential cell delivery vehicle scaffolds.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-11-18", "authors": ["RamasatyaveniGeesala", "NimaiBar", "Neha RDhoke", "PratyayBasak", "AmitavaDas"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.003"}

Limited jaw opening, difficult access through the flap to the bony site, and the very small amount of bone available in which to anchor the implant inspired the development and use of a new \"reverse zygomatic\" implant. For this treatment, site preparation and implant insertion were accomplished using an extraoral approach. The implant was used along with two other conventional zygomatic implants to provide support for a milled titanium bar and overdenture to rehabilitate the maxilla. Two years later, the patient continues to enjoy a healthy reconstruction.

Complex cases, however, may be simplified by computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) assisted surgical planning. This series represents the senior authors' preliminary experiences with CAD/CAM assisted, microvascular reconstruction of the pediatric mandible.\nPresented are two patients with hemifacial/bifacial microsomia, both with profound mandibular hypoplasia, who underwent CAD/CAM assisted reconstruction of their mandibles with vascularized fibula flaps. Surgical techniques, CAD/CAM routines employed, complications, and long-term outcomes are reported.\nSuccessful mandibular reconstructions were achieved in both patients with centralization of their native mandibles and augmentation of deficient mandibular subunits. No long-term complications were observed.\nCAD/CAM technology can be utilized in pediatric mandibular reconstruction, and is particularly beneficial in cases of profound, congenital hypoplasia requiring extensive, multi-planar, bony reconstructions.", "journal": "International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology", "date": "2015-11-18", "authors": ["Alexander JGougoutas", "NicholasBastidas", "Scott PBartlett", "OksanaJackson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijporl.2015.10.038"}
{"title": "Local administration of Mitomycin-C-Treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) prolongs allograft survival in vascularized composite allotransplantation.", "abstract": "VCA offers a potential treatment for extensive tissue defects. First results of systemic administration of Mitomycin C-treated PBMCs in VCA demonstrated a significant prolongation of allograft survival. The aim of this study is to evaluate if local administration of MMC-PBMCs prolongs allograft survival in allogeneic hind limb transplantations of the rat.\nSixty allogeneic hind limb transplantations in the rat were performed in six groups. Lewis rats (LEW) were used as hind limb donors and Brown-Norway rats (BN) as recipients. Animals in group A received donor-derived MMC-treated PBMCs locally (i.m.). Group B received no immunosuppressive therapy, group C received a standard immunosuppressive regime consisting of FK506 and Prednisolon, group D (BN to BN) comprised isograft transplantations without immunosuppressive treatment, group E received non-treated PBMCs (i.m.) and group F received phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without cells. The transplanted hind limbs were assessed for color, edema, skin, hair condition, and consistency of the thigh every 8 hours.\nRejection in group A was delayed to an average of 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 days. Survival times were significantly prolonged (P\u2009<\u20090.01) compared to control groups B, E, and F (5.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7, 5.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7, and 5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 days). Control groups C and D showed no signs of rejection.\nThe findings of this study show that local administration of MMC-PBMCs has no side effects and significantly extends allograft survival. Further experiments with MMC-PBMCs treatments repeated at different time-points and being added to low dose immunosuppressive protocols need to be performed to improve experimental and eventually clinical outcome after VCA. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "MicroRNA\u2011566 modulates vascular endothelial growth factor by targeting Von Hippel\u2011Landau in human glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are able to function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in tumorigenesis, and have been proposed as novel targets for anticancer treatment. It has previously been suggested that miRNAs have important roles in the initiation and progression of glioblastoma; however, the effects of miR\u2011566 in glioblastoma are currently unclear. The present study aimed to demonstrate that miR-566 can modulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by targeting Von Hippel\u2011Lindau (VHL) in glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the expression of miR-566. Glioblastoma is a highly vascularized tumor, which exhibits increased expression of angiogenic factors, including VEGF, which are crucial in the process of glioblastoma angiogenesis. Existing research has demonstrated that VHL is a tumor suppressor gene that is associated with various tumors. In addition, VHL is able to regulate the expression of VEGF by promoting the degradation of hypoxia\u2011inducible factor\u20111\u03b1 via ubiquitination. It has been predicted, using bioinformatics, that the VHL gene is regulated by miR\u2011566. Therefore, the present study hypothesized that miR\u2011566 may regulate VEGF expression by targeting VHL during the angiogenic process of glioblastoma multiforme. The results of the present study demonstrated that inhibition of miR\u2011566 expression increases the expression levels of VHL, decreases the expression levels of VEGF, and inhibits the invasive and migratory abilities of glioblastoma. In addition, VHL was identified as a functional target of miR\u2011566.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2015-11-18", "authors": ["BingXiao", "XuanZhou", "MinhuaYe", "ShigangLv", "MiaojingWu", "ChangchunLiao", "LeiHan", "ChunshengKang", "XingenZhu"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2015.4537"}

These seemingly opposite effects make its role in ischemic disease unclear. Using Trail(-/-) and wildtype mice, we sought to determine the role of TRAIL in angiogenesis and neovascularization following hindlimb ischemia.\nReduced vascularization assessed by real-time 3-dimensional Vevo ultrasound imaging and CD31 staining was evident in Trail(-/-) mice after ischemia, and associated with reduced capillary formation and increased apoptosis. Notably, adenoviral TRAIL administration significantly improved limb perfusion, capillary density, and vascular smooth-muscle cell content in both Trail(-/-) and wildtype mice. Fibroblast growth factor-2, a potent angiogenic factor, increased TRAIL expression in human microvascular endothelial cell-1, with fibroblast growth factor-2-mediated proliferation, migration, and tubule formation inhibited with TRAIL siRNA. Both fibroblast growth factor-2 and TRAIL significantly increased NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) expression. TRAIL-inducible angiogenic activity in vitro was inhibited with siRNAs targeting NOX4, and consistent with this, NOX4 mRNA was reduced in 3-day ischemic hindlimbs of Trail(-/-) mice. Furthermore, TRAIL-induced proliferation, migration, and tubule formation was blocked by scavenging H2O2, or by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase activity. Importantly, TRAIL-inducible endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation at Ser-1177 and intracellular human microvascular endothelial cell-1 cell nitric oxide levels were NOX4 dependent.\nThis is the first report demonstrating that TRAIL can promote angiogenesis following hindlimb ischemia in vivo. The angiogenic effect of TRAIL on human microvascular endothelial cell-1 cells is downstream of fibroblast growth factor-2, involving NOX4 and nitric oxide signaling. These data have significant therapeutic implications, such that TRAIL may improve the angiogenic response to ischemia and increase perfusion recovery in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2015-11-18", "authors": ["Belinda AnnDi Bartolo", "Si\u00e2n PetaCartland", "LeonelPrado-Lourenco", "Thomas ScottGriffith", "CarmineGentile", "JayantRavindran", "Nor Saadah MuhammadAzahri", "ThuanThai", "Amanda Wing SheeYeung", "Shane RossThomas", "Mary MeltemKavurma"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.115.002527"}

Because a flap resists infection better than an avascular graft, a vascularized IT graft is useful for reconstructive surgeries pertaining to infected wounds or wounds in contact with artificial material. The purpose of this study was to examine the vascular anatomy of the IT.\nThe study sample consisted of 39 limbs of freshly frozen cadavers. The study was divided into three parts. The ascending and transverse branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (LCFA) of all cadavers were injected with latex. Distance from the tensor fasciae latae muscle and the most distal point at which the vessel on the IT was stained by latex was recorded. A microscopic observation was performed for these limbs. The deep femoral artery (DFA) or superior lateral genicular artery (SLGA) was also observed.\nThe length of the IT fed by the LCFA was 162.3\u2009\u00b1\u200936.2 mm. The IT vascularity was located between the layered structure of the fascia and there was a vascular source for the IT within 1 mm above the IT by optical microscopy.

{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor A: just one of multiple mechanisms for sex-specific vascular development within the testis?", "abstract": "Testis development from an indifferent gonad is a critical step in embryogenesis. A hallmark of testis differentiation is sex-specific vascularization that occurs as endothelial cells migrate from the adjacent mesonephros into the testis to surround Sertoli-germ cell aggregates and induce seminiferous cord formation. Many in vitro experiments have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) is a critical regulator of this process. Both inhibitors to VEGFA signal transduction and excess VEGFA isoforms in testis organ cultures impaired vascular development and seminiferous cord formation. However, in vivo models using mice which selectively eliminated all VEGFA isoforms: in Sertoli and germ cells (pDmrt1-Cre;Vegfa(-/-)); Sertoli and Leydig cells (Amhr2-Cre;Vegfa(-/-)) or Sertoli cells (Amh-Cre;Vegfa(-/-) and Sry-Cre;Vegfa(-/-)) displayed testes with observably normal cords and vasculature at postnatal day 0 and onwards. Embryonic testis development may be delayed in these mice; however, the postnatal data indicate that VEGFA isoforms secreted from Sertoli, Leydig or germ cells are not required for testis morphogenesis within the mouse. A Vegfa signal transduction array was employed on postnatal testes from Sry-Cre;Vegfa(-/-) versus controls. Ptgs1 (Cox1) was the only upregulated gene (fivefold). COX1 stimulates angiogenesis and upregulates, VEGFA, Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGD2. Thus, other gene pathways may compensate for VEGFA loss, similar to multiple independent mechanisms to maintain SOX9 expression. Multiple independent mechanism that induce vascular development in the testis may contribute to and safeguard the sex-specific vasculature development responsible for inducing seminiferous cord formation, thus ensuring appropriate testis morphogenesis in the male.", "journal": "The Journal of endocrinology", "date": "2015-11-13", "authors": ["Kevin MSargent", "Renee MMcFee", "RenataSpuri Gomes", "Andrea SCupp"], "doi": "10.1530/JOE-15-0342"}

Exploring ways to disarm alloreactive T cells represents a potential strategy to promote long-term allograft acceptance and survival. T cell Ig domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) has previously been demonstrated as a central regulator of T helper 1 (Th1) responses and immune tolerance. Hence, TIM-3 may be an important molecule for decreasing immunological rejection during composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA). In this study, BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were chosen as the experimental animals. The effects of TIM-3 on allograft rejection were explored using TIM-3-modified mature dendritic cells (TIM-3 mDCs). A laser speckle blood flow (LSBF) imager was used to evaluate blood distribution of the BALB/c mice. ELISA, MTT, ELISPOT assays and flow cytometry analysis were carried out for further researches. We found that TIM-3 could obviously prolong the survival time of the transplanted limbs. And TIM-3 could mitigate the immune response and thus enhance immune tolerance after CTA. Also, TIM-3 can induce lymphocyte hyporesponsiveness, including facilitating lymphocyte apoptosis, decreasing lymphocyte proliferation, and influencing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, TIM-3 overexpression could induce CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into regulatory T cells (Tregs), which recalibrate the effector and regulatory arms of the alloimmune response. In summary, we concluded that TIM-3 can mitigate allograft rejection and thus enhance immune tolerance by inducing lymphocyte hyporesponsiveness and increasing the number of Tregs of the alloimmune response.

Treatment was performed through intratumoral and intravenous injection of TGF\u03b1L3-SEB. Tumor size/volume, long-term survival, and cytokine secretion were assessed. In addition, the toxicity of each treatment on liver and kidneys was examined. Our results indicated that the relative tumor volume significantly increased in the mice receiving intratumoral TGFaL3-SEB (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Surprisingly, 5 out of the 14 mice were cleared from the tumor thoroughly in 10-25\u00a0days after intratumoral administration of TGFaL3-SEB.

TE implants elicit the host immune response, often resulting in engraftment impediment or rejection.

Thus, a balanced cooperation between proinflammatory and proresolution players of the immune response is an essential element of implant success. In this context, macrophage plasticity plays a fundamental role. Therefore modulating the immune response, instead of immune suppressing the host, might be the best way to successfully implant TE tissues or organs. In particular, it is becoming evident that the scaffold, immune, and stem cells are linked by a three-way interaction, and many efforts are being made for scaffold-appropriate design and functionalization in order to drive the inflammation process toward regeneration, vascularization, and implant success.

{"title": "[Kocher approach to the elbow and its options].", "abstract": "The original Kocher approach was published several times in the 18921907 period. It extends in the interval between the extensor carpi ulnaris and the anconeus and consists in subperiostal release of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), joint capsule and origin of extensors at the lateral epicondyle and their retraction anteriorly, and a similar release of the anconeus from the distal humerus and its reflection posteriorly. This provides an extensive approach to the elbow. Today this approach is described in the textbooks in various modifications that have little in common with the original description except for the fact that dissection is made in the so called Kocher interval between the extensor carpi ulnaris and the anconeus. Therefore it is often called a limited Kocher approach.The study describes our modification of the Kocher approach that we use primarily in fractures of the head and neck of the radius, in certain fractures of the distal humerus, and also in irreducible dislocations and certain fracture-dislocations of the elbow.The incision is made along the line connecting the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the border between the proximal and middle thirds of the ulna. The incision is pulled open and the strong, white opalescent common extensor fascia incised in order to identify the interval between the extensor carpi ulnaris and the anconeus. The two muscles are separated by thin vascularized fatty connective tissue which is split in order to expose a typical tendon reinforcing the upper half of the anterior margin of the anconeus. In this phase it is beneficial to detach the origin of the extensor carpi ulnaris from the lateral epicondyle. It facilitates retraction of the extensor carpi ulnaris anteriorly and of the anconeus slightly posteriorly. In contrast with the original Kocher approach, we do not release the anconeus from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.The muscles are retracted to expose the anterolateral surface of the joint capsule and to identify the course of the LCL complex. The capsule is incised along the anterior margin of LCL, starting from the lateral epicondyle up to and including the radial annular ligament. Arthrotomy performed anterior to LCL spares the insertion of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament on the ulna and, consequently, preserves the elbow stability. If dissection more distally is required in order to expose the radial neck, part of the supinator must be incised as well. In such case the forearm is first carefully pronated as much as possible, as a result of which the canalis supinatorius including the deep branch of the radial nerve will move anteriorly, thus reducing the risk of injury to the nerve.The capsule is incised and opened, revealing the anterolateral surface of the head of humerus and radial head. In this phase it is beneficial to flex the elbow to 90100 degrees, when the anterior part of the capsule will get flabby and allow a better visualization of the joint. The joint capsule must be released from the distal humerus together with extensors originating at the lateral epicondyle of humerus. This will considerably improve visualization of the anterior part of the joint cavity. During wound closure the common extensor fascia must be firmly sutured, as it is a significant but often underestimated stabilizer of the lateral part of the elbow.The extended option of the Kocher approach consists in retraction of the anconeus proximally. It is indicated in certain fracture-dislocations of the proximal forearm, i.e. fractures of the radial head and the entire proximal ulna. After dissection of the whole anconeus, this muscle is detached from the ulnar shaft and entirely reflected proximally. The muscle remains attached by its short proximal margin to the lateral epicondyle of humerus and to olecranon. This eliminates the risk of injury to the neurovascular hilus of the muscle, as the motoric nerve enters the muscle in the middle of its upper border. Retraction of the muscle exposes both the lateral surface of the joint capsule and the lateral surface of the proximal ulna. Further procedure, i.e. incision of the capsule and inspection of the joint, is the same as in the limited Kocher approach.", "journal": "Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti", "date": "2015-11-12", "authors": ["JBarton\u00ed\u010dek", "ONa\u0148ka", "MTu\u010dek"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Using Ex Vivo Upright Droplet Cultures of Whole Fetal Organs to Study Developmental Processes during Mouse Organogenesis.", "abstract": "Investigating organogenesis in utero is a technically challenging process in placental mammals due to inaccessibility of reagents to embryos that develop within the uterus. A newly developed ex vivo upright droplet culture method provides an attractive alternative to studies performed in utero. The ex vivo droplet culture provides the ability to examine and manipulate cellular interactions and diverse signaling pathways through use of various blocking and activating compounds; additionally, the effects of various pharmacological reagents on the development of specific organs can be studied without unwanted side effects of systemic drug delivery in utero. As compared to other in vitro systems, the droplet culture not only allows for the ability to study three-dimensional morphogenesis and cell-cell interactions, which cannot be reproduced in mammalian cell lines, but also requires significantly less reagents than other ex vivo and in vitro protocols. This paper demonstrates proper mouse fetal organ dissection and upright droplet culture techniques, followed by whole organ immunofluorescence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The ex vivo droplet culture method allows the formation of organ architecture comparable to what is observed in vivo and can be utilized to study otherwise difficult-to-study processes due to embryonic lethality in in vivo models. As a model application system, a small-molecule inhibitor will be utilized to probe the role of vascularization in testicular morphogenesis. This ex vivo droplet culture method is expandable to other fetal organ systems, such as lung and potentially others, although each organ must be extensively studied to determine any organ-specific modifications to the protocol. This organ culture system provides flexibility in experimentation with fetal organs, and results obtained using this technique will help researchers gain insights into fetal development.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2015-11-12", "authors": ["Sarah JPotter", "TonyDeFalco"], "doi": "10.3791/53262"}

Vertical mattress sutures stabilize the meniscal tear in place, allowing for proper healing. The principal steps in the procedure include (1) assessing the location and pattern of the tear arthroscopically, (2) performing a medial or lateral meniscal repair incision in the proper anatomic location, (3) passing the sutures in a vertical mattress pattern through the torn meniscus, and (4) tying the sutures while verifying sufficient reduction of the tear arthroscopically. Postoperatively, patients remain non-weight-bearing for the course of six weeks. Passive knee flexion from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 is allowed for the first two weeks. After two weeks, motion is increased as tolerated. At six weeks postoperatively, patients are allowed to progress to weight-bearing as tolerated and initiate the use of a stationary bicycle. They should avoid squatting, sitting cross-legged, and squatting and lifting for four months postoperatively to avoid substantial stress on the healing meniscus. After four months, sports-specific activities are initiated.

Ninety-eight prospectively followed up patients were treated with MMF [with dose adjustment based on mycophenolic acid (MPA) serum concentration], and 98 patients were in the non-MMF-treated retrospectively assessed control group.\nDuring a mean of 24\u00a0months of observation, immune reactions occurred in eight cases (8\u00a0%) and graft rejection with subsequent graft failure occurred in three cases (3\u00a0%) in the MMF group. In the control group, graft rejection occurred in 76 cases (78\u00a0%) and failure due to graft rejection occurred in 30 cases (31\u00a0%). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that 93\u00a0% of the grafts in the MMF-treated group and 47\u00a0% in the control group showed no immune rejection (p\u2009<\u20090.01, log-rank test) after a year. Cox regression analysis proved that MMF treatment decreased the risk of graft rejection 11 times (RR\u2009=\u200911, 95.0\u00a0% CI 4.8-25, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Among 98 MMF-treated patients, 13 had gastric discomfort, three developed leucopenia, and two had anemia that resolved after MMF dose reduction.\nMMF treatment after high risk penetrating keratoplasty is safe and reduces the incidence of immune graft rejection and graft failure.

{"title": "Levels of circulating endothelial cells are low in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and are further reduced by anti-fibrotic treatments.", "abstract": "It has been suggested that circulating fibrocytes and endothelial cells actively participate in the intense remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Indeed, fibrotic areas exist that have fewer blood vessels, whereas adjacent non-fibrotic tissue is highly vascularized. The number of circulating endothelial cells (CEC) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) might reflect the balance between vascular injury and repair. Thus, fibrocytes as well as endothelial cells could potentially be used as biomarkers of disease progression and treatment outcome.\nPeripheral blood samples were collected from 67 patients with a multidisciplinary diagnosis of IPF and from 45 age-matched and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Buffy coat was isolated according to standard procedures and at least 20 million cells were stained with different monoclonal antibodies for the detection of CEC, EPC and circulating fibrocytes. For the detection of CEC and EPC, cells were stained with anti-CD45, anti-CD34, anti-CD133, anti-CD14, anti-CD309 and with the viability probe Far-Red LIVE/DEAD. For the detection of circulating fibrocytes, cells were first stained with LIVE/DEAD and the following monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD3, anti-CD19, anti-CD45, anti-CD34 and anti-CD14, then cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-collagen I monoclonal antibodies.\nPatients with IPF displayed almost undetectable levels of circulating fibrocytes, low levels of CEC, and normal levels of EPC. Patients treated with nintedanib displayed higher levels of CEC, but lower levels of endothelial cells expressing CD309 (the type II receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor). Treatment with both nintedanib and pirfenidone reduced the percentage of CEC and circulating fibrocytes.\nLevels of CEC were reduced in patients with IPF as compared to healthy individuals. The anti-fibrotic treatments nintedanib and pirfenidone further reduced CEC levels.

Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in rats, and cells were directly transplanted into the border regions of ischemic heart tissue.\nCulture of UCB mononuclear cells yielded two distinct types of cells by morphology after 2 weeks in the same culture conditions. These cells were identified as late EPC and MSC, and each was intramyocardially injected into rat hearts after induction of MI. Echocardiography and histologic analyses demonstrated that both EPC and MSC improved cardiac function and enhanced vascularization, although fibrosis was reduced only in the EPC transplanted hearts. Different paracrine factors were enriched in EPC and MSC. However, once injected into the hearts, they induced similar types of paracrine factors in the heart. Transplanted EPC or MSC were mostly localized at the perivascular areas. This study demonstrated that EPC and MSC can be simultaneously derived from UCB under the same initial culture conditions, and that common paracrine factors are involved in the repair of MI.\nLate EPC and MSC are effective for infarct repair, apparently mediated through common humoral mechanisms.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2015-11-10", "authors": ["Sung-WhanKim", "Hong LianJin", "Seok-MinKang", "SinyoungKim", "Kyung-JongYoo", "YangsooJang", "Hyun OkKim", "Young-supYoon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.10.110"}

{"title": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) in tumor growth and progression: Lessons learned from pediatric oncology.", "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a sympathetic neurotransmitter with pleiotropic actions, many of which are highly relevant to tumor biology. Consequently, the peptide has been implicated as a factor regulating the growth of a variety of tumors. Among them, two pediatric malignancies with high endogenous NPY synthesis and release - neuroblastoma and Ewing sarcoma - became excellent models to investigate the role of NPY in tumor growth and progression. The stimulatory effect on tumor cell proliferation, survival, and migration, as well as angiogenesis in these tumors, is mediated by two NPY receptors, Y2R and Y5R, which are expressed in either a constitutive or inducible manner. Of particular importance are interactions of the NPY system with the tumor microenvironment, as hypoxic conditions commonly occurring in solid tumors strongly activate the NPY/Y2R/Y5R axis. This activation is triggered by hypoxia-induced up-regulation of Y2R/Y5R expression and stimulation of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), which converts NPY to a selective Y2R/Y5R agonist, NPY(3-36). While previous studies focused mainly on the effects of NPY on tumor growth and vascularization, they also provided insight into the potential role of the peptide in tumor progression into a metastatic and chemoresistant phenotype.

{"title": "Pristimerin inhibits angiogenesis in adjuvant-induced arthritic rats by suppressing VEGFR2 signaling pathways.", "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive, inflammatory autoimmune disease. As RA progresses, the hyperplastic synovial pannus creates a hypoxic, inflammatory environment that induces angiogenesis. Further vascularization of the synovial tissue promotes pannus growth and continued infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes, thus perpetuating the disease. Pristimerin inhibits inflammation and tumor angiogenesis. The present study focused on the inhibition of angiogenesis by Pristimerin in adjuvant-induced arthritic rats and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results clearly demonstrate for the first time that Pristimerin significantly reduces vessel density in synovial membrane tissues of inflamed joints and reduces the expression of pro-angiogenic factors in sera, including TNF-\u03b1, Ang-1, and MMP-9. Pristimerin also decreased the expression of VEGF and p-VEGFR2 in the synovial membrane, whereas the total amount of VEGFR2 remained unchanged. Pristimerin suppressed the sprouting vessels of the aortic ring and inhibited VEGF-induced HFLS-RA migration in vitro. Pristimerin also inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation, migration and tube formation by HUVECs, blocked the autophosphorylation of VEGF-induced VEGFR2 and consequently downregulated the signaling pathways of activated PI3K, AKT, mTOR, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 in VEGF-induced HUVECs. Our results indicate that Pristimerin suppressed synovial angiogenesis in our rat model and in vitro by interrupting the targeting of VEGFR2 activation.

{"title": "In vitro maturation of large-scale cardiac patches based on a perfusable starter matrix by cyclic mechanical stimulation.", "abstract": "The ultimate goal of tissue engineering is the generation of implants similar to native tissue. Thus, it is essential to utilize physiological stimuli to improve the quality of engineered constructs. Numerous publications reported that mechanical stimulation of small-sized, non-perfusable, tissue engineered cardiac constructs leads to a maturation of immature cardiomyocytes like neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or induced pluripotent stem cells/embryonic stem cells derived self-contracting cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of mechanical stimulation and perfusion on the maturation process of large-scale (2.5\u00d74.5cm), implantable cardiac patches based on decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) or Biological Vascularized Matrix (BioVaM) and a 3-dimensional construct containing neonatal rat heart cells. Application of cyclic mechanical stretch improved contractile function, cardiomyocyte alignment along the stretch axis and gene expression of cardiomyocyte markers. The development of a complex network formed by endothelial cells within the cardiac construct was enhanced by cyclic stretch. Finally, the utilization of BioVaM enabled the perfusion of the matrix during stimulation, augmenting the beneficial influence of cyclic stretch. Thus, this study demonstrates the maturation of cardiac constructs with clinically relevant dimensions by the application of cyclic mechanical stretch and perfusion of the starter matrix.\nConsidering the poor endogenous regeneration of the heart, engineering of bioartificial cardiac tissue for the replacement of infarcted myocardium is an exciting strategy. Most techniques for the generation of cardiac tissue result in relative small-sized constructs insufficient for clinical applications. Another issue is to achieve cardiomyocytes and tissue maturation in culture. Here we report, for the first time, the effect of mechanical stimulation and simultaneous perfusion on the maturation of cardiac constructs of clinical relevant dimensions, which are based on a perfusable starter matrix derived from porcine small intestine.

{"title": "Multiphasic, Multistructured and Hierarchical Strategies for Cartilage Regeneration.", "abstract": "Cartilage tissue is a complex nonlinear, viscoelastic, anisotropic, and multiphasic material with a very low coefficient of friction, which allows to withstand millions of cycles of joint loading over decades of wear. Upon damage, cartilage tissue has a low self-reparative capacity due to the lack of neural connections, vascularization, and a latent pool of stem/chondro-progenitor cells. Therefore, the healing of articular cartilage defects remains a significant clinical challenge, affecting millions of people worldwide. A plethora of biomaterials have been proposed to fabricate devices for cartilage regeneration, assuming a wide range of forms and structures, such as sponges, hydrogels, capsules, fibers, and microparticles. In common, the fabricated devices were designed taking in consideration that to fully achieve the regeneration of functional cartilage it is mandatory a well-orchestrated interplay of biomechanical properties, unique hierarchical structures, extracellular matrix (ECM), and bioactive factors. In fact, the main challenge in cartilage tissue engineering is to design an engineered device able to mimic the highly organized zonal architecture of articular cartilage, specifically its spatiomechanical properties and ECM composition, while inducing chondrogenesis, either by the proliferation of chondrocytes or by stimulating the chondrogenic differentiation of stem/chondro-progenitor cells. In this chapter we present the recent advances in the development of innovative and complex biomaterials that fulfill the required structural key elements for cartilage regeneration. In particular, multiphasic, multiscale, multilayered, and hierarchical strategies composed by single or multiple biomaterials combined in a well-defined structure will be addressed. Those strategies include biomimetic scaffolds mimicking the structure of articular cartilage or engineered scaffolds as models of research to fully understand the biological mechanisms that influence the regeneration of cartilage tissue.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2015-11-08", "authors": ["Clara RCorreia", "Rui LReis", "Jo\u00e3o FMano"], "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-22345-2_9"}
{"title": "Engineering Pre-vascularized Scaffolds for Bone Regeneration.", "abstract": "Survival of functional tissue constructs of clinically relevant size depends on the formation of an organized and uniformly distributed network of blood vessels and capillaries. The lack of such vasculature leads to spatio-temporal gradients in oxygen, nutrients and accumulation of waste products inside engineered tissue constructs resulting in negative biological events at the core of the scaffold. Unavailability of a well-defined vasculature also results in ineffective integration of scaffolds to the host vasculature upon implantation. Arguably, one of the greatest challenges in engineering clinically relevant bone substitutes, therefore, has been the development of vascularized bone scaffolds. Various approaches ranging from peptide and growth factor functionalized biomaterials to hyper-porous scaffolds have been proposed to address this problem with reasonable success. An emerging alternative to address this challenge has been the fabrication of pre-vascularized scaffolds by taking advantage of biomanufacturing techniques, such as soft- and photo-lithography or 3D bioprinting, and cell-based approaches, where functional capillaries are engineered in cell-laden scaffolds prior to implantation. These strategies seek to engineer pre-vascularized tissues in vitro, allowing for improved anastomosis with the host vasculature upon implantation, while also improving cell viability and tissue development in vitro. This book chapter provides an overview of recent methods to engineer pre-vascularized scaffolds for bone regeneration. We first review the development of functional blood capillaries in bony structures and discuss controlled delivery of growth factors, co-culture systems, and on-chip studies to engineer vascularized cell-laden biomaterials.

In tumor progression, it has primarily an immunosuppressive role but is also thought to regulate neovascularization. However, the latter role is still in debate. When B16F10 melanoma was subcutaneously injected into CD73 knockout mice, changes in the tumor vasculature were not always observed. However, we demonstrated earlier that the growth and vascularization of B16F10 melanoma in CD73 knockout mice depend on the low presence of CD73 on tumor cells. To further analyze the role of CD73 on tumor growth and vascularization, we compared the changes in B16F10 melanoma subcutaneously injected into right flank of wild-type mice, CD73 knockout mice lacking host CD73 only, and CD73 knockout mice with tumor cell CD73 either inhibited with AOPCP (adenosine \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene 5'-diphosphate) or permanently knocked down through genetic modification. We report here that both inhibition and knockdown of tumor CD73 further inhibited tumor growth compared to host CD73 knockout alone. MAP-kinase signaling pathway activation also decreased more strongly in the stable knockdown. There was a significant reduction in the angiogenic activation of blood microvessels as observed by decreased anti-VEGFR2 staining. Stable CD73 knockdown also reduced endothelial cell proliferation as measured by anti-CD105 staining. However, only chemical inhibition with AOPCP significantly augmented the reduction in intratumoral microvessel density induced by host CD73 knockout. Such reduction was not observed when tumor CD73 was knocked down due to the much slower tumor growth and decreased oxygen demand as indicated by the low expression of Bad, a hypoxia marker. Decreased CD73 activity also led to the decreased expression of angiogenic factors, including VEGF and bFGF that was only partially reversed by hypoxia in tumors treated with AOPCP. Both inhibition and knockdown of tumor CD73 significantly decreased tumor macrophage infiltration and induced microenvironment changes, thereby influencing MI or MII macrophage polarization. Additionally, tumor cell CD73 is important in metastasis formation through adenosine-independent attachment to endothelium. We conclude that even low tumor cell CD73 expression has an undeniable role in melanoma progression, including the regulation of many aspects of angiogenesis. CD73 is thus a viable target in anti-angiogenic melanoma therapy.", "journal": "The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology", "date": "2015-11-08", "authors": ["PatrycjaKosza\u0142ka", "MonikaGo\u0142u\u0144ska", "MarcinStanis\u0142awowski", "AleksandraUrban", "GrzegorzStasi\u0142oj\u0107", "MarceliMajewski", "PiotrWierzbicki", "Andrzej CSk\u0142adanowski", "JacekBigda"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biocel.2015.10.003"}
{"title": "Relationships of peripheral IGF-1, VEGF and BDNF levels to exercise-related changes in memory, hippocampal perfusion and volumes in older adults.", "abstract": "Animal models point towards a key role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in mediating exercise-induced structural and functional changes in the hippocampus. Recently, also platelet derived growth factor-C (PDGF-C) has been shown to promote blood vessel growth and neuronal survival. Moreover, reductions of these neurotrophic and angiogenic factors in old age have been related to hippocampal atrophy, decreased vascularization and cognitive decline. In a 3-month aerobic exercise study, forty healthy older humans (60 to 77years) were pseudo-randomly assigned to either an aerobic exercise group (indoor treadmill, n=21) or to a control group (indoor progressive-muscle relaxation/stretching, n=19). As reported recently, we found evidence for fitness-related perfusion changes of the aged human hippocampus that were closely linked to changes in episodic memory function. Here, we test whether peripheral levels of BDNF, IGF-I, VEGF or PDGF-C are related to changes in hippocampal blood flow, volume and memory performance. Growth factor levels were not significantly affected by exercise, and their changes were not related to changes in fitness or perfusion. However, changes in IGF-I levels were positively correlated with hippocampal volume changes (derived by manual volumetry and voxel-based morphometry) and late verbal recall performance, a relationship that seemed to be independent of fitness, perfusion or their changes over time. These preliminary findings link IGF-I levels to hippocampal volume changes and putatively hippocampus-dependent memory changes that seem to occur over time independently of exercise. We discuss methodological shortcomings of our study and potential differences in the temporal dynamics of how IGF-1, VEGF and BDNF may be affected by exercise and to what extent these differences may have led to the negative findings reported here.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2015-11-08", "authors": ["AnneMaass", "SandraD\u00fczel", "TanjaBrigadski", "MoniqueGoerke", "AndreasBecke", "UweSobieray", "KatjaNeumann", "MartinL\u00f6vd\u00e9n", "UlmanLindenberger", "LarsB\u00e4ckman", "R\u00fcdigerBraun-Dullaeus", "D\u00f6rteAhrens", "Hans-JochenHeinze", "Notger GM\u00fcller", "VolkmarLessmann", "MichaelSendtner", "EmrahD\u00fczel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.10.084"}

{"title": "The Role of Ultrasound Imaging of Callus Formation in the Treatment of Long Bone Fractures in Children.", "abstract": "In the process of diagnosis and treatment of fractures, an X-ray study is typically performed. In modern medicine very important is the development of new diagnostic methods without adverse effects on the body. One of such techniques is ultrasound imaging. It has a high value in imaging most areas of the body, including the musculoskeletal system. Reports on the use of ultrasound in the evaluation of the callus are rare and this could be a method equivalent to or even better than standard radiographs. The aim of the study was to analyze the correlation of ultrasound with radiographs in imaging of callus formation after fractures of long bones in children and to analyze the correlation of vascular resistance index (RI) and the degree of vascularization of the callus with a subjective radiological assessment of the bone union quality.\nThe prospective study was planned to qualify 50 children treated for long bones fractures of the arm, forearm, thigh and lower leg. Ultrasound diagnosis was carried out using a Philips iU22 camera equipped with a linear probe with 17-5-MHz resolution and MSK Superficial program. During ultrasound examination measurements of the callus were performed. Using the Power Doppler callus vascularity was visualized and vascular resistance index (RI) was measured. The same measurements were made within the corresponding area of the healthy limb. The results obtained by ultrasound were compared with radiograph measurements and with the subjective assessment of the callus quality.\nPreliminary results were developed on a group of 24 patients, where 28 fractured bones and 28 corresponding healthy bones were examined. Fifteen boys and 9 girls participated in the study. The average age at injury was, respectively, 11 and 9 years. In both groups fractures without displacement were the most frequent. A similar frequency was observed in fractures requiring reposition and subperiosteal fractures. In contrast, fractures with a slight displacement of the fragments, were 3 times more common in girls. Statistical analysis of the measurements of length and width of the callus demonstrated that the differences between results obtained in the ultrasound in comparison with X-rays were not statistically significant. Moreover, preliminary results showed a significantly higher degree of vascularization of the callus than of the healthy periosteum.\nPreliminary results indicate the high efficacy of ultrasound in the evaluation of callus formation after fractures of long bones in children and the possibility of its alternative use to X-ray examinations.", "journal": "Polish journal of radiology", "date": "2015-11-07", "authors": ["MagdalenaWawrzyk", "JanSokal", "EwaAndrzejewska", "Przemys\u0142awPrzewratil"], "doi": "10.12659/PJR.894548"}

Vascularization-flow index and volumetric PI values were determined from the 440 static 3D data sets contained in these STIC data sets. Additionally, 3 sets of radio-frequency data were acquired for offline processing of different wall motion filter values for PRF values of 0.6, 3.3, and 10 kHz.\nWe constructed VFI curves and observed 2 patterns: a flattened pattern with a low PRF and a triphasic pattern with a high PRF, correlating with the known pulsed wave Doppler profile of this vessel. Volumetric PI values were around 0 for low PRF settings and increased with increasing PRF. Analysis of the radiofrequency data showed that increasing wall motion filter values gradually filtered out the low-velocity power Doppler signals while retaining the higher-velocity ones, allowing the distinction of integrated power Doppler signal velocity throughout the cardiac cycle.\nWe conclude that the PRF and wall motion filter dramatically influence 3D power Doppler indices and the volumetric PI, and the use of PRF values in which minimum VFI values are measured during the diastolic phase in the spectral Doppler wave may validate the use of the volumetric PI.", "journal": "Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine", "date": "2015-11-07", "authors": ["Andre HMiyague", "Theo ZPavan", "Carlos ASoares", "LucDe Catte", "Carolina ONastri", "Alec WWelsh", "Wellington PMartins"], "doi": "10.7863/ultra.15.01021"}

{"title": "Cellular and Molecular Inflammatory Profile of the Choroid Plexus in Depression and Suicide.", "abstract": "The inflammatory hypothesis of depression is one of the main theories that endeavors to explain and describe the underlying biological mechanisms of depression and suicide. While mounting evidence indicates altered peripheral and central inflammatory profiles in depressed patients and suicide completers, little is known about how peripheral and central inflammation might be linked in these contexts. The choroid plexus (ChP), a highly vascularized tissue that produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lacks a blood-brain-barrier, is an interface between peripheral and central immune responses. In the present study, we investigated the cellular and molecular inflammatory profile of the ChP of the lateral ventricle in depressed suicides and psychiatrically healthy controls. Gene expression of macrophages, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and various factors implicated in immune cell trafficking were measured; and density of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1-positive (Iba1+) macrophages associated with the ChP epithelial cell layer (ECL) was examined. Significant downregulations of the genes encoding interleukin 1\u00df (IL1\u00df), a pro-inflammatory acute-phase protein; intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), a protein implicated in immune cell trafficking in the ChP; and IBA1, a monocyte/macrophage marker; were detected in depressed suicides as compared to controls. No difference in the density of Iba1+ macrophages associated with the ChP ECL was observed. While interpretation of these findings is challenging in the absence of corroborating data from the CSF, peripheral blood, or brain parenchyma of the present cohort, we hypothesize that the present findings reflect a ChP compensatory mechanism that attenuates the detrimental effects of chronically altered pro-inflammatory signaling caused by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u00df, peripherally and/or centrally.

Here we report on the in vivo performance of implanted glucose sensors coated with Dexamethasone-loaded (Dex-loaded) porous coatings employed to mediate the tissue-sensor interface. Two animal studies were conducted to (1) characterize the tissue modifying effects of the porous Dex-loaded coatings deployed on sensor surrogate implants and (2) investigate the effects of the same coatings on the in vivo performance of Medtronic MiniMed SOF-SENSOR\u2122 glucose sensors. The tissue response to implants was evaluated by quantifying macrophage infiltration, blood vessel formation, and collagen density around implants. Sensor function was assessed by measuring changes in sensor sensitivity and time lag, calculating the Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) for each sensor treatment, and performing functional glucose challenge test at relevant time points. Implants treated with porous Dex-loaded coatings diminished inflammation and enhanced vascularization of the tissue surrounding the implants. Functional sensors with Dex-loaded porous coatings showed enhanced sensor sensitivity over a 21-day period when compared to controls. Enhanced sensor sensitivity was accompanied with an increase in sensor signal lag and MARD score. These results indicate that Dex-loaded porous coatings were able to elicit an attenuated tissue response, and that such tissue microenvironment could be conducive towards extending the performance window of glucose sensors in vivo.\nIn the present article, a coating to extend the functionality of implantable glucose sensors in vivo was developed. Our study showed that the delivery of an anti-inflammatory agent with the presentation of micro-sized topographical cues from coatings may lead to improved long-term glucose sensor function in vivo. We believe that improved function of sensors treated with the novel coatings was a result of the observed decreases in inflammatory cell density and increases in vessel density of the tissue adjacent to the devices. Furthermore, extending the in vivo functionality of implantable glucose sensors may lead to greater adoption of these devices by diabetic patients.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-11-06", "authors": ["Suzana GVallejo-Heligon", "Nga LBrown", "William MReichert", "BruceKlitzman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.10.045"}

VCAs have several immunological peculiarities, which make inaccurate a direct extrapolation of all rules established for solid organs.\nDespite their bone marrow content, VCA do not induce chimerism in recipient and are therefore not spontaneously tolerated. Skin compartment of VCA contains a high density of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), some with self-renewal capacity. Donor APCs are responsible for continuous direct allosensitization of recipient's T cells that explains the high incidence of skin T-cell-mediated rejection and their occurrence beyond 1 year.Regenerative capability of the skin prevents the development of chronic rejection of this compartment as long as immunosuppression is maintained. In contrast, VCA can develop graft arteriosclerosis, which could be because of T cell and/or chronic antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). VCA recipients can indeed develop donor-specific antibodies (DSA). Whether DSA can also trigger acute AMR of VCA remains to be clarified.\nA better understanding of the specificities of the immunopathology of VCA rejection should pave the way for the rationalization of immunosuppressive strategies aiming at optimizing long-term outcome.", "journal": "Current opinion in organ transplantation", "date": "2015-11-05", "authors": ["OlivierThaunat", "LionelBadet", "Val\u00e9rieDubois", "JeanKanitakis", "PalminaPetruzzo", "EmmanuelMorelon"], "doi": "10.1097/MOT.0000000000000242"}

{"title": "A Brachioradialis Splitting Approach Sparing the Pronator Quadratus for Volar Plating of the Distal Radius.", "abstract": "Fractures of the distal radius account for up to 15% of all extremity fractures. Volar plating has become more popular, as it allows locking plate technology to be applied. Traditionally, access to the volar radius has been achieved through the approach of Henry using the interval between flexor carpi radialis and the radial artery, involving incising the radial border of the pronator quadratus (PQ). With this approach, PQ repair is difficult, and when attempted is often incomplete or tenuous, as it is a direct muscle-to-muscle repair. Theoretical advantages of repairing the PQ include the provision of plate coverage, a protective gliding layer, a well-vascularized coverage of the fracture fragments, and a protective barrier against deep infection in the case of superficial infection. Techniques have been developed to try and improve on the Henry approach. We have developed a surgical approach to volar plating that utilizes the anatomic relationship between brachioradialis and PQ in a way that allows simple and stable reattachment of the PQ muscle. We have termed the technique the \"Brachioradialis splitting\" approach.

The clinical and radiological characteristics of the hemorrhagic patients were retrospectively described and analyzed. All the hemorrhagic patients underwent encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis procedure. Digital subtraction angiography was performed to evaluate the efficacy of vascularization. Clinical follow-up outcomes were obtained through clinical visits, telephone, or letter interview.\nIn our study, the ratio of female to male patients in the hemorrhagic group was significantly higher than the ischemic group (2:1 versus 0.9:1; P<0.05). The most frequent hemorrhagic location was intraventricular hemorrhage (n=22, 73%). In addition, significantly greater dilatation of the anterior choroidal artery and the posterior communicating artery were seen in the hemorrhagic group (P<0.05). Good or fair vascularization were observed in all the 15 children with digital subtraction angiography follow-up. Clinical outcomes showed that 25 of 30 (83%) patients had no disability (modified Rankin scale score, 0 and 1); 1 patient (3.3%) died of recurrent hemorrhagic stroke.\nThe presence of anterior choroidal artery and posterior communicating artery dilation may be associated with the bleeding episode in the children with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease.

{"title": "Cell rearrangement in transplanted human islets.", "abstract": "The major feature of the human pancreatic islet architecture is the organization of endocrine cells into clusters comprising central \u03b2 cells and peripheral \u03b1 cells surrounded by vasculature. To have an insight into the mechanisms that govern this unique islet architecture, islet cells were isolated, and reaggregation of \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells into islet-like structures (pseudoislets) after culture or transplantation into mice was studied by immunohistology. The pseudoislets formed in culture displayed an unusual cell arrangement, contrasting with the transplanted pseudoislets, which exhibited a cell arrangement similar to that observed in native pancreatic islet subunits. The pattern of revascularization and the distribution of extracellular matrix around transplanted pseudoislets were alike to those observed in native pancreatic islets. This organization of transplanted pseudoislets occurred also when revascularization was abolished by treating mice with an anti-VEGF antibody, but not when contact with extracellular matrix was prevented by encapsulation of pseudoislets within alginate hydrogel. These results indicate that the maintenance of islet cell arrangement is dependent on in vivo features such as extracellular matrix but independent of vascularization.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2015-11-05", "authors": ["VanessaLavallard", "MathieuArmanet", "G\u00e9raldineParnaud", "J\u00e9r\u00e9myMeyer", "CharlotteBarbieux", "ElisaMontanari", "Rapha\u00eblMeier", "PhilippeMorel", "ThierryBerney", "DomenicoBosco"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.15-273805"}
{"title": "The differentiation of hMSCs counteracts their migration capability and pro-angiogenic effects in vitro.", "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been applied therapeutically in numerous clinical trials. The pro-angiogenic effects of hMSCs, as well as their strong tumor tropism, have been shown both in vitro and in vivo. Some studies suggest using hMSCs as potential drug-carriers for tumor therapy. In previous investigations by our group, the pro-tumorigenic effects of hMSCs on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were shown. However, the influence of hMSCs on tumor vascularization as well as the possibility of its inhibition are yet to be elucidated. The cytokine patterns of the HNSCC cell line FaDu, native hMSCs (hMSCs-nat), hMSCs differentiated into adipocytes (hMSCs-adip) and osteocytes (hMSCs-ost) were evaluated. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were co-cultured with FaDu cells, hMSCs-nat, hMSCs-adip and hMSCs-ost. The capillary tube formation assay was applied. Furthermore, the migration capability of hMSCs-nat, hMSCs-adip and hMSCs-ost towards FaDu cells was measured in a Transwell system. Spheroids were cultured from hMSCs-nat, FaDu cells and DiI-labeled HUVECs. FaDu cells, hMSCs-nat, hMSCs-adip and hMSCs-ost released a wide range of cytokines and growth factors, e.g., IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GRO and MCP. In the capillary tube formation assay, HUVECs generated significantly longer tubes after co-cultivation with hMSCs-nat as compared to HUVECs alone and FaDu. Differentiation into adipocytes and osteocytes counteracted the tube formation. The adipogenic differentiation did not alter hMSC motility, whereas osteogenic differentiation significantly inhibited hMSC migration. Generation of multi-cellular spheroids from hMSCs-nat, FaDu cells and DiI-labeled HUVECs was possible. Florescence microscopy revealed that all HUVECs were present in the spheroid core. Taken together, hMSCs-nat have a pro-angiogenic effect. The effects are counteracted by the differentiation of hMSCs towards osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. The differentiation of stem cells into different lineages may be a promising solution to generating carriers for cancer therapy without pro-tumorigenic properties.", "journal": "Oncology reports", "date": "2015-11-05", "authors": ["AScherzed", "SHackenberg", "KFroelich", "KRak", "PSchendzielorz", "TGehrke", "RHagen", "NKleinsasser"], "doi": "10.3892/or.2015.4383"}

Superficial epigastric fat flaps were evaluated on the right side as control and on the left side as the stress (ischemic or congestive) condition in the same rat in order to avoid biases. Stress conditions were made by obstructing the pedicle vessels with a vascular clip for 3 hours. The volumes of these flaps were measured weekly. After 12 weeks of measurements, the CD of harvested flaps was examined in histologically immunostained sections. Percent changes in the body-weight-corrected flap volume [cFV(%)], the stress/control ratio [FV-ratio(%)], and the stress/control ratio of CD (CD-ratio) were defined.\ncFV(%) 12 weeks after surgery was 34.7\u2009\u00b1\u200926.7 in the control flaps and 13.2\u2009\u00b1\u200910.5 in the stress flaps.

{"title": "Surgical anatomy of the insular cortex.", "abstract": "The objective of the study was to investigate the surgical anatomy of the insular cortex, morphology and vascularization of the insula and adjacent opercula in terms of transsylvian and transcortical approaches, and identification of the permissible anatomical boundaries for resection of glial tumors of the insula.\nThe study was conducted on 18 anatomical specimens fixed in an alcohol-glycerol solution. Perfusion of the internal carotid artery with red latex was used to study the arterial system. Dissection of the arteries and Sylvian fissure, investigation of the morphological features of the opercula as well as simulation of the transsylvian and transcortical approaches to the insula were performed using a surgical microscope, in a certain sequence.\nIn the trassylvian approach, the anteroinferior part of the insula (including the limen insulae) is the most technically easy-to-reach area, whereas the superior parts of the insula are the most difficult-to-reach areas. With the tumor localized in the superior insula, the transcortical approach may be recommended that, unlike the transsylvian approach, does not require a significant retraction of the brain matter and provides a larger surgical corridor. The transcortical approach, regardless the insular region, provides a better surgical view and workspace compared to the transsylvian approach. However, the previous approach is characterized by less access to the important anatomical landmarks such as the peri-insular sulci, limen insulae, and lateral lenticulostriate arteries. Furthermore, the approach requires dissection of the brain matter of the frontal and temporal lobes.\nDetailed knowledge of the surgical anatomy of the insular region provides correct intraoperative identification of a number of the major anatomical landmarks (limen insulae, peri-insular sulci, most distal lenticulostriate artery) and facilitates choosing the proper surgical

{"title": "Operator-related risk factors of anastomotic leaks after colorectal surgery: an up-to-date.", "abstract": "Digestive fistulas are a major complication after digestive surgery. Anastomotic leakage increases the hospitalization time, the prognosis and survival rate after colorectal surgical interventions. The factors involved are either systemic (determined by the patients' co-morbidities), or local (vicious surgical technique or the injuries produced by the disease that requires the anastomosis). Although there are many studies regarding the risk factors of anastomotic leaks, there is no consensus for the role played by each one of them in the healing process of digestive sutures. Most authors sustain that the importance of systemic factors is secondary, the main role being played by the surgeon and the local conditions of the anastomosis. Knowledge of the risk factors can lead to new methods of reducing the incidence of anastomotic leaks by improving vascularization, limiting the tension and the duration of surgery, and by new surgical techniques used for digestive sutures.", "journal": "Clujul medical (1957)", "date": "2015-11-04", "authors": ["AlexandraCaziuc", "George CalinDindelegan", "AurelMironiuc"], "doi": "10.15386/cjmed-420"}

ROS-responsive nanoparticles containing SDF-1\u03b1 were prepared through a multiple emulsion solvent evaporation method. The loading capacity, stability, activity of the encapsulated protein, toxicity, and in vivo distribution of these nanoparticles were determined. These nanoparticles were administered by intravenous infusion to mice with full-thickness skin defects to study their effects on the directed chemotaxis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, wound vascularization, and wound healing.\nThe synthesized ROS-reactive organic polymer poly-(1,4-phenyleneacetone dimethylene thioketal) possessed a molecular weight of approximately 11.5 kDa with a dispersity of 1.97. ROS-responsive nanoparticles containing SDF-1\u03b1 were prepared with an average diameter of 110 nm and a drug loading capacity of 1.8%. The encapsulation process showed minimal effects on the activity of SDF-1\u03b1, and it could be effectively released from the nanoparticles in the presence of ROS. Encapsulated SDF-1\u03b1 could exist for a long time in blood. In mice with full-thickness skin defects, SDF-1\u03b1 was effectively released and targeted to the wounds, thus promoting the chemotaxis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells toward the wound and its periphery, inducing wound vascularization, and accelerating wound healing.", "journal": "International journal of nanomedicine", "date": "2015-11-04", "authors": ["TaoTang", "HaoJiang", "YuanYu", "FangHe", "Shi-zhaoJi", "Ying-yingLiu", "Zhong-shanWang", "Shi-chuXiao", "CuiTang", "Guang-YiWang", "Zhao-FanXia"], "doi": "10.2147/IJN.S88384"}

We aimed at to define the predictive factors for malignancy and factors associated with triage to surgery.\nThe records of all patients with nodules who underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and classified by Bethesda reporting system as AUS/FLUS between 2011 and 2015 at our institution were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to select independent factors associated with thyroid cancer and with triage to surgery. Using independent risk factors for malignancy predictive index categories were created.\nOf the 485 patients who were classified as AUS/FLUS on initial FNAB, 153 underwent surgery with the associated malignancy rate of 22.8%. The malignancy rates for AUS/FLUS patients with and without repeat FNAB were 37.5% and 16.2%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that solid structure, microcalcification, hypoechogenicity, increased vascularization, and irregular margin were found to be significant and independent risk factors associated for malignancy, and solid structure, microcalcifications, increased nodule size (\u22652\u00a0cm) and younger patient age (<65 years) were associated with triage to surgery.\nOur findings showed that using predictive factors for malignancy in AUS/FLUS category as risk indices, an important proportion of patients (35%) who had nodules without any risk factors could be spared unnecessary surgery.

{"title": "Biodegradable magnesium screws and vascularized iliac grafting for displaced femoral neck fracture in young adults.", "abstract": "Avascular necrosis of femoral head and nonunion is a major complication after the treatment of displaced femoral neck fracture in young adults. The purpose of this study was to introduce a new technique using biodegradable magnesium screws and vascularised iliac grafting for displaced femoral neck fracture in young adults.\nTotally 19 patients with displaced femoral neck fracture treated with this technique were retrospectively reviewed. The major steps of this technique included the harvesting of vascularized iliac graft, fixing of the fracture and biodegradable magnesium screws combined with vascularized iliac grafting implantation.\nAll patients were followed for an average of 16 months (range: 8-24 months). Clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated. In 18 cases (94.7 %), the hip union was achieved at an average duration of 4.1 months (range: 3.6-5 months). The nonunion was observed in 1 hip (5.3 %) and the revision to a hip replacement was conducted after twelve months of the operation.

Since vascularization is a complex process guided by multiple synergic factors, it is critical to analyze the specific role that different experimental parameters play in the generation of physiological tissues. Our goals were to design a novel meso-scale model bridging the gap between microfluidic and macro-scale studies, and high-throughput screen the effects of multiple variables on the vascularization of bone-mimicking tissues. We investigated the influence of endothelial cell (EC) density (3-5 Mcells/ml), cell ratio among ECs, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteo-differentiated MSCs (1:1:0, 10:1:0, 10:1:1), culture medium (endothelial, endothelial\u00a0+\u00a0angiopoietin-1, 1:1 endothelial/osteo), hydrogel type (100%fibrin, 60%fibrin+40%collagen), tissue geometry (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02, 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0mm(3)). We optimized the geometry and oxygen gradient inside hydrogels through computational simulations and we analyzed microvascular network features including total network length/area and vascular branch number/length. Particularly, we employed the \"Design of Experiment\" statistical approach to identify key differences among experimental conditions. We combined the generation of 3D functional tissue units with the fine control over the local microenvironment (e.g. oxygen gradients), and developed an effective strategy to enable the high-throughput screening of multiple experimental parameters. Our approach allowed to identify synergic correlations among critical parameters driving microvascular network development within a bone-mimicking environment and could be translated to any vascularized tissue.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-11-03", "authors": ["SimoneBersini", "MaraGilardi", "ChiaraArrigoni", "GiuseppeTal\u00f2", "MorenoZamai", "LuigiZagra", "ValeriaCaiolfa", "MatteoMoretti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.10.057"}

Although suturing remains the gold standard for anastomosing vessels, it is difficult to place sutures correctly through collapsed lumen, making the procedure prone to failure. Here, we report a multiphase transitioning peptide hydrogel that can be injected into the lumen of vessels to facilitate suturing. The peptide, which contains a photocaged glutamic acid, forms a solid-like gel in a syringe and can be shear-thin delivered to the lumen of collapsed vessels (where it distends the vessel) and the space between two vessels (where it is used to approximate the vessel ends). Suturing is performed directly through the gel. Light is used to initiate the final gel-sol phase transition that disrupts the hydrogel network, allowing the gel to be removed and blood flow to resume.

This journey witnessed the rise and demise of various developments, concepts, and procedures, while basic knowledge is still needed. Various periods can be defined in the past century, but the goals remain to obtain more accurate diagnosis through precise anatomic imaging, more controlled and faster tooth movement, more discreet appliances, and the balance of esthetics, function, and stability. The most recent technologic advances have buttressed these goals. Cone-beam computed tomography has brought 3-dimensional assessment to daily usage, albeit the original enthusiasm is tempered by the risk of additional radiation. Temporary anchorage devices or miniscrews have revolutionized orthodontic practice and loom as a solid cornerstone of orthodontic science. Decortication and microperforation promise to speed up tooth displacement by stimulating vascularization. The concept of the regional acceleratory phenomenon has touched upon even the timing of orthognathic surgery. The burden of esthetic appliances remains, with the demand for \"cosmetic\" appliances and clear aligners. Have these developments changed the face of orthodontics? Have we engaged in another turn wherein certain treatment modalities may fade, while others join mainstream applications?

This reaction produce reactive oxygen species able to induce cell death by apoptosis or necrosis, injured to the local vasculature, and exert important effects on the immune system.\nThe present work evaluated the clinical findings, histomorphological alterations and immunodetection of VEGF after PDT using chloro-aluminum phthalocyanine (AlClPc) entrapped in a lipid nanoemulsion in a split-mouth clinical trial.\nEight healthy volunteers with clinical indication for extraction were included in the study. Seven days before the extraction 40 ul of nanoemulsion AlClPc 5\u03bcM was injected into gingival tissue followed by irradiation with diode laser, the contralateral side was used as control. Tissue specimens were removed seven days after the PDT and divided into two groups (test and control groups) for histological and immunohistochemical analysis.

AMI was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary venous retroperfusion was performed at 1 wk after AMI. Twenty-eight animals were randomized into four groups: saline, bFGF+saline, saline+MSCs and bFGF+MSCs. Echocardiography was performed before AMI, at 7 d post-AMI and 40 d after retroperfusion. Apoptotic cardiomyocytes in the border zone of the ischemic region were evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling. Vascular endothelial growth factor and factor VIII concentrations were measured by western blotting. The left ventricular end-systolic volume increased significantly, whereas the left ventricular ejection fraction and global and segmental strain values decreased significantly after AMI. After retroperfusion, the strain values of the infarct zone, but not conventional echocardiographic parameters, were significantly different between control and bFGF+MSC groups. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis decreased, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor and factor VIII concentrations were higher in the bFGF+MSC, bFGF and MSC groups. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was well correlated with the strain values. Although retrograde coronary venous infusion of bFGF and MSCs promoted neo-vascularization of the infarcted myocardium and inhibited apoptosis, there was only a slight strain improvement without a substantial increase in\u00a0global cardiac functions.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2015-11-02", "authors": ["Qi-WeiSun", "LeiZhen", "QinWang", "YanSun", "JiaoYang", "Yi-JiaLi", "Rong-JuanLi", "NingMa", "Zhi-AnLi", "Lu-YaWang", "Shao-PingNie", "YaYang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2015.09.010"}

In this study, two variations of human full-thickness skin constructs were examined. Type KCFB consists of keratinocytes (epidermal equivalent) and fibroblasts that were embedded in a collagen matrix (dermal equivalent). Type KCFB-EC consists of keratinocytes as well as fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. The epidermal equivalent of KCFB-EC constructs underwent cellular alterations in their differentiation possibly induced by the presence of endothelial cells. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of endothelial cells, i.e., endothelialization of the dermal equivalent on the differentiation of keratinocytes by comparing the morphology and ultrastructure of the two types of skin constructs, as well as to excised normal human skin.\nThe differentiation of keratinocytes is influenced by the presence of endothelial cells.\nKCFB constructs (keratinocytes, fibroblasts) and KCFB-EC skin constructs(kera-tinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells) were prepared according to K\u00fcchler et al.

After two weeks, the skin constructs were processed for analysis by light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (TEM), followed by quantitative, semi-quantitative as well as qualitative assessment. For comparison, analysis by LM and TEM of excised normal human skin was also performed.\nBoth KCFB and KCFB-EC skin constructs and the human skin had all strata of stratified soft-cornified epidermis present. The comparison of the respective layers of the skin constructs brought the following characteristics to light: The KCFB-EC constructs had significantly more mitotic cells in the stratum spinosum, more cell layers in the stratum granulosum and more keratohyalin granules compared to KCFB skin constructs. Additionally, the epidermal architecture was unorganized in the endothelialized constructs and features of excessive epidermal differentiation appeared in KCFB-EC skin constructs.\nThe endothelialization of the dermal equivalent caused changes in the differentiation of the epidermis of KCFB-EC skin constructs that may be interpreted as an unbalanced, i.e., uncontrolled or enhanced maturation process.", "journal": "Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation", "date": "2015-11-01", "authors": ["MKhiao In", "LWallmeyer", "SHedtrich", "K CRichardson", "JPlendl", "SKaessmeyer"], "doi": "10.3233/CH-151988"}

{"title": "Is Tracheal Transplantation Possible With Cryopreserved Tracheal Allograft and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy? An Experimental Study.", "abstract": "Allografts have achieved prominence for tracheal reconstruction because of their natural physiologic and anatomic structure, which preserves respiratory tract flexibility and lumen patency. The immunomodulatory effects of cryopreservation prevent tracheal allograft rejection. In addition, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) accelerates wound healing by promoting epithelization and neovascularization. This experimental study investigated the early and late effects of HBOT on cryopreserved tracheal allografts (CTAs).\nThe study used 33 outbred Wistar rats weighing 300 to 350 g as allograft transplantation donors and recipients. Among these, 22 recipient rats were randomly assigned to the HBOT (n = 11) and control (n = 11) groups. Rats in the HBOT group were treated with 100% oxygen for 60 minutes at 2.5 atmospheres of absolute pressure for 7 days. Recipient rats in both groups were euthanized at 1 week (n = 5) and 4 weeks (n = 6) after transplantation, defined as the early and late periods, respectively.\nIn the early period, no significant histopathologic differences were observed between groups (p > 0.05). However, microscopic evaluation of the control group during the late period showed low epithelization of the CTA. In contrast, microscopic evaluation of the HBOT group during this same period revealed epithelium covering the transplanted CTA lumen. Significant epithelization and vascularization and significantly reduced inflammation and fibrosis were found in the HBOT group compared with the control group (p < 0.05).\nHBOT may be effective in tracheal reconstruction by increasing epithelization and neovascularization after extended tracheal resection.

Furthermore, the 40kDa [(3)H]PEG-moiety was given separately to rats by single i.v. bolus doses, to investigate if the pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent. For both compounds, plasma pharmacokinetics, distribution and excretion pathways were investigated, based on total radioactivity measurements ([(3)H]N8-GP: 0.17-4.1mg/kg;~1300-30,000U/kg, PEG load of ~0.03-0.7mg/kg); ([(3)H]PEG: 0.6, 1, 12, 100 and 200mg/kg). The plasma concentration of the intact N8-GP conjugate was also measured by ELISA. After single i.v. administration to rats, both [(3)H]N8-GP and [(3)H]PEG were shown to be widely distributed, mainly in highly vascularized tissues, with the lowest levels of radioactivity found in the CNS. Though a slow elimination of radioactivity was observed over the 12-week study period, approximately half of the radioactive dose of either compound was removed from the body 1week post-dose. The radioactivity was eliminated mainly via the kidney into urine but also via the liver into feces, with a larger fraction found in the feces for [(3)H]N8-GP. Elimination of the 40kDa PEG-moiety was shown to be dose-dependent with faster elimination at lower dose levels. The clinical dose of N8-GP provides a substantially lower PEG exposure (50-75U/kg; PEG load of <0.002mg/kg) when compared to the PEG doses investigated in this paper (0.03-200mg/kg).

{"title": "Potential of dietary nitrate in angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction with impaired bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) is the hallmark in the development of cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction leads to atherosclerosis, characterized by chronic inflammation of the arterial wall and stepwise narrowing of the vessel lumen. Atherosclerosis causes deprivation of adequate tissue blood flow with compromised oxygen supply. To overcome this undersupply, remodeling of the vascular network is necessary to reconstitute and sustain tissue viability. This physiological response is often not sufficient and therapeutic angiogenesis remains an unmet medical need in critical limb ischemia or coronary artery disease. Feasible approaches to promote blood vessel formation are sparse. Administration of pro-angiogenic factors, gene therapy, or targeting of microRNAs has not yet entered the daily practice. Nitric oxide is an important mediator of angiogenesis that becomes limited under ischemic conditions and the maintenance of NO availability might constitute an attractive therapeutic target. Until recently it was unknown how the organism provides NO under ischemia. In recent years it could be demonstrated that NO can be formed independently of its enzymatic synthesis in the endothelium by reduction of inorganic nitrite under hypoxic conditions. Circulating nitrite derives from oxidation of NO or reduction of inorganic nitrate by commensal bacteria in the oral cavity. Intriguingly, nitrate is a common constituent of our everyday diet and particularly high concentrations are found in leafy green vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, or beetroot. Evidence suggests that dietary nitrate supplementation increases the regenerative capacity of ischemic tissue and that this effect may offer an attractive nutrition-based strategy to improve ischemia-induced revascularization.

{"title": "Cancer therapeutic potential of combinatorial immuno- and vasomodulatory interventions.", "abstract": "Currently, most of the basic mechanisms governing tumour-immune system interactions, in combination with modulations of tumour-associated vasculature, are far from being completely understood. Here, we propose a mathematical model of vascularized tumour growth, where the main novelty is the modelling of the interplay between functional tumour vasculature and effector cell recruitment dynamics. Parameters are calibrated on the basis of different in vivo immunocompromised Rag1(-/-) and wild-type (WT) BALB/c murine tumour growth experiments. The model analysis supports that tumour vasculature normalization can be a plausible and effective strategy to treat cancer when combined with appropriate immunostimulations. We find that improved levels of functional tumour vasculature, potentially mediated by normalization or stress alleviation strategies, can provide beneficial outcomes in terms of tumour burden reduction and growth control. Normalization of tumour blood vessels opens a therapeutic window of opportunity to augment the antitumour immune responses, as well as to reduce intratumoral immunosuppression and induced hypoxia due to vascular abnormalities. The potential success of normalizing tumour-associated vasculature closely depends on the effector cell recruitment dynamics and tumour sizes.

{"title": "Cross-Talk Between TGF-\u03b2 and NADPH Oxidases During Liver Fibrosis and Hepatocarcinogenesis.", "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a pathological consequence of chronic liver diseases and results from the progressive accumulation of altered extracellular matrix, highly enriched in type I and III fibrillar collagens. In advanced stages, fibrosis leads to cirrhosis, defined by abnormal liver architecture and altered vascularization. Clinical consequences of cirrhosis are failure in the synthetic function of the liver, portal hypertension, high susceptibility to infection and high risk to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The TGF-\u03b2 family of cytokines plays essential roles in many cellular processes, including growth inhibition, cell migration and invasion, extracellular matrix remodelling and immune suppression, being involved in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. However, TGF-\u03b2s are often continuously overexpressed in disease states, such as fibrosis, inflammation and cancer, and they play pivotal roles in the sequence of events leading to end-stage of chronic liver diseases. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical intermediates in liver physiology and pathology. When the equilibrium between ROS generation and the antioxidant defence of the cell is disrupted, it results in an oxidative stress process. The NADPH oxidase (NOX) family has emerged in the last years as important source of ROS in liver pathologies. Interestingly, NOXes mediate TGF-\u03b2 actions in liver cells, such as regulation of hepatocyte growth and death, as well as activation of hepatic stellate cells to myofibroblasts, key executers of the fibrotic process. In this review we will update the relevant and differential roles of NOX isoforms during liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis, their cross-talk with the TGF-\u03b2 pathway and their potential as therapeutic targets for these diseases.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "date": "2015-10-30", "authors": ["EvaCrosas-Molist", "EstherBertran", "IsabelFabregat"], "doi": "10.2174/1381612821666151029112126"}

It commonly occurs in the gnathic bones of the face and spine, and has a male predominance. To date, only 26 cases of epithelioid multinodular osteoblastoma have been reported and described in detail in the literature. Lucas et al. (Hum Pathol 25:117-134, 1994) described 43 cases of a variant of osteoblastoma that he termed epithelioid multifocal osteoblastoma. These both likely represent the same entity. Here, we report another case of this rare variant of osteoblastoma. An 18-year-old male patient presents with a periapical radiolucency in the region of vital tooth #30. The surgeon's differential diagnosis for this radiolucent lesion was ameloblastoma versus cyst. An incisional biopsy of the lesion revealed well-vascularized fibrous connective tissue containing a multinodular tumor composed of collections of epithelioid cells with osteoblastic differentiation surrounding zones of hyalinization and bony trabeculae. Multinucleated giant cells and rare typical mitotic figures were noted. Additionally present within the tumor were clusters of epithelioid osteoblasts without bony trabeculae. Residual immature viable bone trabeculae were noted surrounding the tumor. A diagnosis of epithelioid multinodular osteoblastoma was rendered. In this paper we present a rare case of epithelioid multinodular osteoblastoma of the mandible, provide a general review of the literature, and highlight the unique histological features that help differentiate this tumor from tumors classified as conventional osteoblastoma, aggressive osteoblastoma, pseudoanaplastic osteoblastoma and, most importantly, low-grade or osteoblastoma-like osteosarcoma.", "journal": "Head and neck pathology", "date": "2015-10-29", "authors": ["ShrutiKashikar", "MichaelSteinle", "ReneeReich", "PaulFreedman"], "doi": "10.1007/s12105-015-0665-6\n10.1097/PAS.0b013e31803402e7\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2005.09.004\n10.1007/s12105-012-0356-5\n10.1007/s12105-010-0234-y\n10.1001/archsurg.1932.01160160022002\n10.1016/0046-8177(94)90267-4\n10.1007/s00256-004-0826-2\n10.1046/j.1365-2559.1997.5870820.x\n10.1007/s00256-001-0458-8"}

First, 10 sonographic features, including shape, border, margin, internal content, echogenicity, microcalcifications, posterior echo, halo, vascularization distribution, and vascularization degree, were defined, and all nodules were retrospectively evaluated.

Third, a total score for each nodule was obtained after the assigned weightings of the suspicious features were summed. Fourth, the malignancy rate of each total score was calculated. Then a modified version of the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) was established with reference to the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System.\nSeven independent features associated with malignancy were a taller-than-wide shape, an obscure border, an irregular margin, solid internal content, marked hypoechogenicity and hypoechogenicity, microcalcifications, and an internal vascularization distribution.

{"title": "Vascularized composite allotransplantation: a new concept in musculoskeletal regeneration.", "abstract": "Over the past 20\u00a0years, the fields of biomaterial sciences and tissue engineering have evolved into new clinically relevant applications including regenerative medicine and cell based therapies. Tissue engineering therapies are based on different types of materials and scaffolds combined with cells and submitted to engineering processes in order to create bio-scaffolds which will improve or replace biological functions. Despite the effort, only a few therapies, such as bone, cartilage and nerve, succeeded in clinical applications. Furthermore, the major drawback in standard application of these therapies was the critical size defects which could be covered with engineered materials, as well as inability to provide sustainable vascular supply to the created bio-scaffolds. In 1998, the first successful hand transplantation was performed in France, and the field of vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) was introduced into the armamentarium of reconstructive surgery (Dubernard in Am J Transplant 5(6):1580-1, 2005; Petruzzo et al. in Am J Transplant 6(7):1718-24, 2006; Lanzetta et al. in Transplantation 79(9):1210-4, 2005). As a result, a new generation of transplants including hand, face, larynx abdominal wall, lower extremities and penile transplantation became available to patients who had lost these unique organs and were previously unable to achieve restored function using standard reconstructive procedures. Ethical debate on the need for life-long immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection of the VCA overshadowed the success of face and hand transplants. Thus, a new, challenging opportunity developed to combine approaches of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and ultimately restore the framework, function, aesthetics and survival of the VSA transplants.

The therapy might be conservative or surgical by a resection of the symphysis and involved parts of the pubic bone. Nevertheless, this resection might lead to an anterior instability impairing the posterior arch and the sacroiliac joints in the aftermath.\nHere, we report about a 50-year-old women suffering from osteitis pubis treated by wedge resection of the symphysis and parts of the pubic bone. To maintain stability and for local antibiotic treatment a cement spacer was implemented. By clinical inconspicuous findings and the patient's desire, no further surgery was performed. However, 2 years after surgery the spacer dislocated and the patient complained about pain in the posterior arch due to an impaired mobility. Reconstruction surgery was planned including the bridging of the accrued space with a vascularized double-barrelled fibula graft, plate osteosynthesis and rectus abdominis flap coverage. The performed surgery led to pain relief and increased mobility.\nThe present case highlights the possible complication of surgical treated osteitis pubis leading to anterior arch instability affecting the posterior arch and thus impairing pelvic ring stability and patient mobility.

{"title": "Enhanced angiogenesis in ischemic skeletal muscle after transplantation of cell sheets from baculovirus-transduced adipose-derived stromal cells expressing VEGF165.", "abstract": "Cell therapy using adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSC) is an intensively developing approach to promote angiogenesis and regeneration. Administration technique is crucial and among others minimal constructs - cell sheets (CS) have certain advantages. Delivery of CS allows transplantation of cells along with matrix proteins to facilitate engraftment. Cells' therapeutic potential can be also increased by expression of proangiogenic factors by viral transduction. In this work we report on therapeutic efficacy of CS from mouse ADSC transduced to express human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 a/a isoform (VEGF165), which showed potency to restore perfusion and protect tissue in a model of limb ischemia.\nMouse ADSC (mADSC) isolated from C57 male mice were expanded for CS formation (10(6)cells per CS). Constructs were transduced to express human VEGF165 by baculoviral (BV) system. CS were transplanted subcutaneously to mice with surgically induced limb ischemia and followed by laser Doppler perfusion measurements. At endpoint animals were sacrificed and skeletal muscle was evaluated for necrosis and vessel density; CS with underlying muscle was stained for apoptosis, proliferation, monocytes and blood vessels.\nUsing BV system and sodium butyrate treatment we expressed human VEGF165 in mADSC (production of VEGF165 reached\u2009\u2248\u200925-27 ng/ml/10(5) cells) and optimized conditions to ensure cells' viability after transduction. Implantation of mock-transduced CS resulted in significant improvement of limb perfusion, increased capillary density and necrosis reduction at 2 weeks post-surgery compared to untreated animals. Additional improvement of blood flow and angiogenesis was observed after transplantation of VEGF165-expressing CS indicating enhanced therapeutic potential of genetically modified constructs.

A lozenge-shaped flap about 9\u00a0cm long and 4\u00a0cm wide was raised along the axis of the radial artery. Dissection of the flap was carried out subfascially. We searched perforators going into the flap and the nutritive branches for the tendon sheath of FCR were dissected up to their origin from the radial artery. Their distance from the scaphoid tubercle was recorded.\nWe found nutritive branches for all the length of the tendon. The mean number of perforators going into the tendon sheath was 9.5 (range 8-12). Constant sizeable branches larger than 0.2\u00a0mm were identified from the scaphoid tubercle to the myotendinous junction; their distance from the scaphoid tubercle ranged between 0.5 and 12.5\u00a0cm. We found an average 0.8 perforators/cm of tendon (range 0.7-1). The donor sites were always closed primarily.\nNutrient branches of the radial artery for the tendon of FCR were constantly found.

{"title": "Formation of vascular network structures within cardiac cell sheets from mouse embryonic stem cells.", "abstract": "Bioengineered cardiac tissues represent a promising strategy for regenerative medicine. However, methods of vascularization and suitable cell sources for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have not yet been established. In this study, we developed methods for the induction of vascular endothelial cells from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells using three-dimensional (3D) suspension culture, and fabricated cardiac cell sheets with a pre-vascularized structure by co-culture of mouse ES cell-derived endothelial cells. After induction, isolated CD31+ cells expressed several endothelial cell marker genes and exhibited the ability to form vascular network structures similar to CD31+ cells from neonatal mouse heart. Co-culture of ES cell-derived CD31+ cells with ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes and dermal fibroblasts resulted in the formation of cardiac cell sheets with microvascular network formation. In contrast, microvascular network formation was reduced in co-cultures without cardiomyocytes, suggesting that cardiomyocytes within the cell sheet might enhance vascular endothelial cell sprouting. Polymerase chain reaction array analysis revealed that the expression levels of several angiogenesis-related genes, including fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), were up-regulated in co-culture with cardiomyocytes compared with cultures without cardiomyocytes. The microvascular network in the cardiac sheets was attenuated by treatment with anti-FGF1 antibody. These results indicate that 3D suspension culture methods may be used to prepare functional vascular endothelial cells from mouse ES cells, and that cardiomyocyte-mediated paracrine effects might be important for fabricating pre-vascularized cardiac cell sheets.", "journal": "Regenerative therapy", "date": "2015-10-27", "authors": ["ShinakoMasuda", "KatsuhisaMatsuura", "MieAnazawa", "TakahiroIwamiya", "TatsuyaShimizu", "TeruoOkano"], "doi": "10.1016/j.reth.2015.10.002"}

The macular angiography scan protocol covered a 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm area. The focus of angiography analysis were two retinal layers: superficial vascular network and deep vascular network. The following vascular morphological congestion parameters were assessed in the vein occlusion area in both the superficial and deep networks: foveal avascular zone enlargement, capillary non-perfusion occurrence, microvascular abnormalities appearance, and vascular congestion signs. Image analyses were performed by 2 masked observers and interobserver agreement of image analyses was 0.90 (\u03ba = 0.225, P < 0.01).\nIn both superficial and deep network of BRVO, a decrease in capillary density with foveal avascular zone enlargement, capillary non-perfusion occurrence, and microvascular abnormalities appearance was observed (P < 0.01). The deep network showed the main vascular congestion at the boundary between healthy and nonperfused retina.\nOptical coherence tomography angiography in BRVO allows to detect foveal avascular zone enlargement, capillary nonperfusion, microvascular abnormalities, and vascular congestion signs both in the superficial and deep capillary network in all eyes. Optical coherence tomography angiography technology is a potential clinical tool for BRVO diagnosis and follow-up, providing stratigraphic vascular details that have not been previously observed by standard fluorescein angiography.

{"title": "Vascularization mediated by mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow and adipose tissue: a comparison.", "abstract": "Tissue-engineered constructs are promising to overcome shortage of organ donors and to reconstruct at least parts of injured or diseased tissues or organs. However, oxygen and nutrient supply are limiting factors in many tissues, especially after implantation into the host. Therefore, the development of a vascular system prior to implantation appears crucial. To develop a functional vascular system, different cell types that interact with each other need to be co-cultured to simulate a physiological environment in vitro. This review provides an overview and a comparison of the current knowledge of co-cultures of human endothelial cells (ECs) with human adipose tissue-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) or bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in three dimensional (3D) hydrogel matrices. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), BMSCs or ASCs, have been shown to enhance vascular tube formation of ECs and to provide a stabilizing function in addition to growth factor delivery and permeability control for ECs. Although phenotypically similar, MSCs from different tissues promote tubulogenesis through distinct mechanisms. In this report, we describe differences and similarities regarding molecular interactions in order to investigate which of these two cell types displays more favorable characteristics to be used in clinical applications. Our comparative study shows that ASCs as well as BMSCs are both promising cell types to induce vascularization with ECs in vitro and consequently are promising candidates to support in vivo vascularization.", "journal": "Cell regeneration (London, England)", "date": "2015-10-27", "authors": ["KarolinePill", "SandraHofmann", "HeinzRedl", "WolfgangHolnthoner"], "doi": "10.1186/s13619-015-0025-8\n10.1016/j.copbio.2010.06.005\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.091\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0474\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.06.006\n10.1186/2045-824X-6-13\n10.1016/j.addr.2011.01.009\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003688\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0106\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2013.02.006\n10.1080/14653240600855905\n10.3727/096368910X492571\n10.3727/096368912X653129\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.178590\n10.1182/blood-2011-08-375188\n10.1101/cshperspect.a006429\n10.1161/01.RES.0000255691.76142.4a\n10.1161/01.RES.0000255690.03436.ae\n10.1006/mvre.1997.2045\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.151456\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.158014\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00039-4\n10.1038/35025215\n10.1152/ajpheart.00096.2013\n10.1006/excr.1998.3936\n10.1126/science.275.5302.964\n10.1182/blood-2005-04-1509\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.09.057\n10.1056/NEJMra022361\n10.1161/01.RES.0000091259.84556.D5\n10.1002/biot.201200199\n10.1007/s10456-014-9439-0\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.01.010\n10.1111/j.1445-2197.2009.04852.x\n10.1007/s10456-012-9257-1\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.01.013\n10.1161/01.HYP.33.6.1379\n10.1371/journal.pone.0035579\n10.1371/journal.pone.0022086\n10.1371/journal.pone.0028352\n10.5301/ijao.5000229\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.09.007\n10.1083/jcb.141.3.805\n10.1182/blood-2007-10-118273\n10.1002/jcp.24056\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0635\n10.1007/s10456-010-9194-9\n10.1002/term.1620\n10.1007/s00441-003-0745-x\n10.1083/jcb.95.1.340\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0342\n10.1002/term.389\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.190926\n10.1182/blood-2008-09-181362"}

Here, we report on a 39-year-old woman with an EIH that repeatedly hemorrhaged and swelled and was ultimately surgically removed. In June 2012, the patient visited her local doctor, complaining of headaches. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan identified a small hemorrhage of approximately 7 mm in her right basal ganglia, and a wait-and-see approach was adopted. Six months later, her headaches recurred. She was admitted to our department after MRI showed tumor lesions accompanying the intermittent hemorrhaging in the right basal ganglia. After admission, hemorrhaging was again observed, with symptoms progressing to left-sided hemiplegia and fluctuating consciousness; thus, a craniotomy was performed. No obvious abnormal blood vessels were observed on the preoperative cerebral angiography. We accessed the lesion using a transcortical approach via a right frontotemporal craniotomy and removed the subacute hematoma by extracting the encapsulated tumor as a single mass. Subsequent pathological examinations showed that the hematoma exhibited abnormal internal vascularization and was covered with a capsule formed from growing capillaries and accumulating collagen fibers, suggesting that it was an EIH. No lingering neurological symptoms were noted upon postoperative follow-up. This type of hematoma expands slowly and is asymptomatic, with reported cases consisting of patients that already have neurological deficits due to progressive hematoma growth.

Their progressive expression at key stages and in specific cell types determines the fertility of adult males, influencing testis development and controlling germline differentiation. BMPs are essential for the interactive instructions between multiple cell types in the early embryo that drive initial specification of gamete precursors. In the nascent foetal testis, several ligands including Nodal, TGF-\u03b2s, Activins and BMPs, serve as key masculinizing switches by regulating male germline pluripotency, somatic and germline proliferation, and testicular vascularization and architecture. In postnatal life, local production of these factors determine adult testis size by regulating Sertoli cell multiplication and differentiation, in addition to specifying germline differentiation and multiplication.

This study introduces a new biodegradable material, Ologen\u2122 collagen matrix (OCM), to repair scleral thinning as an alternative to preserved scleral tissue, and evaluates the long-term outcomes of OCM for ocular surface reconstruction surgery.\nTwo cases of possibly mitomycin C (MMC)-associated marked scleral thinning after pterygium excision with 0.02 % topical MMC for 2-weeks were included in this study. An OCM graft at the scleral thinning area and conjunctival autograft (CAU) were performed on both patients. The scleral defect size was measured and its margin was marked with a biopsy punch. The margin of the scleral thinning area was trimmed by Vannas scissors and the OCM was cut using a circular-shape biopsy punch of the same size. The OCM was sutured with a recipient scleral wall using 10-0 nylon interrupted sutures. Free CAU was harvested from the superonasal bulbar conjunctiva with a punch biopsy 1-mm larger in diameter than that of the OCM. The previously sutured OCM bed was covered with CAU and the graft was secured with 10-0 nylon interrupted sutures. Both patients were examined periodically for over two years by assessing graft thickness and surface vascularization using a slit lamp biomicroscope. Reepithelialization of the ocular surface was observed within three to six days after surgery. Ocular discomfort and inflammation ceased in both patients as the ocular surface quickly stabilized. The entire graft site remained intact and provided a good healthy ocular surface with fluorescein stain negative intact epithelium and good vascularization of grafted conjunctiva. Epithelial defects and scleral thinning did not recur in either patient over the two year follow-up period.\nFor treatment of a possibly MMC-associated scleral necrosis following the surgical excision of the pterygium, an OCM graft with CAU is highly recommended for good clinical outcomes and low recurrence rates.

Disruption of normal CSF circulation and turnover is believed to contribute to the development of many diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, ischemic and traumatic brain injury, and neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Recent insights into CSF biology suggesting that CSF and interstitial fluid exchange along a brain-wide network of perivascular spaces termed the 'glymphatic' system suggest that CSF circulation may interact intimately with glial and vascular function to regulate basic aspects of brain function. Dysfunction within this glial vascular network, which is a feature of the aging and injured brain, is a potentially critical link between brain injury, neuroinflammation and the development of chronic neurodegeneration. Ongoing research within this field may provide a powerful new framework for understanding the common links between neurodegenerative, neurovascular and neuroinflammatory disease, in addition to providing potentially novel therapeutic targets for these conditions.

Vascularized proximal fibular epiphyseal transfers (VFET) have been popularized over non-vascularized transfers and prosthesis. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of VFET and its associated complications.\nElectronic database of PubMed MEDLINE was searched between 1970 and 2014. Studies reporting VFET for distal radius reconstruction in children (<15 years old) with clear reporting of technique (vascular pedicle) and objective outcome measures were included. Outcomes of interest were rate of graft growth, bone union and complications. A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was used to compare growth rates between pedicle types.\nFourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, representing 25 patients. Pedicles used were anterior tibial (44%), peroneal (16%), or bi-pedicled (40%) anastomosed in antegrade (64%) or reverse flow (36%) fashion. Among all pedicle types, best results were achieved using anterior tibial artery with reversed flow, yielding average growth rate of 0.83 cm/year (P\u2009=\u20090.01). Recipient complications included four premature epiphyseal plate closures, a flap loss, and six wrist radial deviations. Donor complications included six common peroneal nerve palsies (five temporary, a permanent), and a talocalcaneal instability. Overall complication rates between pedicle types were comparable (P\u2009=\u20090.062).\nVFET may be a surgical option capable of restoring joint function and axial growth potential in select patients. The reverse flow technique based on the anterior tibial artery may result in superior outcomes. However, the overall complication rate is high and permanent peroneal nerve palsy may result.\nIV \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Controlled release of fibrin matrix-conjugated platelet derived growth factor improves ischemic tissue regeneration by functional angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Sustained, local, low dose growth factor stimulus of target tissues/cells is believed to be of imminent importance in tissue regeneration and engineering. Recently, a technology was developed to bind growth factors to a fibrin matrix using the transglutaminase (TG) activity of factor XIIIa, thus allowing prolonged release through enzymatic cleavage. In this study we aimed to determine whether TG-PDGF.AB in fibrin could improve tissue regeneration in a standard ischemic flap model. In vitro determination of binding and release kinetics of TG-PDGF.AB allowed proof of concept of the developed binding technology. A single spray application of TG-PDGF.AB in fibrin matrix at a concentration of 10 and 100ng/ml significantly reduced ischemia-induced flap tissue necrosis in vivo on day 7 after ischemic impact compared to controls. TG-PDGF.AB at a concentration of 100ng/ml fibrin induced distinct angiogenesis as reflected by significantly improved tissue perfusion assessed by laser Doppler imaging as well as enhanced von Willebrand factor (vWF) protein expression determined by immunohistochemical means. In addition, significantly more mature microvessels were observed with 100ng/ml TG-PDGF.AB in fibrin compared to control and vehicle groups as evidenced by an improved smooth muscle actin (sma)/vWF protein ratio. In conclusion, PDGF.AB in a conjugated fibrin matrix effectively reduced ischemia-induced tissue necrosis, increased tissue perfusion and induced the growth of a mature and functional neovasculature. The sealing properties of the fibrin matrix in conjunction with the prolonged growth factor stimulus enabled by the TG-hook binding technology may present an innovative and suitable tool in tissue regeneration.\nIn our experimental study we elucidated recombinant platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) as a potential candidate in inducing angiogenesis. To avoid preterm growth factor degradation in vivo PDGF.AB was covalently linked to a fibrin scaffold using a bi-domain functionalized peptide (FXIII substrate site and plasmin cleavage site). This allowed PDGF binding to fibrin during spray application to the donor site and subsequent prolonged release via endogenous plasmin. This resulted in a mature vascular network thus enhancing tissue perfusion and consequently improved clinical outcome. With our present work we could certainly provide researchers and clinicians with an innovative versatile and reproducible technology not only to induce functional vascularity but also to improve attempts in tissue engineering in general by e.g. using different growth factors. Hence, we believe that this approach studied in the present work may provide a valuable input in an effort to drive the aim forward bringing experimental work in tissue engineering to clinic by using a clinically well characterized and used fibrin scaffold in combination with a human recombinant growth factor (fibrin scaffold linked with the specific binding technology).", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-10-27", "authors": ["RainerMittermayr", "PaulSlezak", "NicolasHaffner", "DanielSmolen", "JoachimHartinger", "AnnaHofmann", "JasonSchense", "DanielSpazierer", "J\u00f6rgGampfer", "AndreasGoppelt", "HeinzRedl"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.10.028"}

The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathological correlates, growth characteristics and molecular regulation of this aberrant form of graft angiogenesis.\nFetal lung xenografts, derived from 12 previable fetuses (15 to 22 weeks' gestation) and engrafted in the renal subcapsular space of SCID-beige mice, were analyzed 4 weeks posttransplantation for morphology, vascularization, proliferative activity and gene expression.\nFocal plexus-forming angiogenesis (PFA) was observed in 60/230 (26%) of xenografts. PFA was characterized by a complex network of tortuous nonsprouting vascular structures with low endothelial proliferative activity, suggestive of intussusceptive-type angiogenesis. There was no correlation between the occurrence of PFA and gestational age or time interval between delivery and engraftment. PFA was preferentially localized in the relatively hypoxic central subcapsular area. Microarray analysis suggested altered expression of 15 genes in graft regions with PFA, of which 7 are known angiogenic/lymphangiogenic regulators and 5 are known hypoxia-inducible genes. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed significant upregulation of SULF2, IGF2, and HMOX1 in graft regions with PFA.\nThese observations in human fetal lungs ex vivo suggest that postcanalicular lungs can switch from sprouting angiogenesis to an aberrant intussusceptive-type of angiogenesis that is highly reminiscent of BPD-associated dysangiogenesis.

Reconstruction of severely disfigured neck and face can be performed using the occipito-cervico-dorsal superthin flap that is harvested from the dorsal region and supercharged by the circumflex scapular vessels. We used bipedicled superthin free perforator flaps to reconstruct scar contractures on half of the face, whole face, or the whole chin-neck area in 17 postburn patients.\nThis case series report includes all 17 cases. Flaps in the dorsal area were designed. In all cases, one pedicle consisted of the circumflex scapular vessels. In 11, 5, and 1 flaps, the second pedicle consisted of contralateral posterior intercostal perforators (type 1), ipsilateral posterior intercostal perforators (type 2), and ipsilateral circumflex scapular vessels (type 3), respectively. Four patients underwent whole-face reconstruction after acid burn with type 1 or type 3 perforator. The recipient vessels were the superficial temporal vessels and contralateral or ipsilateral facial vessels. Intraoperatively, all adipose tissue in the flap, including between the 2 pedicles, was thinned by scissors before the pedicles were detached from the donor sites. Maximum flap size was 35\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009cm. Donor sites were covered by a split full-thickness skin graft. Flap survival and functional and cosmetic results were assessed retrospectively.\nFifteen of the 17 flaps survived completely. Two developed partial necrosis due to perforator thrombosis. Some patients developed hypertrophic scars around the flap, but these improved naturally over time.

It is debated whether this potentiation is related to a better drug delivery to the tumor due to the antiangiogenic effects on tumor vessel phenotype and functionality. We addressed this question by combining bevacizumab with paclitaxel on A2780-1A9 ovarian carcinoma and HT-29 colon carcinoma transplanted ectopically in the subcutis of nude mice and on A2780-1A9 and IGROV1 ovarian carcinoma transplanted orthotopically in the bursa of the mouse ovary. Paclitaxel concentrations together with its distribution by MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) were measured to determine the drug in different areas of the tumor, which was immunostained to depict vessel morphology and tumor proliferation. Bevacizumab modified the vessel bed, assessed by CD31 staining and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and potentiated the antitumor activity of paclitaxel in all the models. Although tumor paclitaxel concentrations were lower after bevacizumab, the drug distributed more homogeneously, particularly in vascularized, non-necrotic areas, and was cleared more slowly than controls. This happened specifically in tumor tissue, as there was no change in paclitaxel pharmacokinetics or drug distribution in normal tissues. In addition, the drug concentration and distribution were not influenced by the site of tumor growth, as A2780-1A9 and IGROV1 growing in the ovary gave results similar to the tumor growing subcutaneously. We suggest that the changes in the tumor microenvironment architecture induced by bevacizumab, together with the better distribution of paclitaxel, may explain the significant antitumor potentiation by the combination.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2015-10-24", "authors": ["MartaCesca", "LaviniaMorosi", "AlexanderBerndt", "IlariaFuso Nerini", "RobertaFrapolli", "PetraRichter", "AlessandraDecio", "OlafDirsch", "EdoardoMicotti", "SilviaGiordano", "MaurizioD'Incalci", "EnricoDavoli", "MassimoZucchetti", "RaffaellaGiavazzi"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0063"}

It is perceivable that granuloma cores could create conditions where bacilli persist and develop resistance. In this study we analyze drug delivery to granulomas by means of a nanoparticle delivery system. The model consists of two parts; the overall distribution of the nanoparticles is described by a simple circulatory model and this result is used in the second part, focusing on transport in a capillary lined with macrophages.

{"title": "Proteasomal inhibition sensitizes cervical cancer cells to mitomycin C-induced bystander effect: the role of tumor microenvironment.", "abstract": "Inaccessibility of drugs to poorly vascularized strata of tumor is one of the limiting factors in cancer therapy. With the advent of bystander effect (BE), it is possible to perpetuate the cellular damage from drug-exposed cells to the unexposed ones. However, the role of infiltrating tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), an integral part of the tumor microenvironment, in further intensifying BE remains obscure. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of mitomycin C (MMC), a chemotherapeutic drug, to induce BE in cervical carcinoma. By using cervical cancer cells and differentiated macrophages, we demonstrate that MMC induces the expression of FasL via upregulation of PPAR\u03b3 in both cell types (effector cells) in vitro, but it failed to induce bystander killing in cervical cancer cells. This effect was primarily owing to the proteasomal degradation of death receptors in the cervical cancer cells. Pre-treatment of cervical cancer cells with MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor, facilitates MMC-mediated bystander killing in co-culture and condition medium transfer experiments. In NOD/SCID mice bearing xenografted HeLa tumors administered with the combination of MMC and MG132, tumor progression was significantly reduced in comparison with those treated with either agent alone. FasL expression was increased in TAMs, and the enhanced level of Fas was observed in these tumor sections, thereby causing increased apoptosis. These findings suggest that restoration of death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway in tumor cells with concomitant activation of TAMs could effectively restrict tumor growth.", "journal": "Cell death & disease", "date": "2015-10-23", "authors": ["S VSingh", "A KAjay", "NMohammad", "PMalvi", "BChaube", "A SMeena", "M KBhat"], "doi": "10.1038/cddis.2015.292"}

D283hCD73 generated tumors with a reduced proliferative index, lower vascularization, the presence of differentiated cells and increased active caspase-3 expression. Prominent A1 adenosine receptor expression rates were detected in MB cells overexpressing ecto-5'-NT.\nThis work suggests that ecto-5'-NT promotes reduced tumor growth to reduce cell proliferation and vascularization, promote higher differentiation rates and initiate apoptosis, supposedly by accumulating adenosine, which then acts through A1 adenosine receptors.

As the liver may not represent an optimal transplantation site for Langerhans islets, we examined the potential of neonatal porcine islet-like clusters (NPICCs) to engraft in skeletal muscle as an alternative transplantation site.\nNeonatal porcine islet-like clusters were isolated from 2- to 5-day-old piglets and either transplanted under the kidney capsule (s.k.) or injected into the lower hindlimb muscle (i.m.) of streptozotocin-diabetic NOD-SCID IL2r\u03b3(-/-) (NSG) mice. Survival, vascularization, maturation, and functional activity were analyzed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing and immunohistochemical analyses.\nIntramuscular transplantation of NPICCs resulted in development of normoglycemia and restored glucose homeostasis. Time to reversal of diabetes and glucose tolerance (AUC glucose and AUC insulin) did not significantly differ as compared to s.k. transplantation. Intramuscular grafts exhibited rapid neovascularization and graft composition with cytokeratin-positive ductal cells and beta cells at post-transplant weeks 2 and 8 and after establishment of normoglycemia was comparable in both groups.\nIntramuscular injection represents a minimally invasive but efficient alternative for transplantation of NPICCs and, thus, offers an attractive alternative site for xenotransplantation approaches.

Our analysis in multiple GTKO pig-to-primate models of xenotransplantation has demonstrated that the anti-non-gal-\u03b1-1,3-gal (anti-non-Gal) xenoantibody response displays limited structural diversity. This allowed our group to identify an experimental compound which selectively inhibited induced anti-non-Gal IgM xenoantibodies. However, because this compound had an unknown safety profile, we extended this line of research to include screening small molecules with known safety profiles allowing rapid advancement to large animal models.\nThe NIH clinical collections of small molecules were screened by ELISA for their ability to inhibit xenoantibody binding to GTKO pig endothelial cells. Serum collected from non-immunosuppressed rhesus monkeys at day 14 post-injection with GTKO pig endothelial cells was utilized as a source of elicited xenoantibody for initial screening. Virtual small molecule screening based on xenoantibody structure was used to assess the likelihood that the identified small molecules bound xenoantibody directly. As a proxy for selectivity, ELISAs against tetanus toxoid and the natural antigens laminin, thyroglobulin, and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) were utilized to assess the ability of the identified reagents to inhibit additional antibody responses. The identified inhibitory small molecules were further tested for their ability to inhibit xenoantibody elicited in multiple settings, including rhesus monkeys pre-treated with an anti-non-Gal selective anti-idiotypic antibody, non-immunosuppressed rhesus monkeys immunized with wild-type fetal pig isletlike cell clusters, and non-immunosuppressed baboons transplanted with GTKO multiple transgenic pig kidneys.\nFour clinically relevant small molecules inhibited anti-non-Gal IgM binding to GTKO pig endothelial cells in vitro. Three of these drugs displayed a limited region of structural similarity suggesting they may inhibit xenoantibody by a similar mechanism. One of these, the anti-hypertensive agent clonidine, displayed only minimal inhibition of antibodies elicited by vaccination against tetanus toxoid or pre-existing natural antibodies against laminin, thyroglobulin, or ssDNA. Furthermore, clonidine inhibited elicited anti-non-Gal IgM from all animals that demonstrated a xenoantibody response in each experimental setting.\nClinically relevant small molecule drugs with known safety profiles can inhibit xenoantibody elicited against non-Gal antigens in diverse experimental xenotransplantation settings. These molecules are ready to be tested in large animal models. However, it will first be necessary to optimize the timing and dosing required to inhibit xenoantibodies in vivo.", "journal": "Xenotransplantation", "date": "2015-10-23", "authors": ["John MStewart", "Alice FTarantal", "Wayne JHawthorne", "Evelyn JSalvaris", "Philip JO'Connell", "Mark BNottle", "Anthony J Fd'Apice", "Peter JCowan", "MaryKearns-Jonker"], "doi": "10.1111/xen.12199"}
{"title": "Regulation and localization of vascular endothelial growth factor within the mammary glands during the transition from late gestation to lactation.", "abstract": "The vascular network within the developing mammary gland (MG) grows in concert with the epithelium to prepare for lactation, although the mechanisms coordinating this vascular development are unresolved. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) mediates angiogenesis and vascular permeability in the MG during pregnancy and lactation, where its expression is upregulated by prolactin. Given our previous finding that late-gestational hyperprolactinemia induced by domperidone (DOM) increased subsequent milk yield from gilts, we sought to establish changes in vascular development during late gestation and lactation in the MGs of these pigs and determine whether DOM altered MG angiogenesis and the factors regulating it. Gilts received either no treatment (n = 6) or DOM (n = 6) during late gestation, then had their MG biopsied from late gestation through lactation to assess microvessel density, VEGF-A distribution and messenger RNA expression, and aquaporin (AQP) gene expression. Microvessel density in the MG was unchanged during gestation then increased between days 2 and 21 of lactation (P < 0.05). The local expression of messenger RNA for VEGF-A120, VEGF-A147, VEGF-A164, VEGF-A164b, VEGF-A188, VEGF receptors-1 and -2, and AQP1 and AQP3 all generally increased during the transition from gestation to lactation (P < 0.05). Immunostaining localized VEGF-A to the apical cytoplasm of secretory epithelial cells, consistent with a far greater concentration of VEGF-A in colostrum and/or milk vs plasma (P < 0.0001). There was no effect of DOM on any of the variables analyzed. In summary, we found that vascular development in the MG increases during lactation in first-parity gilts and that VEGF-A is a part of the mammary secretome. Although late-gestational hyperprolactinemia increases milk yield, there was no evidence that it altered vascular development.", "journal": "Domestic animal endocrinology", "date": "2015-10-23", "authors": ["M KVanKlompenberg", "RManjar\u00edn", "C EDonovan", "J FTrott", "R CHovey"], "doi": "10.1016/j.domaniend.2015.09.003"}
{"title": "Preventing Allograft Rejection by Targeting Immune Metabolism.", "abstract": "Upon antigen recognition and co-stimulation, T lymphocytes upregulate the metabolic machinery necessary to proliferate and sustain effector function. This metabolic reprogramming in T cells regulates T cell activation and differentiation but is not just a consequence of antigen recognition. Although such metabolic reprogramming promotes the differentiation and function of T effector cells, the differentiation of regulatory T cells employs different metabolic reprogramming. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of glycolysis and glutamine metabolism might prevent graft rejection by inhibiting effector generation and function and promoting regulatory T cell generation. We devised an anti-rejection regimen involving the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), the anti-type II diabetes drug metformin, and the inhibitor of glutamine metabolism 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON).

We investigated the ability of LDL-DHA to reduce growth of orthotopic hepatomas in rats.\nAxC-Irish (ACI) rats were given intrahepatic injections of rat hepatoma cells (H4IIE); 24 tumor-bearing rats (mean tumor diameter, \u223c1 cm) were subject to a single hepatic artery injection of LDL nanoparticles (2 mg/kg) loaded with DHA (LDL-DHA), triolein (LDL-TO), or sham surgery controls. Tumor growth was measured by magnetic resonance imaging and other methods; tumor, liver, and serum samples were collected and assessed by histochemical, immunofluorescence, biochemical, and immunoblot analyses.\nThree days after administration of LDL-TO or sham surgery, the control rats had large, highly vascularized tumors that contained proliferating cells. However, rats given LDL-DHA had smaller, pale tumors that were devoid of vascular supply and >80% of the tumor tissue was necrotic. Four to 6 days after injection of LDL-DHA, the tumors were 3-fold smaller than those of control rats. The liver tissue that surrounded the tumors showed no histologic or biochemical evidence of injury. Injection of LDL-DHA into the hepatic artery of rats selectively deregulated redox reactions in tumor tissues by increasing levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, depleting and oxidizing glutathione and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and significantly\u00a0down-regulating the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase-4.

The second dorsal metacarpal artery is well-described for use in soft tissue and bony reconstruction, with recent cadaveric studies suggesting a reverse-flow second dorsal metacarpal artery bone flap could reach defects in the distal phalanx. The aim of the current report is to illustrate the use of this technique in reconstructing the distal digit in a traumatized index finger with bony loss of the middle third of the distal phalanx. A 49-year-old man presented with a traumatic circular saw injury to his left index finger, with the unique finding of distal phalanx bony loss to the middle third of this bone, with no associated disruption of palmar or dorsal structures. Reconstructive goals were solely that of bony reconstruction, with no soft tissue coverage required. A reverse SDMA vascularized bone flap was successfully used for reconstruction, with the vascularized bone flap mobilized on its reverse SDMA pedicle and pivoted at the level of the distal anastomoses between the palmar and dorsal metacarpal arteries. There was uncomplicated donor and recipient site closures, and good functional outcomes with the ability to retain full distal interphalangeal joint motion and force on distal pinch grip. This case shows that the reverse second dorsal metacarpal artery vascularized bone flap may be undertaken to reconstruct bony loss in the distal phalanx.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2015-10-21", "authors": ["Tanya LKatz", "David JHunter-Smith", "WarrenMatthew Rozen"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.22519"}

{"title": "Hypoxia Inhibits De Novo Vascular Assembly of Adipose-Derived Stromal/Stem Cell Populations, but Promotes Growth of Preformed Vessels.", "abstract": "Vascularization is critical for cell survival within tissue-engineered grafts. Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) are widely used in tissue engineering applications as they are a clinically relevant source of stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells. ASCs have previously been shown to self-assemble into pericyte-stabilized vascular networks in normoxic (20% O2) cultures. This capacity for de novo vascular assembly may accelerate graft vascularization in vivo rather than relying solely on angiogenic ingrowth. However, oxygen depletion within large cell-seeded grafts will be rapid, and it is unclear how this worsening hypoxic environment will impact the vascular assembly of the transplanted cells. The objectives of this study were to determine whether ASC-derived vessels could grow in hypoxia and to assess whether the vessel maturity (i.e., individual cells vs. preformed vessels) influenced this hypoxic response. Utilizing an in vitro vascularization model, ASCs were encapsulated within fibrin gels and cultured in vitro for up to 6 days in either normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (0.2% or 2% O2). In a subsequent experiment, vessels were allowed to preform in normoxia for 6 days before an additional 6 days of either normoxia or hypoxia. Viability, vessel growth, pericyte coverage, proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenic factor expression were assessed for each experimental approach. Vessel growth was dramatically inhibited in both moderate and severe hypoxia (47% and 11% total vessel length vs. normoxia, respectively), despite maintaining high cell viability and upregulating endogenous expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in hypoxia. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling indicated significantly reduced proliferation of endothelial cells in hypoxia. In contrast, when vascular networks were allowed to preform for 6 days in normoxia, vessels not only survived but also continued to grow more in hypoxia than those maintained in normoxia. These findings demonstrate that vascular assembly and growth are tightly regulated by oxygen tension and may be differentially affected by hypoxic conditions based on the maturity of the vessels. Understanding this relationship is critical to developing effective approaches to engineer viable tissue-engineered grafts in vivo.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

In this study, we aimed to compare preoperative thyroid functions, ultrasonography (US) features, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) results, and histopathological characteristics of PTC in patients with and without HT. Data of 919 PTC patients were reviewed retrospectively. The diagnosis of HT was based on histopathological examination and patients were grouped as HT and non-HT. There were 1321 PTC lesions in 919 patients among which 317 (34.5 %) had coexistent HT. There were no significant differences in nodule volume, longitudinal diameter, texture, echogenicity, marginal regularity, presence of microcalcification and hypoechoic halo, and peripheral vascularization in patients with and without HT (p\u2009>\u20090.05, for all parameters).

{"title": "Possible role of mechanical force in regulating regeneration of the vascularized fat flap inside a tissue engineering chamber.", "abstract": "In plastic and reconstructive surgery, adipose tissue is widely used as effective filler for tissue defects. Strategies for treating soft tissue deficiency, which include free adipose tissue grafts, use of hyaluronic acid, collagen injections, and implantation of synthetic materials, have several clinical limitations. With the aim of overcoming these limitations, researchers have recently utilized tissue engineering chambers to produce large volumes of engineered vascularized fat tissue. However, the process of growing fat tissue in a chamber is still relatively limited, and can result in unpredictable or dissatisfactory final tissue volumes. Therefore, detailed understanding of the process is both necessary and urgent. Many studies have shown that mechanical force can change the function of cells via mechanotransduction. Here, we hypothesized that, besides the inflammatory response, one of the key factors to control the regeneration of vascularized fat flap inside a tissue engineering chamber might be the balance of mechanical forces. To test our hypothesis, we intend to change the balance of forces by means of measures in order to make the equilibrium point in favor of the direction of regeneration. If those measures proved to be feasible, they could be applied in clinical practice to engineer vascularized adipose tissue of predictable size and shape, which would in turn help in the advancement of tissue engineering.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2015-10-21", "authors": ["YuanYe", "YiYuan", "FengLu", "JianhuaGao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2015.10.005"}
{"title": "Endothelial sprouting and network formation in collagen- and fibrin-based modular microbeads.", "abstract": "A modular tissue engineering approach may have advantages over current therapies in providing rapid and sustained revascularization of ischemic tissue. In this study, modular protein microbeads were prepared from pure fibrin (FIB) and collagen-fibrin composites (COL-FIB) using a simple water-in-oil emulsification technique. Human endothelial cells and fibroblasts were embedded directly in the microbead matrix. The resulting microbeads were generally spheroidal with a diameter of 100-200\u03bcm. Cell viability was high (75-80% viable) in microbeads, but was marginally lower than in bulk hydrogels of corresponding composition (85-90% viable). Cell proliferation was significantly greater in COL-FIB microbeads after two weeks in culture, compared to pure FIB microbeads. Upon embedding of microbeads in a surrounding fibrin hydrogel, endothelial cell networks formed inside the microbead matrix and extended into the surrounding matrix. The number of vessel segments, average segment length, and number of branch points was higher in FIB samples, compared to COL-FIB samples, resulting in significantly longer total vessel networks. Anastomosis of vessel networks from adjacent microbeads was also observed. These studies demonstrate that primitive vessel networks can be formed by modular protein microbeads containing embedded endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Such microbeads may find utility as prevascularized tissue modules that can be delivered minimally invasively as a therapy to restore blood flow to ischemic tissues.\nVascularization is critically important for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and materials that support and/or promote neovascularization are of value both for translational applications and for mechanistic studies and discovery-based research. Therefore, we fabricated small modular microbeads formulated from pure fibrin (FIB) and collagen-fibrin (COL-FIB) containing endothelial cells and supportive fibroblasts. We explored how cells encapsulated within these materials form microvessel-like networks both within and outside of the microbeads when embedded in larger 3D matrices. FIB microbeads were found to initiate more extensive sprouting into the surrounding ECM in vitro.

Understanding the diverse etiologies of female urethral stricture and loss is essential in evaluating and diagnosing patients.

We discuss the relevant female urethral anatomy, pathophysiology, diagnosis and evaluation of female urethral disorders, and current reconstructive techniques, as well as published outcomes data and potential future directions for female urethral reconstruction.\nWe reviewed articles published in English and indexed in the PubMed\u00ae, Embase\u00ae and Google Scholar\u2122 databases, and consulted textbooks. Key search terms used were female, urethra, urethral reconstruction, urethroplasty, pathology, stricture, vaginal flap, bladder flap, graft, dilation, pubovaginal sling, catheterization, imaging, tissue engineering and bioscaffold. We created a synopsis of relevant articles, including original research studies and reviews.\nUrethral tissue loss and strictures are caused by traumatic injuries, iatrogenic injuries and, rarely, infections and malignancies. A comprehensive patient history and physical examination are critical for diagnosis. Flexible cystoscopy, voiding cystourethrography and endovaginal magnetic resonance imaging can help to determine the surgical method of repair. Minimally invasive approaches to female urethral reconstruction are associated with poor outcomes. Definitive treatment options for repair of female urethral stricture include vaginal flap/wall urethroplasty, graft urethroplasty and distal urethrectomy with advancement meatoplasty. Repair techniques for urethral loss include primary closure, vaginal flap/wall urethroplasty and bladder flap urethroplasty. Vaginal flap approaches with well vascularized grafts and buccal mucosal grafts have high success rates. Tissue engineered grafts are being investigated as a novel treatment modality.\nFemale urethral reconstruction is complex, and one must carefully evaluate patients afflicted with urethral disorders. Urethral stricture and urethral loss have different etiologies. Variations of a standard approach might best address the condition of an individual patient.

Using membrane-bound prostaglandin E synthase 1 (mPges1(-/-)) mice, we show that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by host tissues is critical for B16 melanoma growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis to both bone and soft tissues. Concomitant studies in vitro showed that PGE2 production by fibroblasts is regulated by direct interaction with B16 cells. Autocrine activity of PGE2 further regulates the production of angiogenic factors by fibroblasts, which are key to the vascularization of both primary and metastatic tumor growth. Similarly, cell-cell interactions between B16 cells and host osteoblasts modulate mPGES-1 activity and PGE2 production by the osteoblasts. PGE2, in turn, acts to stimulate receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand expression, leading to osteoclast differentiation and bone erosion. Using eicosanoid receptor antagonists, we show that PGE2 acts on osteoblasts and fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment through the EP4 receptor. Metastatic tumor growth and vascularization in soft tissues was abrogated by an EP4 receptor antagonist. EP4-null Ptger4(-/-) mice do not support B16 melanoma growth. In vitro, an EP4 receptor antagonist modulated PGE2 effects on fibroblast production of angiogenic factors.

We now determine whether the exogenous addition of VEGF and BMP-6 is sufficient for bone healing when MSCs are not provided. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLAGA) microsphere-based three-dimensional scaffolds (P) were fabricated by thermal sintering of PLAGA microspheres. The scaffolds were chemically cross-linked with 200\u00a0ng recombinant human VEGF (P(VEGF)) or BMP-6 (P(BMP-6)) or both (P(VEGF+BMP-6)) by the EDC-NHS-MES method.

The authors describe their multilayer repair technique for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak resulting from extensive anterior skull base fracture using a combination of laterally pediculated temporalis fascial-pericranial, nasoseptal-pericranial, and anterior pericranial flaps.\nRetrospective chart review identified patients treated surgically between January 2004 and May 2014 for anterior skull base fractures with CSF fistulas. All patients were treated with bifrontal craniotomy and received pedicled tissue flaps. Cases were classified according to the extent of fracture: Class I (frontal bone/sinus involvement only); Class II (extent of involvement to ethmoid cribriform plate); and Class III (extent of involvement to sphenoid bone/sinus). Surgical repair techniques were tailored to the types of fractures. Patients were assessed for CSF leak at follow-up. The Fisher exact test was applied to investigate whether the repair techniques were associated with persistent postoperative CSF leak.\nForty-three patients were identified in this series. Thirty-seven (86%) were male. The patients' mean age was 33 years (range 11-79 years). The mean overall length of follow-up was 14 months (range 5-45 months). Six fractures were classified as Class I, 8 as Class II, and 29 as Class III. The anterior pericranial flap alone was used in 33 patients (77%). Multiple flaps were used in 10 patients (3 salvage) (28%)--1 with Class II and 9 with Class III fractures. Five (17%) of the 30 patients with Class II or III fractures who received only a single anterior pericranial flap had persistent CSF leak (p < 0.31). No CSF leak was found in patients who received multiple flaps. Although postoperative CSF leak occurred only in high-grade fractures with single anterior flap repair, this finding was not significant.\nExtensive anterior skull base fractures often require aggressive treatment to provide the greatest long-term functional and cosmetic benefits. Several vascularized tissue flaps can be used, either alone or in combination. Vascularized flaps are an ideal substrate for cranial base repair.

While the field has witnessed tremendous advancements over the past few decades, it still faces many challenges. For example, it has been difficult to visualize, monitor, and assess the functions of the engineered tissue/organ constructs, particularly when three-dimensional scaffolds are involved. Conventional approaches based on histology are invasive and therefore only convey end-point assays. The development of volumetric imaging techniques such as confocal and ultrasonic imaging has enabled direct observation of intact constructs without the need of sectioning. However, the capability of these techniques is often limited in terms of penetration depth and contrast. In comparison, the recently developed photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has allowed us to address these issues by integrating optical and ultrasonic imaging to greatly reduce the effect of tissue scattering of photons with one-way ultrasound detection while retaining the high optical absorption contrast. PAM has been successfully applied to a number of studies, such as observation of cell distribution, monitoring of vascularization, and interrogation of biomaterial degradation.

In this procedure, the choice and use of the flaps are both important. Flaps with adequate soft tissue are required to fill the extensive dead space for huge oromandibular defects. Such flaps, however, tend to sink and droop with time because of gravity, resulting in poor functional and aesthetic results. Here, the authors describe a procedure that avoids flap sinking and drooping, using a vascularized fibular osteocutaneous flap, which is well established for mandibular bone defects, and a rectus abdominalis musculocutaneous flap, which has a lot of soft tissue and a firm anterior rectus sheath. This method was used in 2 patients with extensive composite defects of the oromandibular area. In a patient with resection of the mobile tongue and oral floor, the anterior rectus sheath was fixed to the fibula and mandible to give a mylohyoid muscle-like structure, to prevent sinking of the reconstructed oral floor and tongue. Good swallowing function was maintained. In a patient with defects transversally from the submandibular region to the cheek, the sheath was fixed to the zygomatic arch to prevent cheek drooping.

In this deformity, the spinal canal and the back bone is open. This type of birth defect is also called a neural tube defect. There are many and different methods on the closure of large meningomyelocele defects. Although small meningomyeloceles may be agreeable to direct or primary closure with the local surrounding skin, the closure of large meningomyelocele skin defects needs more complex methods.\nThe author presented a different surgical procedure for the closure of large meningomyelocele defects.\nThe authors presented 9 neonates treated with an O-S (O is the shape of the defect, and S is the final scar shape) advancement procedure. After neurosurgical repair of the placode performed, the skin defect is closed with the O-S flap. This flap method is used for the closure of large meningomyelocele defects in 8 patients, aged between 4 days to 3 months. The defect size was 9.0 to 12.0 cm to 5.3 to 8.5 cm on an average.\nMean follow-up was 9.25 months (range: 2-19 months). In all patients, there was no any flap ischemia, and the tension-free 1-stage closure was ensured. All patients healed without any complication. In one patient, cerebrospinal fluid leakage was observed. Revision surgery was done for this patient. No wound dehiscence was seen at follow-up period.\nThe major advantages of this technique are: defects can be closed with only 2 incisions, short operative time, and there is no additional muscle transfer. Our suggested technique also provides a well-vascularized cutaneous tissue covering over the neural tissues. This suggested new technique seems to be a safe and practical solution for closure of the large meningomyelocele defects.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2015-10-16", "authors": ["Ilteris MuratEmsen"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000002154"}

Continuous long-term multidisciplinary follow-up of face transplant patients is mandatory for surveillance of the complications associated with the immunosuppressive regime and for functional assessment of the graft. In December 2011, our multidisciplinary team performed a digitally planned face transplant at the Ghent University Hospital, Belgium on a 55-year-old man with a large central facial defect after a high-energy ballistic injury. The patient was closely followed to assess functional recovery, immunosuppressive complications, overall well-being, and quality of life. Three years postoperatively, the patient and his family are very satisfied with the overall outcome, and social reintegration in the community is successful. Motor and sensory functions have recovered near normal. Infectious and medical complications have been serious but successfully managed. Immunosuppressive maintenance therapy consists of corticoids, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil in minimal doses. Epithetic reconstruction of both eyes gave a tremendous improvement on the overall aesthetic outcome. Despite serious complications during the first 12 months, multifunctional outcome in the first face transplant in Belgium (#19 worldwide) is successful. This should be attributed to the continuous and long-term multidisciplinary team approach.

The supercharged latissimus dorsi (LD)-groin compound flap is an option that can provide a large skin paddle with simultaneous functional muscle transfer. It is necessary to supercharge the flap with the superficial circumflex iliac pedicle to ensure the viability of its groin extension. In this report, we present a case of a supercharged LD-groin flap in combination with vascularized inguinal lymph nodes, which was used for upper limb reconstruction in a young male patient, following excision of high-grade liposarcoma. Resection resulted in a 28 cm \u00d7 15 cm skin defect extending from the upper arm to the proximal forearm, also involving the triceps muscle, a segment of the ulnar nerve and the axillary lymph nodes. Restoration of triceps function was achieved with transfer of the innervated LD muscle. Part of the ulnar nerve was resected and repaired with sural nerve grafts. Post-operatively, the flap survived fully with no partial necrosis, and no complications at both the recipient and donor sites. At 1-year follow up, the patient had a well-healed wound with good elbow extension (against resistance), no tumor recurrence, and no signs of lymphedema. We believe this comprehensive approach may represent a valuable technique, for not only the oncological reconstruction of upper extremity, but also for the prevention of lymphedema. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Vascular Patterns in Iguanas and Other Squamates: Blood Vessels and Sites of Thermal Exchange.", "abstract": "Squamates use the circulatory system to regulate body and head temperatures during both heating and cooling. The flexibility of this system, which possibly exceeds that of endotherms, offers a number of physiological mechanisms to gain or retain heat (e.g., increase peripheral blood flow and heart rate, cooling the head to prolong basking time for the body) as well as to shed heat (modulate peripheral blood flow, expose sites of thermal exchange). Squamates also have the ability to establish and maintain the same head-to-body temperature differential that birds, crocodilians, and mammals demonstrate, but without a discrete rete or other vascular physiological device. Squamates offer important anatomical and phylogenetic evidence for the inference of the blood vessels of dinosaurs and other extinct archosaurs in that they shed light on the basal diapsid condition. Given this basal positioning, squamates likewise inform and constrain the range of physiological thermoregulatory mechanisms that may have been found in Dinosauria. Unfortunately, the literature on squamate vascular anatomy is limited. Cephalic vascular anatomy of green iguanas (Iguana iguana) was investigated using a differential-contrast, dual-vascular injection (DCDVI) technique and high-resolution X-ray microcomputed tomography (\u03bcCT). Blood vessels were digitally segmented to create a surface representation of vascular pathways. Known sites of thermal exchange, consisting of the oral, nasal, and orbital regions, were given special attention due to their role in brain and cephalic thermoregulation. Blood vessels to and from sites of thermal exchange were investigated to detect conserved vascular patterns and to assess their ability to deliver cooled blood to the dural venous sinuses. Arteries within sites of thermal exchange were found to deliver blood directly and through collateral pathways. The venous drainage was found to have multiple pathways that could influence neurosensory tissue temperature, as well as pathways that would bypass neurosensory tissues. The orbital region houses a large venous sinus that receives cooled blood from the nasal region. Blood vessels from the nasal region and orbital sinus show anastomotic connections to the dural sinus system, allowing for the direct modulation of brain temperatures. The generality of the vascular patterns discovered in iguanas were assessed by firsthand comparison with other squamates taxa (e.g., via dissection and osteological study) as well as the literature. Similar to extant archosaurs, iguanas and other squamates have highly vascularized sites of thermal exchange that likely support physiological thermoregulation that \"fine tunes\" temperatures attained through behavioral thermoregulation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-10-16", "authors": ["William RugerPorter", "Lawrence MWitmer"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0139215\n10.1086/285538"}

The computational domains will be used in one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D)-1D coupled hemodynamic models. A 1D hemodynamic model employs a 1D network of a patient-specific vascular network with large number of vessels. The 1D network is the graph with nodes in the 3D space which bears additional geometric data such as length and radius of vessels. A 3D hemodynamic model requires a detailed 3D reconstruction of local parts of the vascular network. We propose algorithms which extend the automated segmentation of vascular and tubular structures, generation of centerlines, 1D network reconstruction, correction, and local adaptation. We consider two modes of centerline representation: (i) skeletal segments or sets of connected voxels and (ii) curved paths with corresponding radii. Individualized reconstruction of 1D networks depends on the mode of centerline representation. Efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on several examples of 1D network reconstruction. The networks can be used in modeling of blood flows as well as other physiological processes in tubular structures.

The secondary outcome measures were maintenance of pelvic obliquity, lumbosacral kyphosis, and overall sagittal balance.\nThe surgical procedure consisted of two-stage surgeries performed 6-12 weeks apart. The first stage consisted of spinal instrumentation and correction of the deformity via a posterior approach and impaction of one of the vascularized ribs from the spine to the iliac crest. The second stage consisted of an anterior thoraco-lumbar approach for spinal fusion and the second vascularized rib spanning the spine to the iliac crest.\nAll six patients eventually achieved a solid spinal and spinopelvic fusion.

{"title": "The Value of the \"Papillon\" Anterolateral Thigh Flap for Total Pharyngolaryngectomy Reconstruction: A Retrospective Case Series.", "abstract": "The tubed, buried anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap is a popular reconstruction method for total pharyngolaryngectomy defects. The \"papillon\"-designed ALT flap, described by Hayden et al, offers an alternative method of using the ALT flap in this situation. We report our early experience with the papillon ALT flap in a patient cohort.\nOn retrospective review, all patients who underwent reconstruction of circumferential total pharyngolaryngectomy defects with the papillon ALT flap from February 2012 to February 2015 were identified from our departmental database. Demographic and clinical data, operative details, and complications were analyzed from the records.\nSeven patients were included in this study. The mean length of hospital stay was 15 days (range, 10 to 32 days). Acute complications occurred in 5 of 7 patients, namely, partial flap loss managed by a pectoralis flap (1 of 7 [14%]); an early pharyngocutaneous fistula (4 of 7 [57%]) managed by simple repair, wound packing, or delayed repair; and a donor-site hematoma (1 of 7 [14%]). At follow-up (range, 2 to 24 months), there was 1 stricture formation, but no chronic fistula. All patients were able to swallow orally.\nEarly results using the papillon ALT flap suggest that this technique is a viable alternative to the standard tubed ALT flap design. The advantages of this design include the following: 1) it offers simultaneous vascularized skin to resurface anterior neck skin deficiency without resorting to additional tissue elsewhere; 2) direct monitoring of the ALT flap is possible; and 3) any pharyngocutaneous fistula is exteriorized to the surface without compromising the internal neck structures and can be easily identified and repaired directly in the office.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2015-10-11", "authors": ["NaseemGhazali", "Todd CHanna", "DonitaDyalram", "Joshua ELubek"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2015.09.010"}
{"title": "Novel cytogenic and neurovascular niches due to blood-brain barrier compromise in the chronic pain brain.", "abstract": "The mechanisms by which painful injuries are linked to the multitude of pain-related comorbidities and neuroplastic changes in the brain remain poorly understood. Here we propose a model that relies on epi-neuronal communication through the vascular system to effect various brain structures. Specifically, we hypothesize that the differential vulnerability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in different brain regions is associated with region-specific neuroplastic and neurovascular changes that are in turn associated with particular pain-related comorbidities.\nWe will present our hypothesis by focusing on two main points: (A) chronic pain (CP) is associated with differential BBB compromise. (B) Circulating mediators leaking through the BBB create cytogenic and neovascular niches associated with pain-related co-morbidities.\nPre-clinically, our hypothesis can be tested by observing, in parallel, BBB compromise, (neo)vascularization, neurogenesis, and their co-localization in animal pain models using imaging, microscopy, biochemical and other tools. Furthermore, the BBB can be experimentally damaged in specific brain regions, and the consequences of those lesions studied on nociception and associated comorbidities. Recently developed imaging techniques allow the analysis of blood brain barrier integrity in patients providing a route for translation of the laboratory findings. Though perhaps more limited, post-mortem examination of brains with available pain histories constitutes a second approach to addressing this hypothesis.\nUnderstanding changes in BBB permeability in chronic pain conditions has clear implications both for understanding the pathogenesis of chronic pain and for the design of novel treatments to prevent chronic pain and its consequences. More broadly, this hypothesis may help us to understand how peripheral injuries impact the brain via mechanisms other than commonly studied efferent sensory pathways.", "journal": "Molecular pain", "date": "2015-10-11", "authors": ["MaralTajerian", "J DavidClark"], "doi": "10.1186/s12990-015-0066-6\n10.1007/s11920-005-0056-x\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5280-10.2011\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000000403\n10.1371/journal.pone.0055259\n10.1186/1744-8069-10-33\n10.1016/j.neuron.2015.06.005\n10.1007/s12975-011-0125-x\n10.1097/00019052-200406000-00009\n10.1152/ajpheart.01288.2004\n10.1152/ajpheart.00027.2002\n10.1152/ajpheart.00747.2005\n10.1093/bja/aen078\n10.1002/ijc.28433\n10.1002/glia.22575\n10.1371/journal.pone.0110024\n10.1093/brain/awu377\n10.1016/j.nbd.2009.07.030\n10.1111/cns.12018\n10.1002/ana.22664\n10.1002/ana.22082\n10.1155/2015/718201\n10.4103/0975-7406.135247\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.008323\n10.1016/j.neulet.2011.06.047\n10.3389/fnins.2015.00020\n10.3727/096368915X686878\n10.1152/jn.00972.2014\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.08.008\n10.1038/jcbfm.2014.125\n10.1186/1744-8069-9-21\n10.1038/nphoton.2012.329\n10.2174/13816128113199990457\n10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.03.038\n10.1038/jcbfm.2012.45\n10.1016/j.nicl.2014.09.002\n10.1038/nature14432"}

We aim to engineer 3-dimensional (3D) vascular networks in synthetic hydrogels from type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) patient-derived human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), to serve as a transformative autologous vascular therapy for diabetic patients.\nWe validated and optimized an adherent, feeder-free differentiation procedure to derive early vascular cells (EVCs) with high portions of vascular endothelial cadherin-positive cells from hiPSCs. We demonstrate similar differentiation efficiency from hiPSCs derived from healthy donor and patients with T1D. T1D-hiPSC-derived vascular endothelial cadherin-positive cells can mature to functional endothelial cells-expressing mature markers: von Willebrand factor and endothelial nitric oxide synthase are capable of lectin binding and acetylated low-density lipoprotein uptake, form cords in Matrigel and respond to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. When embedded in engineered hyaluronic acid hydrogels, T1D-EVCs undergo morphogenesis and assemble into 3D networks. When encapsulated in a novel hypoxia-inducible hydrogel, T1D-EVCs respond to low oxygen and form 3D networks. As xenografts, T1D-EVCs incorporate into developing zebrafish vasculature.\nUsing our robust protocol, we can direct efficient differentiation of T1D-hiPSC to EVCs. Early endothelial cells derived from T1D-hiPSC are functional when mature. T1D-EVCs self-assembled into 3D networks when embedded in hyaluronic acid and hypoxia-inducible hydrogels.

Survival rates were calculated, and histologic morphology was evaluated. The expression of CD31 was detected by means of immune-histochemical staining to observe neo-vascularization of the auto-transplanted fat tissue. Perilipin was detected by means of immune-histochemical staining to observe the survival of fat cells.\nAt 12 weeks, the survival rates in the experimental group were statistically greater than that in the control group, respectively (p < 0.05).

{"title": "Comparison between polyethylene glycol and zwitterionic polymers as antifouling coatings on wearable devices for selective antigen capture from biological tissue.", "abstract": "Selective capture of disease-related proteins in complex biological fluids and tissues is an important aim in developing sensitive protein biosensors for in vivo applications. Microprojection arrays are biomedical devices whose mechanical and chemical properties can be tuned to allow efficient penetration of skin, coupled with highly selective biomarker capture from the complex biological environment of skin tissue. Herein, the authors describe an improved surface modification strategy to produce amine-modified polycarbonate arrays, followed by the attachment of an antifouling poly(sulfobetaine-methacrylate) (pSBMA) polymer or a linear polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer of comparative molecular weight and hydrodynamic radius. Using a \"grafting to\" approach, pSBMA and linear PEG coatings yielded comparative antifouling behavior in single protein solutions, diluted plasma, or when applied to mouse flank skin penetrating into the vascularized dermal tissue. Interestingly, the density of immobilized immunoglobulin G (IgG) or bovine serum albumin protein on pSBMA surfaces was significantly higher than that on the PEG surfaces, while the nonspecific adsorption was comparable for each protein. When incubated in buffer or plasma solutions containing dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1), anti-NS1-IgG-coated pSBMA surfaces captured significantly more NS1 in comparison to PEG-coated devices. Similarly, when wearable microprojection arrays were applied to the skin of dengue-infected mice using the same coatings, the pSBMA-coated devices showed significantly higher capture efficiency (>2-fold increase in signal) than the PEG-coated substrates, which showed comparative signal when applied to na\u00efve mice. In conclusion, zwitterionic pSBMA polymers (of equivalent hydrodynamic radii to PEG) allowed detection of dengue NS1 disease biomarker in a preclinical model of dengue infection, showing significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to the PEG controls.

{"title": "Effect of ocular shape and vascular geometry on retinal hemodynamics: a computational model.", "abstract": "A computational model for retinal hemodynamics accounting for ocular curvature is presented. The model combines (i) a hierarchical Darcy model for the flow through small arterioles, capillaries and small venules in the retinal tissue, where blood vessels of different size are comprised in different hierarchical levels of a porous medium; and (ii) a one-dimensional network model for the blood flow through retinal arterioles and venules of larger size. The non-planar ocular shape is included by (i) defining the hierarchical Darcy flow model on a two-dimensional curved surface embedded in the three-dimensional space; and (ii) mapping the simplified one-dimensional network model onto the curved surface. The model is solved numerically using a finite element method in which spatial domain and hierarchical levels are discretized separately. For the finite element method, we use an exterior calculus-based implementation which permits an easier treatment of non-planar domains. Numerical solutions are verified against suitably constructed analytical solutions. Numerical experiments are performed to investigate how retinal hemodynamics is influenced by the ocular shape (sphere, oblate spheroid, prolate spheroid and barrel are compared) and vascular architecture (four vascular arcs and a branching vascular tree are compared). The model predictions show that changes in ocular shape induce non-uniform alterations of blood pressure and velocity in the retina. In particular, we found that (i) the temporal region is affected the least by changes in ocular shape, and (ii) the barrel shape departs the most from the hemispherical reference geometry in terms of associated pressure and velocity distributions in the retinal microvasculature. These results support the clinical hypothesis that alterations in ocular shape, such as those occurring in myopic eyes, might be associated with pathological alterations in retinal hemodynamics.", "journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "date": "2015-10-09", "authors": ["AndreaDziubek", "GiovannaGuidoboni", "AlonHarris", "Anil NHirani", "EdmondRusjan", "WilliamThistleton"], "doi": "10.1007/s10237-015-0731-8"}

We also detected protein expressions of BDNF and NGF by Western blotting assays and examined BMSCs that incorporated into myelin and vascellum. The results showed that BMSCs infected by Ad5-Netrin-1-EGFP significantly improved the function of the sciatic nerve, and led to increased expression of BDNF and NGF (P<0.05).

{"title": "Geometrical versus Random \u03b2-TCP Scaffolds: Exploring the Effects on Schwann Cell Growth and Behavior.", "abstract": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that Schwann cells (SCs) play a role in nerve regeneration; however, their role in innervating a bioceramic scaffold for potential application in bone regeneration is still unknown. Here we report the cell growth and functional behavior of SCs on \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) scaffolds arranged in 3D printed-lattice (P-\u03b2-TCP) and randomly-porous, template-casted (N-\u03b2-TCP) structures. Our results indicate that SCs proliferated well and expressed the phenotypic markers p75LNGFR and the S100-\u03b2 subunit of SCs as well as displayed growth morphology on both scaffolds, but SCs showed spindle-shaped morphology with a significant degree of SCs alignment on the P-\u03b2-TCP scaffolds, seen to a lesser degree in the N-\u03b2-TCP scaffold. The gene expressions of nerve growth factor (\u03b2-ngf), neutrophin-3 (nt-3), platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf-bb), and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf-a) were higher at day 7 than at day 14. While no significant differences in protein secretion were measured between these last two time points, the scaffolds promoted the protein secretion at day 3 compared to that on the cell culture plates. These results together imply that the \u03b2-TCP scaffolds can support SC cell growth and that the 3D-printed scaffold appeared to significantly promote the alignment of SCs along the struts. Further studies are needed to investigate the early and late stage relationship between gene expression and protein secretion of SCs on the scaffolds with refined characteristics, thus better exploring the potential of SCs to support vascularization and innervation in synthetic bone grafts.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-10-09", "authors": ["LaurenSweet", "YunqingKang", "ChristopherCzisch", "LukaszWitek", "YangShi", "JimSmay", "Giles WPlant", "YunzhiYang"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0139820\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.09.035\n10.1038/nature03875\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.188144\n10.1101/gad.1305405\n10.1100/2012/413091\n10.1002/ar.1120\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300871\n10.1111/j.1529-8027.2012.00425.x\n10.1016/B978-0-12-410499-0.00007-1\n10.1016/j.devcel.2013.01.009\n10.1038/sj.sc.3101943\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1620-06.2006\n10.1016/j.mcn.2012.04.004\n10.1111/exd.12115\n10.1002/mus.20272\n10.1016/S0074-7742(09)87010-4\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.01.052\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2009.0017\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.09.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0057157\n10.1016/B978-0-444-52137-8.00036-X\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.08.008\n10.1002/jbm.a.32443\n10.1016/j.msec.2006.05.018\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.007\n10.1088/1741-2560/8/4/046015\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.02.020\n10.1007/s10439-005-9013-4\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.015\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2011.05.004\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.002\n10.1186/1471-2202-14-106\n10.1038/nprot.2012.118\n10.1007/s11010-012-1285-z/fulltext.html\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1038/nmeth.2089\n10.1016/0361-9230(95)00040-2\n10.1002/neu.480251106\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.02.037\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.07.031\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.06.025\n10.1016/j.msec.2010.04.001\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.03.032\n10.1186/1742-2094-8-110\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2011.03.017\n10.1172/JCI18420\n10.1124/pr.56.4.3\n10.1152/physrev.00031.2008\n10.1242/dev.072348\n10.1155/2013/362918"}

Mice globally lacking Bcl-2 (Bcl-2 -/-) are small in stature and succumb to renal failure shortly after weaning as a result of renal hypoplasia/cystic dysplasia. We have shown that Bcl-2 -/- mice displayed attenuated retinal vascular development and neovascularization. In vitro studies indicated that in addition to modulating apoptosis, Bcl-2 expression also impacts endothelial and epithelial cell adhesion, migration and extracellular matrix production. However, studies delineating the cell autonomous role Bcl-2 expression plays in the endothelium during vascular development, pruning and remodeling, and neovascularization are lacking. Here we generated mice carrying a conditional Bcl-2 allele (Bcl-2Flox/Flox) and VE-cadherin-cre (Bcl-2EC mice). Bcl-2EC mice were of normal stature and lifespan and displayed some but not all of the retinal vascular defects previously observed in global Bcl-2 deficient mice. Bcl-2EC mice had decreased numbers of endothelial cells, decreased retinal arteries and premature primary branching of the retinal vasculature, but unlike the global knockout mice, spreading of the retinal superficial vascular layer proceeded normally. Choroidal neovascularization was attenuated in Bcl-2EC mice, although retinal neovascularization accompanying oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy was not. Thus, Bcl-2 expression in the endothelium plays a significant role during postnatal retinal vascularization, and pathological choroidal but not retinal neovascularization, suggesting vascular bed specific Bcl-2 function in the endothelium.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-10-09", "authors": ["Ismail SZaitoun", "Ryan PJohnson", "NasimJamali", "ReemAlmomani", "ShoujianWang", "NaderSheibani", "Christine MSorenson"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0139994\n10.1016/j.ejcb.2012.02.002\n10.1002/dvdy.21678\n10.1152/ajpcell.90633.2007\n10.1152/ajplung.00390.2009\n10.1242/jcs.006064\n10.1038/cdd.2010.175.\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.10.034\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.12.017\n10.1007/s10456-009-9155-3\n10.1002/dvdy.20643\n10.1016/j.devcel.2010.05.006\n10.1038/nm.1947\n10.1096/fj.13-228551\n10.1242/dev.084871\n10.1002/dvdy.10412\n10.1002/1097-4652(200009)184:3<301::AID-JCP3>3.0.CO;2-H\n10.1038/eye.2009.318\n10.1039/c3ib40085a\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4401352\n10.1002/neu.480230919\n10.1098/rstb.1994.0100\n10.1002/jcp.20858\n10.1038/ki.2013.491\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-1078\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.07.023"}

Regenerating the kidney requires the induction of the more than 20 distinct cell types required for excretion and the regulation of pH, and electrolyte and fluid balance. We have previously described the simultaneous induction of progenitors for both collecting duct and nephrons via the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. Paradoxically, although both are of intermediate mesoderm in origin, collecting duct and nephrons have distinct temporospatial origins. Here we identify the developmental mechanism regulating the preferential induction of collecting duct versus kidney mesenchyme progenitors. Using this knowledge, we have generated kidney organoids that contain nephrons associated with a collecting duct network surrounded by renal interstitium and endothelial cells. Within these organoids, individual nephrons segment into distal and proximal tubules, early loops of Henle, and glomeruli containing podocytes elaborating foot processes and undergoing vascularization. When transcription profiles of kidney organoids were compared to human fetal tissues, they showed highest congruence with first trimester human kidney. Furthermore, the proximal tubules endocytose dextran and differentially apoptose in response to cisplatin, a nephrotoxicant.

This approach provides a systematic and detailed view of the cerebrovascular anatomy at the micrometer level without any need for contrast agents. From qualitative and quantitative perspectives, the present 3D data provide a considerable insight into the spatial vascular network for whole rodent brain, particularly for functionally important regions of interest, such as the hippocampus, pre-frontal cerebral cortex and the corpus striatum. We extended these results to synchrotron-based virtual micro-endoscopy, thus revealing the trajectory of targeted vessels in 3D.

{"title": "HMGB1 enhances the protumoral activities of M2 macrophages by a RAGE-dependent mechanism.", "abstract": "The monocyte-macrophage lineage shows a high degree of diversity and plasticity. Once they infiltrate tissues, they may acquire two main functional phenotypes, being known as the classically activated type 1 macrophages (M1) and the alternative activated type 2 macrophages (M2). The M1 phenotype can be induced by bacterial products and interferon-\u03b3 and exerts a cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. Conversely, the alternatively activated M2 phenotype is induced by Il-4/IL13 and promotes tumor cell growth and vascularization. Although receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) engagement in M1 macrophages has been reported by several groups to promote inflammation, nothing is known about the functionality of RAGE in M2 macrophages. In the current study, we demonstrate that RAGE is equally expressed in both macrophage phenotypes and that RAGE activation by high-mobility group protein box1 (HMGB1) promotes protumoral activities of M2 macrophages. MKN45 cells co-cultured with M2 macrophages treated with HMGB1 at different times displayed higher invasive abilities. Additionally, conditioned medium from HMGB1-treated M2 macrophages promotes angiogenesis in vitro. RAGE-targeting knockdown abrogates these activities. Overall, the present findings suggest that HMGB1 may contribute, by a RAGE-dependent mechanism, to the protumoral activities of the M2 phenotype.", "journal": "Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine", "date": "2015-10-07", "authors": ["ArmandoRojas", "FernandoDelgado-L\u00f3pez", "Ram\u00f3nPerez-Castro", "IleanaGonzalez", "JacquelineRomero", "IsraelRojas", "PaulinaAraya", "CarolinaA\u00f1azco", "ErikMorales", "JorgeLlanos"], "doi": "10.1007/s13277-015-3940-y"}

{"title": "Vascular heterogeneity and targeting: the role of YKL-40 in glioblastoma vascularization.", "abstract": "Malignant glioblastomas (GBM) are highly malignant brain tumors that have extensive and aberrant tumor vasculature, including multiple types of vessels. This review focuses on recent discoveries that the angiogenic factor YKL-40 (CHI3L1) acts on glioblastoma-stem like cells (GSCs) to drive the formation of two major forms of tumor vascularization: angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry (VM). GSCs possess multipotent cells able to transdifferentiate into vascular pericytes or smooth muscle cells (PC/SMCs) that either coordinate with endothelial cells (ECs) to facilitate angiogenesis or assemble in the absence of ECs to form blood-perfused channels via VM. GBMs express high levels of YKL-40 that drives the divergent signaling cascades to mediate the formation of these distinct microvascular circulations. Although a variety of anti-tumor agents that target angiogenesis have demonstrated transient benefits for patients, they often fail to restrict tumor growth, which underscores the need for additional therapeutic tools. We propose that targeting YKL-40 may compliment conventional anti-angiogenic therapies to provide a substantial clinical benefit to patients with GBM and several other types of solid tumors.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2015-10-07", "authors": ["RongShao", "Sherry LTaylor", "Dennis SOh", "Lawrence MSchwartz"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.5943"}

An attempt of tumor resection was previously performed in another clinic, but the surgery was aborted due to massive intraoperative bleeding and only a biopsy was done. Angiography showed no suitable vessels for embolization. A new attempt of tumor removal was carried out, but again, severe intraoperative bleeding occurred and only a partial resection was possible.

Intraoperative blood loss was 345 ml (first surgery = only partial removal), 250 ml (second procedure = 1/3 of tumor volume resected), and 250 ml (third surgery = total removal). The patient presented no additional deficits.\nIntratumoral percutaneous embolization with onyx was very helpful in reducing intraoperative bleeding in this case.

{"title": "[Optoacoustic imaging].", "abstract": "Imaging modalities play an increasing role in today's medical diagnostics. Among them, ultrasound (US) is one the most widespread techniques although it has relatively poor soft tissue contrast. Furthermore, US is poorly suited as a modality for molecular imaging (MI).\nMethods such as Doppler and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) allow functional imaging of the vasculature; however, ultrasound-based MI remains limited to the vascular network due to the size of available contrast agents.\nOptoacoustic imaging combines the benefits of optics (high contrast) with those of acoustics (low scattering and high resolution). In this technique, signals are generated in tissue with high contrast depending on the local optical absorption coefficient and detected with an acoustic procedure.\nOptoacoustic imaging can intrinsically be scaled in terms of resolution and is therefore usable in various applications from in vitro microscopy, to preclinical small animal imaging up to clinical imaging. With a resolution in the range of clinical ultrasound systems (100-400 \u00b5m), highly scattering tissue can be imaged up to several centimeters in depth.\nIn contrast to conventional ultrasound imaging, optoacoustic techniques are highly suitable for MI. Various contrast agents as well as different technical implementations of the approach have already been preclinically evaluated.

The clinical value of placental three-dimensional power Doppler (3DPD) in assessing HDCP requires further confirmation. The research was developed to assess changes of placental vascularity in HDCP using 3DPD and to investigate the placental vascularity in small for gestational age (SGA) compared with not-SGA in patients with HDCP.\nThere were 126 normotensive and 128 hypertensive pregnant women included in this prospective case-control study from March 2011 to March 2013. Pregnant women underwent 3DPD. Vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI) were obtained. The placental 3DPD indices, umbilical artery systolic and diastolic ratio (S/D) and pregnancy outcomes were compared between the groups.\nThe placental VI and VFI were significantly lower in hypertensive women compared with normotensive women (P\u2009<\u20090.001 and P\u2009=\u20090.014, respectively), and these parameters were significantly reduced in severe preeclampsia (P\u2009<\u20090.001 and P\u2009=\u20090.003, respectively). A weak correlation was found between VI and umbilical artery S/D in HDCP group (r\u2009=\u2009-0.277, P\u2009=\u20090.001). In HDCP population, neonates who were postnatally diagnosed with SGA had lower VI (P\u2009=\u20090.041) and higher S/D (P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nThe placental vascularity indices decreased in hypertensive women and the reduction inplacental perfusion was consistent with the severity of the hypertensive disorder. The associations betweenplacental vascularization and umbilical artery impedance may be valuable for further researches and arerequired confirmation. The significant differences in the 3DPD placental vascularization between SGA andnot-SGA in hypertensive pregnancy population may show some clinical importance that we could use tobetter assess or predict the progression and adverse outcomes in the future.

A simultaneous presence of c-Met in 41% SCCOHT-1 cells suggested an autocrine growth mechanism. Expression of c-Met was also observed at low levels in the corresponding BIN-67 cell line (6.5%) and at high levels in ovarian adenocarcinoma cells (NIH:OVCAR-3 (84.4%) and SK-OV-3 (99.3%)). Immunohistochemistry of c-Met expression in SCCOHT tumors revealed a heterogeneous distribution between undetectable levels and 80%. Further characterization of SCCOHT-1 and BIN-67 cells by cell surface markers including CD90 and EpCAM demonstrated similar patterns with differences to the ovarian adenocarcinoma cells. HGF stimulation of SCCOHT-1 cells was associated with c-Met phosphorylation at Tyr1349 and downstream Thr202/Tyr204 phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase. This HGF-induced signaling cascade was abolished by the c-Met inhibitor foretinib. Cell cycle analysis after foretinib treatment demonstrated enhanced G2 accumulation and increasing apoptosis within 72 h. Moreover, the IC50 of foretinib revealed 12.4 nM in SCCOHT-1 cells compared to 411 nM and 481 nM in NIH:OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3 cells, respectively, suggesting potential therapeutic effects. Indeed, SCCOHT-1 and BIN-67 tumor xenografts in NODscid mice exhibited an approximately 10-fold and 5-fold reduced tumor size following systemic application of foretinib, respectively. Furthermore, foretinib-treated tumors revealed a significantly reduced vascularization and little if any c-Met-mediated signal transduction. Similar findings of reduced proliferative capacity and declined tumor size were observed after siRNA-mediated c-Met knock-down in SCCOHT-1 cells demonstrating that in vivo inhibition of these pathways contributed to an attenuation of SCCOHT tumor growth.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2015-10-06", "authors": ["AnnaOtte", "FinnRauprich", "Julianevon der Ohe", "YuanyuanYang", "FriedrichKommoss", "FriedrichFeuerhake", "PeterHillemanns", "RalfHass"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.5151"}

Implantation of inert materials was carried out by making a small incision on one or either side of the thoracic-lumbar region of rats. Subcutaneous pockets were created by blunt dissection around the incision into which the inert bodies were inserted (1 or 2 per rat). The incisions were closed with silk sutures, and the animals were allowed to recover. In case of the polydextran gel slurry 5 mL of the slurry was injected in the subcutaneous space using an 18 gauge needle. After implanting the foreign bodies a newly regenerated encapsulating tissue developed around the foreign bodies. The tissues were harvested after 4-42 d of implantation and studied by gross examination, histology, and histochemistry for organization, vascularity, and presence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (CD271+CD34+ cells).\nImplanting a large cylindrically shaped polyvinyl tube resulted in a large flat sheet of tissue that could be tailored to a specific size and shape for use as a tissue patch for repairing large organs. Implanting a smaller sized polyvinyl tube yielded a cylindrical tissue that could be useful for repairing nerves and blood vessels. This type of patch could be obtained in different lengths by varying the length of the implanted tube. Implanting a suspension of inert polydextran suspension gave rise to a bladder-like tissue that could be potentially used for repairing heart valves. Histologically, the three different types of tissue patches generated were organized similarly, consisting of three layers, increasing in thickness until day 14. The inner layer in contact with the inert material was avascular; a middle layer that was highly vascular and filled with matrix, and an outer layer consisting of loose connective tissue. MSCs identified as CD271+CD34+ cells were present in the medial layer and around major blood vessels at day 4 but absent at later time points. The early-harvested tissues, endowed with MSCs, could be used for tissue repair, while the later-harvested tissues, being less vascular but thicker and tougher, could be used as filler tissue for cosmetic purposes.\nAn autologous, vascularized tissue patch of desired shape and size can be created in the subcutaneous space by implanting different types of inert bodies.", "journal": "World journal of stem cells", "date": "2015-10-06", "authors": ["IgnacioGarcia-Gomez", "Krishnamurthy PGudehithlu", "Jose A LArruda", "Ashok KSingh"], "doi": "10.4252/wjsc.v7.i8.1127"}

{"title": "Senescent peritoneal mesothelium induces a pro-angiogenic phenotype in ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model in vivo.", "abstract": "It is believed that senescent cells contribute to the progression of primary and metastatic tumors, however, the exact mechanisms of this activity remain elusive. In this report we show that senescent human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) alter the secretory profile of ovarian cancer cells (A2780, OVCAR-3, SKOV-3) by increasing the release of four angiogenic agents: CXCL1, CXCL8, HGF, and VEGF. Proliferation and migration of endothelial cells subjected to conditioned medium generated by: cancer cells modified by senescent HPMCs; cancer cells co-cultured with senescent HPMCs; and by early-passage HPMCs from aged donors, were markedly intensified. The same was the case for the vascularization, size and number of tumors that developed in the mouse peritoneum upon injection of ovarian cancer cells with senescent HPMCs. When the identified pro-angiogenic proteins were neutralized in conditioned medium from the cancer cells, both aspects of endothelial cell behavior intensified in vitro in response to senescent HPMCs were markedly reduced. The search for mediators of senescent HPMC activity using specific neutralizing antibodies and recombinant exogenous proteins showed that the intensified angiogenic potential of cancer cells was elicited by IL-6 and TGF-\u03b21. At the transcriptional level, increased proliferation and migration of endothelial cells exposed to cancer cells modified by senescent HPMCs was regulated by HIF-1\u03b1, NF-\u03baB/p50 and AP-1/c-Jun. Collectively, our findings indicate that senescent HPMCs may promote the progression of ovarian cancer cells by reprogramming their secretory phenotype towards increased production of pro-angiogenic agents and subsequent increase in the angiogenic capabilities of the vascular endothelium.", "journal": "Clinical & experimental metastasis", "date": "2015-10-05", "authors": ["JustynaMiku\u0142a-Pietrasik", "PatrycjaSosi\u0144ska", "ErykNaumowicz", "KonstantinMaksin", "HannaPiotrowska", "AldonaWo\u017aniak", "DariuszSzpurek", "KrzysztofKsi\u0105\u017cek"], "doi": "10.1007/s10585-015-9753-y\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.003\n10.1146/annurev-pathol-121808-102144\n10.1016/j.canlet.2014.09.041\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.051222\n10.1016/S0022-4804(03)00307-X\n10.1089/rej.2008.0736\n10.1007/s10522-014-9505-4\n10.1007/BF02630943\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.03.014\n10.1007/s10456-012-9266-0\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3452\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0895\n10.1074/jbc.M603307200\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1720\n10.1073/pnas.211053698\n10.1016/j.molonc.2014.07.009\n10.1038/ncomms3126\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0682\n10.1172/JCI43304\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.06.026\n10.1016/j.exger.2007.04.012\n10.3389/fonc.2013.00097\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0895\n10.1016/j.biocel.2013.07.004\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0808\n10.4049/jimmunol.171.6.3194\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.06.006"}

The transition of epithelial cells to mesenchymal phenotype, neovascularization, and consequently development of peritoneal fibrosis occur due to the involvement of peritoneal membrane by various insults such as uremia itself, peritonitis attacks, and exposure to bio-incompatible peritoneal dialysis fluids.

Here we establish a decellularization method of vascular tissue from cryopreserved human placenta chorionic plate starting with an initial freeze-thaw step followed by a series of chemical treatments applied with a custom-made perfusion system. This novel pulsatile perfusion set-up enabled us to successfully decellularize the vascular tissue with lower concentrations of chemicals and shorter exposure times compared to a non-perfusion process. The decellularization procedure described here lead to the preservation of the native extracellular matrix architecture and the removal of cells. Quantitative analysis revealed no significant changes in collagen content and a retained glycosaminoglycan content of approximately 29%. In strain-to-failure tests, the decellularized grafts showed similar mechanical behavior compared to native controls. In addition, the mechanical values for ultimate tensile strength and stiffness were in an acceptable range for in vivo applications. Furthermore, biocompatibility of the decellularized tissue and its recellularizationability to serve as an adequate substratum for upcoming recellularization strategies using primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was demonstrated. HUVECs cultured on the decellularized placenta vessel matrix performed endothelialization and maintained phenotypical characteristics and cell specific expression patterns.

Differential expression of the HIF subunits HIF1\u03b1 and HIF2\u03b1 occurs in many human tumor types, suggesting selective implications to biologic context. For example, high expression of HIF2\u03b1 that occurs in neuroblastoma is associated with stem cell-like features, disseminated disease, and poor clinical outcomes, suggesting pivotal significance for HIF2 control in neuroblastoma biology. In this study, we provide novel insights into how HIF2\u03b1 expression is transcriptionally controlled by hypoxia and how this control is abrogated by inhibition of insulin-like growth factor-1R/INSR-driven phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Reducing PI3K activity was sufficient to decrease HIF2\u03b1 mRNA and protein expression in a manner with smaller and less vascularized tumors in vivo. PI3K-regulated HIF2A mRNA expression was independent of Akt or mTORC1 signaling but relied upon mTORC2 signaling. HIF2A mRNA was induced by hypoxia in neuroblastoma cells isolated from metastatic patient-derived tumor xenografts, where HIF2A levels could be reduced by treatment with PI3K and mTORC2 inhibitors.

{"title": "Three-dimensional reconstruction of a vascular network by dynamic tracking of magnetite nanoparticles.", "abstract": "Visualization of small blood vessels feeding tumor sites provides important information on the tumors and their microenvironment. This information plays an important role in targeted drug therapies using magnetic gradients. However, capabilities of current clinical imaging modalities may be insufficient to resolve complex microvascular networks. The purpose of this study is to map the vascular network, 3D, based on the magnetic susceptibility contrast.\nMagnetic particles induce an inhomogeneity in the MRI's magnetic field in an order much larger than their real size. This is an approach to compensate the spatial resolution insufficiency of a clinical MR scanner. Micron-sized agglomerations of magnetite nanoparticles were injected in a 3D phantom vascular network, and a fast multislice, multiacquisition MR sequence was applied to track the agglomerations along their trajectories. The experiment was performed twice for two different imaging planes: coronal and transversal. The susceptibility artifact in the images indicated the presence and the position of the agglomerations. The calculated positions through multiple images were assembled to build up the 3D distribution of the vascular network.\nThe calculated points were compared with the centerline of the channels, extracted from the 3D reference image, to determine the absolute measurement error. The mean error was measured to be approximately half of the pixel's size. It was found that the positioning error on the axis perpendicular to the imaging slice was nearly twice as high as on the imaging plane axes due to the slice thickness. In order to compensate for the lack of resolution on the perpendicular axis, the reconstruction was performed using a combination of coronal and transversal data. The combination of the coordinates led to a significant decrease in the mean measurement error at each segment in the vascular network (p < 0.001).\nA method for 3D reconstruction of a microvascular network based on the susceptibility contrast in MRI and using a clinical scanner and a commercial receiver coil was proposed.

On the other hand, some signaling molecules may play a role as mitogens and serve to increase the number of bone producing cells or may increase vascularization. This is true for factors such as Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) or Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF). Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) likely has a special role. Not only does it induce new blood vessel formation, it also has direct effects on osteoblasts through endothelial cell-based BMP production. In addition to these pathways that classically have targeted bone production, there are also opportunities to target other aspects of the bone healing process such as inflammation, vascularization, and cell ingress to the fracture site. Bone regeneration is highly complex with defined, yet overlapping stages of healing. We will review established and novel extracellular signaling factors associated with various stages of fracture healing that could be targeted to promote enhanced bone regeneration. Importantly, multiple potential cell and tissues could be targeted to enhance healing in addition to focusing solely on osteoinductive therapeutics.", "journal": "Advanced drug delivery reviews", "date": "2015-10-03", "authors": ["K DHankenson", "KGagne", "MShaughnessy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.addr.2015.09.008"}
{"title": "Functional imaging of the human placenta with magnetic resonance.", "abstract": "Abnormal placentation is responsible for most failures in pregnancy; however, an understanding of placental functions remains largely concealed from noninvasive, in vivo investigations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is safe in pregnancy for magnetic fields of up to 3 Tesla and is being used increasingly to improve the accuracy of prenatal imaging. Functional MRI (fMRI) of the placenta has not yet been validated in a clinical setting, and most data are derived from animal studies. FMRI could be used to further explore placental functions that are related to vascularization, oxygenation, and metabolism in human pregnancies by the use of various enhancement processes. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is best able to quantify placental perfusion, permeability, and blood volume fractions. However, the transplacental passage of Gadolinium-based contrast agents represents a significant safety concern for this procedure in humans. There are alternative contrast agents that may be safer in pregnancy or that do not cross the placenta. Arterial spin labeling MRI relies on magnetically labeled water to quantify the blood flows within the placenta. A disadvantage of this technique is a poorer signal-to-noise ratio. Based on arterial spin labeling, placental perfusion in normal pregnancy is 176 \u00b1 91 mL \u00d7 min(-1) \u00d7 100 g(-1) and decreases in cases with intrauterine growth restriction. Blood oxygen level-dependent and oxygen-enhanced MRIs do not assess perfusion but measure the response of the placenta to changes in oxygen levels with the use of hemoglobin as an endogenous contrast agent. Diffusion-weighted imaging and intravoxel incoherent motion MRI do not require exogenous contrast agents, instead they use the movement of water molecules within tissues. The apparent diffusion coefficient and perfusion fraction are significantly lower in placentas of growth-restricted fetuses when compared with normal pregnancies. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has the ability to extract information regarding metabolites from the placenta noninvasively and in vivo. There are marked differences in all 3 metabolites N-acetyl aspartate/choline levels, inositol/choline ratio between small, and adequately grown fetuses. Current research is focused on the ability of each fMRI technique to make a timely diagnosis of abnormal placentation that would allow for appropriate planning of follow-up examinations and optimal scheduling of delivery. These research programs will benefit from the use of well-defined sequences, standardized imaging protocols, and robust computational methods.", "journal": "American journal of obstetrics and gynecology", "date": "2015-10-03", "authors": ["NathalieSiauve", "Gihad EChalouhi", "BenjaminDeloison", "MarianneAlison", "OlivierClement", "YvesVille", "Laurent JSalomon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajog.2015.06.045"}
{"title": "Osteogenic capillaries orchestrate growth plate-independent ossification of the malleus.", "abstract": "Endochondral ossification is a developmental process by which cartilage is replaced by bone. Terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes are calcified, vascularized, and removed by chondroclasts before bone matrix is laid down by osteoblasts. In mammals, the malleus is one of three auditory ossicles that transmit vibrations of the tympanic membrane to the inner ear. The malleus is formed from a cartilaginous precursor without growth plate involvement, but little is known about how bones of this type undergo endochondral ossification. Here, we demonstrate that in the processus brevis of the malleus, clusters of osteoblasts surrounding the capillary loop produce bone matrix, causing the volume of the capillary lumen to decrease rapidly in post-weaning mice. Synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy revealed a concentric, cylindrical arrangement of osteocyte lacunae along capillaries, indicative of pericapillary bone formation. Moreover, we report that overexpression of Fosl1, which encodes a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, in osteoblasts significantly blocked malleal capillary narrowing. These data suggest that osteoblast/endothelial cell interactions control growth plate-free endochondral ossification through 'osteogenic capillaries' in a Fosl1-regulated manner.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2015-10-03", "authors": ["KoichiMatsuo", "YukikoKuroda", "NobuhitoNango", "KoujiShimoda", "YoshiakiKubota", "MasatsuguEma", "LatifaBakiri", "Erwin FWagner", "YoshihiroTakeda", "WataruYashiro", "AtsushiMomose"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.123885\n10.1111/j.1469-7580.2012.01526.x\n10.1073/pnas.1107019108\n10.2741/3813\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600282\n10.1128/MCB.01054-12\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.034\n10.1038/9467\n10.1083/jcb.122.3.685\n10.1002/hep.26518\n10.1083/jcb.201010010\n10.1038/79676\n10.1016/j.bone.2006.01.155\n10.1359/jbmr.080812\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2010.11.063\n10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00157-0\n10.1679/aohc.66.123\n10.1038/nature01657\n10.1128/MCB.18.12.7095\n10.1038/nature13145\n10.1242/dev.02701\n10.1083/jcb.200105052\n10.1038/onc.2009.308\n10.1007/s00223-012-9689-z\n10.1016/j.devcel.2010.07.010\n10.1002/dvg.22031\n10.1038/72855\n10.1364/BOE.4.000917\n10.1359/jbmr.051216\n10.1002/dvdy.20402\n10.1016/j.devcel.2014.03.014\n10.1016/j.tcb.2003.12.003\n10.1002/jcb.240550303\n10.1038/79683\n10.1073/pnas.1220108110\n10.1242/dev.063768\n10.1073/pnas.152324099\n10.1143/APEX.1.117002\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81169-1\n10.1111/j.0105-2896.2005.00332.x\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05238.x\n10.1002/jbmr.2196\n10.1038/nm.3668\n10.1359/jbmr.090603\n10.1097/01.mlg.0000191466.09210.9a\n10.1002/dvdy.10288\n10.1016/j.cmet.2006.05.012"}

However, the development of fibrosis suggests massive cellular death after transplantation. This study tested the hypothesis that islet graft function is limited by hypoxia-related death early after intramuscular transplantation, but that this can be overcome by cotransplantation of an oxygen carrier, that is, polymerized bovine hemoglobin (PolyHb).\nTwo hundred islets were transplanted with or without different doses of PolyHb intramuscularly to nondiabetic C57BL/6 and diabetic C57BL/6 nu/nu mice. \u03b2-cell hypoxia and apoptosis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry after injection of the biochemical marker pimonidazole or by staining for caspase-3, respectively. Blood glucose concentrations were monitored for 30 days after islet transplantation and animals were then subjected to an intravenous glucose tolerance test.\nSubstantial hypoxia was observed in control islet grafts during the first 4 days after transplantation. Cotransplantation of PolyHb resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of \u03b2-cell hypoxia, but \u03b2-cell apoptosis was only reduced by cotransplantation of low-dose PolyHb (0.03 mg/g body weight) due to the inflammatory effects of higher PolyHb concentrations. Cotransplantation of low-dose PolyHb resulted in improved islet graft function 30 days after transplantation in diabetic mice, with a glucose tolerance comparable to transplantation of 50% more islets.\nWe conclude that cotransplantation of islets with PolyHb can be used to effectively bridge the critical hypoxic phase immediately after transplantation, improve islet graft function, and reduce the number of islets needed for successful intramuscular transplantation.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2015-10-02", "authors": ["DanielEspes", "JoeyLau", "MyQuach", "UddyalokBanerjee", "Andre FPalmer", "Per-OlaCarlsson"], "doi": "10.1097/TP.0000000000000815"}

{"title": "The Mesothelial Origin of Carcinoma Associated-Fibroblasts in Peritoneal Metastasis.", "abstract": "Solid tumors are complex and unstructured organs that, in addition to cancer cells, also contain other cell types. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent an important population in the tumor microenviroment and participate in several stages of tumor progression, including cancer cell migration/invasion and metastasis. During peritoneal metastasis, cancer cells detach from the primary tumor, such as ovarian or gastrointestinal, disseminate through the peritoneal fluid and colonize the peritoneum. Tumor cells metastasize by attaching to and invading through the mesothelial cell (MC) monolayer that lines the peritoneal cavity, then colonizing the submesothelial compact zone where CAFs accumulate. CAFs may derive from different sources depending on the surrounding metastatic niche. In peritoneal metastasis, a sizeable subpopulation of CAFs originates from MCs through a mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT), which promotes adhesion, invasion, vascularization and subsequent tumor growth. The bidirectional communication between cancer cells and MC-derived CAFs via secretion of a wide range of cytokines, growth factors and extracellular matrix components seems to be crucial for the establishment and progression of the metastasis in the peritoneum. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of novel advances in understanding how peritoneal CAFs provide cancer cells with a supportive microenvironment, as well as the development of future therapeutic approaches by interfering with the MMT in the peritoneum.", "journal": "Cancers", "date": "2015-10-02", "authors": ["AngelaRynne-Vidal", "Jos\u00e9 AntonioJim\u00e9nez-Heffernan", "Concepci\u00f3nFern\u00e1ndez-Chac\u00f3n", "ManuelL\u00f3pez-Cabrera", "PilarSandoval"], "doi": "10.3390/cancers7040872\n10.1007/s00428-012-1287-y\n10.1016/S1470-2045(06)70939-1\n10.1016/j.crad.2006.06.015\n10.1097/01.sla.0000197702.46394.16\n10.1155/2014/912418\n10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2014.07.005\n10.1186/1477-7819-7-5\n10.1002/path.4281\n10.1038/nrc865\n10.1016/j.biocel.2009.01.015\n10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02195.x\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.3389/fcell.2015.00033\n10.1371/journal.pone.0088018\n10.1007/s00428-003-0963-3\n10.1055/s-0028-1082388\n10.4161/cc.5.15.3112\n10.1002/cm.970290302\n10.1083/jcb.122.1.103\n10.1073/pnas.90.3.999\n10.1016/j.ccr.2012.08.013\n10.1007/s13277-012-0638-2\n10.1083/jcb.130.2.393\n10.1002/jcp.24347\n10.1101/gad.1636908\n10.1038/nature03096\n10.1007/s10555-011-9340-x\n10.1387/ijdb.041802ad\n10.1038/nrc1877\n10.1002/emmm.200900043\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604662\n10.1681/ASN.2008050513\n10.1056/NEJMoa020809\n10.1096/fj.13-236828\n10.1073/pnas.1214136110\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.03.520\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.02.017\n10.1007/s13277-014-1808-1\n10.1155/2014/473134\n10.1172/JCI39104\n10.1681/ASN.2009070694\n10.1681/ASN.2006111292\n10.1093/annonc/mdl499\n10.1016/S0748-7983(96)80009-6\n10.1111/j.1525-1438.2006.00777.x\n10.1016/0304-3835(92)90186-Y\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1800\n10.1002/ijc.29385\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19991112)83:4<476::AID-IJC7>3.0.CO;2-V\n10.1046/j.1365-2249.1998.00576.x\n10.1016/j.ygyno.2005.02.017\n10.1016/S0959-8049(03)00427-1\n10.1111/j.1471-0528.2001.00206.x\n10.1002/1097-0142(19931015)72:8<2433::AID-CNCR2820720822>3.0.CO;2-L\n10.1046/j.1526-0968.2003.00087.x\n10.1002/jcp.20307\n10.1007/s00441-005-0002-6\n10.1186/1479-5876-2-23\n10.1016/j.ygyno.2015.05.009\n10.1186/1471-2407-14-288\n10.1186/1471-2407-11-210\n10.1152/ajpendo.00573.2014\n10.1016/j.ygyno.2015.08.010\n10.1007/s10555-013-9456-2\n10.1200/JCO.2005.02.047\n10.1681/ASN.2010111197\n10.1002/ijc.25961\n10.1007/s13277-013-1472-x\n10.1002/cncy.21442\n10.1371/journal.pone.0130472\n10.1093/carcin/bgu130\n10.1042/BST0370918\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6601635\n10.1007/s10585-004-5768-5\n10.1158/2159-8274.CD-11-0010\n10.1172/JCI69815\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.04.023\n10.1007/s10555-012-9351-2\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.03.012\n10.1080/15419060390262561\n10.1074/jbc.M312372200\n10.1007/s10585-005-2893-8\n10.1023/A:1026519016213\n10.1002/ijc.25036\n10.1007/s00464-010-1067-1\n10.1007/s10120-014-0400-0\n10.1016/j.cyto.2012.09.013\n10.4161/cc.8.5.7703\n10.1172/JCI33775\n10.1371/journal.pone.0057659\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2678\n10.1172/JCI74778\n10.1371/journal.pone.0031492\n10.1038/onc.2013.584\n10.1038/onc.2014.246\n10.1002/ijc.22874\n10.1093/carcin/bgr230\n10.1016/j.canlet.2014.09.041\n10.3892/ijo.2012.1490\n10.1186/1471-2407-10-553\n10.1007/BF03032599\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.015\n10.1530/REP-14-0546\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2014.02.006\n10.1016/j.canlet.2013.01.042\n10.1681/ASN.2004060436\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0366\n10.1016/j.jss.2012.04.074\n10.1186/1471-2407-14-125\n10.1038/35077241\n10.1007/s12307-009-0032-9\n10.1016/j.tranon.2014.02.013\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060776\n10.1053/j.ajkd.2005.08.011\n10.1016/S0022-4804(03)00307-X\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0304\n10.1517/14728222.9.6.1217\n10.1093/jb/mvq043\n10.1093/ndt/gfp480\n10.1093/ndt/gfp618\n10.1093/ndt/gfl355\n10.1242/dmm.001321\n10.1242/jcs.071647\n10.1038/labinvest.2012.166\n10.1681/ASN.2008020211\n10.1093/ndt/gfp384\n10.1016/j.ejogrb.2009.05.030\n10.1016/j.cca.2010.12.026\n10.1056/NEJMoa061652\n10.1053/j.gastro.2006.08.079\n10.1200/JCO.2010.29.6244\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.636746\n10.1186/1757-2215-5-7\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0172\n10.1038/onc.2010.532\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5167\n10.2353/ajpath.2009.080613\n10.1016/j.arr.2013.01.008\n10.5114/wo.2013.33768\n10.1371/journal.pone.0061165\n10.1007/s005950070101\n10.1016/j.gendis.2014.12.002\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07919.x\n10.1038/nrc745\n10.1186/1471-2407-12-129\n10.1007/s10555-011-9337-5\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2015.05.009\n10.1517/14712598.2011.557657\n10.1056/NEJMoa1103799"}

{"title": "Reconstruction of open wounds as a complication of spinal surgery with flaps: a systematic review.", "abstract": "OBJECT A systematic review of the available evidence on the prophylactic and therapeutic use of flaps for the coverage of complex spinal soft-tissue defects was performed to determine if the use of flaps reduces postoperative complications and improves patient outcomes. METHODS A PubMed database search was performed to identify English-language articles published between 1990 and 2014 that contained the following phrases to describe postoperative wounds (\"wound,\" \"complex back wound,\" \"postoperative wound,\" \"spine surgery\") and intervention (\"flap closure,\" \"flap coverage,\" \"soft tissue reconstruction,\" \"muscle flap\"). RESULTS In total, 532 articles were reviewed with 17 articles meeting the inclusion criteria of this study. The risk factors from the pooled analysis of 262 patients for the development of postoperative complex back wounds that necessitated muscle flap coverage included the involvement of instrumentation (77.6%), a previous history of radiotherapy (33.2%), smoking (20.6%), and diabetes mellitus (17.2%). In patients with instrumentation, prophylactic coverage of the wound with a well-vascularized flap was shown to result in a lower incidence of wound complications. One study showed a statistically significant decrease in complications compared with patients where prophylactic coverage was not performed (20% vs 45%). The indications for flap coverage after onset of wound complications included hardware exposure, wound infection, dehiscence, seroma, and hematoma. Flap coverage was shown to decrease the number of surgical debridements needed and also salvage hardware, with the rate of hardware removal after flap coverage ranging from 0% to 41.9% in 4 studies. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic coverage with flaps in high-risk patients undergoing spine surgery reduces complications, while therapeutic coverage following wound complications allows the salvage of hardware in the majority of patients.", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "date": "2015-10-02", "authors": ["Lee OnnChieng", "ZacharyHubbard", "Christopher JSalgado", "Allan DLevi", "HarveyChim"], "doi": "10.3171/2015.7.FOCUS15245"}

Although several microsurgical treatments have been described, the optimal treatment has yet to be determined. We describe our initial experience with symptomatic lesions combining 1) cyst fenestration and imbrication and 2) filling the epidural space using vascularized paraspinous muscle flaps rotated into the cystic cavity.\nWe retrospectively reviewed all consecutive cases of symptomatic giant sacral Tarlov cysts treated with microsurgery at our institution between 2003 and 2011. The main outcome measure was self-reported symptom relief. Postoperative imaging, surgical complications, and subsequent treatments were also recorded.\nThirty-five patients were treated. Mean age was 52 years. All patients presented with a chief complaint of sacral-perineal pain. The mean cyst size was 3.6 cm (largest diameter). Follow-up beyond the initial hospital stay was available in 86% (median 8 months). Ninety-three percent reported improvement in pain at some point during the postoperative course but 50% of those developed recurrent pain symptoms. Postoperative imaging was available in 69% of the patients in whom 92% showed complete obliteration (25%) or reduction in cyst size (67%).\nThe combination of microsurgical cyst fenestration and the use of vascularized muscle pedicle flaps to fill the cystic cavity and the epidural space results in obliteration or reduction in size of the majority of cysts and is associated with initial improvement in pain in most patients.

{"title": "Convergent evolution of vascular optimization in kelp (Laminariales).", "abstract": "Terrestrial plants and mammals, although separated by a great evolutionary distance, have each arrived at a highly conserved body plan in which universal allometric scaling relationships govern the anatomy of vascular networks and key functional metabolic traits. The universality of allometric scaling suggests that these phyla have each evolved an 'optimal' transport strategy that has been overwhelmingly adopted by extant species. To truly evaluate the dominance and universality of vascular optimization, however, it is critical to examine other, lesser-known, vascularized phyla. The brown algae (Phaeophyceae) are one such group--as distantly related to plants as mammals, they have convergently evolved a plant-like body plan and a specialized phloem-like transport network. To evaluate possible scaling and optimization in the kelp vascular system, we developed a model of optimized transport anatomy and tested it with measurements of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, which is among the largest and most successful of macroalgae. We also evaluated three classical allometric relationships pertaining to plant vascular tissues with a diverse sampling of kelp species. Macrocystis pyrifera displays strong scaling relationships between all tested vascular parameters and agrees with our model; other species within the Laminariales display weak or inconsistent vascular allometries. The lack of universal scaling in the kelps and the presence of optimized transport anatomy in M. pyrifera raises important questions about the evolution of optimization and the possible competitive advantage conferred by optimized vascular systems to multicellular phyla.", "journal": "Proceedings.

All patients had clinical symptoms prompting at the time of imaging. All patients first underwent whole-body contrast-enhanced CT and subsequently segmental volume perfusion CT for assessment of the degree of vascularization of (peri) aortitis as a surrogate marker for inflammatory activity. Blood flow, blood volume, volume transfer constant (k-trans), time to peak and mean transit time were determined. The thickness of the increased connective tissue formation was measured. Perfusion data were correlated with clinical symptoms and acute-phase inflammatory parameters such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leukocyte number.\n21 of 35 patients were untreated and 14 of 35 had previous/ongoing immunosuppression. The interobserver agreement was good (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.78) for all perfusion parameters. Average values of perfusion parameters were higher in untreated patients but remained abnormally elevated in treated patients as well.

However, with local injection of particles into target tissue, the significant particle loss caused by external biomechanical forces is a great challenge yet to be resolved to date. We hypothesized that nanoparticles associated with tissue-adherent microbubbles in the form of core-shell particles due to van der Waals attractive forces would stably remain on an implanted site and significantly increase therapeutic efficacy of drug cargos. To examine this hypothesis, we used 100 nm diameter nanoparticles made of poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as a model nanoparticle and 50 \u03bcm diameter microbubbles made of poly(2-hydroxyethyl aspartamide) (PHEA) grafted with octadecyl chains, PHEA-g-C18, as a model microbubble. Simple mixing of PLGA nanoparticles and PHEA-g-C18 microbubbles resulted in the core-shell particles. Following implantation, the PHEA-g-C18 microbubbles acted as glue to minimize the displacement of PLGA nanoparticles, because of the association between the octadecyl chains on PHEA-g-C18 and the epithelium of the tissue. As a consequence, the core-shell particles prepared with Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1)-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles significantly promoted vascularization in the implanted tissue.

Two kinds of vaccines were separately tested in two independent experiments of CIA. In the first, we tested a kinoid of the murine cytokine VEGF (VEGF-K), obtained by conjugating VEGF-A to KLH. For the second, we selected two VEGF-A-derived peptide sequences to produce heterocomplexes (Vpep1-K and Vpep2-K).

However, the skull attenuates acoustic waves, so fUS in rats currently requires craniotomy or a thinned-skull window. Here we propose a non-invasive approach by enhancing the fUS signal with a contrast agent, inert gas microbubbles. Plane-wave illumination of the brain at high frame rate (500Hz compounded sequence with three tilted plane waves, PRF=1500Hz with a 128 element 15MHz linear transducer), yields highly-resolved neurovascular maps. We compared fUS imaging performance through the intact skull bone (transcranial fUS) versus a thinned-skull window in the same animal. First, we show that the vascular network of the adult rat brain can be imaged transcranially only after a bolus intravenous injection of microbubbles, which leads to a 9dB gain in the contrast-to-tissue ratio. Next, we demonstrate that functional increase in the blood volume of the primary sensory cortex after targeted electrical-evoked stimulations of the sciatic nerve is observable transcranially in presence of contrast agents, with high reproducibility (Pearson's coefficient \u03c1=0.7\u00b10.1, p=0.85). Our work demonstrates that the combination of ultrafast Doppler imaging and injection of contrast agent allows non-invasive functional brain imaging through the intact skull bone in rats.

{"title": "Vascular autorescaling of fMRI (VasA fMRI) improves sensitivity of population studies: A pilot study.", "abstract": "The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is widely used for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain function in health and disease. The statistical power of fMRI group studies is significantly hampered by high inter-subject variance due to differences in baseline vascular physiology. Several methods have been proposed to account for physiological vascularization differences between subjects and hence improve the sensitivity in group studies. However, these methods require the acquisition of additional reference scans (such as a full resting-state fMRI session or ASL-based calibrated BOLD). We present a vascular autorescaling (VasA) method, which does not require any additional reference scans. VasA is based on the observation that slow oscillations (<0.1Hz) in arterial blood CO2 levels occur naturally due to changes in respiration patterns. These oscillations yield fMRI signal changes whose amplitudes reflect the blood oxygenation levels and underlying local vascularization and vascular responsivity. VasA estimates proxies of the amplitude of these CO2-driven oscillations directly from the residuals of task-related fMRI data without the need for reference scans. The estimates are used to scale the amplitude of task-related fMRI responses, to account for vascular differences. The VasA maps compared well to cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) maps and cerebral blood volume maps based on vascular space occupancy (VASO) measurements in four volunteers, speaking to the physiological vascular basis of VasA. VasA was validated in a wide variety of tasks in 138 volunteers. VasA increased t-scores by up to 30% in specific brain areas such as the visual cortex. The number of activated voxels was increased by up to 200% in brain areas such as the orbital frontal cortex while still controlling the nominal false-positive rate.

While modern regenerative approaches are based on the transplantation of stem cell-derived cells, natural regeneration in lower vertebrates, such as zebrafish and newts, relies predominantly on the intrinsic plasticity of mature tissues. This property involves local activation of the remaining material at the site of injury to promote cell division, cell migration and complete reproduction of the missing structure. It remains an unresolved question why adult mammals are not equally competent to reactivate morphogenetic programmes. Although organ regeneration depends strongly on the proliferative properties of cells in the injured tissue, it is apparent that various organismic factors, such as innervation, vascularization, hormones, metabolism and the immune system, can affect this process.

While displaying high individual variation, the luteal VEGFA was elevated during pre-implantation and post-implantation, followed by a decrease during mid-gestation, which was more pronounced at the mRNA level, and showed constant expression afterwards. Within the uterus, it increased following implantation and during mid-gestation in ut-pl compartments, but was downregulated at prepartum luteolysis. Luteal VEGFR1 expression resembled that of VEGFA; VEGFR2 remained unaffected throughout pregnancy. In ut-pl compartments, both receptors increased gradually towards mid-gestation; a prepartum decrease was observed for VEGFR1. Antigestagen-treatment resulted in decreased expression of ut-pl VEGFR1. In the CL, VEGFA stained in luteal cells. Uterine signals of VEGFA and its two receptors were observed in epithelial and vascular compartments, and in myometrium. In placental labyrinth, additionally, trophoblast stained positively. Luteal VEGFR1 was localized to the luteal cells and tunica media of blood vessels, whereas VEGFR2 stained only in capillary endothelial cells. The upregulation of luteal and the ut-pl VEGF system during early gestational stages supports the increased vascularization rate during this time. The diminishing effects of the prepartum endocrine milieu on VEGFA function seem to be more pronounced in the ut-pl units.", "journal": "General and comparative endocrinology", "date": "2015-09-29", "authors": ["AykutGram", "BerndHoffmann", "AloisBoos", "Mariusz PKowalewski"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ygcen.2015.09.020"}

However, a number of technical challenges are often associated with iPSC-ECs in culture, including instability of the endothelial phenotype and limited cell proliferative capacity over time. Early senescence is believed to be the primary mechanism underlying these limitations. Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) is an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase involved in the regulation of cell senescence, redox state, and inflammatory status. We hypothesize that overexpression of the SIRT1 gene in iPSC-ECs will maintain EC phenotype, function, and proliferative capacity by overcoming early cell senescence. SIRT1 gene was packaged into a lentiviral vector (LV-SIRT1) and transduced into iPSC-ECs at passage 4. Beginning with passage 5, iPSC-ECs exhibited a fibroblast-like morphology, whereas iPSC-ECs overexpressing SIRT1 maintained EC cobblestone morphology. SIRT1 overexpressing iPSC-ECs also exhibited a higher percentage of canonical markers of endothelia (LV-SIRT1 61.8% CD31(+) vs. LV-empty 31.7% CD31(+), P\u2009<\u20090.001; LV-SIRT1 46.3% CD144(+) vs. LV-empty 20.5% CD144(+), P\u2009<\u20090.02), with a higher nitric oxide synthesis, lower \u03b2-galactosidase production indicating decreased senescence (3.4% for LV-SIRT1 vs. 38.6% for LV-empty, P\u2009<\u20090.001), enhanced angiogenesis, increased deacetylation activity, and higher proliferation rate. SIRT1 overexpressing iPSC-ECs continued to proliferate through passage 9 with high purity of EC-like characteristics, while iPSC-ECs without SIRT1 overexpression became senescent after passage 5. Taken together, SIRT1 overexpression in iPSC-ECs maintains EC phenotype, improves EC function, and extends cell lifespan, overcoming critical hurdles associated with the use of iPSC-ECs in translational research.", "journal": "Stem cells and development", "date": "2015-09-29", "authors": ["BinJiang", "MicheleJen", "LouisianePerrin", "Jason AWertheim", "Guillermo AAmeer"], "doi": "10.1089/scd.2015.0191"}

Intraretinal exudates developed and retinal hemorrhages increased in the left eye at 51 weeks of PMA. Diode laser photocoagulation (LP) was applied to the left eye. Exudates involved the macula, and telangiectatic changes developed one month following LP. Additional LP was applied to the left eye combined with intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection at 55 weeks of PMA. Disease regressed one month after the additional therapy. At the 14-month examination of the baby, telangiectatic changes and intraretinal exudates were observed in the right eye. Diode LP was applied to the right eye combined with IVB injection. Exudates did not resolve completely, and cryotherapy was applied one month following LP. Retinal findings regressed three months following the cryotherapy. Conclusion.

For complex tissue loss, it may be advantageous to harvest the free serratus anterior with rib myo-osseous composite flap. We performed 20\u00a0osteomuscular serratus anterior composite flap between 2008 and 2010.\nWe retrospectively studied the records of 20\u00a0patients, by separately analyzing the characteristics of the bone defect and the soft tissue loss. Patients have been recently reviewed by an independent operator. We compared our results to other reconstruction techniques and other similar series reported in the literature.\nThe average age of our patients was 43\u00a0years and 11\u00a0months. In all cases, defect was traumatic. The average follow-up was 5\u00a0years (4.5 to 5.8). The average flap area was 135cm(2) and the average rib length was 9.21cm. Our microsurgical success rate is 95%. Our global consolidation rate is 82%.\nUse of vascularized rib in the treatment of lower limb traumatic defects is rare. The bone quality of rib is lower than fibula, but the coverage provided is better, due to serratus anterior muscle. The length and diameter of the vascular pedicle is very useful too. Our results are comparable to other series using this flap. Its coverage properties and the possibility of simultaneous bone reconstruction is useful.

We tested the hypothesis that incorporating angiogenic growth factor into a scaffold-stem cell construct and implanting this construct around a vascular pedicle improves neovascularization and adipogenesis for engineering soft tissue flaps. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic-acid/polyethylene glycol (PLGA/PEG) microspheres containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were impregnated into collagen-chitosan scaffolds seeded with human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). This setup was analyzed in vitro and then implanted into isolated chambers around a discrete vascular pedicle in nude rats. Engineered tissue samples within the chambers were harvested and analyzed for differences in vascularization and adipose tissue growth. In vitro testing showed that the collagen-chitosan scaffold provided a supportive environment for hASC integration and proliferation. PLGA/PEG microspheres with slow-release VEGF had no negative effect on cell survival in collagen-chitosan scaffolds. In vivo, the system resulted in a statistically significant increase in neovascularization that in turn led to a significant increase in adipose tissue persistence after 8 weeks versus control constructs. These data indicate that our model-hASCs integrated with a collagen-chitosan scaffold incorporated with VEGF-containing PLGA/PEG microspheres supported by a predominant vascular vessel inside a chamber-provides a promising, clinically translatable platform for engineering vascularized soft tissue flap.

Inclusion criteria were post-menopausal bleeding and a thick endometrium greater than 5mm. The ultrasound image showing the most vascularized section through the endometrium as assessed by power Doppler was frozen to estimate endometrial thickness and features. The vascularity index was calculated using computer software. A structured history was taken to collect clinical information. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to create mathematical models to predict endometrial malignancy.\nThere were 31 (26.4%) malignant and 86 (74.6%) benign endometria\u2026 Women with a malignant endometrium were older (median age 61 vs 56 years, P=0.036) and had a thicker endometrium (median thickness 18.8mm vs 12.5; P=0.002) and higher values for vascularity index. When using only clinical data to build a model for estimating the risk of endometrial malignancy, a model including the variables age had the largest area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC), with a value of 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.79). A model including age and endometrial thickness had an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.50-0.96), and one including age, endometrial thickness and vascularity index had an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.62-0.97).

We present the first case of successful multiple EGS in a patient with brain ischemic disease who presented with different cerebrovascular findings from MMD.\nA 13-year-old girl had an increased frequency of transient ischemic attacks that affected her right extremities. Digital subtraction angiography showed tapering of the internal carotid artery (ICA). The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) were visible on vertebral angiogram, but not on carotid angiogram. The intact circle of Willis and lack of hypervascularity of the lenticulostriate arteries were observed. Decreased regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the bilateral ACA and MCA territories quantified by (123)I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine-single photon emission computed tomography indicated the need for extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery. Multiple EGS procedures were performed instead of direct anastomosis, which is the standard procedure for intracranial ICA stenosis, because the space for the craniotomy was limited by transdural anastomosis.\nDespite the fact that the diagnosis of MMD was questionable, the hemispheres were well vascularized, and the neurology and CBF improved postoperatively.\nThe preserved circle of Willis and lack of moyamoya vessels were inconsistent with the features of MMD. However, childhood onset, bilateralness, chronic intracranial ICA stenosis, and transdural anastomosis indicated the same underling pathogenicity as MMD. It is hypothesized that ICA stenosis occurred immediately proximal to the posterior communicating artery in this case.

Our hypothesis is that vascular damage occurred in the long process of the malleus during tympanic membrane detachment before fastening a malleovestibulopexy (MVP) prosthesis promotes the lysis of this ossicle at the attachment site. To confirm this premise, we carried out an evolutive and descriptive study of ten MVP procedures as well as a morphological analysis of ten cadaveric mallei using both light and scanning electron microscopies. The arterial supply of the manubrium comes from two main sources: vascular branches that reach this ossicle from the site of insertion of the tensor tympani tendon and small perforating branches which penetrate the bone from arteries of the tympanic membrane that, following the periosteum/perichondrium, they arrange parallel to the bone. The detachment of the tympanic membrane to fasten a MVP prosthesis causes a damage in the periosteal/perichondral vascular supply of the handle as well as micro-trauma on it, which can promote bone resorption at the point of anchorage by osteoclast stimulation. Respect periosteal vascularization of the manubrium may be important to prevent damage in this ossicle caused by some middle ear reconstruction prostheses.", "journal": "European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery", "date": "2015-09-26", "authors": ["L AVallejo-Valdezate", "DHerrero-Calvo", "MGarrosa-Garc\u00eda"], "doi": "10.1007/s00405-015-3787-2"}

T-cell defects in tumors can be reversed by treating tumor-bearing mice with multivalent forms of the Notch receptor ligand DLL-1, but the immunologic correlates of this effect have not been elucidated. Here, we report mechanistic insights along with the efficacy of combinational treatments of multivalent DLL-1 with oncoprotein targeting drugs in preclinical mouse models of lung cancer. Systemic DLL-1 administration increased T-cell infiltration into tumors and elevated numbers of CD44(+)CD62L(+)CD8(+) memory T cells while decreasing the number of regulatory T cells and limiting tumor vascularization. This treatment was associated with upregulation of Notch and its ligands in tumor-infiltrating T cells enhanced expression of T-bet and phosphorylation of Stat1/2. Adoptive transfer of T cells from DLL1-treated tumor-bearing immunocompetent hosts into tumor-bearing SCID-NOD immunocompromised mice attenuated tumor growth and extended tumor-free survival in the recipients. When combined with the EGFR-targeted drug erlotinib, DLL-1 significantly improved progression-free survival by inducing robust tumor-specific T-cell immunity. In tissue culture, DLL1 induced proliferation of human peripheral T cells, but lacked proliferative or clonogenic effects on lung cancer cells. Our findings offer preclinical mechanistic support for the development of multivalent DLL1 to stimulate antitumor immunity.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2015-09-26", "authors": ["Asel KBiktasova", "Duafalia FDudimah", "Roman VUzhachenko", "KyunghoPark", "AnwariAkhter", "Rajeswara RArasada", "Jason VEvans", "Sergey VNovitskiy", "Elena ETchekneva", "David PCarbone", "AnilShanker", "Mikhail MDikov"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1154"}

However, the NSF repair after skull base resection for anterior cranial base malignancies may demonstrate radiologic findings confusing for recurrent or residual disease on postoperative surveillance imaging. The objective of the current study was to review neuroradiologic misinterpretations of NSF reconstruction following anterior cranial base malignancies. Methods\u2003A multicenter review of patients reconstructed with the NSF after endoscopic resection of anterior cranial base malignancies from 2008 to 2013 was performed. Data were collected regarding etiology, surgical technique, locoregional control, and postoperative radiologic assessments. Only patients with at least one postoperative surveillance scan with inaccurate assessment of residual or recurrent malignancy were included in the study. Results\u2003Over 5 years, 13 patients were identified who had erroneous reporting of malignancy due to NSF reconstruction. On average, two neuroradiologists interpreted the NSF as persistent or recurrent malignancy over this time period (range: 1-7). The key findings suspicious for recurrence were enhancement and soft tissue thickening of the NSF. These findings were present in at least one postoperative scan in all patients.

VEGF expression was evaluated in 50 cervical cancer samples by immunohistochemical staining. Microvessel density was assessed by immunostaining for CD31-positive endothelial cells in the most vascularized areas of tumors. VEGF expression and microvessel density were significantly higher in adenocarcinomas than in squamous cell carcinomas. However, in cases of adenocarcinoma, no significant correlations were found among VEGF expression, microvessel density, and clinicopathological parameters. In contrast, for squamous cell carcinomas, microvessel density was significantly higher in cases at an advanced stage and in those with several other poor prognostic factors. The finding that cervical adenocarcinomas exhibited greater VEGF expression and microvessel density than squamous cell carcinomas may explain the poorer prognosis of adenocarcinoma compared with squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, microvessel density in squamous cell carcinomas was significantly correlated with poor prognostic factors.

This study tests the hypothesis that this \"allograft revitalization\" technique is as effective as vascularized autograft for repairing critical bony defects.\nThree groups of pigs had 3-cm defects created in their bilateral tibial diaphyses for repair using rigid fixation and one of three modalities. Negative control tibias were repaired with allograft tibia alone. To simulate repair using vascularized autograft, the osteotomized bone in positive control animals was left in situ, with the posterior periosteum intact. Experimental animals' defects were repaired with allograft tibia packed with autologous adipose-derived stem cells and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2, with native periosteum intact. After 8 weeks, unilateral midgraft osteotomies were performed to assess graft healing potential. Serial radiographs and terminal micro-computed tomography and histology enabled evaluation of healing.\nAt week 7 after ostectomy, no negative control tibias had healed (zero of six) whereas most positive control (five of six) and all experimental tibias (six of six) had healed. Unilateral midgraft osteotomies were performed at 8 weeks to assess graft ability to heal. As expected, no negative control tibias (three of three) had radiographic union 7 weeks later. However, all positive control (two of two; p = 0.05) and experimental (three of three; p = 0.01) tibias had healed their repeated osteotomies by this time.\nSimilar to vascularized autograft, revitalized allograft successfully repaired a critical tibial defect, including after refracture, suggesting that this technique may be an alternative to osseous free flaps.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2015-09-24", "authors": ["Christopher MRunyan", "Anthony TVu", "AaronRumburg", "KevinBove", "JohnRacadio", "David ABillmire", "Jesse ATaylor"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0000000000001637"}

Previously, the authors used a \"chamber\" model that promotes intense angiogenesis in vivo as a platform for functional three-dimensional muscle and renal engineering. A silicone membrane used to define the structure and to contain the constructs is successful in the short term. However, over time, generated tissues contract and decrease in size in a manner similar to capsular contracture seen around many commonly used surgical implants. The authors hypothesized that modification of the chamber structure or internal surface would promote tissue adherence and maintain construct volume.\nThree chamber configurations were tested against volume maintenance. Previously studied, smooth silicone surfaces were compared to chambers modified for improved tissue adherence, with multiple transmembrane perforations or lined with a commercially available textured surface. Tissues were allowed to mature long term in a rat model, before analysis.\nOn explantation, average tissue masses were 49, 102, and 122 mg; average volumes were 74, 158 and 176 \u03bcl; and average cross-sectional areas were 1.6, 6.7, and 8.7 mm for the smooth, perforated, and textured groups, respectively. Both perforated and textured designs demonstrated significantly greater measures than the smooth-surfaced constructs in all respects.\nBy modifying the design of chambers supporting vascularized, three-dimensional, in vivo tissue engineering constructs, generated tissue mass, volume, and area can be maintained over a long time course.

We generated a new mouse model of constitutive Gpr116 inactivation, with a large genetic deletion encompassing exon 4 to exon 21 of the Gpr116 gene. This model allowed us to confirm recent results defining Gpr116 as necessary regulator of surfactant homeostasis. The loss of Gpr116 provokes an early accumulation of surfactant in the lungs, followed by a massive infiltration of macrophages, and eventually progresses into an emphysema-like pathology. Further analysis of this knockout model revealed cerebral vascular leakage, beginning at around 1.5 months of age. Additionally, endothelial-specific deletion of Gpr116 resulted in a significant increase of the brain vascular leakage. Mice devoid of Gpr116 developed an anatomically normal and largely functional vascular network, surprisingly exhibited an attenuated pathological retinal vascular response in a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy.

{"title": "Enhanced Viability of Endothelial Colony Forming Cells in Fibrin Microbeads for Sensor Vascularization.", "abstract": "Enhanced vascularization at sensor interfaces can improve long-term function. Fibrin, a natural polymer, has shown promise as a biomaterial for sensor coating due to its ability to sustain endothelial cell growth and promote local vascularization. However, the culture of cells, particularly endothelial cells (EC), within 3D scaffolds for more than a few days is challenging due to rapid loss of EC viability. In this manuscript, a robust method for developing fibrin microbead scaffolds for long-term culture of encapsulated ECs is described. Fibrin microbeads are formed using sodium alginate as a structural template. The size, swelling and structural properties of the microbeads were varied with needle gauge and composition and concentration of the pre-gel solution.

Three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler US with high-definition flow (HDF) technology was used to investigate the blood flow in and morphological features of the tumors. Six vascularity quantization features, three morphological features, and two vascular direction features were selected and extracted from the US images. A support vector machine was used to evaluate the changes in vascularity after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and pCR and PR were predicted on the basis of these changes.The most accurate prediction of pCR was achieved after the first chemotherapy cycle, with an accuracy of 93.1% and a specificity of 85.5%, while that of a PR was achieved after the second cycle, with an accuracy of 79.31% and a specificity of 72.22%.Vascularity data can be useful to predict the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

{"title": "Sensitization and desensitization of burn patients as potential candidates for vascularized composite allotransplantation.", "abstract": "Sensitization describes the acquired ability of the immune system to react to foreign human leukocyte antigens (HLA) by producing antibodies and developing memory cells. In the field of transplantation, recipient preformed HLA antibodies due to previous sensitization have been identified - beneath ABO incompatibility - as a major factor for acute graft rejection. Several reasons for sensitization have largely been studied, such as previous blood transfusions, pregnancies or former transplants. Recent studies indicate that the use of assist devices (e.g. ECMO) or cadaveric skin allotransplantation providing temporary coverage in burn patients may lead to additional sensitization. As vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) has become a rapidly advancing therapeutic option for reconstruction of complex tissue defects in burns, it seems even more important to become familiar with immunological principles and to be cautiously aware of both sources of sensitization and therapeutic concepts in burns avoiding sensitization. This may also include emergency VCAs in burn patients as potential strategy for early definitive reconstruction avoiding procedures triggering HLA antibody formation.

{"title": "Quantitative volumetric imaging of normal, neoplastic and hyperplastic mouse prostate using ultrasound.", "abstract": "Genetically engineered mouse models are essential to the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying human prostate pathology and the effects of therapy on the diseased prostate. Serial in vivo volumetric imaging expands the scope and accuracy of experimental investigations of models of normal prostate physiology, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer, which are otherwise limited by the anatomy of the mouse prostate. Moreover, accurate imaging of hyperplastic and tumorigenic prostates is now recognized as essential to rigorous pre-clinical trials of new therapies. Bioluminescent imaging has been widely used to determine prostate tumor size, but is semi-quantitative at best. Magnetic resonance imaging can determine prostate volume very accurately, but is expensive and has low throughput. We therefore sought to develop and implement a high throughput, low cost, and accurate serial imaging protocol for the mouse prostate.\nWe developed a high frequency ultrasound imaging technique employing 3D reconstruction that allows rapid and precise assessment of mouse prostate volume. Wild-type mouse prostates were examined (n = 4) for reproducible baseline imaging, and treatment effects on volume were compared, and blinded data analyzed for intra- and inter-operator assessments of reproducibility by correlation and for Bland-Altman analysis. Examples of benign prostatic hyperplasia mouse model prostate (n = 2) and mouse prostate implantation of orthotopic human prostate cancer tumor and its growth (n =\u2009 ) are also demonstrated.\nSerial measurement volume of the mouse prostate revealed that high frequency ultrasound was very precise. Following endocrine manipulation, regression and regrowth of the prostate could be monitored with very low intra- and interobserver variability. This technique was also valuable to monitor the development of prostate growth in a model of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Additionally, we demonstrate accurate ultrasound image-guided implantation of orthotopic tumor xenografts and monitoring of subsequent tumor growth from ~10 to ~750 mm(3) volume.\nHigh frequency ultrasound imaging allows precise determination of normal, neoplastic and hyperplastic mouse prostate. Low cost and small image size allows incorporation of this imaging modality inside clean animal facilities, and thereby imaging of immunocompromised models. 3D reconstruction for volume determination is easily mastered, and both small and large relative changes in volume are accurately visualized. Ultrasound imaging does not rely on penetration of exogenous imaging agents, and so may therefore better measure poorly vascularized or necrotic diseased tissue, relative to bioluminescent imaging (IVIS).\nOur method is precise and reproducible with very low inter- and intra-observer variability.

In this study, collateral vessel development is reported in CAM assay useful in analysis of angiogenesis. Four days old white Leghorn fertilized chicken eggs were inoculated with vehicle, standard or test angiogenesis inhibitor using standard protocol. Central vessel growth was seen tapering down and collateral vessels were developed from the lower side of the chorioallantoic membrane moving upward in 12 days old standard or test treated CAMs. In the absence of the central vessel, collateral blood supply helped in survival of embryos. Hence, development of collateral vessels was used for ranking of blood vessels and angiogenesis in addition to well-known standard parameters related to central vessel. The finding could differentiate molecules inhibiting angiogenesis with or without collateralization which is crucial in anti-angiogenic therapy used for cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

{"title": "Organotypic brain slice cultures as a model to study angiogenesis of brain vessels.", "abstract": "Brain vessels are the most important structures in the brain to deliver energy and substrates to neurons. Brain vessels are composed of a complex interaction between endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, controlling the entry of substrates into the brain. Damage of brain vessels and vascular impairment are general pathologies observed in different neurodegenerative disorders including e.g., Alzheimer's disease. In order to study remodeling of brain vessels, simple 3-dimensional in vitro systems need to be developed. Organotypic brain slices of mice provide a potent tool to explore angiogenic effects of brain vessels in a complex 3-dimensional structure. Here we show that organotypic brain slices can be cultured from 110 \u03bcm thick sections of postnatal and adult mice brains. The vessels are immunohistochemically stained for laminin and collagen IV. Co-stainings are an appropriate method to visualize interaction of brain endothelial cells with pericytes and astrocytes in these vessels. Different exogenous stimuli such as fibroblast growth factor-2 or vascular endothelial growth factor induce angiogenesis or re-growth, respectively. Hyperthermia or acidosis reduces the vessel density in organotypic slices.

{"title": "OCTOPUS Negatively Regulates BIN2 to Control Phloem Differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "abstract": "The phloem is a vascular strand that conducts photoassimilates and systemic signals throughout the plant to coordinate growth. To date, few molecular genetic determinants have been identified to control both specification and differentiation of this tissue [1-3]. Among them, OCTOPUS (OPS) protein was previously identified as a polarly localized plasma membrane-associated protein of unknown biochemical function whose broad provascular expression becomes restricted to the phloem upon differentiation [2]. OPS loss-of-function mutants showed an altered vascular network in cotyledons and an intermittent phloem differentiation in the root [2, 4]. Here, we demonstrate a role for OPS as a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway. Indeed, transgenic lines overexpressing OPS (OPS-OE) display the hallmarks of constitutively overactivated BR mutants. Physiological and genetic analyses place OPS as a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway upstream of the key transcription factors BES1 and BZR1. Directed protein interactions with known BR signaling proteins identified BIN2, a GSK3 protein involved in multiple signaling pathways, as a partner of OPS. This interaction recruits BIN2 to the plasma membrane, thus preventing its inhibitory activity in the nucleus. Finally, both bikinin (a potent inhibitor of GSK3 [5]) treatment and downstream dominant mutants bes1-D [6] and bzr1-D [7] can rescue phloem defects of ops in the root. Together, our data show that OPS antagonizes BIN2 to promote phloem differentiation.", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "date": "2015-09-22", "authors": ["PaulineAnne", "MarianneAzzopardi", "LionelGissot", "S\u00e9bastienBeaubiat", "KianH\u00e9maty", "Jean-ChristophePalauqui"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cub.2015.08.033"}

{"title": "Treatment of sunitinib-induced hypertension in solid tumor by nitric oxide donors.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR) are overexpressed in the majority of renal cell carcinomas. This characteristic has supported the rationale of targeting VEGF-driven tumour vascularization, especially in clear cell RCC. VEGF-inhibiting strategies include the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, axitinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib) and neutralizing antibodies such as bevacizumab. Hypertension (HTN) is one of the most common adverse effects of angiogenesis inhibitors. HTN observed in clinical trials appears to correlate with the potency of VEGF kinase inhibitor against VEGFR-2: agents with higher potency are associated with a higher incidence of HTN. Although the exact mechanism by tyrosine kinase inhibitors induce HTN has not yet been completely clarified, two key hypotheses have been postulated. First, some studies have pointed to a VEGF inhibitors-induced decrease in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production, that can result in vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. VEGF, mediated by PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathway, upregulates the endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme leading to up-regulation of NO production. So inhibition of signaling through the VEGF pathway would lead to a decrease in NO production, resulting in an increase in vascular resistance and blood pressure. Secondly a decrease in the number of microvascular endothelial cells and subsequent depletion of normal microvessel density (rarefaction) occurs upon VEGF signaling inhibition. NO donors could be successfully used not only for the treatment of developed angiogenesis-inhibitor-induced hypertension but also for preventive effects.", "journal": "Redox biology", "date": "2015-09-21", "authors": ["LLe\u00f3n-Mateos", "JMosquera", "LAnt\u00f3n Aparicio"], "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2015.09.007"}

The aim was to combine the blocking of blood supply to the target region and the inhibition of the embolization-stimulated angiogenesis. The material is composed of an ethanolic solution of a linear acrylate based copolymer and acrylate calibrated microparticles containing nanospheres loaded with sunitinib, an anti-angiogenic agent. The precipitation of the linear copolymer in aqueous environment after injection through microcatheter results in the formation of an in-situ embolization gel whereas the microparticles serve to increase the cohesive properties of the embolization agent and to form a reservoir from which the sunitinib-loaded nanospheres are released post-embolization. The swollen state of the microparticles in contact with aqueous medium results in the release of the nanospheres out of microparticles macromolecular structure. After the synthesis, the formulation and the characterization of the different components of the material, anti-angiogenic activity was evaluated in vitro using endothelial cells and in vivo using corneal neovascularization model in rabbit. The efficiency of the arterial embolization was tested in vivo in a sheep model. Results proved the feasibility of this new system for vascular embolization in association with an in situ delivery of anti-angiogenic drug.

{"title": "Quantitative evaluation of the vasculature supplying the oviduct in pre-pubertal and sexually mature sows.", "abstract": "The present work was aimed at characterizing the regional vascularization of the oviduct in the pig to ascertain whether the number of terminal mesosalpingeal arterioles supplying the isthmus and ampulla is influenced by reproductive maturity and state of the estrous cycle. The total number of terminal arterioles (NTA) in the mesosalpinx was quantified under a stereomicroscope in latex injected ex-vivo reproductive tracts from pre-pubertal (n\u2009=\u200910) and mature sows (n\u2009=\u200934), the latter allocated into three phases of the estrous cycle: follicular (n\u2009=\u200912); early luteal (n\u2009=\u200911); and late luteal (n\u2009=\u200911). The NTA and density of terminal arterioles (DTA) changed little between pre-pubertal and mature sows or among sows of different reproductive status (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Conversely, both in pre-pubertal and mature sows the isthmus showed higher DTA (P\u2009<\u20090.001) than the ampulla. It is concluded that the pattern of vascularization supplying the porcine oviduct is essentially established before the onset of puberty so that neither cyclical changes coupled with the estrous cycle nor regional variations between the isthmus and ampulla are likely at the level of the terminal arterioles supplying the oviduct during the reproductive life.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2015-09-20", "authors": ["Hugo AGuti\u00e9rrez", "RafaelLatorre", "ElizabethMart\u00cdnez Bag\u00c1n", "Francisco MS\u00c1nchez Margallo", "OctavioL\u00f3pez Albors"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.23269"}
{"title": "Spheroid-plug model as a tool to study tumor development, angiogenesis, and heterogeneity in vivo.", "abstract": "Subcutaneous injection of the tumor cell suspension is a simple and commonly used tool for studying tumor development in vivo. However, subcutaneous models poorly resemble tumor complexity due to the fast growth not reflecting the natural course. Here, we describe an application of the new spheroid-plug model to combine the simplicity of subcutaneous injection with improved resemblance to natural tumor progression. Spheroid-plug model relies on in vitro formation of tumor spheroids, followed by injection of single tumor spheroid subcutaneously in Matrigel matrix. In spheroid-plug model, tumors grow slower in comparison to tumors formed by injection of cell suspension as assessed by 3D ultrasonography (USG) and in vivo bioluminescence measurements. The slower tumor growth rate in spheroid-plug model is accompanied by reduced necrosis. The spheroid-plug model ensures increased and more stable vascularization of tumor than classical subcutaneous tumor model as demonstrated by 3D USG Power Doppler examination. Flow cytometry analysis showed that tumors formed from spheroids have enhanced infiltration of endothelial cells as well as hematopoietic and progenitor cells with stem cell phenotype (c-Kit(+) and Sca-1(+)). They also contain more tumor cells expressing cancer stem cell marker CXCR4. Here, we show that spheroid-plug model allows investigating efficiency of anticancer drugs. Treatment of spheroid-plug tumors with known antiangiogenic agent axitinib decreased their size and viability. The antiangiogenic activity of axitinib was higher in spheroid-plug model than in classical model.

Definition of keratoplasty at \"high risk\" of rejection included one or more of the following: a history of ipsilateral graft rejection and/or failure, 2 or more quadrants of stromal vascularization, perforation or ocular inflammation at the time of surgery, presence of atopy, and a large-diameter (\u22659 mm) graft. Median follow-up duration was 5 years after transplantation.\nGraft survival at 5 years in patients receiving systemic immunosuppression was 73.5%.

A well-known hypothesis proposes that the safety of xylem (its ability to resist embolism formation and spread) should trade off against xylem efficiency (its capacity to transport water). We tested this safety-efficiency hypothesis in branch xylem across 335 angiosperm and 89 gymnosperm species. Safety was considered at three levels: the xylem water potentials where 12%, 50% and 88% of maximal conductivity are lost. Although correlations between safety and efficiency were weak (r(2) \u00a0<\u00a00.086), no species had high efficiency and high safety, supporting the idea for a safety-efficiency tradeoff. However, many species had low efficiency and low safety. Species with low efficiency and low safety were weakly associated (r(2) \u00a0<\u00a00.02 in most cases) with higher wood density, lower leaf- to sapwood-area and shorter stature.

Because bone defect morphology is often irregular, selecting treatment strategies may be difficult. With the Masquelet technique, a fracture site is bridged and fixed with a locking plate after treating deep infection with antibiotic-containing cement, and a free cancellous bone-graft is concomitantly placed into the defects. This procedure avoids excessive bone resection.\nWe studied 6 patients who underwent surgical treatment for deep infection occurring after extremity trauma (2004 through 2009). Ages at surgery ranged from 29 to 59 years (largest age group: 30 s). Mean follow-up was 50.7 months (minimum/maximum: 36/72 months). One patient had complete amputation of the upper extremity, 3 open forearm fractures, 1 closed supracondylar femur fracture, and 1 open tibia fracture. In all patients, bone defects were filled with antibiotic-containing cement beads after infected site debridement. If bacterial culture of infected sites during curettage was positive, surgery was repeated to refill bone defects with antibiotic-containing cement beads. After confirmation of negative bacterial culture, osteosynthesis was performed, in which bone defects were bridged and fixed with locking plates. Concomitantly, crushed cancellous bone grafts harvested from the autogenous ilium was placed in the bone defects.\nTime from bone grafting and plate fixation to bone union was at least 3 and at most 6 months, 4 months on average. Infection relapsed in one patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, necessitating vascularized fibular grafting which achieved bone union. No patients showed implant loosening or breakage or infection relapse after the last surgery during follow-up.\nThe advantage of cancellous bone grafting include applicability to relatively large bone defects, simple surgical procedure, bone graft adjustability to bone defect morphology, rapid bone graft revascularization resulting in high resistance to infection, and excellent osteogenesis.", "journal": "Fukushima journal of medical science", "date": "2015-09-18", "authors": ["RyoichiKawakami", "Shin-IchiKonno", "SoichiEjiri", "SatoshiHatashita"], "doi": "10.5387/fms.2015-17"}

A simple process is developed to generate macroporous scaffolds with a well-defined architecture of interconnected pores from chicken egg white (EW), a material with protein- and growth factor-binding features which has not yet been employed in regenerative medicine. The physicomechanical properties and degradation rates of the scaffold are finely tuned by using varying concentrations of the cross-linker, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride, without alteration of the biochemical traits. In vitro, EW scaffolds supported active metabolism, proliferation, and migration of human dermal fibroblasts, thereby generating uniform cellular constructs. In vivo, subcutaneous implantation in mice reveals negligible immune reaction and efficient cell and tissue ingrowth. Angiogenesis into EW scaffolds is enhanced as compared to standard collagen type I sponges used as reference material, likely due to significantly higher adsorption of the proangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor.

To elucidate the precise mechanisms of ECs apoptosis leading to neointimal smooth muscle cells (SMCs) accumulation during TA. We induced apoptosis in cultured ECs by overexpressing p53 through lentivirus-mediated transfection. ECs apoptosis induced the production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 in both apoptotic and neighboring viable cells, leading to increased TGF-\u03b21 in the culture media. Conditioned media from Ltv-p53-transfected ECs further promoted transition of cultured ECs to SM-like cells by activating TGF-\u03b2/Smad3, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and MAPK/ERK signaling in a TGF-\u03b2-dependent manner. In transgenic rat aorta transplantation models, inhibition of ECs apoptosis in Bcl-xL(+/+) knock-in rat aortic allografts significantly reduced TGF-\u03b21 production both in allograft endothelia and in blood plasma, which in turn decreased accumulation of SM22\u03b1+ cells from transgenic recipient ECs originally marked with EGFP knock-in in neointima and alleviated TA. Systemic treatment with SIS3, AP23573, or PD98059 also prevented recipient ECs-originated SM-like cells accumulation and intima hyperplasia in aortic allografts.

The patch environment can also yield increased survival. In the present study, we sought to assess the efficacy of a cardiac patch made from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to engraft and limit left ventricular (LV) remodeling acutely after infarction. Cardiac patches were created from hiPSC-CMs and human pericytes (PCs) entrapped in a fibrin gel and implanted acutely onto athymic rat hearts. hiPSC-CMs not only remained viable after in vivo culture, but also increased in number by as much as twofold, consistent with colocalization of human nuclear antigen, cardiac troponin T, and Ki-67 staining. CM+PC patches led to reduced infarct sizes compared with myocardial infarction-only controls at week 4, and CM+PC patch recipient hearts exhibited greater fractional shortening over all groups at both 1 and 4 weeks after transplantation. However, a decline occurred in fractional shortening for all groups over 4 weeks, and LV thinning was not mitigated. CM+PC patches became vascularized in vivo, and microvessels were more abundant in the host myocardium border zone, suggesting a paracrine mechanism for the improved cardiac function. PCs in a PC-only control patch did not survive 4 weeks in vivo. Our results indicate that cardiac patches containing hiPSC-CMs engraft onto acute infarcts, and the hiPSC-CMs survive, proliferate, and contribute to a reduction in infarct size and improvements in cardiac function.\nIn the present study, a cardiac patch was created from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and human pericytes entrapped in a fibrin gel, and it was transplanted onto infarcted rat myocardium.

{"title": "Endothelial cell division in angiogenic sprouts of differing cellular architecture.", "abstract": "The vasculature of the zebrafish trunk is composed of tubes with different cellular architectures. Unicellular tubes form their lumen through membrane invagination and transcellular cell hollowing, whereas multicellular vessels become lumenized through a chord hollowing process. Endothelial cell proliferation is essential for the subsequent growth and maturation of the blood vessels. However, how cell division, lumen formation and cell rearrangement are coordinated during angiogenic sprouting has so far not been investigated at detailed cellular level. Reasoning that different tubular architectures may impose discrete mechanistic constraints on endothelial cell division, we analyzed and compared the sequential steps of cell division, namely mitotic rounding, cytokinesis, actin re-distribution and adherence junction formation, in different blood vessels. In particular, we characterized the interplay between cell rearrangement, mitosis and lumen dynamics within unicellular and multicellular tubes. The lumen of unicellular tubes becomes constricted and is ultimately displaced from the plane of cell division, where a de novo junction forms through the recruitment of junctional proteins at the site of abscission. By contrast, the new junctions separating the daughter cells within multicellular tubes form through the alteration of pre-existing junctions, and the lumen is retained throughout mitosis. We also describe variations in the progression of cytokinesis: while membrane furrowing between daughter cells is symmetric in unicellular tubes, we found that it is asymmetric in those multicellular tubes that contained a taut intercellular junction close to the plane of division. Our findings illustrate that during the course of normal development, the cell division machinery can accommodate multiple tube architectures, thereby avoiding disruptions to the vascular network.", "journal": "Biology open", "date": "2015-09-16", "authors": ["VahapAydogan", "AnnaLenard", "Alexandru StefanDenes", "LoicSauteur", "Heinz-GeorgBelting", "MarkusAffolter"], "doi": "10.1242/bio.012740\n10.1038/nrm2183\n10.1073/pnas.0704963105\n10.1073/pnas.1207968109\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.01.038\n10.1016/j.devcel.2013.02.006\n10.1016/j.devcel.2014.04.009\n10.1242/dev.118372\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.10.035\n10.1038/ncb2482\n10.1016/j.devcel.2013.01.008\n10.1007/s00441-003-0745-x\n10.1146/annurev-cellbio-101011-155718\n10.1016/j.devcel.2013.01.010\n10.1038/nrm2927\n10.1016/j.devcel.2012.11.019\n10.1016/j.tcb.2013.11.009\n10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.016\n10.1006/dbio.2000.9995\n10.1002/aja.1002030302\n10.1371/journal.pone.0075060\n10.1038/nature11792\n10.1016/j.cub.2007.12.051\n10.1016/j.devcel.2013.03.014\n10.1006/dbio.2002.0711\n10.1016/j.devcel.2013.05.010\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1002126\n10.1016/j.tcb.2011.10.001\n10.1038/embor.2013.85\n10.1038/nature12335\n10.1016/j.devcel.2014.11.017\n10.1002/imic.200790154\n10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00341-1\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.024\n10.1038/nature05577\n10.1016/j.ceb.2011.10.002\n10.1083/jcb.200701058\n10.1182/blood-2006-07-037952"}
{"title": "Rescue from Sexually Dimorphic Neuronal Cell Death by Estradiol and PI3 Kinase Activity.", "abstract": "Responses of primary hippocampal and cortical neurons derived from male and female rats to cellular stressors were studied. It is demonstrated that 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), a potent neuroprotectant, protected the female neurons but had no effects on the male neurons from CoCl2- and glutamate-induced toxicity. Agonists of the estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, DPN and PPT, respectively, had similar effects to E2. By contrast, effects of E2 were abolished by the ER antagonist ICI-182780, further corroborating the neuroprotective role of ERs. In male neurons, CoCl2 predominately activated the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)-dependent pathway and AIF translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. In comparison, CoCl2 activated the caspase pathway and cytochrome c release in female neurons. The inhibitors of these pathways, namely DiQ for AIF and zVAD for caspase, specifically rescued CoCl2-induced cell death in male and female neurons, respectively. When zVAD and ICI-182780, and E2 were applied in combination, it was demonstrated E2 acted on the caspase pathway leading to female-specific neuroprotection. Furthermore, the PI3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor blocked the rescue effects of DiQ and zVAD on the male and female neurons, respectively, suggesting that PI3K is a common upstream regulator for both pathways. The present study suggested that both sex-specific and nonspecific mechanisms played a role in neuronal responses to stressors and protective reagents.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular neurobiology", "date": "2015-09-16", "authors": ["Hui-YunCheng", "Shin-HuiHung", "Po-JuChu"], "doi": "10.1007/s10571-015-0259-6"}

Surgical revascularization such as extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass is the preferred procedure for moyamoya disease. Despite the favorable long-term outcome, cerebral infarction and hyperperfusion syndrome are potential complications of this procedure, which can lead to neurological deterioration in the acute stage. In light of the similar clinical presentations between perioperative ischemia and hyperperfusion, it is essential to attempt a prompt cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement in the acute stage after EC-IC bypass for moyamoya disease to differentiate these distinct pathologies, because the management of cerebral ischemia and hyperperfusion is contradictory to each other. Routine CBF analysis by single-photon emission computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging not only facilitated a safer perioperative management but also provided important information about dynamic pathology of the hemodynamic conversion in the acute stage after revascularization surgery for moyamoya disease. We represent the current status of CBF analysis during the perioperative period of revascularization surgery for moyamoya disease, and sought to discuss its significance and efficacy to avoid surgical complications.", "journal": "Neurologia medico-chirurgica", "date": "2015-09-16", "authors": ["MikiFujimura", "TeijiTominaga"], "doi": "10.2176/nmc.ra.2015-0063"}

To date, few experimental animal models for VLNT have been described and the viability of lymph nodes after the transfer tested. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of axillary VLNT in the rat. Lymph node containing flaps were harvested from the axillary region in 10 Lewis rats based on the axillary vessels. Flaps were transferred to the ipsilateral groin and end-to-side microanastomosis was performed to the femoral vessels using 10-0 sutures. Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography was used to confirm flap perfusion. On postoperative day 7, flaps were elevated to assess their structure and vessel patency. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to confirm the presence and survival of lymph nodes. All animals tolerated the procedure well. Immediate post-procedure ICG angiography confirmed flap perfusion. No signs of ischemia or necrosis were observed in donor extremities. At postoperative day 7, all flaps remained viable with patent vascular pedicles. Gross examination and histology confirmed the presence of 3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 lymph nodes in each flap without any signs of necrosis. This study showed that the transfer of axillary lymph nodes based on the axillary vessels is feasible.

While a number of peptides have been identified with pro-angiogenic behaviors, therapeutic efficacy is limited by poor tissue localization and persistence. Therefore, poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels providing sustained, enzymatically-responsive peptide release were exploited for peptide delivery. Two pro-angiogenic peptide drugs, SPARC113 and SPARC118, from the Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine, were incorporated into hydrogels as crosslinking peptides flanked by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) degradable substrates. In vitro testing confirmed peptide drug bioactivity requires sustained delivery. Furthermore, peptides retain bioactivity with residual MMP substrates present after hydrogel release. Incorporation into hydrogels achieved enzymatically-responsive bulk degradation, with peptide release in close agreement with hydrogel mass loss and released peptides retaining bioactivity. Interestingly, SPARC113 and SPARC118-releasing hydrogels had significantly different degradation time constants in vitro (1.16 and 8.77\u00d710(-2) h(-1), respectively), despite identical MMP degradable substrates. However, upon subcutaneous implantation, both SPARC113 and SPARC118 hydrogels exhibited similar degradation constants of ~1.45\u00d710(-2) h(-1), and resulted in significant ~1.65-fold increases in angiogenesis in vivo compared to controls.

In recent years tissue engineering has developed techniques based on adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that could represent an attractive therapeutical option to treat large bone defects in the future. It has been demonstrated in various animal models that ex vivo expanded MSCs are capable of promoting the regeneration of skeletal defects after implantation. However, for the efficient regeneration of bone in tissue engineering applications, a rapid vascularization of implanted grafts is essential to ensure the survival of cells in the early post-implantational phase. A promising strategy to enhance vascularization of MSC-containing implants could consist of overexpression of the angiogenic master transcription factor Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (Hif-1) in the MSCs in order to induce angiogenesis and support osteogenesis. In the present study, we overexpressed Hif-1\u03b1 in MSCs by using recombinant adenoviruses and investigated cell-autonomous effects. Overexpression of Hif-1\u03b1 enhanced proliferation, migration, cell survival and expression of pro-angiogenic genes. Other parameters such as expression of the osteogenic markers BMP-2 and RunX2 were decreased. Hif-1\u03b1 overexpression had no effect on invasion, senescence and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Our experiments revealed multifarious effects of Hif-1\u03b1 overexpression on cell-autonomous parameters.

The operative time, skin healing time postoperatively, and the incidence of skin infections, and abdominal wall hernias were observed. In the rabbit animal model, bilateral full-thickness incisions were made through the rabbit rectus abdominus muscles and a 2\u00d74cm longitudinal whole layer defect was created on either the left or right lateral anterior abdominal wall. A four-layered variant of the SIS graft was used to repair the right abdominal defect; ADM was used to repair the left. Tensile strength was measured using an Instron tensiometer. Electron scanning and light microscopy were used to evaluate neovascularization, collagen deposition, and muscle fibers at 2, 4, 8, and 16weeks postimplantation.\nIn the neonatal patients, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to operative time, skin healing time postoperatively, the incidence of skin infections, or abdominal wall hernias.

In the ADM group, four patients developed skin infection postoperatively, and the patch was gradually removed. In the animal study, there was no significant difference between the mean breaking strength of ADM versus SIS repairs. Scanning electron and light microscopy showed collagen deposition, increased vascularization, fibroblasts, and muscular regeneration in both SIS and ADM repairs. SEM showed that the SIS graft was absorbed, while ADM was not. Light microscopy showed foreign body macrophages in ADM, but not in the SIS repairs.\nSIS and ADM grafts adequately enhance healing with a low complication rate.

EVs expressed Sema3A at their surface, which accounted for in vitro elevation of brain endothelial permeability and in vivo vascular permeability, in both skin and brain vasculature. Blocking Sema3A or its receptor Neuropilin1 (NRP1) hampered EV-mediated permeability. In vivo models using ectopically and orthotopically xenografted mice revealed that Sema3A-containing EVs were efficiently detected in the blood stream. In keeping with this idea, sera from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients also contain high levels of Sema3A carried in the EV fraction that enhanced vascular permeability, in a Sema3A/NRP1-dependent manner.

Changes in DNA affinity and expression of NF-\u03baB in endothelial and carcinoma-derived cells and their solid tumors (xenografts) treated with brimamin were ascertained by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western blotting. The anti-vascular effect of brimamin in solid tumors was verified by CD31 immunostaining.\nWe found that brimamin can inhibit tubulin polymerization and cause a reorganization of F-actin in Ea.hy926 endothelial cells. Its inhibitory effect on tube formation was found to depend on functional Rho kinase and JNK. JNK inhibition was found to suppress the induction of endothelial cell apoptosis by brimamin. In CA-4-refractory human BxPC-3 pancreas carcinoma-derived and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma-derived cells brimamin was found to inhibit growth and to induce apoptosis at low nanomolar concentrations by blocking NF-\u03baB activation in a dose-dependent manner.

{"title": "The availability of perifascial areolar tissue graft for deep cutaneous ulcer coverage.", "abstract": "Soft tissue defects or skin ulcers associated with tendon or bone exposure located distally on the extremities are always difficult to treat. The introduction of the vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) and dermal templates has led to major changes in ulcer treatment strategies. However, it is necessary to find an alternative method to treat these defects when VAC is not available. Perifascial areolar tissue (PAT) is the loose connective tissue on the deep fascia that could be a candidate for repairing soft tissue defects or skin ulcers. Grafting PAT on the exposed bone or tendon, including a wide coverage of well-vascularized tissue surrounding the granulation tissue, can prepare the wound to be subsequently closed by a skin graft. In this study, the PAT was used in various situations and its optimal usage and outcomes were evaluated. A total of 13 PAT grafts were performed and were especially useful for covering narrow ulcers with narrow tendon exposure and filling fistula areas. In comparison to other cases, covering the exposed cortical bone ulcers seemed to be more difficult to perform. However, an option for these ulcers could be the exposure of bone marrow and usage of intraosseous blood flow. It was also possible for the simultaneous engraftment of PAT and skin in narrow areas and could be an alternative in cases of small concave ulcers or fistulae. The PAT graft is a simple and minimally invasive procedure that can be a good alternative when VAC is not available.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2015-09-12", "authors": ["AyatoHayashi", "MasakazuKomoto", "RicaTanaka", "YuheiNatori", "TakashiMatsumura", "MasatoshiHoriguchi", "NorifumiMatsuda", "HidekazuYoshizawa", "HiroshiMizuno"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2015.08.008"}
{"title": "Three-dimensional graphene foams loaded with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells promote skin wound healing with reduced scarring.", "abstract": "The regeneration of functional skin remains elusive, due to poor engraftment, deficient vascularization, and excessive scar formation. Aiming to overcome these issues, the present study proposed the combination of a three-dimensional graphene foam (GF) scaffold loaded with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to improve skin wound healing. The GFs demonstrated good biocompatibility and promoted the growth and proliferation of MSCs. Meanwhile, the GFs loaded with MSCs obviously facilitated wound closure in animal model. The dermis formed in the presence of the GF structure loaded with MSCs was thicker and possessed a more complex structure at day 14 post-surgery. The transplanted MSCs correlated with upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which may lead to neo-vascularization. Additionally, an anti-scarring effect was observed in the presence of the 3D-GF scaffold and MSCs, as evidenced by a downregulation of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) together with an increase of TGF-\u03b23. Altogether, the GF scaffold could guide the wound healing process with reduced scarring, and the MSCs were crucial to enhance vascularization and provided a better quality neo-skin. The GF scaffold loaded with MSCs possesses necessary bioactive cues to improve wound healing with reduced scarring, which may be of great clinical significance for skin wound healing.", "journal": "Materials science & engineering.

However, there is scanty information on the risk factors for the establishment of chronic toe web intertrigo in LE patients. We performed a case-control study recruiting 52 lower limb LE with intertrigo and 52 lower limb LE without intertrigo in community settings and assessed general and local potential risk factors for chronic intertrigo. Analysis of local risk factors revealed that topical application of oil, tingling and numbness of the extremities were associated independently with chronic intertrigo. In multivariate analysis, LE grades III and IV were associated with chronic intertrigo, after adjusting for tingling and numbness, prophylactic antibiotic, age group, and gender. From a public health perspective, LE patients of grades III and IV and patients under antibiotic prophylaxis should be self-motivated to look for the early symptoms of toe web intertrigo to prevent chronic stage and recurrent episodes of cellulitis.

{"title": "Genetics of Congenital Corneal Opacification--Impact on Diagnosis and Treatment.", "abstract": "As our understanding of phenotype has improved with improving anterior segment imaging, it has become increasingly clear that the early genotype-phenotype correlations were largely misled by inaccurate phenotyping. Using a novel classification, congenital or neonatal corneal opacification can be considered to be primary or secondary. Secondary corneal disease may be developmental or acquired. Genetic analysis using this phenotypic classification becomes easier to navigate. Primary corneal disease includes endothelial dystrophies, corneal dermoids, cornea plana, and CYP1B1 cytopathy. Genotyping for all these conditions is reasonably advanced. Secondary developmental corneal disease includes entities that are the least well understood genotypically. These are kerato-irido-lenticular dysgenesis (also known as Peters anomaly, types 1 and 2). The genotyping literature of these conditions is littered with confusion. Iridocorneal adhesions (Peters anomaly 1) are often avascular, whereas keratolenticular adhesions (Peters anomaly 2) are usually vascularized. Children with a known molecular diagnosis can have iridocorneal adhesion in one eye and keratolenticular adhesion in the other eye. This further supports the notion that Peters anomaly 1 or 2 is a sign and not a diagnosis. Further types of kerato-irido-lenticular dysgenesis are those in which the lens fails to form or forms and then degenerates. Genotyping in these cases has been somewhat more fruitful but, as always, not comprehensive. If the lens fails to form or forms partially, the gene involved is FOXE3, which is a lens gene. Not surprisingly, if the lens forms partially or fails to form, this has an effect on the vitreous and the drainage angle. These cases are often associated with severe glaucoma. Other secondary developmental corneal diseases may include Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, Aniridia, and primary congenital glaucoma, all of which have specific genotypic characterization. Other secondary causes are acquired and include infection, trauma, and metabolic disorders.", "journal": "Cornea", "date": "2015-09-10", "authors": ["Ken KNischal"], "doi": "10.1097/ICO.0000000000000552"}

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have inherent anti-inflammatory properties. We postulated that coencapsulation of MSCs with the target cells would reduce PFO. A hepatoinsulinoma cell line (HUH7) was used to model human target cells and was coencapsulated with either human or mouse MSCs at different ratios in alginate microcapsules. Viability of encapsulated cells was assessed in vitro and xenografted either intraperitoneally or subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice. Graft retrieval was performed at 3 weeks posttransplantation and assessed for PFO. Coencapsulation of human MSCs (hMSCs) or mouse MSCs (mMSCs) with HUH7 at different ratios did not alter cell viability in vitro. In vivo data from intraperitoneal infusions showed that PFO for HUH7 cells coencapsulated with hMSCs and mMSCs in a ratio of 1:1 was significantly reduced by \u223c30% and \u223c35%, respectively, compared to HUH7 encapsulated alone. PFO for HUH7 cells was reduced by \u223c51% when the ratio of mMSC/HUH7 was increased to 2:1. Implanting the microcapsules subcutaneously rather than intraperitoneally substantially reduced PFO in all treatment groups, which was most significant in the mMSC/HUH7 2:1 group with a \u223c53% reduction in PFO compared with HUH7 alone. Despite the reduced PFO reaction to the individual microcapsules implanted subcutaneously, all microcapsule treatment groups were contained in a vascularized fibrotic pouch at 3 weeks. The presence of MSCs in microcapsules retrieved from these fibrotic pouches improved graft survival with significantly higher cell viabilities of 83.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6% and 79.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8% seen with microcapsules containing mMSC/HUH7 at 2:1 and 1:1 ratios, respectively, compared to HUH7 alone (51.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7%) transplanted subcutaneously.

{"title": "NcoA2-Dependent Inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 Activation Is Regulated via AhR.", "abstract": "High endogenous levels of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) contribute to hypoxia signaling pathway inhibition following exposure to the potent AhR ligand benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and could alter cellular homeostasis and disease condition. Increasing evidence indicates that AhR might compete with AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) for complex formation with hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) for transactivation, which could alter several physiological variables. Nuclear receptor coactivator 2 (NcoA2) is a transcription coactivator that regulates transcription factor activation and inhibition of basic helix-loop-helix Per (Period)-ARNT-SIM (single-minded) (bHLH-PAS) family proteins, such as HIF-1\u03b1, ARNT, and AhR, through protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrated that both hypoxia and hypoxia-mimic conditions decreased NcoA2 protein expression in HEK293T cells. Hypoxia response element (HRE) and xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) transactivation also were downregulated with NcoA2 knockdown under hypoxic conditions. In addition, B[a]P significantly decreased NcoA2 protein expression be accompanied with AhR degradation. We next evaluated whether the absence of AhR could affect NcoA2 protein function under hypoxia-mimetic conditions. NcoA2 and HIF-1\u03b1 nuclear localization decreased in both B[a]P-pretreated and AhR-knockdown HepG2 cells under hypoxia-mimic conditions. Interestingly, NcoA2 overexpression downregulated HRE transactivation by competing with HIF-1\u03b1 and AhR to form protein complexes with ARNT. Both NcoA2 knockdown and overexpression inhibited endothelial cell tube formation in\u00a0vitro. We also demonstrated using the in\u00a0vivo plug assay that NcoA2-regulated vascularization decreased in mice. Taken together, these results revealed a biphasic role of NcoA2 between AhR and hypoxic conditions, thus providing a novel mechanism underlying the cross talk between AhR and hypoxia that affects disease development and progression.", "journal": "Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology", "date": "2015-09-10", "authors": ["Chi-HaoTsai", "Ching-HaoLi", "Po-LinLiao", "Yu-WenCheng", "Cheng-HuiLin", "Shih-HsuanHuang", "Jaw-JouKang"], "doi": "10.1093/toxsci/kfv199"}

However, there is a void of studies directly assessing the effect of Hh inhibition on post-natal osteogenesis. This study utilized a cyclic loading-induced ulnar stress fracture model to evaluate the hypothesis that Hh signaling contributes to osteogenesis and angiogenesis during stress fracture healing. Immediately prior to loading, adult rats were given GDC-0449 (Vismodegib - a selective Hh pathway inhibitor; 50mg/kg orally twice daily), or vehicle. Hh signaling was upregulated in response to stress fracture at 3 days (Ptch1, Gli1 expression), and was markedly inhibited by GDC-0449 at 1 day and 3 days in the loaded and non-loaded ulnae. GDC-0449 did not affect Hh ligand expression (Shh, Ihh, Dhh) at 1 day, but decreased Shh expression by 37% at 3 days. GDC-0449 decreased woven bone volume (-37%) and mineral density (-17%) at 7 days. Dynamic histomorphometry revealed that the 7 day callus was composed predominantly of woven bone in both groups. The observed reduction in woven bone occurred concomitantly with decreased expression of Alpl and Ibsp, but was not associated with differences in early cellular proliferation (as determined by callus PCNA staining at 3 days), osteoblastic differentiation (Osx expression at 1 day and 3 days), chondrogenic gene expression (Acan, Sox9, and Col2\u03b11 expression at 1 day and 3 days), or bone resorption metrics (callus TRAP staining at 3 days, Rankl and Opg expression at 1 day and 3 days). To evaluate angiogenesis, vWF immunohistochemistry showed that GDC-0449 reduced fracture callus blood vessel density by 55% at 3 days, which was associated with increased Hif1\u03b1 gene expression (+30%). Dynamic histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that GDC-0449 also inhibited lamellar bone formation. Lamellar bone analysis of the loaded limb (directly adjacent to the woven bone callus) showed that GDC-0449 significantly decreased mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR/BS) (-17% and -20%, respectively). Lamellar BFR/BS in the non-loaded ulna was also significantly decreased (-37%), indicating that Hh signaling was required for normal bone modeling.

The development of artificial tissues with large dimensions that exceed the diffusion limitation will require nutrients and oxygen to be delivered via perfusion instead of diffusion alone over a short time period. One approach to perfusion is to vascularize engineered tissues, creating a de novo three-dimensional (3D) microvascular network within the tissue construct. This significantly shortens the time of in vivo anastomosis, perfusion and graft integration with the host. In this study, we aimed to develop injectable allogeneic collagen-phenolic hydroxyl (collagen-Ph) hydrogels that are capable of controlling a wide range of physicochemical properties, including stiffness, water absorption and degradability. We tested whether collagen-Ph hydrogels could support the formation of vascularized engineered tissue graft by human blood-derived endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in vivo. First, we studied the growth of adherent ECFCs and MSCs on or in the hydrogels. To examine the potential formation of functional vascular networks in vivo, a liquid pre-polymer solution of collagen-Ph containing human ECFCs and MSCs, horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide was injected into the subcutaneous space or abdominal muscle defect of an immunodeficient mouse before gelation, to form a 3D cell-laden polymerized construct. These results showed that extensive human ECFC-lined vascular networks can be generated within 7 days, the engineered vascular density inside collagen-Ph hydrogel constructs can be manipulated through refinable mechanical properties and proteolytic degradability, and these networks can form functional anastomoses with the existing vasculature to further support the survival of host muscle tissues. Finally, optimized conditions of the cell-laden collagen-Ph hydrogel resulted in not only improving the long-term differentiation of transplanted MSCs into mineralized osteoblasts, but the collagen-Ph hydrogel also improved an increased of adipocytes within the vascularized bioengineered tissue in a mouse after 1 month of implantation.\nWe reported a method for preparing autologous extracellular matrix scaffolds, murine collagen-Ph hydrogels, and demonstrated its suitability for use in supporting human progenitor cell-based formation of 3D vascular networks in vitro and in vivo.

The protective effect of thiamine pyrophosphate against oxidative damage in some tissues has been reported, but no information on the protective effects of thiamine pyrophosphate against ethambutol-induced oxidative retinal damage has been found in the medical literature.\nThe objective is to investigate whether thiamine pyrophosphate has a protective effect against oxidative retinal damage in rats induced by ethambutol.\nExperimental animals divided into four groups (n\u2009=\u200910): the healthy group (HG), the ethambutol control group (EMB), thiamine\u2009+\u2009ethambutol group (Thi-EMB) and thiamine pyrophosphate\u2009+\u2009ethambutol group (TPP-EMB). The rats in the TPP-EMB and Thi-EMB groups were administered thiamine pyrophosphate and thiamine, respectively, at doses of 20\u2009mg/kg intraperitoneally. Distilled water was administered intraperitoneally to the HG and the EMB groups as a solvent in the same volumes. One hour after drug injection, 30\u2009mg/kg ethambutol was administered via an oral gavage to the TPP-EMB, Thi-EMB and EMB groups. This procedure was repeated once a day for 90 days. At the end of this period, all rats were euthanized under high-dose thiopental sodium anesthesia, and biochemical and histopathological investigations of the retinal tissue were performed.\nMalondialdehyde (MDA) and DNA damage product 8-hydroxyguanine levels were significantly lower in the retinal tissue of TPP-EMB and HG groups compared to those of the Thi-EMB and EMB groups, and total glutathione (tGSH) was also found to be higher. In addition, severe retinal tissue vascularization, edema and loss of ganglion cells were observed in the Thi-EMB and EMB groups, whereas histopathological findings for the TPP-EMB group were observed to be close to normal.\nThese findings suggest that thiamine pyrophosphate protects retinal tissues from ethambutol-induced oxidative damage, and thiamine does not.

{"title": "Ultrastructure of the fetal membranes of the oviparous kingsnake, Lampropeltis getula (Colubridae) as revealed by scanning electron microscopy.", "abstract": "In reptilian sauropsids, fetal (extraembryonic) membranes that line the eggshell sustain developing embryos by providing for gas exchange and uptake of water and eggshell calcium. However, a scarcity of morphological studies hinders an understanding of functional specializations and their evolution. In kingsnakes (Lampropeltis getula), scanning electron microscopy reveals two major fetal membranes: the chorioallantois and yolk sac omphalopleure. In early development, the chorioallantois contains tall chorionic epithelial cells, avascular connective tissue, and enlarged allantoic epithelial cells. During its maturation, the chorionic and allantoic epithelia thin dramatically and become underlain by a rich network of allantoic capillaries, yielding a membrane ideally suited for respiratory gas exchange. Yolk sac development initially is like that of typical lizards and snakes, forming an avascular omphalopleure, isolated yolk mass (IYM), and yolk cleft. However, unlike the situation in most squamates studied, the omphalopleure becomes transformed into a \"secondary chorioallantois\" via three asynchronous events: flattening of the epithelium, regression of the IYM, and vascularization by the allantois. Progressive expansion of chorioallantois parallels growing embryonic needs for gas exchange. In early through mid-development, external surfaces of both the chorionic and omphalopleure epithelium show an abundance of irregular surface protrusions that possibly increase surface area for water absorption. We postulate that the hypertrophied allantoic epithelial cells produce allantoic fluid, a viscous substance that facilitates water uptake and storage. Our findings are consistent with a previous study on the corn snake Pantherophis guttatus, but include new observations and novel functional hypotheses relevant to a reconstruction of basal squamate patterns.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2015-09-04", "authors": ["Young KKim", "Daniel GBlackburn"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.20435"}

This compartment is devoid of blood vessels, which are however found in the wall of the seminiferous tubules. Our proteomic study using cultured human testicular peritubular cells (HTPCs) i.e. the cells, which form this wall, revealed that they constitutively secrete pigment epithelium-derived factor, PEDF, which is known to exert anti-angiogenic actions. Immunohistochemistry supports its presence in vivo, in the human tubular wall. Co-culture studies and analysis of cell migration patterns showed that human endothelial cells (HUVECs) are repulsed by HTPCs. The factor involved is likely PEDF, as a PEDF-antiserum blocked the repulsing action. Thus testicular peritubular cells, via PEDF, may prevent vascularization of human seminiferous tubules. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increased PEDF (qPCR) in HTPCs, however PEDF expression in the testis of a non-human primate occurs before puberty. Thus PEDF could be involved in the establishment of the avascular nature of seminiferous tubules and after puberty androgens may further reinforce this feature. Testicular microvessels and blood flow are known to contribute to the spermatogonial stem cell niche. Hence HTPCs via control of testicular microvessels may contribute to the regulation of spermatogonial stem cells, as well.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2015-09-04", "authors": ["SWindsch\u00fcttl", "CKampfer", "CMayer", "FFlenkenthaler", "TFr\u00f6hlich", "J USchwarzer", "F MK\u00f6hn", "HUrbanski", "G JArnold", "AMayerhofer"], "doi": "10.1038/srep12820\n10.1101/gad.228080.113\n10.1124/pr.110.002790\n10.1387/ijdb.130068ja\n10.1530/REP-12-0497\n10.1021/pr400769z\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0434\n10.1530/REP-14-0251\n10.1152/ajpheart.01210.2010\n10.1210/en.2007-1064\n10.1016/j.lfs.2013.12.007\n10.1111/j.2047-2927.2014.00227.x"}

Under stereomicroscopy, we noticed that chromium-hematoxylin-stained threadlike structures, which were barely observable in 1-week-old rats, were networked in specific areas of the brain, for example, the lateral lobes and the cerebella, in 4-week-old rats. In 7-week-old rats, those structures were found to have become larger and better networked. With phase contrast microscopy, we found that in 1-week-old rats, chromium-hematoxylin-stained granules were scattered in the same areas of the brain in which the network structures would later be observed in the 4- and 7-week-old rats. Such age-dependent network structures were examined by using optical and transmission electron microscopy, and the following results were obtained. The scattered granules fused into networks with increasing age. Cross-sections of the age-dependent network structures demonstrated heavily-stained basophilic substructures. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the basophilic substructures to be clusters with high electron densities consisting of nanosized particles.

However, recent literature has suggested that fibrous nonunion may be suited to treatment with rigid fixation without bone grafting.

Fibrous nonunion of the scaphoid was defined as a scaphoid fracture with all of the following features: (1) persistent tenderness, (2) incomplete trabecular bridging on three X-ray views, (3) injury that had occurred at a minimum of 6\u00a0months prior to surgery, and (4) identification of fibrous union at the time of surgery. Outcomes were assessed with range of motion assessment, Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores, and plain radiographs.\nTwelve of the 14 patients healed successfully, while two patients required secondary vascularized bone grafting.

A topologic model of the inner retinal vascular network was obtained from OCT angiography data using a combination of automated and manually-guided image processing techniques. Using a resistive network model, with experimentally-quantified flow in major retinal vessels near the optic nerve head as boundary conditions, theoretical changes in the distribution of flow induced by vessel dilations were inferred.\nA topologically-representative 3D vectorized graph of the inner retinal vasculature, derived from OCT angiography data, is presented. The laminar and compartmental connectivity of the vasculature are characterized. In contrast to sparse connectivity between the superficial vitreal vasculature and capillary plexuses of the inner retina, connectivity between the two capillary plexus layers is dense. Simulated dilation of single arterioles is shown to produce both localized and lamina-specific changes in blood flow, while dilation of capillaries in a given retinal vascular layer is shown to lead to increased total flow in that layer.\nOur graphing and modeling data suggest that vascular architecture enables both local and lamina-specific control of blood flow in the inner retina.

Biotin pulldown analysis to capture the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) bound to VEGFA mRNA followed by mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the RBP HuR [human antigen R, a member of the embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) family of proteins], interacts with VEGFA mRNA. VEGFA mRNA-tagging experiments showed that exposure to CoCl2 increases the interaction of HuR with VEGFA mRNA and promoted the colocalization of HuR and the distal part of the VEGFA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) in the cytoplasm.

{"title": "Protection and pathology in TB: learning from the zebrafish model.", "abstract": "Zebrafish has earned its place among animal models of tuberculosis. Its natural pathogen, Mycobacterium marinum, shares major virulence factors with the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In adult zebrafish, which possess recombination-activated adaptive immunity, it can cause acute infection or a chronic progressive disease with containment of mycobacteria in well-structured, caseating granulomas. In addition, a low-dose model that closely mimics human latent infection has recently been developed. These models are used alongside infection of optically transparent zebrafish embryos and larvae that rely on innate immunity and permit non-invasive visualization of the early stages of developing granulomas that are inaccessible in other animal models. By microinjecting mycobacteria intravenously or into different tissues, systemic and localized infections can be induced, each useful for studying particular aspects of early pathogenesis, such as phagocyte recruitment, granuloma expansion and maintenance, vascularization of granulomas, and the phagocyte-mediated dissemination of mycobacteria. This has contributed to new insights into the mycobacteria-driven mechanisms that promote granuloma formation, the double-edged role of inflammation, the mechanisms of macrophage cell death that favor disease progression, and the host-protective role of autophagy.

{"title": "Placentation, maternal-fetal interface, and conceptus loss in\u00a0swine.", "abstract": "Pregnancy is a delicate yet complex physiological process that requires fine-tuning of many factors (hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and receptors) between the mother and the conceptus to ensure the survival of the conceptus(es) to term. Any disturbance in the maternal-conceptus dialog can have detrimental effects on the affected conceptus or even the outcome of pregnancy as a whole. Being a litter-bearing species, such disruptions can lead to a loss of up to 45% of the totally healthy offspring during early (periattachment) and midgestation to late gestation in pigs. Although the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, several factors have been associated with the fetal loss including but not limited to uterine capacity, placental efficiency, genetics, nutrition, and deficits in vascularization at the maternal-fetal interface. Over the years, we investigated how immune cells are recruited to the porcine maternal-fetal interface and whether they contribute to vascularization. We also delineated how cytokines, chemokines, and cytokine destabilizing factors fine-tune inflammation and whether the cytokine shift from early to midpregnancy exists at the porcine maternal-fetal interface. Finally, we evaluated the role of microRNAs in regulating immune cell recruitment and their angiogenic functions during pregnancy. Collectively our research points out that the immune-angiogenesis axis at the porcine maternal interface is significantly involved in promoting new blood vessel development, regulating inflammatory responses and ultimately contributing to pregnancy success. In this review, we summarized current knowledge on spontaneous fetal loss in swine, with special attention to the mechanisms in immune reactivity and interplay at the maternal-fetal interface.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2015-09-02", "authors": ["Rami TKridli", "KasraKhalaj", "MallikarjunBidarimath", "ChandrakantTayade"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.08.001"}

{"title": "In vivo bioresponses to silk proteins.", "abstract": "Silks are appealing materials for numerous biomedical applications involving drug delivery, tissue engineering, or implantable devices, because of their tunable mechanical properties and wide range of physical structures. In addition to the functionalities needed for specific clinical applications, a key factor necessary for clinical success for any implanted material is appropriate interactions with the body in\u00a0vivo. This review summarizes our current understanding of the in\u00a0vivo biological responses to silks, including degradation, the immune and inflammatory response, and tissue remodeling with particular attention to vascularization. While we focus in this review on silkworm silk fibroin protein due to the large quantity of in\u00a0vivo data thanks to its widespread use in medical materials and consumer products, spider silk information is also included if available. Silk proteins are degraded in the body on a time course that is dependent on the method of silk fabrication and can range from hours to years. Silk protein typically induces a mild inflammatory response that decreases within a few weeks of implantation. The response involves recruitment and activation of macrophages and may include activation of a mild foreign body response with the formation of multinuclear giant cells, depending on the material format and location of implantation. The number of immune cells present decreases with time and granulation tissue, if formed, is replaced by endogenous, not fibrous, tissue. Importantly, silk materials have not been demonstrated to induce mineralization, except when used in calcified tissues. Due to its ability to be degraded, silk can be remodeled in the body allowing for vascularization and tissue ingrowth with eventual complete replacement by native tissue. The degree of remodeling, tissue ingrowth, or other specific cell behaviors can be modulated with addition of growth or other signaling factors. Silk can also be combined with numerous other materials including proteins, synthetic polymers, and ceramics to enhance its characteristics for a particular function. Overall, the diverse array of silk materials shows excellent bioresponses in\u00a0vivo with low immunogenicity and the ability to be remodeled and replaced by native tissue making it suitable for numerous clinical applications.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-09-01", "authors": ["Amy EThurber", "Fiorenzo GOmenetto", "David LKaplan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.039\n10.1002/mabi.201500013.(1616-5195(Electronic);1616-5187(Linking))"}

{"title": "Class 3 semaphorins negatively regulate dermal lymphatic network formation.", "abstract": "The development of a patterned lymphatic vascular network is essential for proper lymphatic functions during organ development and homeostasis. Here we report that class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3s), SEMA3F and SEMA3G negatively regulate lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) growth and sprouting to control dermal lymphatic network formation. Neuropilin2 (NRP2) functions as a receptor for SEMA3F and SEMA3G, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC). In culture, Both SEMA3F and SEMA3G inhibit VEGFC-mediated sprouting and proliferation of human dermal LECs. In the developing mouse skin, Sema3f is expressed in the epidermis and Sema3g expression is restricted to arteries, whereas their receptor Nrp2 is preferentially expressed by lymphatic vessels. Both Sema3f;Sema3g double mutants and Nrp2 mutants exhibit increased LEC growth in the skin. In contrast, Sema3f;Sema3g double mutants display increased lymphatic branching, while Nrp2 mutants exhibit reduced lymphatic branching. A targeted mutation in PlexinA1 or PlexinA2, signal transducers forming a receptor complex with NRP2 for SEMA3s, exhibits an increase in LEC growth and lymphatic branching as observed in Sema3f;Sema3g double mutants. Our results provide the first evidence that SEMA3F and SEMA3G function as a negative regulator for dermal lymphangiogenesis in vivo. The reciprocal phenotype in lymphatic branching between Sema3f;Sema3g double mutants and Nrp2 mutants suggest a complex NRP2 function that regulates LEC behavior both positively and negatively, through a binding with VEGFC or SEMA3s.", "journal": "Biology open", "date": "2015-09-01", "authors": ["YutakaUchida", "Jennifer MJames", "FumikazuSuto", "Yoh-SukeMukouyama"], "doi": "10.1242/bio.012302\n10.1172/JCI21378\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.11.024\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.269316\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0529\n10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.029\n10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80870-3\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-3121\n10.1126/science.282.5390.946\n10.1097/00001756-199812010-00038\n10.1182/blood-2005-11-4447\n10.1242/dev.02187\n10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80625-X\n10.1074/jbc.M006909200\n10.1002/emmm.201202078\n10.1371/journal.pone.0020444\n10.1126/science.1085649\n10.1242/dev.095026\n10.1126/science.276.5317.1423\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.269399\n10.1038/ni1013\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3090\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.215871\n10.3791/2620\n10.1093/emboj/20.17.4762\n10.1038/nature02060\n10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00757-2\n10.1242/dev.01675\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2464\n10.1016/j.neuron.2013.09.005\n10.1016/j.canlet.2014.12.046\n10.1016/S0959-4388(03)00003-5\n10.1186/1471-2164-9-633\n10.1093/nar/gkp1005\n10.1182/blood-2007-04-084269\n10.1016/j.neuron.2007.01.028\n10.1038/2203\n10.1111/j.1365-2443.2005.00877.x\n10.1093/nar/gng154\n10.1083/jcb.200903137\n10.1016/j.neuron.2006.10.032\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.01.029"}

In the present manuscript, we describe the design of an ex vivo culture system allowing the generation of an oxygen gradient between the luminal and the adventitial sides of the vein. This system featured a separation between the inner and the outer vessel culture circuits, and integrated a purpose-developed de-oxygenator module enabling the trans-wall oxygen distribution (high oxygen level at luminal side and low oxygen level at the adventitial side) existing in arterialized veins. Compared with standard cultures the bypass-specific conditions determined a significant increase in the proliferation of cells around adventitial vasa vasorum and an elevation in the length density of small and large caliber vasa vasorum.

We show crypt-shaped HAF are present in villi at different levels from 4 to 11 weeks and in the chorionic plate from 4 to 9 weeks. In the villous placenta, the foci often approach closely at one end to the trophoblast basement membrane. Morphologically they show remarkable similarity to those found in the yolk sac at similar stages. In some crypts, all cells are CD34+, but CD34 and nestin progressively segregate into the endothelial lineage. Brachyury is present in less differentiated cells. The erythroid lineage is dominant, as shown by the widespread expression of CD235a/glycophorin and characteristic erythroid morphologies, indicating various degrees of differentiation. However, CD41 is also present in non-endothelial cells. Initially a discontinuous UEA-1/CD31-positive endothelium forms at the periphery of the foci. These cells appear to become integrated into the developing vasculogenic/angiogenic vessel network. We also demonstrate that, independent of HAF, vasculogenesis occurs near the tips of growing villi during the first trimester.\nWe suggest HAF interface with the developing vascular network, producing communication channels that allow erythrocytes to enter the placental-embryonic circulation. We speculate that the erythroid cells act as oxygen reservoirs during the period before flow of maternal blood through the intervillous space of the placenta, allowing a slow feed of oxygen-rich cells to the developing embryo.", "journal": "Placenta", "date": "2015-09-01", "authors": ["John DAplin", "HannahWhittaker", "Yu TingJana Lim", "StefanieSwietlik", "JayneCharnock", "Carolyn J PJones"], "doi": "10.1016/j.placenta.2015.08.005"}

Mesorectal macrovascular features, i.e., the number of vascular branches, average diameter and length, were assessed from baseline-subtracted post-contrast images by two independent readers. Mesorectal microvascular function was investigated by means of area under the enhancement-time curve (AUC). Histopathology served as reference standard of the tumour response to CRT.\nThe average vessel branching in the mesorectum around the tumour and normal rectal wall was 8.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8 and 1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3, respectively (reader1: p\u2009=\u20090.001, reader2: p\u2009=\u20090.002).

{"title": "Trypsinogen 4 boosts tumor endothelial cells migration through proteolysis of tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2.", "abstract": "Proteases contribute to cancer in many ways, including tumor vascularization and metastasis, and their pharmacological inhibition is a potential anticancer strategy. We report that human endothelial cells (EC) express the trypsinogen 4 isoform of the serine protease 3 (PRSS3), and lack both PRSS2 and PRSS1. Trypsinogen 4 expression was upregulated by the combined action of VEGF-A, FGF-2 and EGF, angiogenic factors representative of the tumor microenvironment. Suppression of trypsinogen 4 expression by siRNA inhibited the angiogenic milieu-induced migration of EC from cancer specimens (tumor-EC), but did not affect EC from normal tissues. We identified tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2), a matrix associated inhibitor of cell motility, as the functional target of trypsinogen 4, which cleaved TFPI-2 and removed it from the matrix put down by tumor-EC. Silencing tumor-EC for trypsinogen 4 accumulated TFPI2 in the matrix. Showing that angiogenic factors stimulate trypsinogen 4 expression, which hydrolyses TFPI-2 favoring a pro-migratory situation, our study suggests a new pathway linking tumor microenvironment signals to endothelial cell migration, which is essential for angiogenesis and blood vessel remodeling.

Its role in tumor angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulation, key steps involved in tumor growth and metastasis, are unknown. We evaluated the angioinhibitory effect of Nef-M1 peptide and examined its role in the inhibition of EMT in these cancers. Colon (HT29) and breast (MDA-MB231) cancer cells expressing CXCR4 were studied in vitro and in xenograft tumors propagated in severe combined immunodeficient mice. The mice were treated intraperitoneally with Nef-M1 or scrambled amino acid sequence of Nef-M1 (sNef-M1) peptide, a negative control, starting at the time of tumor implantation. Sections from tumors were evaluated for tumor angiogenesis, as measured by microvessel density (MVD) based on immunostaining of endothelial markers. In vitro tumor angiogenesis was assessed by treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells with conditioned media from the tumor cell lines. A BC cell line (MDA-MB 468) which does not express CXCR4 was used to study the actions of Nef-M1 peptide. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses assessed the effect of Nef-M1 on tumor angiogenesis and EMT in both tumors and cancer cells. Metastatic lesions of CRC and BC expressed more CXCR4 than primary lesions. It was also found that tumors from mice treated with sNef-M1 had well established vascularity, while Nef-M1 treated tumors had very poor vascularization. Indeed, the mean MVD was lower in tumors from Nef-M1 treated mice than in sNef-M1 treated tumors. Nef-M1 treated tumor has poor morphology and loss of endothelial integrity. Although conditioned medium from CRC or BC cells supported HUVEC tube formation, the conditioned medium from Nef-M1 treated CRC or BC cells did not support tube formation. Western blot analyses revealed that Nef-M1 effectively suppressed the expression of VEGF-A in CRC and BC cells and tumors. This suggests that Nef-M1 treated CRC and BC cells are more consistent with E-cadherin signature, and thus appears more epithelial in nature. Our data indicate that Nef-M1 peptide inhibits tumor angiogenesis and the oncogenic EMT process.

{"title": "Testing Foundations of Biological Scaling Theory Using Automated Measurements of Vascular Networks.", "abstract": "Scientists have long sought to understand how vascular networks supply blood and oxygen to cells throughout the body. Recent work focuses on principles that constrain how vessel size changes through branching generations from the aorta to capillaries and uses scaling exponents to quantify these changes. Prominent scaling theories predict that combinations of these exponents explain how metabolic, growth, and other biological rates vary with body size. Nevertheless, direct measurements of individual vessel segments have been limited because existing techniques for measuring vasculature are invasive, time consuming, and technically difficult. We developed software that extracts the length, radius, and connectivity of in vivo vessels from contrast-enhanced 3D Magnetic Resonance Angiography. Using data from 20 human subjects, we calculated scaling exponents by four methods-two derived from local properties of branching junctions and two from whole-network properties. Although these methods are often used interchangeably in the literature, we do not find general agreement between these methods, particularly for vessel lengths. Measurements for length of vessels also diverge from theoretical values, but those for radius show stronger agreement. Our results demonstrate that vascular network models cannot ignore certain complexities of real vascular systems and indicate the need to discover new principles regarding vessel lengths.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2015-09-01", "authors": ["Mitchell GNewberry", "Daniel BEnnis", "Van MSavage"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004455\n10.1073/pnas.0702242104\n10.1126/science.276.5309.122\n10.1113/jphysiol.1955.sp005276\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000171\n10.1126/science.1104819\n10.1371/journal.pone.0022973\n10.3934/dcdsb.2013.18.1077\n10.1038/20144\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.048702\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.048702\n10.1098/rsif.2011.0270\n10.1073/pnas.1012194108\n10.1890/03-0800\n10.1038/nature08920\n10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02022.x\n10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02021.x\n10.1006/jtbi.1998.0892\n10.1126/science.156.3775.636\n10.1006/jtbi.2000.2238\n10.1111/j.0269-8463.2004.00830.x\n10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01860.x\n10.1104/pp.110.162834\n10.1152/ajpheart.00818.2007\n10.1085/jgp.81.3.325\n10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01458.x\n10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02022.x\n10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02022.x\n10.1073/pnas.1012194108\n10.1073/pnas.1009974107\n10.1111/ele.12127\n10.1073/pnas.0812294106\n10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01712.x\n10.1006/jtbi.1998.0723\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036715\n10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01554.x\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.048704\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.048703\n10.2214/AJR.07.2235\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3287-09.2009\n10.1145/1031120.1031121\n10.1109/2945.795212\n10.1017/S1464793106007007\n10.1137/070710111"}

{"title": "Resistance to sunitinib in renal clear cell carcinoma results from sequestration in lysosomes and inhibition of the autophagic flux.", "abstract": "Metastatic renal cell carcinomas (mRCC) are highly vascularized tumors that are a paradigm for the treatment with antiangiogenesis drugs targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. The available drugs increase the time to progression but are not curative and the patients eventually relapse. In this study we have focused our attention on the molecular mechanisms leading to resistance to sunitinib, the first line treatment of mRCC. Because of the anarchic vascularization of tumors the core of mRCC tumors receives only suboptimal concentrations of the drug. To mimic this in vivo situation, which is encountered in a neoadjuvant setting, we exposed sunitinib-sensitive mRCC cells to concentrations of sunitinib below the concentration of the drug that gives 50% inhibition of cell proliferation (IC50). At these concentrations, sunitinib accumulated in lysosomes, which downregulated the activity of the lysosomal protease CTSB (cathepsin B) and led to incomplete autophagic flux. Amino acid deprivation initiates autophagy enhanced sunitinib resistance through the amplification of autolysosome formation. Sunitinib stimulated the expression of ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B [MDR/TAP], member 1), which participates in the accumulation of the drug in autolysosomes and favor its cellular efflux.

A set of 172 segmented and skeletonized human retinal images, corresponding to both normal (24 images) and pathological (148 images) states of the retina were examined. An automatic unsupervised method for retinal vessel segmentation was applied before fractal analysis. The fractal analyses of the retinal digital images were performed using the fractal analysis software ImageJ. Statistical analyses were performed for these groups using Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and GraphPad InStat software.\nIt was found that subtle changes in the vascular network geometry of the human retina are influenced by diabetic retinopathy (DR) and can be estimated using the fractal geometry. The average of fractal dimensions D for the normal images (segmented and skeletonized versions) is slightly lower than the corresponding values of mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR) images (segmented and skeletonized versions).

In this study, we present a novel framework for the regeneration of whole bones by tissue engineering anatomically shaped hypertrophic cartilaginous grafts in vitro that subsequently drive endochondral bone formation in vivo. To realize this, we first fabricated molds from digitized images to generate mesenchymal stem cell-laden alginate hydrogels in the shape of different bones (the temporomandibular joint [TMJ] condyle and the distal phalanx). These constructs could be stimulated in vitro to generate anatomically shaped hypertrophic cartilaginous tissues that had begun to calcify around their periphery. Constructs were then formed into the shape of the distal phalanx to create the hypertrophic precursor of the osseous component of an engineered long bone. A layer of cartilage engineered through self-assembly of chondrocytes served as the articular surface of these constructs. Following chondrogenic priming and subcutaneous implantation, the hypertrophic phase of the engineered phalanx underwent endochondral ossification, leading to the generation of a vascularized bone integrated with a covering layer of stable articular cartilage. Furthermore, spatial bone deposition within the construct could be modulated by altering the architecture of the osseous component before implantation. These findings open up new horizons to whole limb regeneration by recapitulating key aspects of normal bone development.", "journal": "BioResearch open access", "date": "2015-08-27", "authors": ["Eamon JSheehy", "TariqMesallati", "LaraKelly", "TatianaVinardell", "Conor TBuckley", "Daniel JKelly"], "doi": "10.1089/biores.2015.0014"}
{"title": "Development and Characterization of a Collagen-Based Matrix for Vascularization and Cell Delivery.", "abstract": "Since the development of the Edmonton protocol, islet transplantation is increasingly encouraging as a treatment for type 1 diabetes. Strategies to ameliorate problems with the intraportal site include macroencapsulating the islets in diverse biomaterials. Characterization of these biomaterials is important to optimally tune the properties to support islets and promote vascularization. In this study, we characterize the cross-linker-dependent properties of collagen-based matrices containing chondroitin-6-sulfate, chitosan, and laminin, cross-linked with 7.5, 30, or 120\u2009mM of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide. The swelling ratio was found to be significantly negatively correlated with increasing cross-linker concentrations (p<0.0001; R2=0.718). The matrix released insulin in a reproducible logarithmic manner (R2 of 0.99 for all concentrations), demonstrating cross-linker-dependent control of drug release. The matrices with the highest cross-linker concentrations resisted degradation by collagenase for longer than the lowest concentrations (58.13%\u00b12.22% vs. 13.69%\u00b17.67%; p<0.05). Scanning electron microscopy images of the matrices revealed that the matrices had uniform topography and porosity, indicating efficient cross-linking and incorporation of the polymer components. Matrices were transplanted subcutaneously in naive BALB/c mice, and the number and size of vessels were quantified using von Willebrand factor staining; matrices with higher cross-linking concentrations had significantly larger capillaries at every time point up to 4 weeks after transplantation compared to the lowest cross-linker concentration group. CD31 staining visualized the capillaries at each time point.

{"title": "Endothelial Cells Promote Pigmentation through Endothelin Receptor B Activation.", "abstract": "Findings of increased vascularization in melasma lesions and hyperpigmentation in acquired bilateral telangiectatic macules suggested a link between pigmentation and vascularization. Using high-magnification digital epiluminescence dermatoscopy, laser confocal microscopy, and histological examination, we showed that benign vascular lesions of the skin have restricted but significant hyperpigmentation compared with the surrounding skin. We then studied the role of microvascular endothelial cells in regulating skin pigmentation using an in vitro co-culture model using endothelial cells and melanocytes. These experiments showed that endothelin 1 released by microvascular endothelial cells induces increased melanogenesis signaling, characterized by microphthalmia-associated transcription factor phosphorylation, and increased tyrosinase and dopachrome tautomerase levels. Immunostaining for endothelin 1 in vascular lesions confirmed the increased expression on the basal layer of the epidermis above small vessels compared with perilesional skin. Endothelin acts through the activation of endothelin receptor B and the mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and p38, to induce melanogenesis. Finally, culturing of reconstructed skin with microvascular endothelial cells led to increased skin pigmentation that could be prevented by inhibiting EDNRB. Taken together these results demonstrated the role of underlying microvascularization in skin pigmentation, a finding that could open new fields of research for regulating physiological pigmentation and for treating pigmentation disorders such as melasma.", "journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "date": "2015-08-27", "authors": ["ClaireRegazzetti", "Gian MarcoDe Donatis", "Houda HammamiGhorbel", "NathalieCardot-Leccia", "DamienAmbrosetti", "PhilippeBahadoran", "B\u00e9reng\u00e8reChignon-Sicard", "Jean-PhilippeLacour", "RobertBallotti", "AndreMahns", "ThierryPasseron"], "doi": "10.1038/jid.2015.332"}
{"title": "Minimal residual disease in cancer therapy--Small things make all the difference.", "abstract": "Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a major hurdle in the eradication of malignant tumors. Despite the high sensitivity of various cancers to treatment, some residual cancer cells persist and lead to tumor recurrence and treatment failure. Obvious reasons for residual disease include mechanisms of secondary therapy resistance, such as the presence of mutant cells that are insensitive to the drugs, or the presence of cells that become drug resistant due to activation of survival pathways. In addition to such unambiguous resistance modalities, several patients with relapsing tumors do not show refractory disease and respond again when the initial therapy is repeated. These cases cannot be explained by the selection of mutant tumor cells, and the precise mechanisms underlying this clinical drug resistance are ill-defined. In the current review, we put special emphasis on cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms that may explain mechanisms of MRD that are independent of secondary therapy resistance. In particular, we show that studying genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), which highly resemble the disease in humans, provides a complementary approach to understand MRD. In these animal models, specific mechanisms of secondary resistance can be excluded by targeted genetic modifications. This allows a clear distinction between the selection of cells with stable secondary resistance and mechanisms that result in the survival of residual cells but do not provoke secondary drug resistance. Mechanisms that may explain the latter feature include special biochemical defense properties of cancer stem cells, metabolic peculiarities such as the dependence on autophagy, drug-tolerant persisting cells, intratumoral heterogeneity, secreted factors from the microenvironment, tumor vascularization patterns and immunosurveillance-related factors. We propose in the current review that a common feature of these various mechanisms is cancer cell dormancy. Therefore, dormant cancer cells appear to be an important target in the attempt to eradicate residual cancer cells, and eventually cure patients who repeatedly respond to anticancer therapy but lack complete tumor eradication.", "journal": "Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy", "date": "2015-08-27", "authors": ["SohviBlatter", "SvenRottenberg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.drup.2015.08.003"}

One of the reasons is the lack of understanding on the complex interplay between tumor growth dynamics and the associated immune system responses. Toward this goal, we consider a mathematical model of vascularized tumor growth and the corresponding effector cell recruitment dynamics. Bifurcation analysis allows for the exploration of model's dynamic behavior and the determination of these parameter regimes that result in immune-mediated tumor control. In this work, we focus on a particular tumor evasion regime that involves tumor and effector cell concentration oscillations of slowly increasing and decreasing amplitude, respectively.

The combination of mastopexy and breast implants has revealed a moderate recurrence of breast ptosis in many patients particularly with use of medium to large implants. Ptosis is the \"bottoming out\" of the breast tissue with loss of the desired roundness, due to the ptosis of the breast implant and the mammary tissue. In this study, we hypothesize the need for careful planning and careful preoperative surgical execution to minimize this complication.\nBetween January 2007 and July 2011, augmentation mastopexy with implant and autologous tissue (\"double implant\") was performed for 25 patients with grade III mammary ptosis. All patients underwent inverted-T mastopexy with supramuscular moderately cohesive gel breast implant using an inferior-based flap of de-epitelialized dermoglandular tissue and a superior-based nipple-areola complex pedicle.\nAn inferior-based flap of deepithelialized dermoglandular tissue was used to stabilize the implant and is projection. Breast lifting was performed through a strong anchorage to fascia and to muscle of second intercostal space, improving the profile of the breast. Results were analyzed, no breast ptosis recurrence was noted at 30-month follow-up.\nOur technique presents the challenge of determining the amount of excess skin to be removed after implantation to create symmetry and provide for skin tightening without compromising tissue vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research", "date": "2015-08-26", "authors": ["Giuseppe AndreaFerraro", "FrancescoDe Francesco", "SergioRazzano", "FrancescoD'Andrea", "GianfrancoNicoletti"], "doi": "10.3109/08941939.2015.1037940"}
{"title": "Zoledronic acid prevents the tumor-promoting effects of mesenchymal stem cells via MCP-1 dependent recruitment of macrophages.", "abstract": "Zoledronic acid (ZA) has been tested in clinical trials as an additive therapy for early-stage breast cancer. However, the mechanism by which ZA exerts its antitumor activity is still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the prevention of tumor growth by ZA is through regulating the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)-monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1)-macrophages axis in the tumor microenvironment. To address this issue, MDA-MB-231-FLUC human breast cancer cells were cultured and injected either alone, or coupled with MSC into the mammary fat pads of nude mice. MSC were treated with either ZA or untreated. Tumor growth was determined by using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in tumor tissues were immunohistochemically analyzed by using CD206 antibody. The effects of ZA on the cytokine related gene expression of MSC were assessed by using real-time PCR. In this study, we found that ZA-treated mice showed a significant delay in tumor growth. In addition, our data revealed that ZA weakened the ability of MSC to promote tumor growth by impairing TAMs recruitment and tumor vascularization. Furthermore, it was found that ZA decreased MCP-1 expression of MSC, and therefore reduced the recruitment of TAMs to the tumor sites and hence inhibited the tumor growth. Altogether, our study demonstrated ZA can prevent the tumor-promoting effects of MSC. The antitumor effects of ZA were caused by decreasing the MCP-1 expression of MSC, which further decreased the infiltration of TAMs into tumor sites, and therefore inhibited the tumor growth.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2015-08-26", "authors": ["Xiao-HuaJia", "YangDu", "DuoMao", "Zhong-LiangWang", "Zhen-QiangHe", "Jing-DanQiu", "Xi-BoMa", "Wen-TingShang", "DanDing", "JieTian"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.4658"}

To see whether such drugs could be used at lower concentrations with the same efficacy, it was first shown that microvesiculation of prostate cancer (PCa) cells, PC3, could be inhibited pharmacologically with calpeptin (calpain inhibitor) and by siRNA (CAPNS1). In cells treated with docetaxel (DTX), this inhibition resulted in a third-fold increase in intracellular concentrations of DTX. As a result, 20-fold lower concentrations of DTX (5\u2009nM) could be used, in the presence of calpeptin (20\u2009\u03bcM) inducing the same degree of apoptosis after 48\u2009h in PC3 cells, as 100\u2009nM of DTX alone. Inhibition of microvesiculation similarly improved combination chemotherapy (DTX and methotrexate). In a mouse xenograft model of PCa, DTX (0.1\u2009mg/kg) together with calpeptin (10\u2009mg/kg), administered i.p., significantly reduced tumor volumes compared to DTX alone (0.1\u2009mg/kg) and brought about the same reductions in tumor growth as 10\u2009mg/kg of DTX alone.

{"title": "Effects of Tobacco Smoking on the Degeneration of the Intervertebral Disc: A Finite Element Study.", "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is associated with numerous pathological conditions. Compelling experimental evidence associates smoking to the degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD). In particular, it has been shown that nicotine down-regulates both the proliferation rate and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis of disc cells. Moreover, tobacco smoking causes the constriction of the vascular network surrounding the IVD, thus reducing the exchange of nutrients and anabolic agents from the blood vessels to the disc. It has been hypothesized that both nicotine presence in the IVD and the reduced solute exchange are responsible for the degeneration of the disc due to tobacco smoking, but their effects on tissue homeostasis have never been quantified. In this study, a previously presented computational model describing the homeostasis of the IVD was deployed to investigate the effects of impaired solute supply and nicotine-mediated down-regulation of cell proliferation and biosynthetic activity on the health of the disc. We found that the nicotine-mediated down-regulation of cell anabolism mostly affected the GAG concentration at the cartilage endplate, reducing it up to 65% of the value attained in normal physiological conditions.

{"title": "The placenta: phenotypic and epigenetic modifications induced by Assisted Reproductive Technologies throughout pregnancy.", "abstract": "Today, there is growing interest in the potential epigenetic risk related to assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Much evidence in the literature supports the hypothesis that adverse pregnancy outcomes linked to ART are associated with abnormal trophoblastic invasion. The aim of this review is to investigate the relationship between epigenetic dysregulation caused by ART and subsequent placental response. The dialogue between the endometrium and the embryo is a crucial step to achieve successful trophoblastic invasion, thus ensuring a non-complicated pregnancy and healthy offspring. However, as described in this review, ART could impair both actors involved in this dialogue. First, ART may induce epigenetic defects in the conceptus by modifying the embryo environment. Second, as a result of hormone treatments, ART may impair endometrial receptivity. In some cases, it results in embryonic growth arrest but, when the development of the embryo continues, the placenta could bring adaptive responses throughout pregnancy. Amongst the different mechanisms, epigenetics, especially thanks to a finely tuned network of imprinted genes stimulated by foetal signals, may modify nutrient transfer, placental growth and vascularization. If these coping mechanisms are overwhelmed, improper maternal-foetal exchanges occur, potentially leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as abortion, preeclampsia or intra-uterine growth restriction. But in most cases, successful placental adaptation enables normal progress of the pregnancy. Nevertheless, the risks induced by these modifications during pregnancy are not fully understood. Metabolic diseases later in life could be exacerbated through the memory of epigenetic adaptation mechanisms established during pregnancy. Thus, more research is still needed to better understand abnormal interactions between the embryo and the milieu in artificial conditions. As trophectoderm cells are in direct contact with the environment, they deserve to be studied in more detail. The ultimate goal of these studies will be to render ART protocols safer. Optimization of the environment will be the key to improving the dialogue between the endometrium and embryo, so as to ensure that placentation after ART is similar to that following natural conception.", "journal": "Clinical epigenetics", "date": "2015-08-25", "authors": ["C\u00e9cileChoux", "VirginieCarmignac", "C\u00e9lineBruno", "PaulSagot", "DanielVaiman", "PatriciaFauque"], "doi": "10.1186/s13148-015-0120-2"}
{"title": "Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis: a focus on the EIF2AK4 mutation in onset and pathogenesis.", "abstract": "Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) is a pulmonary vascular disease that mainly affects small capillaries in the lung, and is often misdiagnosed as pulmonary arterial hypertension or pulmonary veno-occlusive disease due to similarities in their clinical presentations, prognosis, and management. In patients who are symptomatic, there is a high mortality rate with median survival of 3 years after diagnosis. Both idiopathic and familial PCH cases are being reported, indicating there is genetic component in disease etiology. Mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 kinase 4 (EIF2AK4) gene were identified in familial and idiopathic PCH cases, suggesting EIF2AK4 is a genetic risk factor for PCH. EIF2AK4 mutations were identified in 100% (6/6) of autosomal recessively inherited familial PCH and 20% (2/10) of sporadic PCH cases. EIF2AK4 is a member of serine/threonine kinases. It downregulates protein synthesis in response to a variety of cellular stress such as hypoxia, viral infection, and amino acid deprivation. Bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) is a major genetic risk factor in pulmonary arterial hypertension and EIF2AK4 potentially connects with BMPR2 to cause PCH. L-Arginine is substrate of nitric oxide synthase, and L-arginine is depleted during the production of nitric oxide, which may activate EIF2AK4 to inhibit protein synthesis and negatively regulate vasculogenesis. Mammalian target of rapamycin and EIF2\u03b1 kinase are two major pathways for translational regulation. Mutant EIF2AK4 could promote proliferation of small pulmonary arteries by crosstalk with mammalian targets of the rapamycin signaling pathway. EIF2AK4 may regulate angiogenesis by modulating the immune system in PCH pathogenesis. The mechanisms of abnormal capillary angiogenesis are suggested to be similar to that of tumor vascularization. Specific therapies were developed according to pathogenesis and are proved to be effective in reported cases. Targeting the EIF2AK4 pathway may provide a novel therapy for PCH.", "journal": "The application of clinical genetics", "date": "2015-08-25", "authors": ["LijiangMa", "RuijunBao"], "doi": "10.2147/TACG.S68635"}

Orthotopically implanted NDRG1 glioma showed reduced tumor growth and vessel density compared to controls. RT-PCR gene array analysis revealed a 30-fold TNFSF15 increase in NDRG1 tumors. Consequently, the supernatant from NDRG1 transfected U87MG glioma cells resulted in reduced HUVEC proliferation, migration and angiogenic response in tube formation assays in vitro. This effect was provoked by increased TNFSF15 promoter activity in NDRG1 cells. Mutations in NF-\u03baB and AP-1 promoter response elements suppressed TNFSF15 promoter activity.

{"title": "Patient-Specific Biomechanical Modeling for Guidance During Minimally-Invasive Hepatic Surgery.", "abstract": "During the minimally-invasive liver surgery, only the partial surface view of the liver is usually provided to the surgeon via the laparoscopic camera. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the actual position of the internal structures such as tumors and vessels from the pre-operative images. Nevertheless, such task can be highly challenging since during the intervention, the abdominal organs undergo important deformations due to the pneumoperitoneum, respiratory and cardiac motion and the interaction with the surgical tools. Therefore, a reliable automatic system for intra-operative guidance requires fast and reliable registration of the pre- and intra-operative data. In this paper we present a complete pipeline for the registration of pre-operative patient-specific image data to the sparse and incomplete intra-operative data. While the intra-operative data is represented by a point cloud extracted from the stereo-endoscopic images, the pre-operative data is used to reconstruct a biomechanical model which is necessary for accurate estimation of the position of the internal structures, considering the actual deformations. This model takes into account the patient-specific liver anatomy composed of parenchyma, vascularization and capsule, and is enriched with anatomical boundary conditions transferred from an atlas. The registration process employs the iterative closest point technique together with a penalty-based method. We perform a quantitative assessment based on the evaluation of the target registration error on synthetic data as well as a qualitative assessment on real patient data.

The regulation of the mRNA splicing of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is critical for EC-associated cancer vascularization and invasion. Recently, we have reported that poorly prognostic EC had high levels of YT521, a newly defined RNA splicing protein. However, whether YT521 may similarly regulate the splicing of VEGF-A in EC is unknown. Here, we showed that EC specimens contained significantly higher levels of YT521, compared to the adjacent non-tumor endometrial tissue. Higher levels of YT521 were detected in EC specimens with metastases. High-YT521 EC is associated with poor patient survival. In order to examine whether YT521 may regulate VEGF-A mRNA splicing in EC, we transfected an EC cell line HEC-1A with different doses of YT521 mimics. We found that YT521 dose-dependently increased the ratio of VEGF-165 vs VEGF-121 at both mRNA and protein level, suggesting that YT521 may promote VEGF-A mRNA splicing to favor a VEGF-165 isoform. Moreover, the increases in the ratio of VEGF-165 vs VEGF-121 by YT521 overexpression resulted in increases in EC cell invasion, while decreases in the ratio of VEGF-165 vs VEGF-121 by YT521 depletion resulted in decreases in EC cell invasion in a transwell cell migration assay. Further, overexpression of VEGF-165, but not overexpression of VEGF-121, increased EC cell invasiveness. Finally, a strong correlation was detected between the ratio of VEGF-165 vs VEGF-121 and the levels of YT521 in EC specimens.

Incorporation of HA of various concentrations resulted in ECM with varying mechanical properties. Sprouting angiogenesis was affected by mechanically modulated HA-extracellular matrix interactions, generating a model of vascularized bone microenvironment.

Specifically, altiratinib inhibits not only mechanisms of tumor initiation and progression, but also drug resistance mechanisms in the tumor and microenvironment through balanced inhibition of MET, TIE2 (TEK), and VEGFR2 (KDR) kinases. This profile was achieved by optimizing binding into the switch control pocket of all three kinases, inducing type II inactive conformations. Altiratinib durably inhibits MET, both wild-type and mutated forms, in vitro and in vivo. Through its balanced inhibitory potency versus MET, TIE2, and VEGFR2, altiratinib provides an agent that inhibits three major evasive (re)vascularization and resistance pathways (HGF, ANG, and VEGF) and blocks tumor invasion and metastasis. Altiratinib exhibits properties amenable to oral administration and exhibits substantial blood-brain barrier penetration, an attribute of significance for eventual treatment of brain cancers and brain metastases.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2015-08-20", "authors": ["Bryan DSmith", "Michael DKaufman", "Cynthia BLeary", "Benjamin ATurner", "Scott CWise", "Yu MiAhn", "R JohnBooth", "Timothy MCaldwell", "Carol LEnsinger", "Molly MHood", "Wei-PingLu", "Tristan WPatt", "William CPatt", "Thomas JRutkoski", "ThiwankaSamarakoon", "HanumaiahTelikepalli", "LakshminarayanaVogeti", "SubhaVogeti", "Karen MYates", "LawrenceChun", "Lance JStewart", "MichaelClare", "Daniel LFlynn"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-1105"}

In melanoma, for instance, stress-associated norephinephrine (NE), acting at \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs), stimulates melanoma cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Among \u03b2-ARs, \u03b23-ARs play a role acting not only at tumor cells but also at non-neoplastic stromal cells within the melanoma. In the present study, we used a murine model of B16 melanoma to evaluate the role of the host \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs in melanoma growth and we determined whether the role of \u03b23-ARs can be influenced by the absence of stromal \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs. As compared to wild-type mice, \u03b21/2-AR knockout mice displayed (i) increased intratumoral levels of both NE and \u03b23-ARs, as evidentiated at both messenger and protein levels; (ii) increased tumor vascularization; (iii) decreased tumor cell proliferation but increased tumor cell apoptosis; and (iv) increased responsiveness to intratumoral injection of the \u03b23-AR blocker L-748,337 in terms of decrease in tumor growth, tumor vascular response, tumor cell proliferation, and increase in tumor cell death. These findings together validate the role of \u03b2-AR signaling in melanoma microenvironment suggesting that non-neoplastic stromal cells may be targeted by \u03b2-AR-related drugs.

In this paper we examined if senescent HPMCs can intensify the progression of colorectal (SW480) and pancreatic (PSN-1) cancers in vitro and in vivo. Experiments showed that senescent HPMCs stimulate proliferation, migration and invasion of SW480 cells, and migration of PSN-1 cells. When SW480 cells were injected i.p. with senescent HPMCs, the dynamics of tumor formation and vascularization were increased. When xenografts were generated using PSN-1 cells, senescent HPMCs failed to favor their growth. SW480 cells subjected to senescent HPMCs displayed up-regulated expression of transcripts for various pro-cancerogenic agents as well as increased secretion of their products. Moreover, they underwent an epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the Smad 2/3-Snail1-related pathway. The search for mediators of senescent HPMC activity showed that increased SW480 cell proliferation was stimulated by IL-6, migration by CXCL8 and CCL2, invasion by IL-6, MMP-3 and uPA, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by TGF-\u03b21. Secretion of these agents by senescent HPMCs was increased in an NF-\u03baB- and p38 MAPK-dependent mechanism.

Here, we report the oncogenic properties of dynAP. In contrast to control NIH3T3 cells expressing LacZ (NIH3T3LacZ), NIH3T3dynAP cells vigorously formed foci in two-dimensional culture, colonies on soft agar, and spheroids in anchorage-deficient three-dimensional culture. NIH3T3dynAP cells injected into nude mice produced tumors with abundant blood vessels and weak cell-cell contacts. Expression of dynAP elevated the level of rictor (an essential subunit of mTORC2) and promoted phosphorylation of FOXO3aSer253. FOXO3a is a transcriptional factor that stimulates expression of pro-apoptotic genes and phosphorylation of FOXO3a abrogates its function, resulting in promoted cell survival. Knockdown of rictor in NIH3T3dynAP cells reduced AktSer473 phosphorylation and formation of foci, colony in soft agar and spheroid, indicating that dynAP-induced activation of the mTORC2/AktSer473 pathway for cell survival contributes to cell transformation. E-cadherin and its mRNA were markedly reduced upon expression of dynAP, giving rise to cells with higher motility, which may be responsible for the weak cell-cell adhesion in tumors.

Here, we describe a composite, laser micromachined, collagen-alginate construct containing human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) for tissue repair applications. Collagen type I was fashioned into laminated collagen sheets to form a mechanically robust fascia that was subsequently laser micropatterned with pores of defined dimension and spatial distribution as a means to modulate mechanical behavior and promote tissue integration. Significantly, laser micromachined patterned constructs displayed both substantially greater compliance and suture retention strength than non-patterned constructs. hMSCs were loaded in an RGD-functionalized alginate gel modified to degrade in vivo. Over a 7 day observation period in vitro, high cell viability was observed with constant levels of VEGF, PDGF-\u03b2 and MCP-1 protein expression. In a full thickness abdominal wall defect model, the composite construct prevented hernia recurrence in Wistar rats over an 8-week period with de novo tissue and vascular network formation and the absence of adhesions to underlying abdominal viscera. As compared to acellular constructs, constructs containing hMSCs displayed greater integration strength (cell seeded: 0.92 \u00b1 0.19 N/mm vs. acellular: 0.59 \u00b1 0.25 N/mm, p=0.01), increased vascularization (cell seeded: 2.7-2.1/hpf vs. acellular: 1.7-2.1/hpf, p<0.03), and increased infiltration of macrophages (cell seeded: 2021-3630 \u03bcm(2)/hpf vs. acellular: 1570-2530 \u03bcm(2)/hpf, p<0.05). A decrease in the ratio of M1 macrophages to total macrophages was also observed in hMSC-populated samples. Laser micromachined collagen-alginate composites containing hMSCs can be used to bridge soft tissue defects with the capacity for enhanced tissue repair and integration.\nEffective restoration of large soft tissue defects caused by trauma or treatment complications represents a critical challenge in the clinic. In this study, a novel composite construct was engineered and evaluated for stem cell delivery and tissue repair. Laser micromachining was used to fabricate patterned, microporous constructs designed with pores of defined size and distribution as a means to tune mechanical responses, accommodate and protect incorporated cells, and enhance tissue integration. The construct was embedded within an engineered alginate gel containing hMSCs.

{"title": "Modulation of inflammation and angiogenesis and changes in ECM GAG-activity via dual delivery of nucleic acids.", "abstract": "Tissue-engineered organs and implants hold promise for the replacement of damaged and diseased organs. However, the foreign body response (FBR) is a major obstacle that compromises the function of tissue-engineered constructs, typically causing them to fail. Two components of FBR are an inflammatory response and a lack of vascularization. To overcome these limitations, a collagen system was developed to release interleukin-6 (IL-6) siRNA and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pDNA in a staggered manner. Hollow collagen microspheres were assembled into a collagen sphere-in-hydrogel system that displayed a staggered release profile in\u00a0vitro. This system was assessed in\u00a0vivo in a subcutaneous rat model. The doses of IL-6 siRNA and eNOS pDNA were first individually optimized for their ability to reduce the volume fraction of inflammatory cells (7 days) and increase the length density of blood vessels (14 days), respectively. The identified optimal doses were combined, and the ability of the system to decrease the volume fraction of inflammatory cells and increase the length density of blood vessels was confirmed at both 7 and 14 days. Analysis of the tissue using Raman microspectroscopy revealed that in addition to changes in inflammation and angiogenesis, there were also changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) at seven days. While changes in sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content of the ECM were not detected, changes in the binding of sGAG of the ECM to growth factors were observed. Two growth factors tested, VEGF165 and bFGF showed increased binding to sGAG extracted from eNOS pDNA-treated samples at seven days, increasing the angiogenic potential of the ECM. Thus, we observe that changes in the tissue in terms of the balance of inflammation and angiogenesis as well changes in the activity of sGAG of the ECM occurs following dual delivery of nucleic acids from the collagen sphere-in-hydrogel system.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-08-19", "authors": ["ShaneBrowne", "Michael GMonaghan", "EvaBrauchle", "Daniel CarvajalBerrio", "SandrineChantepie", "DulcePapy-Garcia", "KatjaSchenke-Layland", "AbhayPandit"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.012"}

Amputation of lower limbs in diabetic patients who present foot complications is a common occurrence with a significant reduction of life quality, and heavy costs on the health system. Unfortunately, there is no easy protocol to define the conditions that should be considered to proceed to amputation. The main objective of the present study is to create a simple prognostic score to evaluate the diabetic foot, which is called Tardivo Algorithm. Calculation of the score is based on three main factors: Wagner classification, signs of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which is evaluated by using Peripheral Arterial Disease Classification, and the location of ulcers. The final score is obtained by multiplying the value of the individual factors. Patients with good peripheral vascularization received a value of 1, while clinical signs of ischemia received a value of 2 (PAD 2). Ulcer location was defined as forefoot, midfoot and hind foot. The conservative treatment used in patients with scores below 12 was based on a recently developed Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) protocol. 85.5% of these patients presented a good outcome and avoided amputation. The results showed that scores 12 or higher represented a significantly higher probability of amputation (Odds ratio and logistic regression-IC 95%, 12.2-1886.5).

The latter were characterized by an alteration of the normal vascular appearance consisting of loss of the subcapsular arterioles and lack of a centripetal vascular pattern. The qualitative aspect of the study highlighted the different vascular architecture between BPH, prostatitis, adenocarcinoma, and lymphoma. This study shows how contrast-enhanced ultrasound represents a valid and noninvasive method for highlighting and characterizing prostatic vasculature. Furthermore, it allows the operator to obtain qualitative and quantitative data that are useful for the diagnosis of selected prostatic diseases. In conclusion, contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be a valuable noninvasive diagnostic tool to improve the diagnostic accuracy of prostate diseases in the dog.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2015-08-19", "authors": ["AlessandroTroisi", "RiccardoOrlandi", "PaoloBargellini", "LauraMenchetti", "PauloBorges", "RiccardoZelli", "AngelaPolisca"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.07.029"}

The vascular anatomy of the SLGA and its distal branches to skin, muscle, and periosteum were identified. Fluoroscopic images were taken during continuous perfusion of a radiopaque contrast dye into the SLGA. Intra-arterial injections of latex rubber were performed in 12 cadaver limbs. The vascular territory was traced from the SLGA to its distal branches, and surrounding soft tissues were dissected.\nThe SLGA originated from the popliteal artery 4.9 \u00b1 1.2 cm (range, 2.8-7 cm) from the knee joint and its pedicle diameter was 1.8 \u00b1 0.5 mm (range, 1-3 mm). SGLA pedicle-specific fluoroscopic angiography demonstrated a dense filigree of vessels over the lateral distal femur. Arterial latex injections confirmed that the SLGA supplied the periosteum of the LFC and distal femur shaft. The proximal-most extent of periosteal perfusion was 11.7 \u00b1 2.1 cm (range, 9.3-14.1 cm) from the knee joint. The average pedicle length of LFC osteoperiosteal flaps was 4.8 \u00b1 0.9 cm (range, 3.5-6.3 cm).\nThe LFC flap consistently demonstrated almost 12 cm of femur length perfusion based on the SLGA pedicle.

We prospectively examined whether physical activity was associated with prostate tumor microvessel morphology among 571 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study using ordinal logistic regression. Vessel size (\u03bcm(2)), vessel lumen regularity (perimeter(2)/4 \u00b7 \u03a0 \u00b7 area), and microvessel density (number/high-powered field) were ascertained in tumor sections stained for endothelial cell marker CD34. Vigorous activity [metabolic equivalent task (MET) \u2265 6], nonvigorous activity (MET < 6), and walking pace were assessed a median of 14 months before diagnosis. Prostate tumors from men who reported a brisk walking pace (3+ mph) had larger, more regularly shaped blood vessels compared with those of men who walked at a less than brisk pace [vessel regularity OR, 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-2.27; P value, 0.01; vessel size OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.04-2.12; P value, 0.03].

{"title": "Multiple Antenatal Dexamethasone Treatment Alters Brain Vessel Differentiation in Newborn Mouse Pups.", "abstract": "Antenatal steroid treatment decreases morbidity and mortality in premature infants through the maturation of lung tissue, which enables sufficient breathing performance. However, clinical and animal studies have shown that repeated doses of glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone and betamethasone lead to long-term adverse effects on brain development. Therefore, we established a mouse model for antenatal dexamethasone treatment to investigate the effects of dexamethasone on brain vessel differentiation towards the blood-brain barrier (BBB) phenotype, focusing on molecular marker analysis. The major findings were that in total brains on postnatal day (PN) 4 triple antenatal dexamethasone treatment significantly downregulated the tight junction protein claudin-5, the endothelial marker Pecam-1/CD31, the glucocorticoid receptor, the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, and Abc transporters (Abcb1a, Abcg2 Abcc4). Less pronounced effects were found after single antenatal dexamethasone treatment and in PN10 samples. Comparisons of total brain samples with isolated brain endothelial cells together with the stainings for Pecam-1/CD31 and claudin-5 led to the assumption that the morphology of brain vessels is affected by antenatal dexamethasone treatment at PN4. On the mRNA level markers for angiogenesis, the sonic hedgehog and the Wnt pathway were downregulated in PN4 samples, suggesting fundamental changes in brain vascularization and/or differentiation.

All the tumors shared a similar morphology, including a purely nested or sheet-like architecture separated by a delicate vascular network, purely epithelioid cells displaying a clear or granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, a lack of papillary structures and spindle cell or fat components, uniform round or oval nuclei containing small visible nucleoli, and, in most cases (11/12), melanin pigmentation.

Omeprazole (OM) is a proton pump inhibitor that is used to treat humans with gastric acid related disorders. OM-mediated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation attenuates acute hyperoxic lung injury (HLI) in adult mice. Whether OM activates pulmonary AhR and protects C57BL/6J newborn mice against hyperoxia-induced developmental lung (alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification, inflammation, and oxidative stress) injury (HDLI) is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that OM will activate pulmonary AhR and mitigate HDLI in newborn mice. Newborn mice were treated daily with i.p. injections of OM at doses of 10 (OM10) or 25 (OM25) mg/kg while being exposed to air or hyperoxia (FiO2 of 85%) for 14 days, following which their lungs were harvested to determine alveolarization, pulmonary vascularization, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular injury, and AhR activation. To our surprise, hyperoxia-induced alveolar and pulmonary vascular simplification, inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury were augmented in OM25-treated animals. These findings were associated with attenuated pulmonary vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 expression and decreased pulmonary AhR activation in the OM25 group. We conclude that contrary to our hypothesis, OM decreases functional activation of pulmonary AhR and potentiates HDLI in newborn mice.

Results\u2003There are several benefits of intratumoral injection of fibrin sealant in hemangiopericytomas: (1) the extensive bleeding is diminished and blood loss minimized; (2) the restriction of the surgical view by the venous oozing is diminished, making the microsurgical dissection of the tumor capsule off the pial surface easier and safer; (3) the loose consistency of the tumor becomes firmer and facilitates the manipulation of the tumor and leads to a safer resection; and (4) a shorter operating time is needed.

Our earlier studies have reported altered maternal angiogenesis and differential placental gene expression and methylation patterns of angiogenic factors in women with preeclampsia when compared with normotensive women. We have also demonstrated lower maternal and placental neurotrophin (NT) levels in women with preeclampsia.

The anatomy of CHA absence was assessed synthetically by combining preoperative CT scans and intraoperative images, which were classified according to the anatomy of replaced hepatic arteries (RHAs) and were grouped into the early-year group (2007-2011) and the later-year group (2012-2013) based on the year in which the operation was performed.CHA absence was noted in 38 cases (1.8%) and was classified into 6 types: type I (replaced CHA [RCHA] from the superior mesenteric artery [SMA] with retropancreatic course, 28), type II (RCHA from the SMA with circumambulated course, 1), type III (RCHA from the aortic artery, 1), type IV (replaced left hepatic artery [RLHA] from the left gastric artery [LGA] and replaced right hepatic artery [RRHA] from the SMA, 5), type V (RLHA from the LGA and RRHA from the celiac artery, 2), and type VI (RLHA from the aberrant gastroduodenal artery and RRHA from the SMA, 1). Of the 38 cases, 17 cases (44.7%) belong to the early-year group, and 21 cases (55.3%) belong to the later-year group. The vascular injury rate was significantly lower in the later-year group than in the early-year group (4.8% [1/21] vs 41.2% [7/17], P\u200a=\u200a0.005]. Additionally, the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL) values were significantly lower in the later-year group than in the early-year group on postoperative day 3 (all P\u200a<\u200a0.05).A 6-type anatomic classification system can be used to demonstrate variations in features resulting from CHA absence in detail.

At this time, >100 upper extremity transplants, 30 face transplants, and a variety of other vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) procedures have been performed around the world. VCA recipients present unique challenges for transplantation. The incidence of acute rejection exceeds 80% in hand and face transplantation and is well documented, whereas reports about antibody-mediated rejection and chronic rejection remain scarce. Immunosuppression protocols commonly used at US centers are derived from solid organ transplantation protocols. Novel approaches to minimize rejections in VCA may include improved HLA matching and considerations toward cytomegalovirus infection status. New graft preservation techniques may decrease immunogenicity prior to transplant. Novel monitoring methods such as valid biomarkers, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and sentinel flaps may enable earlier diagnosis of rejection. Cell-based therapies are being explored to achieve immunosuppressive regimen minimization or even tolerance induction. The efficacy of local immunosuppression in clinical VCA remains controversial. In conclusion, although immunosuppressive strategies adapted from SOT have demonstrated good midterm results, focusing on the unique features of VCA grafts may enable additional, more specific treatment strategies in the future and improved long-term graft outcomes.", "journal": "Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation", "date": "2015-08-13", "authors": ["MaximilianKueckelhaus", "SebastianFischer", "MidasSeyda", "Ericka MBueno", "Mario AAycart", "MuayyadAlhefzi", "AbdallahElKhal", "BohdanPomahac", "Stefan GTullius"], "doi": "10.1111/tri.12652"}
{"title": "Extensive Loss of Islet Mass Beyond the First Day After Intraportal Human Islet Transplantation in a Mouse Model.", "abstract": "Clinical islet transplantation is characterized by a progressive deterioration of islet graft function, which renders many patients once again dependent on exogenous insulin administration within a couple of years. In this study, we aimed to investigate possible engraftment factors limiting the survival and viability of experimentally transplanted human islets beyond the first day after their transplantation to the liver. Human islets were transplanted into the liver of nude mice and characterized 1 or 30 days after transplantation by immunohistochemistry. The factors assessed were endocrine mass, cellular death, hypoxia, vascular density and amyloid formation in the transplanted islets. One day posttransplantation, necrotic cells, as well as apoptotic cells, were commonly observed. In contrast to necrotic death, apoptosis rates remained high 1 month posttransplantation, and the total islet mass was reduced by more than 50% between 1 and 30 days posttransplantation. Islet mass at 30 days posttransplantation correlated negatively to apoptotic death. Vascular density within the transplanted islets remained less than 30% of that in native human islets up to 30 days posttransplantation and was associated with prevailing hypoxia. Amyloid formation was rarely observed in the 1-day-old transplants, but was commonly observed in the 30-day-old islet transplants. We conclude that substantial islet cell death occurs beyond the immediate posttransplantation phase, particularly through apoptotic events. Concomitant low vascularization with prevailing hypoxia and progressive amyloid development was observed in the human islet grafts.

In KS tumors, KSHV expresses only a few latent proteins together with 12 pre-microRNAs. Previous microarray and proteomic studies predicted that multiple splice variants of the tumor suppressor protein tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) were targets of KSHV microRNAs. Here we show that at least two microRNAs of KSHV, miR-K2 and miR-K5, repress protein levels of specific isoforms of TPM1. We identified a functional miR-K5 binding site in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of one TPM1 isoform. Furthermore, the inhibition or loss of miR-K2 or miR-K5 restores expression of TPM1 in KSHV-infected cells. TPM1 protein levels were also repressed in KSHV-infected clinical samples compared to uninfected samples. Functionally, miR-K2 increases viability of unanchored human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by inhibiting anoikis (apoptosis after cell detachment), enhances tube formation of HUVECs, and enhances VEGFA expression.

{"title": "Bone Tissue Engineering with Multilayered Scaffolds-Part I: An Approach for Vascularizing Engineered Constructs In Vivo.", "abstract": "Obtaining functional capillaries through the bulk has been identified as a major challenge in tissue engineering, particularly for critical-sized defects. In the present study, a multilayered scaffold system was developed for bone tissue regeneration, designed for through-the-thickness vascularization of the construct. The basic principle of this approach was to alternately layer mesenchymal stem cell-seeded nanofibers (osteogenic layer) with microfibers or porous ceramics (osteoconductive layer), with an intercalating angiogenic zone between the two and with each individual layer in the microscale dimension (100-400\u2009\u03bcm). Such a design can create a scaffold system potentially capable of spatially distributed vascularization in the overall bulk tissue. In the cellular approach, the angiogenic zone consisted of collagen/fibronectin gel with endothelial cells and pericytes, while in the acellular approach, cells were omitted from the zone without altering the gel composition. The cells incorporated into the construct were analyzed for viability, distribution, and organization of cells on the layers and vessel development in vitro. Furthermore, the layered constructs were implanted in the subcutaneous space of nude mice and the processes of vascularization and bone tissue regeneration were followed by histological and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. The results indicated that the microenvironment in the angiogenic zone, microscale size of the layers, and the continuously channeled architecture at the interface were adequate for infiltrating host vessels through the bulk and vascularizing the construct. Through-the-thickness vascularization and mineralization were accomplished in the construct, suggesting that a suitably bioengineered layered construct may be a useful design for regeneration of large bone defects.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The angiogenic layer was a collagen-fibronectin gel, and the osteogenic layer was made from nanofibrous polycaprolactone while the osteoconductive layer was made either from microporous hydroxyapatite or microfibrous polycaprolactone. In this follow-up study, we implanted these acellular and cellular multilayered constructs in critical-sized rat calvarial defects and evaluated their vascularization and bone formation potential. Vascularization and bone formation at the defect were evaluated and quantified using microcomputed tomography (microCT) followed by perfusion of the animals with the radio opaque contrast agent, MICROFIL. The extent of bony bridging and union within the critical-sized defect was evaluated using a previously established scoring system from the microCT data set. Similarly the new bone formation in the defect was quantified from the microCT data set as previously reported. Histological evaluation at 4 and 12 weeks validated the microCT findings. Our experimental results showed that acellular multilayered scaffolds with microscale-thick nanofibers and porous ceramic discs with angiogenic zone at their interface can regenerate functional vasculature and bone similar to that of cellular constructs in critical-sized calvarial defects. This result suggests that suitably bioengineered acellular multilayered constructs can be an improved and more translational approach in functional in vivo bone regeneration.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

In this case report we demonstrate a novel variation of a two-stage technique for reconstruction of a devastated bulbous urethra in a 57-year-old male who suffered penetrating trauma to his previously reconstructed urethra. Because of extensive loss of local tissue from the prior reconstruction and subsequent trauma and infection a 2-stage technique with use of gracilis was employed. This technique involved creation of two independently vascularized urethral hemi-plates prelaminated with buccal mucosa graft (BMG). In the first stage the dorsal plate was created by quilting buccal graft onto corpora cavernosa to create a temporary augmented perineal urethrostomy.

Clinically, ECM scaffolds have been used for lower extremity VML repair; in particular, MatriStem\u2122, a porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM), has shown improved functional outcomes and vascularization, but limited myogenesis. However, efficacy of the scaffold for the repair of traumatic muscle injuries has not been examined systematically. In this study, we demonstrate that the porcine UBM scaffold when used to repair a rodent gastrocnemius musculotendinous junction (MTJ) and tibialis anterior (TA) VML injury does not support muscle tissue regeneration. In the MTJ model, the scaffold was completely resorbed without tissue remodeling, suggesting that the scaffold may not be suitable for the clinical repair of muscle-tendon injuries. In the TA VML injury, the scaffold remodeled into a fibrotic tissue and showed functional improvement, but not due to muscle fiber regeneration. The inclusion of physical rehabilitation also did not improve functional response or tissue remodeling. We conclude that the porcine UBM scaffold when used to treat VML injuries may hasten the functional recovery through the mechanism of scaffold mediated functional fibrosis. Thus for appreciable muscle regeneration, repair strategies that incorporate myogenic cells, vasculogenic accelerant and a myoconductive scaffold need to be developed.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-08-11", "authors": ["AmitAurora", "Janet LRoe", "Benjamin TCorona", "Thomas JWalters"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.07.040"}
{"title": "Loss of endothelial programmed cell death 10 activates glioblastoma cells and promotes tumor growth.", "abstract": "Neo-angiogenesis is a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM) and is sustained by autocrine and paracrine interactions between neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells. Programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) is ubiquitously expressed in nearly all tissues and plays crucial roles in regulating angiogenesis and apoptosis. We recently discovered the absence of PDCD10 expression in the tumor vessels of GBM patients. This raised the hypothesis that loss of endothelial PDCD10 affected GBM cell phenotyping and tumor progression.\nEndothelial PDCD10 was silenced by siRNA and lentiviral shRNA. The tumor cell phenotype was studied in direct and indirect co-culture of endothelial cells (ECs) with U87 or LN229. Angiogenic protein array was performed in the media of PDCD10-silenced ECs. Tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth were investigated in a human GBM xenograft mouse model.\nEndothelial silence of PDCD10 significantly stimulated tumor cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and invasion and inhibited apoptosis in co-cultures. Stable knockdown of endothelial PDCD10 increased microvessel density and the formation of a functional vascular network, leading to a 4-fold larger tumor mass in mice. Intriguingly, endothelial deletion of PDCD10 increased (\u22652-fold) the release of 20 of 55 tested proangiogenic factors including VEGF, which in turn activated Erk1/2 and Akt in GBM cells.\nFor the first time, we provide evidence that loss of endothelial PDCD10 activates GBM cells and promotes tumor growth, most likely via a paracrine mechanism. PDCD10 shows a tumor-suppressor-like function in the cross talk between ECs and tumor cells and is potentially implicated in GBM progression.", "journal": "Neuro-oncology", "date": "2015-08-09", "authors": ["YuanZhu", "KaiZhao", "AnjaPrinz", "KathyKeyvani", "NicoleLambertz", "IlonkaKreitschmann-Andermahr", "TingLei", "UlrichSure"], "doi": "10.1093/neuonc/nov155"}
{"title": "Vessel and Mast Cell Densities in Sporadic and Syndrome-associated Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors.", "abstract": "Peripheral nerve sheath (PNS) tumors constitute a heterogeneous group of solid tumors. Neurofibroma and schwannoma are the most frequently diagnosed entities. Both tumor types occur sporadically and are associated with syndromes. Current strategies to fight PNS progression by means of pharmaceuticals aim to specifically interfere with vascular growth factors identified in PNS. Furthermore, malignant transformation of PNS tumors is known to be associated with a change in vascularization. The aim of the study was to investigate vascularization of different PNS tumors with respect to sporadic or syndromal state of the entities.\nOne hundred and thirty-two formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded PNS tissue samples were retrieved from the archives of the Institute of Neuropathology, Eppendorf University Hospital. Lymphatic and blood vessels were immunohistochemically identified and morphometrically analyzed in PNS and controls.\nBlood vessel density in malignant tumors was significantly higher than in benign lesions (30.8/mm(2) vs. 13.46/mm(2)). In the latter, the vessel density resembled that of control tissue. Lymphatic vessel supply was significantly higher in cutaneous neurofibroma and diffuse plexiform neurofibroma (PNF) than in intra-neural localized tumors (schwannoma, nodular PNF). Lymphatic vessels showed no marked differences with respect to tumor entity. Prevalence of mast cells differed markedly between tumor types.\nDifferent vascularization of PNS may contribute to diverging tumor response following application of anti-neoplastic drugs. Mast cells may have an impact during formation and growth of neurofibroma but are unlikely to be involved in the process of de-differentiation.", "journal": "Anticancer research", "date": "2015-08-09", "authors": ["Reinhard EFriedrich", "UrsNaber", "MarkusGlatzel", "ChristianHagel"], "doi": null}

All underwent ultrasound-guided surgical removal of the retained products under general anesthesia. Blood loss during the procedure was collected and recorded. The removed tissue was sent for histologic examination. An ultrasound examination was repeated within 24 hours.\nFive patients had retained products of conception after a term delivery, 1 after a second-trimester termination of pregnancy, 7 after a spontaneous first-trimester miscarriage, and 5 after a first-trimester termination elsewhere. The PSV in the area of enhanced myometrial vascularity at diagnosis ranged from 61.0 to 152.6 cm/s (mean, 104.9 cm/s). The estimated blood loss at surgery ranged from 20 to 1000 mL (mean, 200 mL). After surgery, the PSV in the myometrium dropped dramatically (\u226430 cm/s in all but 1 case). In all cases, trophoblastic tissue was confirmed at histologic examination.\nAlthough surgical removal of retained products of conception was uneventful in most cases, heavy bleeding has to be anticipated in cases of high-velocity flow in the myometrium underlying residual trophoblastic tissue.

We showed that oxidative stress was elevated in CACs cultured from blood of individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and diabetes. We then assessed the action of palmitic acid (PA), a deregulated and increased NEFA in metabolic disorders, focusing on its oxidant potential. We observed that the phyto-polyphenol resveratrol normalized oxidative stress both in CACs isolated from MetS patients or treated with PA. Resveratrol further decreased the deleterious action of PA on gene expression of vascularization factors (TNF\u03b1, VEGF-A, SDF1\u03b1, PECAM-1, VEGFR2, Tie2 and CXCR4) and improved CAC motility. Particularly, resveratrol abolished the PA-induced over-expression of the pro-oxidant protein p66Shc. Neither KLF2 nor SIRT1, previously shown in resveratrol and p66Shc action, was directly involved. Silencing p66Shc normalized PA action on VEGF-A and TNF\u03b1 specifically, without abolishing the PA-induced oxidative stress, which suggests a deleterious role of p66Shc independently of any major modulation of the cellular oxidative status in a high NEFA levels context.

Although c-Kit receptor signaling promotes angiogenesis in multiple cell types, its role in islet vasculature is unknown. This study examines the effects of c-Kit-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor isoform A (VEGF-A) and islet vascularization on \u03b2-cell function and survival using in vitro cell culture and in vivo mouse models. In cultured INS-1 cells and primary islets, c-Kit regulates VEGF-A expression via the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Juvenile mice with mutated c-Kit (c-Kit(Wv/+)) showed impaired islet vasculature and \u03b2-cell dysfunction, while restoring c-Kit expression in \u03b2-cells of c-Kit(Wv/+) mice rescued islet vascular defects through modulation of the Akt/mTOR/VEGF-A pathway, indicating that c-Kit signaling in \u03b2-cells is a required regulator for maintaining normal islet vasculature. Furthermore, \u03b2-cell-specific c-Kit overexpression (c-Kit\u03b2Tg) in aged mice showed significantly increased islet vasculature and \u03b2-cell function, but, when exposed to a long-term high-fat diet, c-Kit signaling in c-Kit\u03b2Tg mice induced substantial vascular remodeling, which resulted in increased islet inflammatory responses and \u03b2-cell apoptosis.

As many stem cell cues have adverse effects on normal tissue homeostasis, there is a need to develop bioactive scaffolds which offer locally retained and cell-targeted drug delivery for intracellular release in targeted cell populations. Further, the scaffolds need to support vascularization to promote tissue growth and function. We have developed an electrospun PLA-PANI fiber scaffold, and incorporated mesoporous silica nanoparticles within the scaffold matrix to obtain cell-targeted and localized drug delivery. The isotropy of the scaffold can be tuned to find the optimal morphology for a given application and the scaffold is electroactive to support differentiation of contractile tissues. We demonstrate that there is no premature drug release from particles under physiological conditions over a period of one week and that the drug is released upon internalization of particles by cells within the scaffold. The scaffold is biocompatible, supports muscle stem cell differentiation and cell-seeded scaffolds are vascularized in vivo upon transplantation on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos. The scaffold is a step towards instructive biomaterials for local control of stem cell differentiation, and tissue formation supported by vascularization and without adverse effects on the homeostasis of adjacent tissues due to diffusion of biological cues.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2015-08-08", "authors": ["HusseinShokry", "UlriikaVanamo", "OliverWiltschka", "JenniNiinim\u00e4ki", "MartinaLerche", "KalleLevon", "MikaLinden", "CeciliaSahlgren"], "doi": "10.1039/c5nr03983e"}
{"title": "The effects of different vascular carrier patterns on the angiogenesis and osteogenesis of BMSC-TCP-based tissue-engineered bone in beagle dogs.", "abstract": "Bone repair using tissue-engineered bone (TEB) in a large defect or accompanied by a poor recipient vascular bed is a long-standing challenge. Surgical vascular carrier patterns of vascular bundle (VB) and arteriovenous loop (AV loop) have been shown to improve the vascularization and repair capacity of TEB. However, the effects of these different vascular carrier patterns on angiogenesis and osteogenesis in TEB have never been evaluated. Here, TEB was constructed with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and \u03b2-TCP and prevascularized by the VB or AV loop technique in beagle dogs. The vascularization and bone formation in TEB were quantitatively compared using Microfil perfusion, histological examination and CT and micro-CT analyses. The distribution and constitution of the neovasculature were analysed to determine the underlying mechanism of angiogenesis. The results showed that prevascularized TEB generated bone tissue faster and more homogeneously than untreated TEB. The VB technique was found to strike a better balance between bone regeneration and \u03b2-TCP scaffold degradation than the AV loop strategy, which resulted in more vascularization but less bone yield, due to faster degradation of the \u03b2-TCP scaffold. This study indicates that a suitable triangular relationship, composed of bone regeneration, scaffold degradation and vasculature, is critical to TEB construction.

{"title": "Celecoxib Nanoparticles for Therapeutic Angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Controllable induction of blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) presents an important therapeutic goal in ischemic diseases and is also beneficial in various normal physiological processes. In this study, we have shown that nanoparticles of celecoxib, a lipophilic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, effectively evoke therapeutic angiogenesis in animal models, in both normal and ischemic organs. Celecoxib is widely considered to inhibit angiogenesis, although a recent study suggests that it can instead promote blood vessel growth in cancer cell lines. The hydrophobic nature of this drug necessitates its administration in nanoparticulate form in order to elicit a perceivable pharmacological response. We developed a facile method for nanoparticle formation by solvent extraction from microemulsions in supercritical carbon dioxide. This method exploits a spontaneous formation of nanometric domains within the microemulsion system and their rapid conversion to nanoparticles by supercritical fluid. The resultant nanoparticles were administered subcutaneously to mice in a biocompatible hydrogel, and caused a 4-fold increase in blood vessel count in normally perfused skin compared with drug-free particles. They were at least as effective in inducing angiogenesis as nanoparticles of deferoxamine, a well-established neovascularization promoter. Next, we evaluated their effect on ischemic tissues in murine model of myocardial infarction. We found that celecoxib nanoparticles were able to induce a significant vascularization of ischemic myocardium and hamper the progression of heart failure, which points toward a new approach for treating ischemia.", "journal": "ACS nano", "date": "2015-08-06", "authors": ["KatherineMargulis", "Evgenios ANeofytou", "Ramin EBeygui", "Richard NZare"], "doi": "10.1021/acsnano.5b04137"}

The genes FZD4, LRP5, and TSPAN12 are known to be associated with the autosomal inheritance form of FEVR. In this study, we performed mutation screening for FZD4, LRP5, and TSPAN12 in patients with clinical diagnosis of FEVR. In patients with no mutation detected, sequencing analyses for ZNF408, a novel gene potentially related to FEVR, and two other genes related to retinal development, LGR4 and ATOH7, were performed.\nMutational studies were done in 51 unrelated patients with diagnosis of FEVR during 2008 to 2012 at the Seoul National University Hospital. These patients were screened previously for NDP gene and confirmed to be negative for mutations. Diagnosis of FEVR was established by ophthalmic examinations. Data collected from medical records included sex, age at diagnosis, clinical presentation, and angiographic findings.\nIn this study, we identified 3 known mutations, 10 novel variants with high possibility of pathogenicity, and a whole gene deletion in a total of 18 unrelated patients of 51, resulting in 35.3% of patients being genetically confirmed as having FEVR. Among the patients with pathogenic mutations detected, FZD4 mutations accounted for the largest proportion of autosomal inheritance FEVR cases (13/18 patients, 72.2%), followed by LRP5 (4/18 patients, 22.2%) and TSPAN12 (1/18 patients, 5.6%). No pathogenic mutations were identified in ZNF408, LGR4, and ATOH7. A significant difference in FEVR stage and visual acuity was observed according to the gene involved, showing that patients with FZD4 mutations had milder phenotype.\nMutations of FZD4 accounted for the largest proportion, which could be directly applied to the testing strategy to start with screening for FZD4 mutations.

Leg initial assessment demonstrated a 5cm bone loss at the distal fibula combined with severe soft tissue damage. Immediate healing was achieved with split-thickness skin graft but secondary reconstruction was necessary to obtain bone replacement with soft tissue coverage to allow bone growth and shoe donning. To avoid microsurgical fibular epiphyseal transplant morbidity and complications, we used a pedicled second metatarsal flap based on the dorsalis pedis vessels including the second metatarsal bone, the skin of the second toe and the brevis pedis muscle. Repair of the donor side was performed with direct suture and no post-operative course complication was noted. At seven-year follow-up, transferred bone had excellent growth and the patient had adequate ankle function and stable ride.

We also attempted to correlate these modifications with the histological parameters of tumour aggressiveness and the surrounding liver parenchyma.\nNinety-six HCCs (from 80 patients) were retrospectively enrolled, 46 occurring in non-cirrhotic livers, and 50 in livers transplanted for cirrhosis. Histopathological analysis, immunohistochemistry for CD34, Nestin and WT1 and RT-PCR for Nestin, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1R) mRNA were performed in all nodules.\nBy correlating the CD34 and Nestin immunoreactivity in HCC vasculature with the tumorous architecture, we identified four vascular patterns (named from 'a' to 'd'). Each of them was characterised by different expressions of TGF\u03b21 and IGF1R mRNA. Pattern a showed CD34-positive/Nestin-negative sinusoids, and was prevalent in microtrabecular lesions. Pattern b showed similar morphology and architecture as pattern a, but with Nestin-positive sinusoids and a significant 'boost' in IGF1R and TGF\u03b21 mRNAs. In patterns c and d a progressive sinusoid loss and a gain of newly formed arterioles were seen. Notably, HCCs with pattern a arose more frequently in cirrhosis (p=0.024), and showed lower incidence of microvascular invasion (p=0.002) and infiltration (p=0.005) compared with HCCs with other patterns.\nAlthough future studies are surely required, the identification of different vascular profiles in HCCs from cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic livers may help clarify the relationship between HCC progression and aggressiveness.", "journal": "Journal of clinical pathology", "date": "2015-08-06", "authors": ["FrancescoVasuri", "SilviaFittipaldi", "FrancescaGiunchi", "MelissaMonica", "MatteoRavaioli", "AlessioDegiovanni", "SoniaBonora", "RitaGolfieri", "LuigiBolondi", "Walter FGrigioni", "GianandreaPasquinelli", "AntoniaD'Errico-Grigioni"], "doi": "10.1136/jclinpath-2015-203028"}

Two months after surgery, the grafted fatty tissues were harvested for histopathological and biochemical analyses.\nThe results showed that 2 months postoperatively, fat grafts of the DMSO-C and DMSO-IP groups weighed significantly more than the grafts of the control group. Moreover, the vascularity of the grafts was higher in the DMSO-C group than in the control group, and no significant difference was found between the two DMSO groups. The mean lipid peroxidation levels were the same in the three groups, but myeloperoxidation was significantly lower in the DMSO-C group than in the other two groups.\nThe study results showed that cutaneous rather than intraperitoneal DMSO administration could preserve the quality and volume of transplanted fat tissue in rats by enhancing vascularity and decreasing inflammation.", "journal": "Aesthetic surgery journal", "date": "2015-08-06", "authors": ["ElifSari", "BulentBakar", "BahramSarkarati", "OnderBozdogan", "TarikCavusoglu"], "doi": "10.1093/asj/sjv119"}

This review surveys recent evidence for and remaining uncertainties regarding a role of neovascularization in atherosclerotic plaque progression. Specific emphasis is given to hypoxia, angiogenesis inhibition, and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT).\nImmunohistochemical and imaging studies showed a strong association between hypoxia, inflammation and neovascularization, and the progression of the atherosclerotic plaque both in humans and mice. Whereas in humans, a profound invasion of microvessels from the adventitia into the plaque occurs, neovascularization in mice is found mainly (peri)adventitially. Influencing neovascularization in mice affected plaque progression, possibly by improving vessel perfusion, but supportive clinical data are not available. Whereas plaque neovascularization contributes to monocyte/macrophage accumulation in the plaque, lymphangiogenesis may facilitate egress of cells and waste products. A specific role for PVAT and its secreted factors is anticipated and wait further clinical evaluation.\nHypoxia, inflammation, and plaque neovascularization are associated with plaque progression as underpinned by recent imaging data in humans.

The present study was designed to augment the cardiogenic potential of cardiac c-Kit+ cells through class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition and evaluate their therapeutic potency in the chronic heart failure (CHF) animal model. Myocardial infarction (MI) was created by coronary artery occlusion in rats. c-Kit+ cells were treated with mocetinostat (MOCE), a specific class I HDAC inhibitor. At 3 weeks after MI, CHF animals were retrogradely infused with untreated (control) or MOCE-treated c-Kit+ cells (MOCE/c-Kit+ cells) and evaluated at 3 weeks after cell infusion. We found that class I HDAC inhibition in c-Kit+ cells elevated the level of acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) and increased AcH3 levels in the promoter regions of pluripotent and cardiac-specific genes. Epigenetic changes were accompanied by increased expression of cardiac-specific markers. Transplantation of CHF rats with either control or MOCE/c-Kit+ cells resulted in an improvement in cardiac function, retardation of CHF remodeling made evident by increased vascularization and scar size, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy reduction. Compared with CHF infused with control cells, infusion of MOCE/c-Kit+ cells resulted in a further reduction in left ventricle end-diastolic pressure and total collagen and an increase in interleukin-6 expression. The low engraftment of infused cells suggests that paracrine effects might account for the beneficial effects of c-Kit+ cells in CHF. In conclusion, selective inhibition of class I HDACs induced expression of cardiac markers in c-Kit+ cells and partially augmented the efficacy of these cells for CHF repair.\nThe study has shown that selective class 1 histone deacetylase inhibition is sufficient to redirect c-Kit+ cells toward a cardiac fate.

Strips from 10 ovaries were cryopreserved, 5 by vitrification (V), and 5 by slow-freezing (SF). Pieces of fresh ovarian tissue were used for controls. After 1 month, the strips were autografted to two different vascular beds, healed (HB) or freshly decorticated (FDB), constituting four study groups: SF-HB, SF-FDB, V-HB, and V-FDB. These were compared to fresh tissue. After 6 months, the ovaries were removed and several parameters analyzed: follicle quality, stage, density, proliferation, apoptosis, functionality, vascularization, and fibrosis. Mixed effect linear regression models were built to assess the impact of cryopreservation and vascular bed preparation on ovarian tissue viability and functionality. p values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, and q values < 0.20 were considered significant in order to achieve a 20% false discovery rate.\nCompared to fresh tissue, no difference was observed in the percentage of morphologically normal follicles, while a significant increase was noted in the follicle proliferation rate (41%, q = 0.19), percentage of antral follicles (12%, q = 0.14), and number of vessels per area (3.3 times, q = 0.07) in the V-FDB group.\nVitrification associated with FDB vascular bed preparation is the best combination to obtain functional autografted ovarian tissue. Further studies are nevertheless required, with confirmed pregnancies and live births before introducing the procedure into clinical practice.", "journal": "Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics", "date": "2015-08-05", "authors": ["M MDolmans", "M MBinda", "SJacobs", "J PDehoux", "J LSquifflet", "JAmbroise", "JDonnez", "C AAmorim"], "doi": "10.1007/s10815-015-0542-y\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.030\n10.1038/nrendo.2013.205\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61261-7\n10.1073/pnas.1312830110\n10.1093/humrep/deu353\n10.5694/mja12.11768\n10.1111/aogs.12568\n10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60198-2\n10.1093/humrep/dep289\n10.1007/s10815-012-9757-3\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.04.048\n10.1016/S1472-6483(10)60303-3\n10.1093/humrep/des088\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.08.062\n10.1093/humrep/dep079\n10.1016/j.rbmo.2011.04.005\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.11.016\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.11.046\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.07.1109\n10.1093/humrep/det103\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.05.012\n10.1002/ajp.22281\n10.1177/0192623308327412\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17222-X\n10.1093/humupd/dml032\n10.1016/S0093-691X(00)00269-7\n10.1093/humrep/deq131\n10.1016/S0303-7207(00)00220-3\n10.1097/GCO.0000000000000171\n10.1530/REP-07-0131\n10.1007/s10815-011-9672-z\n10.1093/molehr/gar082\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0204\n10.1093/humrep/des178\n10.1093/humrep/des013"}

{"title": "Depot-Based Delivery Systems for Pro-Angiogenic Peptides: A Review.", "abstract": "Insufficient vascularization currently limits the size and complexity for all tissue engineering approaches. Additionally, increasing or re-initiating blood flow is the first step toward restoration of ischemic tissue homeostasis. However, no FDA-approved pro-angiogenic treatments exist, despite the many pre-clinical approaches that have been developed. The relatively small size of peptides gives advantages over protein-based treatments, specifically with respect to synthesis and stability. While many pro-angiogenic peptides have been identified and shown promising results in vitro and in vivo, the majority of biomaterials developed for pro-angiogenic drug delivery focus on protein delivery. This narrow focus limits pro-angiogenic therapeutics as peptides, similar to proteins, suffer from poor pharmacokinetics in vivo, necessitating the development of controlled release systems. This review discusses pro-angiogenic peptides and the biomaterials delivery systems that have been developed, or that could easily be adapted for peptide delivery, with a particular focus on

These barriers are essential not only for the protection of the brain, but also in regulating the exchange of cells and molecules in and out of the brain. The choroid plexus (CP) epithelial cells and the arachnoid membrane form the BCSFB. The CP is structurally divided into two independent compartments: one formed by a unique and continuous line of epithelial cells that rest upon a basal lamina; and, a second consisting of a central core formed by connective and highly vascularized tissue populated by diverse cell types (fibroblasts, macrophages and dendritic cells). Here, we review how the CP transcriptome and secretome vary depending on the nature and duration of the stimuli to which the CP is exposed. Specifically, when the peripheral stimulation is acute the CP response is rapid, strong and transient, whereas if the stimulation is sustained in time the CP response persists but it is weaker. Furthermore, not all of the epithelium responds at the same time to peripheral stimulation, suggesting the existence of a synchrony system between individual CP epithelial cells.", "journal": "Frontiers in cellular neuroscience", "date": "2015-08-04", "authors": ["FernandaMarques", "Jo\u00e3o CSousa"], "doi": "10.3389/fncel.2015.00136\n10.1007/s10571-004-1374-y\n10.1126/science.1252945\n10.1016/j.bbi.2013.04.002\n10.1111/j.1600-065x.2006.00435.x\n10.1016/j.brainres.2012.06.046\n10.1186/2045-8118-8-4\n10.1371/journal.pone.0083345\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04658.x\n10.1016/j.coi.2007.08.004\n10.1023/A:1006995910836\n10.1093/brain/awt259\n10.3389/fncel.2012.00033\n10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600557\n10.1038/jcbfm.2009.15\n10.1186/1471-2202-10-135\n10.1016/0165-5728(92)90131-4\n10.1007/s00441-003-0779-0\n10.2174/1566524013666131118113410\n10.1007/978-1-62703-125-7_2\n10.1002/glia.20373\n10.1007/s11481-006-9025-3\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060199\n10.1038/ni.1716\n10.1016/j.jaci.2007.08.046\n10.1186/1742-2094-9-187\n10.1038/nature13437\n10.1189/jlb.0207096\n10.1016/j.immuni.2013.02.012\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2006.03.015\n10.1002/1097-0029(20010101)52:1<49::aid-jemt7>3.0.co;2-c\n10.1186/1743-8454-4-11\n10.1038/jcbfm.2011.111\n10.1038/jcbfm.2009.71\n10.3389/fnhum.2014.00238\n10.1016/s0165-0173(03)00177-2"}
{"title": "Animal models in surgical lymphedema research--a systematic review.", "abstract": "Chronic secondary lymphedema is a well-known complication in oncologic surgery. Autologous lymph node transplantation, lymphovenous anastomosis, and other lymphatic surgeries have been developed in the last decades with rising clinical application. Animal models to explore the pathophysiology of lymphedema and microsurgical interventions have reached great popularity, although the induction of stable lymphedema in animals is still challenging. The aim of this review was to systematically assess lymphedema animal models and their potential use to study surgical interventions.\nA systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed without time or language restriction. Studies describing new or partially new models were included in chronological order.

{"title": "Does autogenous bone graft work? A logistic regression analysis of data from 159 papers in the foot and ankle literature.", "abstract": "While autogenous cancellous iliac crest bone graft is the gold standard for foot and ankle surgery, it lacks Level I evidence. Although one third of all graft cases performed in the United States today rely on allograft, some surgeons believe no graft is necessary. We hypothesized that a systematic review of the foot and ankle literature would reveal that (1) autogenous bone graft during foot and ankle arthrodesis would demonstrate healing rates that were superior to the use of either using allograft or no bone graft at all, and (2) these differences would be even more dramatic in patients having risk factors that impair bone healing. To our knowledge, neither of these assessments to date has ever been performed with this body of literature. The goal of this study was to review the use and union rates of bone graft during foot and ankle arthrodesis and determine if autogenous bone graft was superior.\nA literature search was performed to include articles between 1959 and 2012 using autograft, allograft, and/or no bone graft for foot and/or ankle arthrodesis. Case reports involving fewer than four patients, investigations failing to incorporate outcome data, those involving orthobiologic augmentation, and those including vascularized graft, xenograft, or pediatric patients were excluded. Recorded search results included patient demographics, comorbidities, pre-operative diagnosis, surgical procedure, bone graft type and indication, union rate, method of fixation, patient satisfaction, all outcome scores, definition of healing/success, and any listed complications including revision. Final data were stratified based upon the type of graft material.\nThis search generated 953 related articles, of which 159 studies (5327 patients) met inclusion criteria. The majority (153/159) were retrospective case series. Systematic review demonstrated a trend toward higher union rates for cancellous autograft (OR 1.39, p=0.11), structural autograft (OR 1.52, p=0.09), and cancellous allograft (OR 1.31, p=0.52) relative to no graft material, but none reached statistical significance. Compared to no graft, structural allograft trended toward worse performance (OR 0.62, p=0.17). The overall probability of union was 93.7% for cancellous autograft, 94.2% for structural autograft, 93.3% for cancellous allograft, 91.4% for no graft, and 86.9% for structural allograft. When only comparing the 19 papers that included a no graft arm (91.9% union rate), data revealed the highest union using cancellous autograft (95.1%, OR 1.73, p=0.09) and structural autograft (96.3%, OR 2.33, p=0.06) while only 76% for structural allograft. No significant statistical association existed between union rates and other recorded variables.\nSystematic analysis of bone graft use in foot and ankle fusions favors the use of autograft and cancellous allograft for optimized healing rates, although no differences were statistically significant. If we assume that graft material been chosen for more complex procedures having lower anticipated union rates, then these data lend further support to the use of autograft and cancellous allograft.\nLevel IV.", "journal": "Foot and ankle surgery : official journal of the European Society of Foot and Ankle Surgeons", "date": "2015-08-04", "authors": ["Craig RLareau", "Matthew EDeren", "AmandaFantry", "Rafe M JDonahue", "Christopher WDiGiovanni"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fas.2015.03.008"}

Their frontoparietal is a distinctive skeletal element which has served as a basis for establishing the genus Albionbatrachus. Because little was known about developmental and individual variation of the frontoparietal, and its usefulness in delimiting genera and species has sometimes been doubted, we investigate its structure in Palaeobatrachus and Albionbatrachus by means of X-ray high resolution computer tomography (micro-CT). To infer the scope of variation present in the fossil specimens, we also examined developmental and interspecific variation in extant Xenopus. In adults of extinct taxa, the internal structure of the frontoparietal bone consists of a superficial and a basal layer of compact bone, with a middle layer of cancellous bone between them, much as in early amphibians. In Albionbatrachus, the layer of cancellous bone, consisting of small and large cavities, was connected with the dorsal, sculptured surface of the bone by a system of narrow canals; in Palaeobatrachus, the layer of cancellous bone and the canals connecting this layer with the dorsal surface of the frontoparietal were reduced. The situation in Palaeobatrachus robustus from the lower Miocene of France is intermediate-while external features support assignment to Palaeobatrachus, the inner structure is similar to that in Albionbatrachus. It may be hypothesized that sculptured frontoparietals with a well-developed layer of cancellous (i.e., vascularized) bone may indicate adaptation to a more terrestrial way of life, whereas a reduced cancellous layer might indicate a permanent water dweller.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2015-08-04", "authors": ["Zbyn\u011bkRo\u010dek", "RenaudBoistel", "NicolasLenoir", "ArnaudMazurier", "Stephanie EPierce", "Jean-ClaudeRage", "Sergei VSmirnov", "Achim HSchwermann", "XavierValentin", "M\u00e1rtonVenczel", "MichaelWuttke", "Tom\u00e1\u0161Zikmund"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.23203"}
{"title": "Intramedullary hemangioblastomas: surgical results in 16 patients.", "abstract": "OBJECT Hemangioblastomas are rare, benign, highly vascularized tumors that can be found throughout the neuraxis but are mainly located in the cerebellum and in the spinal cord. Spinal hemangioblastomas can present with motor and sensory deficits, whose severity varies according to the size and location of the tumor. Resection is the best treatment option to avoid neurological deterioration. The authors report surgical results in the treatment of intramedullary hemangioblastomas and discuss the technical nuances important to achieving total resection without adding new deficits. METHODS A consecutive series of patients with intramedullary hemangioblastomas operated on between 2000 and 2014 by the senior author (H.T.) is presented. The functional scale proposed by McCormick was used to evaluate the patients' neurological status before and after surgery. RESULTS Sixteen patients were included in the study and underwent 17 surgeries. Follow-up was at least 6 months. Age at presentation varied from 13 to 58 years (mean 33.8 years). Ten patients (62.5%) were males and 6 patients (37.5%) were females. Seven (43.75%) of the 16 patients had associated von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, with hemangioblastomas also presenting in other locations. Three patients had multiple tumors in the same segment in the spinal cord, and 10 patients (62.5%) presented with cysts. According to the site of presentation, 11 tumors (68.75%) were localized at the cervical region (including the cervicomedullary junction) and 5 tumors (31.25%) at the thoracic level. Total resection was achieved in all cases, evidenced by postoperative MRI. Four patients had some functional worsening immediately after surgery. After 6 months, 1 patient had functional worsening compared with preoperative status, and 2 patients had clinical improvement. The majority of the patients remained clinically stable postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Adequate knowledge of anatomy and the correct use of microsurgical techniques allowed total resection of these tumors, with minimal morbidity and maximum functional recovery.

Surgery represents the standard therapy, with the goal of obtaining complete resection even at the risk of neurological morbidity. MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of intramedullary tumors. Nevertheless, sometimes MRI may not accurately differentiate between different types of intramedullary tumors, in particular if they are associated with syringes or intra- and peritumoral cysts. This could subsequently affect surgical strategies. Intraoperative ultrasound (ioUS) has become in the last few years a very useful tool for use during neurosurgical procedures. Various ioUS modalities such as B-mode and Doppler have been applied during neurosurgical procedures. On the other hand, the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is not yet well defined and standardized in this field. We report a case of a young patient harboring a cervicothoracic intramedullary tumor, for which the preoperative neuroradiologi-cal diagnosis was in favor of a diffuse astrocytoma with nodular components whereas ioUS demonstrated 3 distinct intramedullary nodules. CEUS showed highly vascularized lesions, compatible with hemangioblastomas. These findings, particularly those obtained with CEUS, allowed better definition of the lesions for diagnosis, enhanced understanding of the physiopathological aspects, and permitted the localization of all 3 nodules, thus limiting spinal cord manipulation and allowing complete resection of the lesions, with an uneventful postoperative neurological course.

{"title": "Treatment Of Sunitinib-Induced Hypertension In Solid Tumors By Nitric Oxid Donors.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR) are overexpressed in the majority of renal cell carcinomas (RCC). This characteristic has supported the rationale of targeting VEGF-driven tumour vascularization, especially in clear cell RCC. VEGF-inhibiting strategies include the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, axitinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib) and neutralizing antibodies such as bevacizumab. Hypertension (HT) is one of the most common adverse effects of angiogenesis inhibitors. Hypertension observed in clinical trials appears to correlate with the potency of VEGF kinase inhibitor against VEGFR-2: agents with higher potency are associated with a higher incidence of hypertension. Although the exact mechanism by TKIs induce hypertension has not yet been completely clarified, two key hypotheses have been postulated. First, some studies have pointed to a VEGF inhibitors-induced decrease in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production, that can result in vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. VEGF, mediated by PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathway, upregulates the endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme leading to up-regulation of NO production. So inhibition of signaling through the VEGF pathway would lead to a decrease in NO production, resulting in an increase in vascular resistance and blood pressure. Secondly a decrease in the number of microvascular endothelial cells and subsequent depletion of normal microvessel density (rarefaction) occurs upon VEGF signaling inhibition.", "journal": "Redox biology", "date": "2015-08-01", "authors": ["Lu\u00eds ALeon", "Lu\u00eds MAnt\u00f3n-Aparicio"], "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2015.09.036"}

Vasodilatory prostaglandins (PGs), including PGE2 and PGI2, regulate blood flow in peripheral tissues. PGs also stimulate angiogenesis by inducing vascular endothelial growth factor. However, PG levels are reduced in diabetes mainly due to enhanced degradation. We hypothesized that inhibition of the prostaglandin transporter (PGT) (SLCO2A1), which mediates the degradation of PGs, would increase blood flow and stimulate vascularization, thereby mitigating peripheral ischemia and accelerating wound healing in diabetes. Here we report that inhibiting PGT with intravenously injected PGT inhibitor, T26A, increased blood flow in ischemic hind limbs created in non-diabetic rats and streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Systemic, or combined with topical, T26A accelerated closure of cutaneous wounds. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that inhibition of PGT enhanced vascularization (marked by larger numbers of vessels formed by CD34+ cells), and accelerated re-epithelialization of cutaneous wounds. In cultured primary human bone marrow CD34+ cells and human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) either inhibiting or silencing PGT increased migration in both cell lines. Thus PGT directly regulates mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and HEKs, which could contribute to PGT-mediated vascularization and re-epithelialization. At the molecular level, systemic inhibition of PGT raised circulating PGE2. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PGT modulates arterial blood flow, mobilization of EPCs and HEKs, and vascularization and epithelialization in wound healing by regulating vasodilatory and pro-angiogenic PGs.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-08-01", "authors": ["ZhongboLiu", "OuthiriaradjouBenard", "Mahrukh MSyeda", "Victor LSchuster", "YulingChi"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0133615\n10.1089/ars.2008.2121\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.03.012\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.862946\n10.1124/jpet.111.181354\n10.1124/jpet.111.181354\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.787754\n10.1016/j.jvs.2008.06.041\n10.1016/j.vph.2009.07.001\n10.1371/journal.pone.0017867\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2015.02.021\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2014.03.004\n10.1007/s11936-010-0076-7\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61249-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131735\n10.1530/JOE-12-0339\n10.1371/journal.pone.0097369"}

Currently, bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF antibody, is trailed in retinopathy of prematurity, a vasoproliferative retinal disorder in premature infants. However, the risks of systemic complications after intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF antibody in infants are not well understood. In this study, we show that intravitreally injected anti-VEGF antibody is transported into the systemic circulation into the periphery where it reduces brown fat in neonatal C57BL/6 mice. A considerable amount of anti-VEGF antibody was detected in serum after intravitreal injection. Furthermore, in interscapular brown adipose tissue, we found lipid droplet accumulation, decreased VEGF levels, loss of vascular network, and decreased expression of mitochondria-related genes, Ppargc1a and Ucp1, all of which are characteristics of \"whitening\" of brown fat. With increasing age and body weight, brown fat restored its morphology and vascularity. Our results show that there is a transient, but significant impact of intravitreally administered anti-VEGF antibody on brown adipose tissue in neonatal mice. We suggest that more attention should be focused on the metabolic and developmental significance of brown adipose tissue in bevacizumab treated retinopathy of prematurity infants.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-08-01", "authors": ["Dong HyunJo", "Sung WookPark", "Chang SikCho", "Michael BPowner", "Jin HyoungKim", "MarcusFruttiger", "Jeong HunKim"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0134308\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.06.006\n10.1007/s12272-013-0324-y\n10.1056/NEJMoa1007374\n10.1016/j.jaapos.2011.11.002\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60178-6\n10.1056/NEJMoa1102673\n10.1111/j.1651-2227.2011.02445.x\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2014.05.015\n10.1016/j.survophthal.2010.08.006\n10.1167/iovs.13-12574\n10.1096/fj.12-221812\n10.1172/JCI71643\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00243.x\n10.1016/j.jaapos.2009.12.002\n10.1167/iovs.09-4140\n10.1167/iovs.09-4425\n10.1097/IAE.0b013e3181e46ad8\n10.1016/j.ajo.2011.07.005\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1419\n10.1016/j.molmet.2014.03.010\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.12.010\n10.1016/j.cmet.2008.11.009\n10.2337/db11-0832\n10.1172/JCI78362\n10.1016/j.cmet.2014.07.025"}

The coeliac artery emitted the splenic, left gastric and hepatic arteries. The splenic artery directed towards the spleen, and the right ruminal artery, which is its only collateral directed towards the stomach, being the main artery of the rumen. The left gastric artery gave origin to the left ruminal, the reticular and the left gastroepiploic arteries. The left gastroepiploic artery originated the reticular accessory artery. Both arteries, gastric and left gastroepiploic, anastomosed their right counterparts derived from the hepatic artery on the curvatures of the abomasum. The cranial mesenteric artery irrigated the second half of the duodenum until the beginning of the descending colon. The thickest branch emitted by the cranial mesenteric artery was the ileocolic artery, which was destined to the ascending colon, caecum and ileum. The colic branches and the right colic arteries were irradiated on the right surface of the spiral loop of the ascending colon and distributed to both centripetal and centrifugal coils of the ascending colon; the colic branches were also anastomosed with the last jejunals and ileals and with the right colic arteries. There were no variations in the origin of any of the main branches derived from the coeliac and cranial mesenteric arteries.

It is aimed at in vivo imaging of large field-of-view, deep-tissue studies of vascular structures. Based on simple geometric modelling of the object-of-interest, a distortion function is directly estimated from the image volume by deconvolution analysis. Such distortion function is then applied to subvolumes of the image stack to adaptively adjust for spatially varying distortion and reduce the image blurring through blind deconvolution. The proposed technique was first evaluated in phantom imaging of fluorescent microspheres that are comparable in size to the underlying capillary vascular structures. The effectiveness of restoring three-dimensional (3D) spherical geometry of the microspheres using the estimated distortion function was compared with empirically measured point-spread function. Next, the proposed approach was applied to in vivo vascular imaging of mouse skeletal muscle to reduce the image distortion of the capillary structures. We show that the proposed method effectively improve the image quality and reduce spatially varying distortion that occurs in large field-of-view deep-tissue vascular dataset.

{"title": "Efficacy of Multilayered Hepatocyte Sheet Transplantation for Radiation-Induced Liver Damage and Partial Hepatectomy in a Rat Model.", "abstract": "Although cell sheet technology has recently been developed for use in both animal experiments and in the clinical setting, it remains unclear whether transplanted hepatocyte sheets improve the liver function in vivo. Radiation-induced liver damage (RILD) combined with partial hepatectomy (PH) has been reported to suppress the proliferation of host hepatocytes and induce critical liver failure. The aim of this study was to improve the liver function in the above-mentioned diseased rat model (RILD\u2009+\u2009PH) using multilayered hepatocyte sheet transplantation. In this study, we used Fischer rats as a donor for primary hepatocytes and dermal fibroblast isolation. Cocultured multilayered hepatocyte sheets were generated by disseminating hepatocytes onto fibroblasts cultured beforehand on temperature-responsive culture dishes. Four cell sheets were transplanted into the recipient rats subcutaneously. Prior to transplantation, RILD (50 Gy) with 2/3PH was induced in the recipients. The same model was applied in the control group without transplantation. The serum was collected each week. The rats in both groups were sacrificed at 2 months after transplantation for the histological analysis. Consequently, the serum albumin concentrations were significantly higher in the transplant group than in the control group (54.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6 vs. 32.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7 mg/ml; p\u2009<\u20090.01) after 2 months and comparable to the serum albumin levels in the normal rats (58.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4 mg/ml). In addition, treatment with the transplanted sheets significantly improved the survival rate (57% vs. 22%, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and the hepatocyte sheets showed the storage of albumin, glycogen, and bile canaliculus structures. Some hepatocytes and fibroblasts were positive for Ki-67, and vascularization was observed around the cell sheets. Transplanted multilayered hepatocyte sheets can survive with additional proliferative activity, thereby maintaining the liver function in vivo for at least 2 months, providing metabolic support for rats with RILD.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2015-08-01", "authors": ["ZhassulanBaimakhanov", "KoshoYamanouchi", "YusukeSakai", "MakikoKoike", "AkihikoSoyama", "MasaakiHidaka", "MitsuhisaTakatsuki", "FumihikoFujita", "KengoKanetaka", "TamotsuKuroki", "SusumuEguchi"], "doi": "10.3727/096368915X688669"}

Each eye was treated with at least three doses of ranibizumab at monthly intervals. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), anterior segment findings, intraocular pressure, and fundus examination results were evaluated during control visits. Color fundus photography, fundus fluorescein angiographies, fundus autofluorescence, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images were obtained. The height of pigment epithelial detachment (PED) was measured by SD-OCT.\nTwelve eyes with RPE tears were studied. Nine eyes (75%) developed RPE tears during ranibizumab injections for choroidal neovascularization (eight eyes with vascularized PED and one eye with choroidal osteoma), and tears occurred in three eyes before any injections. The median number of ranibizumab injections after diagnosis of RPE tears was 3 (min 2, max 5). In the most recent follow-up visit, there was no statistically significant correlation between the grade of RPE and logMAR of BCVA (p>0.05, r=0.112). Eight of twelve eyes had PED, and seven of these had irregular PED contours before injection therapy. The mean PED height was 447 \u00b1 122 \u00b5m.\nIn this series, RPE tears developed mostly after intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for vascularized PED.

{"title": "Tumor Stroma, Tumor Blood Vessels, and Antiangiogenesis Therapy.", "abstract": "Solid tumors generally require a vascularized connective tissue stroma if they are to grow beyond minimal size. They generate that stroma in part by secreting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent vascular permeability and angiogenic factor. Increased vascular permeability leads to deposition of a provisional fibrin stroma, which supports tumor, connective tissue, and inflammatory cell migration and plays an active role in the formation of mature vascularized stroma. Vascular endothelial growth factor-induced tumor blood vessels are heterogeneous, of at least 6 distinct types, and develop linearly over time. They include both angiogenic (mother vessels, glomeruloid microvascular proliferations, vascular malformations, capillaries) and arteriovenogenic (feeding arteries, draining veins) blood vessels. Attacking the tumor vasculature with drugs that target VEGF or its receptors (VEGFR) has come into vogue but has been less effective than had been hope for. One reason for this is that anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapy attacks only a subset of tumor blood vessels, the earliest to form. New targets on late-forming blood vessels such as feeding arteries would be useful in helping antivascular cancer therapy fulfill its promise.", "journal": "Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)", "date": "2015-07-30", "authors": ["Harold FDvorak"], "doi": "10.1097/PPO.0000000000000124"}
{"title": "Use of Pedicled Trapezius Myocutaneous Flap for Posterior Skull Reconstruction.", "abstract": "Soft-tissue defects in posterior skull can be challenging for reconstruction. If related to tumor resection, these wound beds are generally irradiated and can be difficult from a recipient-vessel perspective for a free tissue transfer. Locoregional flaps might prove to be important reconstructive option in such patients. There is a very limited data on the usage of pedicled trapezius myocutaneous flaps for such defects.\nThe authors reviewed existing study for usage of trapezius flap for posterior skull repair and used pedicled trapezius myocutaneous flaps based on the descending branch of superficial cervical artery (SCA) for reconstruction of posterior skull soft-tissue defect in an irradiated and infected wound.\nTwo patients were operated for trapezius myocutaneous flap for posterior skull defects complicated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and epidural abscess. There was no recipient or donor-site complication at a mean follow-up of 12.5 months. Neither of the 2 patients had any functional deficits for the entire duration of the follow-up. Although this flap was able to help in controlling the CSF leakage in the first patient, it successfully healed the cavity generated from epidural abscess drainage in the second patient.\nThe large angle of rotation coupled with the ability to complete the procedure without repositioning the patients makes trapezius myocutaneous flap an attractive option for posterior skull reconstruction. In our limited experience, the pedicled trapezius flaps are a reliable alternative as they are well vascularized and able to obliterate the soft-tissue defect completely.

In such an operation, preserving the eyebrow is often a problem, and they suggest an approach in 2 stages, which allows us to both save the eyebrow and use the expander flap at the same time. In the last 6 years, they have performed 5 forehead expansions for total upper eyelid skin reconstruction, achieving very good aesthetic outcomes.\nFirstly, the authors measure the defect and choose an appropriate expander implant for the forehead. Secondly, they cut out the pathologically changed-turned red or scarred-skin to protect the eyebrow. Next they get out the tissue expander and use the tissue flap to repair the upper eyelid defect, while the eyebrow is under the expander flap, covered by skin, which they originally cut from the upper eyelid. Three weeks later they can cut down the pedicel and the flap becomes the new upper eyelid skin.\nThe authors find that the new upper eyelid skin may be vascularized by dermatological vessels from the expander flap. The forehead expander flap is reliable and particularly well suited for an upper eyelid, with numerous advantages. In this way, they make maximal use of the expander flap and no additional incision is needed.\nLevel IV, therapeutic study.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2015-07-30", "authors": ["HaidongLi", "SongTao", "ZhaoZhenmin"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000002008"}

Current study shows hNSSCs to display significant migration potential in the undifferentiated state and high responsiveness in the in vitro wound healing scratch assay.

CAMs transplanted with endothelial-differentiated hNSSCs displayed a higher number of blood vessels containing hNSSCs compared to CAMs transplanted with undifferentiated hNSSCs. Interestingly, undifferentiated hNSSCs showed a propensity to differentiate towards ectoderm with indication of epidermal formation with cells positive for CD1a, CK5/6, CK19, FXIIIa, and S-100 cells, which warrant further investigation.

When administered BMSCs following stroke, the neurological outcome was significantly improved relative to controls. There was an increase in the number of BMSCs labelled with BrdU present in the injured hemisphere of the brain compared to the non-injured side. Furthermore, administration of BMSCs also led to increases in astrocytosis, vascularization and endogenous proliferation.

Using an integrated morphometry approach to quantify intra-islet capillary density in human and mouse pancreatic sections, we found that human islets have five-fold fewer vessels per islet area than mouse islets. Islets in pancreatic sections from T2D subjects showed capillary thickening, some capillary fragmentation and had increased vessel density as compared with non-diabetic controls. These changes in islet vasculature in T2D islets appeared to be associated with amyloid deposition, which was noted in islets from 8/9 T2D subjects (and occupied 14% \u00b1 4% of islet area), especially around the intra-islet capillaries.

These blood vessels contain a series of properties, termed the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which distinguishes them from vasculature in other tissues, enabling CNS vessels to stringently regulate the transfer of ions, molecules and cells between the blood and the tissue. This barrier is critical to maintain brain homeostasis which allows for proper neuronal function and also to protect the tissue from injury and disease and many neurological diseases are associated with BBB dysfunction, including traumatic brain injuries, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the development of the BBB may lead to improved comprehension of the pathophysiology of these diseases, and further aid in the identification of targets to modulate the barrier to treat different neurological diseases. Many of the properties of the BBB are possessed by the endothelial cells that form the walls of the blood vessels but are acquired through a series of complex cellular interactions with the microenvironment throughout its development. We will review what is known about the induction and regulation of BBB properties during development.", "journal": "Mechanisms of development", "date": "2015-07-29", "authors": ["MarieBlanchette", "RichardDaneman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mod.2015.07.007"}
{"title": "Fibrinolysis is essential for fracture repair and prevention of heterotopic ossification.", "abstract": "Bone formation during fracture repair inevitably initiates within or around extravascular deposits of a fibrin-rich matrix. In addition to a central role in hemostasis, fibrin is thought to enhance bone repair by supporting inflammatory and mesenchymal progenitor egress into the zone of injury. However, given that a failure of efficient fibrin clearance can impede normal wound repair, the precise contribution of fibrin to bone fracture repair, whether supportive or detrimental, is unknown. Here, we employed mice with genetically and pharmacologically imposed deficits in the fibrin precursor fibrinogen and fibrin-degrading plasminogen to explore the hypothesis that fibrin is vital to the initiation of fracture repair, but impaired fibrin clearance results in derangements in bone fracture repair. In contrast to our hypothesis, fibrin was entirely dispensable for long-bone fracture repair, as healing fractures in fibrinogen-deficient mice were indistinguishable from those in control animals. However, failure to clear fibrin from the fracture site in plasminogen-deficient mice severely impaired fracture vascularization, precluded bone union, and resulted in robust heterotopic ossification. Pharmacological fibrinogen depletion in plasminogen-deficient animals restored a normal pattern of fracture repair and substantially limited heterotopic ossification. Fibrin is therefore not essential for fracture repair, but inefficient fibrinolysis decreases endochondral angiogenesis and ossification, thereby inhibiting fracture repair.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2015-07-28", "authors": ["MasatoYuasa", "Nicholas AMignemi", "Jeffry SNyman", "Craig LDuvall", "Herbert SSchwartz", "AtsushiOkawa", "ToshitakaYoshii", "GourabBhattacharjee", "ChenguangZhao", "Jesse EBible", "William TObremskey", "Matthew JFlick", "Jay LDegen", "Joey VBarnett", "Justin M MCates", "Jonathan GSchoenecker"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI80313\n10.1016/j.bone.2014.07.002\n10.1002/jcb.10435\n10.1073/pnas.1221602110\n10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0687\n10.1073/pnas.93.12.5899\n10.1038/nm0396-287\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81390-2\n10.1002/art.38639\n10.1111/os.12017\n10.1177/107110079401500202\n10.1016/j.exger.2006.09.008\n10.3113/FAI.2009.1042\n10.1016/j.injury.2013.10.042\n10.1136/bmj.1.6157.153\n10.1007/s11239-011-0593-6\n10.1161/hq0801.093667\n10.1016/j.devcel.2010.07.010\n10.1006/excr.1997.3512\n10.1007/s11420-009-9129-4\n10.1038/9467\n10.1038/9460\n10.1016/S8756-3282(01)00608-1\n10.1016/S0033-0620(03)00079-3\n10.1161/01.CIR.100.10.1134\n10.2337/dc10-0641\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.077487\n10.1016/j.jvs.2004.08.049\n10.1111/j.1365-2141.1959.tb04053.x\n10.1165/ajrcmb.15.2.8703482\n10.1002/jcp.1041570312\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.050372\n10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181d3cffe\n10.1002/jbmr.1921\n10.1359/jbmr.1999.14.6.946\n10.1016/j.bone.2008.07.004\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3010168\n10.1016/S0305-4179(01)00011-0\n10.1097/TA.0b013e31820f85a7\n10.1016/0049-3848(92)90178-D\n10.1083/jcb.200705127\n10.1101/gad.9.7.794\n10.1101/gad.9.16.2020\n10.1016/j.bone.2012.03.008\n10.1016/j.bone.2012.10.011\n10.1152/ajpheart.00928.2003\n10.1002/jbmr.1765\n10.1016/j.bone.2004.08.017\n10.1359/jbmr.2003.18.9.1584\n10.1074/jbc.272.18.11994\n10.1016/j.bone.2004.11.007\n10.1038/bonekey.2015.31"}

{"title": "Comparison of autologous versus allogeneic epithelial-like stem cell treatment in an in vivo equine skin wound model.", "abstract": "Several studies report beneficial effects of autologous and allogeneic stem cells on wound healing. However, no comparison between autologous versus allogeneic epithelial-like stem cells (EpSCs) has been made so far. For this reason, we first hypothesize that both EpSC types enhance wound healing in comparison to vehicle treatment and untreated controls. Second, on the basis of other studies, we hypothesized that there would be no difference between autologous and allogeneic EpSCs.\nTwelve full-thickness skin wounds were created in six horses. Each horse was subjected to (i) autologous EpSCs, (ii) allogeneic EpSCs, (iii) vehicle treatment or (iv) untreated control. Wound evaluation was performed at day 3, 7 and 14 through wound exudates and at week 1, 2 and 5 through biopsies.\nWound circumference and surface were significantly smaller in autologous EpSC-treated wounds. A significantly lower amount of total granulation tissue (overall) and higher vascularization (week 1) was observed after both EpSC treatments. Significantly more major histocompatibility complex II-positive and CD20-positive cells were noticed in EpSC-treated wounds at week 2. In autologous and allogeneic groups, the number of EpSCs in center biopsies was low after 1 week (11.7% and 6.1%), decreased to 7.6% and 1.7%, respectively (week 2), and became undetectable at week\u00a05.\nThese results confirm the first hypothesis and partially support the second hypothesis.

The effect of mechanical cues in guiding and stabilizing the vessels has begun to attract marked interest. This review surveys the impact of mechanical cues on formation of vascular networks in 2D and 3D gel matrices. We give less emphasis to regulation of endothelial monolayers and single endothelial cells. Several vascularization models have consistently found that the stress generated in the gel, and encountered by embedded cells, control various aspects of vascular network formation, including sprouting, branching, alignment, and vessel maturation. This internal stress is generated by cell contractile forces, and is balanced by gel stiffness and boundary constrains imposed on the gel. Actin and myosin II are key molecular players in controlling initiation of vessel sprouting and branching morphogenesis.

Various types of biomaterials with different physical and chemical properties have been developed to improve the localized delivery of growth factor and/or cells for therapeutic angiogenesis in ischemic tissues. Hydrogels are particularly advantageous as carrier systems because they are structurally similar to the tissue extracellular matrix (ECM), they can be processed under relatively mild conditions and can be delivered in a minimally invasive manner. Moreover, hydrogels can be designed to degrade in a timely fashion that coincides with the angiogenic process. For these reasons, hydrogels have shown great potential as pro-angiogenic matrices.

Although the vascular morphological changes following experimental vein occlusion have been described in a variety of models using angiography, the underlying cellular events are ill defined.\nWe here show that laser-induced experimental BRVO in mice leads to a wave of TUNEL-positive endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis in the upstream vascular network associated with a transient edema and hemorrhages. Subsequently, we observe an induction of EC proliferation within the dilated vein and capillaries, detected by EdU incorporation, and the edema resolves. However, the pericytes of the upstream capillaries are severely reduced, which was associated with continuing EC apoptosis and proliferation. The vascular remodeling was associated with increased expression of TGF\u03b2, TSP-1, but also FGF2 expression. Exposure of the experimental animals to hypoxia, when pericyte (PC) dropout had occurred, led to a dramatic increase in endothelial cell proliferation, confirming the vascular instability induced by the experimental BRVO.\nExperimental BRVO leads to acute endothelial cells apoptosis and increased permeability. Subsequently the upstream vascular network remains destabilized, characterized by pericyte dropout, un-physiologically high endothelial cells turnover and sensitivity to hypoxia.

{"title": "Contrast-enhanced ultrasound: clinical applications in patients with atherosclerosis.", "abstract": "Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is increasingly being used to evaluate patients with known or suspected atherosclerosis. The administration of a microbubble contrast agent in conjunction with ultrasound results in an improved image quality and provides information that cannot be assessed with standard B-mode ultrasound. CEUS is a high-resolution, noninvasive imaging modality, which is safe and may benefit patients with coronary, carotid, or aortic atherosclerosis. CEUS allows a reliable assessment of endocardial borders, left ventricular function, intracardiac thrombus and myocardial perfusion. CEUS results in an improved detection of carotid atherosclerosis, and allows assessment of high-risk plaque characteristics including intraplaque vascularization, and ulceration. CEUS provides real-time bedside information in patients with a suspected or known abdominal aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection.

The in vitro set evaluated ASCs' viability in the Gelfoam scaffold at different times of co-culturing (after 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h). The in vivo set used 20 12-week-old adult female Wistar rats. Frozen-thawed ovarian grafts were treated with ASCs delivered in Gelfoam scaffolds immediately after an autologous retroperitoneal transplant (ASCs-GS, n = 10). The controls received Gelfoam with a culture medium (GS, n = 10). Assessment of graft quality was conducted by vaginal smears (until euthanasia on the 30th postoperative day), histological analyses, follicular density, and viability and fibrosis. Immunohistochemical staining for VEGF-A expression, vascular network (vWF), apoptosis (caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)), cell proliferation (Ki-67), and hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) were performed.\nThe cells remained viable in Gelfoam for up to 120 h of co-culturing. The graft morphology was similar among the groups. ASC therapy promoted the earlier resumption of the estrous phase (GS 16.6 \u00b1 3 vs. ASCs-GS 12.8 \u00b1 1.3 days) and enhanced estrogen receptors compared with the controls (p < 0.05) without interfering with the quantity and viability of the ovarian follicles, fibrosis, endothelial cells, VEGF immunoexpression, apoptosis, or cell proliferation (p > 0.05).\nThe Gelfoam scaffold could be a feasible and safe non-invasive technique for ASC delivery in the treatment of frozen-thawed ovarian autografts.

The aim of this work was to study nerve sprouting and neovascularization in an acellular pericardial-derived scaffold used as a myocardial bioimplant. To this end, 17 swine were submitted to a myocardial infarction followed by implantation of a decellularized human pericardial-derived scaffold. After 30 days, animals were sacrificed and hearts were analyzed with hematoxylin/eosin and Masson's and Gallego's modified trichrome staining. Immunohistochemistry was carried out to detect nerve fibers within the cardiac bioimplant by using \u03b2III tubulin and S100 labeling. Isolectin B4, smooth muscle actin, CD31, von Willebrand factor, cardiac troponin I, and elastin antibodies were used to study scaffold vascularization. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to confirm the presence of vascular and nervous ultrastructures. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, end-diastolic wall mass, and infarct size were assessed by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Newly formed nerve fibers composed of several amyelinated axons as the afferent nerve endings of the heart were identified by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, neovessel formation occurred spontaneously as small and large isolectin B4-positive blood vessels within the scaffold. In summary, this study demonstrates for the first time the neoformation of vessels and nerves in cell-free cardiac scaffolds applied over infarcted tissue. Moreover, MRI analysis showed a significant improvement in LVEF (P = 0.03) and CO (P = 0.01) and a 43 % decrease in infarct size (P = 0.007).", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2015-07-25", "authors": ["CarolinaG\u00e1lvez-Mont\u00f3n", "M TeresaFernandez-Figueras", "Merc\u00e8Mart\u00ed", "CarolinaSoler-Botija", "SantiagoRoura", "IsaacPerea-Gil", "CristinaPrat-Vidal", "AidaLluci\u00e0-Valldeperas", "\u00c1ngelRaya", "AntoniBayes-Genis"], "doi": "10.1186/s13287-015-0101-6\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs364\n10.1016/j.recesp.2012.11.013\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071910-124701\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.04.181\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1047-2_17\n10.1016/j.biocel.2003.12.003\n10.1161/01.RES.0000039537.73816.E5\n10.1136/heartjnl-2014-306092\n10.1007/s12265-010-9202-x\n10.1002/jgm.513\n10.1007/s12265-010-9211-9\n10.2741/heizmann\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.09.107\n10.1111/febs.13062\n10.1002/jcp.21870\n10.1038/jp.2011.174\n10.2307/3428837"}
{"title": "TLR4 stimulation by LPS enhances angiogenesis in a co-culture system consisting of primary human osteoblasts and outgrowth endothelial cells.", "abstract": "The development of new approaches leading to fast and successful vascularization of tissue-engineered constructs is one of the most intensively studied subjects in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Recently, TLR4 activation and LPS stimulation of endothelial cells have been reported to promote angiogenesis in a variety of settings. In this study, we demonstrate that TLR4 activation by Ultrapure LPS Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (LPS-EB) significantly enhances microvessel formation in a co-culture system consisting of outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) and primary human osteoblasts (pOBs). The precise modes of TLR4 action on the process of angiogenesis have also been investigated in this study. Using quantitative fluorescence microscopy in monocultures of OECs and pOBs, it was found that TLR4 activation through LPS-EB upregulates the expression level of TLR4/MYD88 and enhances both angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Furthermore, ELISA and qRT-PCR have shown that the level of two adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and E-selectin), two cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) and two growth factors (VEGF and PDGF-BB) related to angiogenesis increase significantly after LPS-EB treatment. This increased understanding of the role of TLR4 in angiogenesis could be of value in various settings related to tissue repair and tissue engineering. Moreover, since LPS and TLR4 agonists improve angiogenesis and osteogenesis, TLR4 agonists (endogenous or synthetic) could be used for angiogenesis intervention in vivo and therefore could be tested for their potential clinical applications in promoting angiogenesis in bone tissue engineering.

Tracer diffusion properties were determined based on available literature. Blood activity and clearance over a four-hour period post-injection (p.i.) were derived from clinical dynamic PET scans of patients suffering from head and neck or bronchial cancer. Simulations were performed both for average patient blood activities and for individual patients, and image contrast between normoxic and hypoxic tissue areas was determined over this four-hour period p.i.\nOn average, HX4 showed a six-fold higher clearance than FMISO and an almost three-fold higher clearance than FAZA based on the clinical PET data. The absolute variation in clearance was significantly higher for HX4 than for FMISO (standard deviations of 5.75 *10-5 s-1 vs. 1.55 *10-5 s-1). The absolute tracer activity in these scans at four hours p.i. was highest for FMISO and lowest for HX4. Simulated contrast at four hours p.i. was highest for HX4 (2.39), while FMISO and FAZA were comparable (1.67 and 1.75, respectively). Variations in contrast of 7-11% were observed for each tracer depending on the vascularization patterns of the chosen tissue. Higher variations in clearance for HX4 resulted in an increased inter-patient variance in simulated contrast at four hours p.i.\nIn line with recent experimental and clinical data, the results suggest that HX4 is a promising new tracer that provides high image contrast four hours p.i., though inter-patient variance can be very high. Nevertheless, the widely used tracer FMISO provides a robust and reproducible signal four hours p.i., but with a lower contrast.

Therefore, evaluating the potential complications of cancer-related reconstructive surgical procedures such as NSM, both the distance of the tumoral lesion from the skin and the surgical incision site should be carefully considered. The preferred site of incision corresponds to the inframammary fold or possibly the periareolar area.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 113 patients who underwent NSM from January 2005 to October 2012 to evaluate skin complications.

{"title": "Monitoring therapeutic efficacy of sunitinib using [(18)F]FDG and [(18)F]FMISO PET in an immunocompetent model of luminal B (HER2-positive)-type mammary carcinoma.", "abstract": "Clinical studies implying the sunitinib multi-kinase inhibitor have led to disappointing results for breast cancer care but mostly focused on HER2-negative subtypes. Preclinical researches involving this drug mostly concern Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) murine models. Here, we explored the therapeutic efficacy of sunitinib on a PyMT-derived transplanted model classified as luminal B (HER2-positive) and monitored the response to treatment using both in vivo and ex vivo approaches.\nTumour-induced animals were treated for 9 (n = 7) or 14 (n = 8) days with sunitinib at 40 mg/kg or with vehicle only. Response to therapy was assessed in vivo by monitoring glucose tumour metabolism and hypoxia using 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) and [(18)F]fluoromisonidazole ([(18)F]FMISO) Positron Emission Tomography (PET). After primary tumour excision, ex vivo digital microscopy was performed on treated and control samples to estimate vascular density (CD31), apoptosis (Tunel), proliferation (Ki-67), Tumour-Associated Macrophage (TAM) infiltration (F4/80), metabolism (GLUT1) and cellular response to hypoxia (HIF1 alpha). The drug impact on the metastasis rate was evaluated by monitoring the PyMT gene expression in the lungs of the treated and control groups.\nConcomitant with sunitinib-induced tumour size regression, [(18)F]FDG PET imaging showed a stable glycolysis-related metabolism inside tumours undergoing treatment compared to an increased metabolism in untreated tumours, resulting at treatment end in 1.5 less [(18)F]FDG uptake in treated (n = 4) vs control (n = 3) tumours (p < 0.05). With this small sample, [(18)F]FMISO PET showed a non-significant decrease of hypoxia in treated vs control tumours. The drug triggered a 4.9 fold vascular volume regression (p < 0.05), as well as a 17.7 fold induction of tumour cell apoptosis (p < 0.001). The hypoxia induced factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) expression was twice lower in the treated group than in the control group (p < 0.05).

Computer simulations, expression studies and functional analyses in Aqp1 knockout mice demonstrated the critical role of the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) in water removal during peritoneal dialysis. Pharmacologic regulation of AQP1, either through increased expression or gating, is associated with increased water transport in rodent models of peritoneal dialysis. Water transport is impaired during acute peritonitis, despite unchanged expression of AQP1, resulting from the increased microvascular area that dissipates the osmotic gradient across the membrane. In long-term peritoneal dialysis patients, the fibrotic interstitium also impairs water transport, resulting in ultrafiltration failure. Recent data suggest that stroke and drug intoxications might benefit from peritoneal dialysis and could represent novel applications of peritoneal transport in the future.\nA better understanding of the regulation of osmotic water transport across the peritoneum offers novel insights into the role of water channels in microvascular endothelia, the functional importance of structural changes in the peritoneal interstitium and the transport of water and solutes across biological membranes in general.", "journal": "Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension", "date": "2015-07-22", "authors": ["JohannMorelle", "OlivierDevuyst"], "doi": "10.1097/MNH.0000000000000151"}

{"title": "A new approach to blood flow simulation in vascular networks.", "abstract": "A proper analysis of blood flow is contingent upon accurate modelling of the branching pattern and vascular geometry of the network of interest. It is challenging to reconstruct the entire vascular network of any organ experimentally, in particular the pulmonary vasculature, because of its very high number of vessels, complexity of the branching pattern and poor accessibility in vivo. The objective of our research is to develop an innovative approach for the reconstruction of the full pulmonary vascular tree from available morphometric data. Our method consists of the use of morphometric data on those parts of the pulmonary vascular tree that are too small to reconstruct by medical imaging methods. This method is a three-step technique that reconstructs the entire pulmonary arterial tree down to the capillary bed. Vessels greater than 2 mm are reconstructed from direct volume and surface analysis using contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Vessels smaller than 2 mm are reconstructed from available morphometric and distensibility data and rearranged by applying Murray's laws. Implementation of morphometric data to reconstruct the branching pattern and applying Murray's laws to every vessel bifurcation simultaneously leads to an accurate vascular tree reconstruction. The reconstruction algorithm generates full arterial tree topography down to the \ufb01rst capillary bifurcation. Geometry of each order of the vascular tree is generated separately to minimize the construction and simulation time. The node-to-node connectivity along with the diameter and length of every vessel segment is established and order numbers, according to the diameter-de\ufb01ned Strahler system, are assigned. In conclusion, the present model provides a morphological foundation for future analysis of blood flow in the pulmonary circulation.", "journal": "Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering", "date": "2015-07-22", "authors": ["HoumanTamaddon", "MehrdadBehnia", "MasudBehnia", "LeonardKritharides"], "doi": "10.1080/10255842.2015.1058926"}
{"title": "Isolation and Characterization of Multipotential Mesenchymal Stromal Cells from Congenital Pseudoarthrosis of the Tibia: Case Report.", "abstract": "Congenital pseudoarthrosis of the tibia (CPT) is an uncommon disease whose etiology and pathogenesis is unknown. Several evidences suggest that decreased osteogenic capacities, impaired local vascularization, and microenvironment alterations may play a role in the pathogenesis of CPT. Additionally, it is not clear if the pathogenesis of this disease is related to the absence of cells with osteogenic capacity of differentiation. In this work, a two-year-old patient diagnosed with CPT underwent an orthopedic surgery to promote bone union in a pseudoarthrosis lesion. Tissue from CPT lesion was excised, and histological evaluation and tissue culture were performed. Histologic analysis of the soft CPT lesion showed the presence of highly cellular fibrous tissue, vascularization, and abundant extracellular matrix. Fusiform cells of mesenchymal appearance were observed but osteoblasts, osteoclasts, chondrocytes, and adipose cells were not found. There was no evidence of osteogenesis. CPT tissue cultured as explants showed, after one month of culture, evidence of osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis. Cells isolated from explants of CPT tissue showed a fibroblast-like morphology and expressed the mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) markers: CD105, CD73, and CD90 (CPT-MSC). Functional analysis showed that CPT-MSC differentiate, in vitro, into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipocytic cells. CPT-MSC expressed osteocalcin and agrecan. CPT-MSC produced collagen in the presence of ascorbic acid. MSC from BM of normal individuals were used as control. In summary, our results indicate that CPT tissue contains MSC with osteogenic capacity of differentiation.

However, challenges, including poor tissue survival and a lack of efficient engraftment, must be overcome. An encapsulating or scaffolding material can act as a vehicle for agents carefully chosen for the islet transplant application. From open porous scaffolds to spherical capsules and conformal coatings, greater immune protection is often accompanied by greater distances to microvasculature. Generating a local oxygen supply from the implant material or encouraging vessel growth through the release of local factors can create an oxygenated engraftment site. Intricately related to the vascularization response, inflammatory interaction with the cell supporting implant is a long-standing hurdle to material-based islet transplant. Modulation of the immune responses to the islets as well as the material itself must be considered. To match the post-transplant complexity, the release rate can be tuned to orchestrate temporal responses. Material degradation properties can be utilized in passive approaches or external stimuli and biological cues in active approaches.

The device consists of four interconnected microtissue compartments (~0.1 mm(3)) arranged in a square. The top and bottom pairs of compartments can be sequentially loaded with discrete cellularized hydrogels creating the opportunity to investigate homotypic (left to right or x-direction) and heterotypic (top to bottom or y-direction) cell-cell communication. A controlled hydrostatic pressure difference across the tissue compartments in both x and y direction induces interstitial flow and modulates communication via soluble factors. To validate the biological significance of this novel platform, we examined the role of stromal cells in the process of vasculogenesis. Our device confirms previous observations that soluble mediators derived from normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) are necessary to form a vascular network derived from endothelial colony forming cell-derived endothelial cells (ECFC-ECs).

The fluorescently labeled nanobeacons reports on the interaction with the target as the fluorescent Cy3 signal is quenched by the gold nanoparticle and only emit light following conjugation to the Kras target owing to reorganization and opening of the nanobeacons, thus increasing the distance between the dye and the quencher. The systemic administration of the anti-Kras nanobeacons resulted in approximately 60% tumor size reduction and a 90% reduction in tumor vascularization.

{"title": "CD44 enhances tumor aggressiveness by promoting tumor cell plasticity.", "abstract": "Aggressive tumor cells can obtain the ability to transdifferentiate into cells with endothelial features and thus form vasculogenic networks. This phenomenon, called vasculogenic mimicry (VM), is associated with increased tumor malignancy and poor clinical outcome. To identify novel key molecules implicated in the process of vasculogenic mimicry, microarray analysis was performed to compare gene expression profiles of aggressive (VM+) and non-aggressive (VM-) cells derived from Ewing sarcoma and breast carcinoma. We identified the CD44/c-Met signaling cascade as heavily relevant for vasculogenic mimicry. CD44 was at the center of this cascade, and highly overexpressed in aggressive tumors. Both CD44 standard isoform and its splice variant CD44v6 were linked to increased aggressiveness in VM. Since VM is most abundant in Ewing sarcoma tumors functional analyses were performed in EW7 cells. Overexpression of CD44 allowed enhanced adhesion to its extracellular matrix ligand hyaluronic acid. CD44 expression also facilitated the formation of vasculogenic structures in vitro, as CD44 knockdown experiments repressed migration and vascular network formation. From these results and the observation that CD44 expression is associated with vasculogenic structures and blood lakes in human Ewing sarcoma tissues, we conclude that CD44 increases aggressiveness in tumors through the process of vasculogenic mimicry.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2015-07-21", "authors": ["Yvette W JPaulis", "Elisabeth J MHuijbers", "Daisy W Jvan der Schaft", "Patricia M M BSoetekouw", "PatrickPauwels", "Vivianne C GTjan-Heijnen", "Arjan WGriffioen"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.3839"}

The aim of this study was to assess by dynamic-susceptibility-contrast MRI (DSC-MRI) the effect of radiotherapy (RT) and Tipifarnib combination on tumor perfusion in GBM patients. Eighteen patients with newly diagnosed GBM, enrolled in a phase I-II clinical trial associating RT with Tipifarnib, underwent anatomical MR imaging and DSC-MRI before (M0) and two months after treatment (M2). Anatomic volumes of interest (VOIs) were delineated according to contrast-enhanced and hyper-intense signal areas on T1-Gd and T2 images, respectively. Perfusion variations between M0 and M2 were assessed with median relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) inside these VOIs. Another voxel by voxel analysis of CBV values classified 405,117 tumor voxels into High_, Normal_ and Low_CBVTUMOR according to the distribution of CBV in the contralateral normal tissue. These three categories of CBVTUMOR voxels were color-coded over anatomical MRI. Variations of median rCBV were significantly different for two groups of patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.013): rCBV decreased when initial rCBV was\u00a0\u2265\u00a01.0 (Group_rCBV_M0\u00a0>\u00a01) and rCBV increased when initial rCBV was\u00a0<\u00a01.0 (Group_rCBV_M0\u00a0<\u00a01). Mapping of color-coded voxels provided additional spatial and quantitative information about tumor perfusion: Group_rCBV_M0\u00a0>\u00a01 presented a significant decrease of High_CBVTUMOR volume (P\u00a0=\u00a00.015) simultaneously with a significant increase of Normal_CBVTUMOR volume (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009) after treatment. Group_rCBV_M0\u00a0<\u00a01 presented a decrease of Low_CBVTUMOR volume with an increase of Normal_ and High_CBV TUMOR volume after treatment.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 90 min followed by reperfusion for 3 days. Progesterone (8 mg/kg/day) was administered intraperitoneally at 1h after initial occlusion followed by subcutaneous injections at 6, 24 and 48 h post-occlusion. Rats were euthanized after 72 h and brain endothelial cell density and macrophage infiltration were evaluated within the cerebral cortex. We also assessed progesterone's ability to induce macrophage migration toward hypoxic/reoxygenated cultured endothelial cells. We found that progesterone treatment post-tMCAO protects ischemic endothelial cells from macrophage infiltration. We further demonstrate that infiltration of monocytes/macrophages can be induced by potent chemotactic factors such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and the chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), secreted by hypoxic/reoxygenated endothelial cells. Progesterone blunts secretion of MCP-1 and CXCL1 from endothelial cells after hypoxia/reoxygenation injury and decreases leukocyte infiltration.

To investigate the possible role of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in cutaneous wound healing of aged mice, we have applied the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1. The SkQ1 treatment resulted in accelerated resolution of the inflammatory phase, formation of granulation tissue, vascularization and epithelization of the wounds. The wounds of SkQ1-treated mice contained increased amount of myofibroblasts which produce extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors mediating granulation tissue formation. This effect resembled SkQ1-induced differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblast, observed earlierin vitro. The Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFb) produced by SkQ1-treated fibroblasts was found to stimulated motility of endothelial cells in vitro, an effect which may underlie pro-angiogenic action of SkQ1 in the wounds. In vitro experiments showed that SkQ1 prevented decomposition of VE-cadherin containing contacts and following increase in permeability of endothelial cells monolayer, induced by pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF. Prevention of excessive reaction of endothelium to the pro-inflammatory cytokine(s) might account for anti-inflammatory effect of SkQ1.

The objective of the present study was to analyze the endocrine profile, growth dynamics, and histologic characteristics of persistent ovarian follicles-cysts developing in response to long-term administration of intermediate levels of progesterone. To this end, after synchronization of cows, a low dose of progesterone was administered for 5, 10, and 15 days after the expected day of ovulation in treated cows (groups P5, P10, and P15, respectively), using an intravaginal progesterone-releasing device. A significant increase in diameter was detected on Day 11 of progesterone treatment and thereafter (P < 0.05), and at Day 15 of persistence, the diameter of the persistent follicle reached a mean of 23 \u00b1 0.6 mm. Microscopically, the persistent follicles had a complete granulosa, an intensely vascularized theca interna, and a collagenous theca externa layer. Temporal changes in the serum concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, and FSH were detected (effects of time, P < 0.01). Progesterone treatment completely inhibited the LH preovulatory surge in treated cows and affected the basal concentration of LH. The pulse frequency remained high at 5 and 10 days of persistence and declined (P < 0.05) after 15 days of persistence. The LH pulse concentration and pulse amplitude had a significant reduction (P < 0.05) during follicular persistence. Changes in the serum levels of estradiol, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and testosterone in serum and follicular fluid were also observed. In serum, estradiol increased gradually from proestrus to Day 10 of follicular persistence (P < 0.05), progesterone showed an increase (P < 0.05) at Day 5 of follicular persistence, 17-hydroxyprogesterone showed a significant decrease at 5 days of follicular persistence in relation to proestrus, and testosterone showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) from proestrus and Day 5 of persistence through Day 15 of follicular persistence. Correlation between serum and follicular fluid steroid concentrations was significant for testosterone (P < 0.0001) and not significant for estradiol and progesterone. These findings indicate that ovarian cysts in COD are similar in many ways to the persistent follicles induced by progesterone, with an analogous hormonal and morphologic context, thus confirming a local role of subluteal levels of progesterone in COD pathogenesis and in the regulatory mechanisms of the ovarian function.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2015-07-19", "authors": ["Pablo UD\u00edaz", "Mat\u00edas LStangaferro", "Natalia CGareis", "William JSilvia", "ValentinaMatiller", "Natalia RSalvetti", "FlorenciaRey", "Fabi\u00e1nBarberis", "LucianoCattaneo", "Hugo HOrtega"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.06.015"}

{"title": "Recurrent Metacarpal Enchondroma Treated With Strut Allograft: 14-year Follow-up.", "abstract": "Enchondroma of the hand is a common lesion with a recurrence rate of up to 13.3% after curettage and bone grafting. Pathologic fractures often occur. Although allograft bone chips are widely used in the surgical treatment of enchondroma, the use of structural allograft bone has not been reported before. This case report presents a recurrent enchondroma of the fifth metacarpal with pathologic fracture in a 13-year-old girl who had 2 previous interventions and 2 more interventions for other enchondromas in the same hand. These interventions consisted of curettage and autogenous iliac crest bone grafting. The metacarpal diaphysis was resected and reconstructed with an intercalary freeze-dried strut allograft fibular bone segment to avoid further donor graft site morbidity. At 14 years of follow-up, the patient had full range of motion of the hand, with no symptoms, and the allograft bone had been incorporated completely, with no recurrence of the tumor. With strut allograft bone, healing occurs by creeping substitution at its ends that is limited to a few millimeters. Limited vascularization also occurs on the allograft surface, leaving most of the allograft segment devoid of vascularity and leading to the complications seen in massive bone allografts. However, because of their thin cortices and decreased total volume, smaller bone allografts show higher rates of osteointegration and revascularization. In selected cases, a strut allograft bone may be considered a suitable material for long-term reconstruction of the hand after enchondroma excision, especially in young patients, who have increased healing potential compared with older patients.", "journal": "Orthopedics", "date": "2015-07-18", "authors": ["MerterYalcinkaya", "Yunus EmreAkman", "A ErdemBagatur"], "doi": "10.3928/01477447-20150701-92"}

The PFD liposomes showed the largest area under the curve for the lung. The high distribution of PFD achieved in the lungs using this liposomal formulation may be explained by physical entrapment of the liposomes in the vascular network of the lung.

A Review in the Theme: Cellular Responses to Hypoxia.", "abstract": "In recent years, the intestinal mucosa has proven to be an intriguing organ to study tissue oxygenation. The highly vascularized lamina propria juxtaposed to an anaerobic lumen containing trillions of metabolically active microbes results in one of the most austere tissue microenvironments in the body. Studies to date have determined that a healthy mucosa contains a steep oxygen gradient along the length of the intestine and from the lumen to the serosa. Advances in technology have allowed multiple independent measures and indicate that, in the healthy mucosa of the small and large intestine, the lumen-apposed epithelia experience Po2 conditions of <10 mmHg, so-called physiologic hypoxia. This unique physiology results from a combination of factors, including countercurrent exchange blood flow, fluctuating oxygen demands, epithelial metabolism, and oxygen diffusion into the lumen. Such conditions result in the activation of a number of hypoxia-related signaling processes, including stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor. Here, we review the principles of mucosal oxygen delivery, metabolism, and end-point functional responses that result from this unique oxygenation profile.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

After 4 days, MTX PCL implants were also introduced, and anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and antifibrogenic activities of the MTX were determined. MTX reduced the vascularization (hemoglobin content), the neutrophil, and monocyte/macrophage infiltration (MPO and NAG activities, respectively), and the collagen deposition in sponges. MTX reduced tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels, demonstrating its local antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and myelotoxicity, which could be induced by the drug, were evaluated. However, MTX did not promote toxicity to these organs, as the levels of AST and ALT (hepatic markers) and creatinine and urea (renal markers) were not increased, and the complete blood count was not decreased.

{"title": "Neurite Mistargeting and Inverse Order of Intraretinal Vascular Plexus Formation Precede Subretinal Vascularization in Vldlr Mutant Mice.", "abstract": "In the retina blood vessels are required to support a high metabolic rate, however, uncontrolled vascular growth can lead to impaired vision and blindness. Subretinal vascularization (SRV), one type of pathological vessel growth, occurs in retinal angiomatous proliferation and proliferative macular telangiectasia. In these diseases SRV originates from blood vessels within the retina. We use mice with a targeted disruption in the Vldl-receptor (Vldlr) gene as a model to study SRV with retinal origin. We find that Vldlr mRNA is strongly expressed in the neuroretina, and we observe both vascular and neuronal phenotypes in Vldlr-/- mice. Unexpectedly, horizontal cell (HC) neurites are mistargeted prior to SRV in this model, and the majority of vascular lesions are associated with mistargeted neurites. In Foxn4-/- mice, which lack HCs and display reduced amacrine cell (AC) numbers, we find severe defects in intraretinal capillary development. However, SRV is not suppressed in Foxn4-/-;Vldlr-/- mice, which reveals that mistargeted HC neurites are not required for vascular lesion formation. In the absence of VLDLR, the intraretinal capillary plexuses form in an inverse order compared to normal development, and subsequent to this early defect, vascular proliferation is increased. We conclude that SRV in the Vldlr-/- model is associated with mistargeted neurites and that SRV is preceded by altered retinal vascular development.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-07-16", "authors": ["VerityJohnson", "MengqingXiang", "ZheChen", "Harald JJunge"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0132013\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2006.01.001\n10.1001/archopht.125.6.795\n10.1074/jbc.M611289200\n10.1167/iovs.07-0870\n10.1016/j.mvr.2009.02.005\n10.1167/iovs.10-7082\n10.1371/journal.pone.0075186\n10.1172/JCI35977\n10.1167/iovs.10-6496\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016733\n10.1016/j.exer.2013.08.003\n10.1007/978-94-007-7687-6_1\n10.1167/iovs.05-0116\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-396846\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2012.04.003\n10.1242/dev.033175\n10.1016/j.neuron.2004.08.041\n10.1016/j.mcn.2011.02.004\n10.1093/hmg/ddl195\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4430-11.2011\n10.1093/hmg/dds398\n10.1038/nmeth.1573\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3135-11.2011\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0442-12.2012\n10.1007/s11427-013-4543-8\n10.1167/iovs.13-13196\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.188144\n10.1167/iovs.07-0051\n10.1016/j.exer.2011.07.017\n10.1002/syn.21674\n10.1093/hmg/ddi336\n10.1002/cne.21188\n10.1038/nn1320\n10.1007/s00018-012-1230-z\n10.1016/j.visres.2004.08.007\n10.1167/iovs.08-2447\n10.1038/nn.3772\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3580-11.2011\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.08.017\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0267-12.2012\n10.1167/iovs.10-7146\n10.1172/JCI70230\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.048S0092-8674(09)01042-3\n10.1167/iovs.08-1731\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.10.042\n10.7554/eLife.00324\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.10.022\n10.1101/cshperspect.a001875cshperspect.a001875"}
{"title": "Endothelial Network Formation Within Human Tissue-Engineered Skeletal Muscle.", "abstract": "The size of in vitro engineered skeletal muscle tissue is limited due to the lack of a vascular network in vitro. In this article, we report tissue-engineered skeletal muscle consisting of human aligned myofibers with interspersed endothelial networks. We extend our bioartificial muscle (BAM) model by coculturing human muscle progenitor cells with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a fibrin extracellular matrix (ECM). First, the optimal medium conditions for coculturing myoblasts with HUVECs were determined in a fusion assay. Endothelial growth medium proved to be the best compromise for the coculture, without affecting the myoblast fusion index. Second, both cell types were cocultured in a BAM maintained under tension to stimulate myofiber alignment. We then tested different total cell numbers containing 50% HUVECs and found that BAMs with a total cell number of 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6) resulted in well-aligned and densely packed myofibers while allowing for improved interspersed endothelial network formation. Third, we compared different myoblast-HUVEC ratios. Including higher numbers of myoblasts improved endothelial network formation at lower total cell density; however, improvement of network characteristics reached a plateau when 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6) or more myoblasts were present. Finally, addition of Matrigel to the fibrin ECM did not enhance overall myofiber and endothelial network formation. Therefore, in our BAM model, we suggest the use of a fibrin extracellular matrix containing 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6) cells of which 50-70% are muscle cells. Optimizing these coculture conditions allows for a physiologically more relevant muscle model and paves the way toward engineering of larger in vitro muscle constructs.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

VEGF165 presentation by HSPGs enhances VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) signaling. We investigated the effect of TG2, which binds to HSPGs, on the interaction between VEGF165 and HS and angiogenesis. Mice with tg2 deficiency showed transiently enhanced retina vessel formation and increased vascularization of VEGF165-containing Matrigel implants. In addition, endothelial cells in which TG2 was knocked down exhibited enhanced VEGF165-induced sprouting and migration, which was associated with increased phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Tyr(951) and its targets Src and Akt. TG2 knockdown did not affect the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Tyr(1175) or cell proliferation in response to VEGF165 and sprouting or signaling in response to VEGF121. Decreased phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Tyr(951) was due to ECM-localized TG2, which reduced the binding of VEGF165 to endothelial ECM in a manner that required its ability to bind to HS but not its catalytic activity. Surface plasmon resonance assays demonstrated that TG2 impeded the interaction between VEGF165 and HS.

M-HPC shares similar clinical manifestations and radiological findings with meningioma, which causes difficulty in differentiation of this entity from those prognostically favorable mimics prior to surgery. Treatment of M-HPC, particularly in metastatic settings, remains a challenge. A case is described of primary M-HPC with recurrence at the initial and distant intracranial sites and extraneural multiple-organ metastases in a 36-year-old female.

{"title": "Discrimination between two different grades of human glioma based on blood vessel infrared spectral imaging.", "abstract": "Gliomas are brain tumours classified into four grades with increasing malignancy from I to IV. The development and the progression of malignant glioma largely depend on the tumour vascularization. Due to their tissue heterogeneity, glioma cases can be difficult to classify into a specific grade using the gold standard of histological observation, hence the need to base classification on a quantitative and reliable analytical method for accurately grading the disease. Previous works focused specifically on vascularization study by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, proving this method to be a way forward to detect biochemical changes in the tumour tissue not detectable by visual techniques. In this project, we employed FTIR imaging using a focal plane array (FPA) detector and globar source to analyse large areas of glioma tumour tissue sections via molecular fingerprinting in view of helping to define markers of the tumour grade. Unsupervised multivariate analysis (hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis) of blood vessel spectral data, retrieved from the FPA images, revealed the fine structure of the borderline between two areas identified by a pathologist as grades III and IV. Spectroscopic indicators are found capable of discriminating different areas in the tumour tissue and are proposed as biomolecular markers for potential future use of grading gliomas.

We recently demonstrated that BBR and its synthetic derivative 13-(4-chlorophenylethyl)berberine iodide, NAX014, exert antiproliferative activity against HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, inducing apoptosis, modulating the expression of cell cycle checkpoint molecules involved in cell senescence, and reducing both HER2 expression and phosphorylation on tumor cells. In this study, we examined the anticancer properties of BBR and NAX014 in a transgenic mouse model which spontaneously develops HER2-positive mammary tumors. Repeated intraperitoneal injections of a safety dose (2.5mg/kg) of NAX014 delayed the development of tumors, reducing both the number and size of tumor masses. In vivo sidestream dark field videomicroscopy revealed a significant lower vessel density in mammary tumors from NAX014-treated mice in comparison with the control group. Immunohistochemical evaluation using CD34 antibody confirmed the reduced vessel density in NAX014 group. Statistically significant increase of senescence associated \u03b2-galactosidase and p16 expression, and reduced expression of heparanase were observed in tumors from NAX014-treated mice than in tumors from control animals. Finally, NAX014 treatment decreased the level of perforine and granzyme mRNA in mammary tumors. Berberine did not show any statistically significant modulation in comparison with control mice. The results of the present study indicate that NAX014 is more effective than BBR in exerting anticancer activity delaying the development of mammary tumors in mice transgenic for the HER-2/neu oncogene.

IL-22, a pro-inflammatory cytokine mediating a cross-talk between immune system and epithelial cells, has been shown to have a role in repair processes. In this study we aimed to investigate IL-22 regenerative potential in the poor healing context of diabetic wounds. By using streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, we demonstrated that IL-22 wound treatment significantly accelerated the healing process, by promoting re-epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and vascularization. Improved re-epithelialization was associated with increased keratinocyte proliferation and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation. We showed that endogenous IL-22 content was reduced at both mRNA and protein level during the inflammatory phase of diabetic wounds, with fewer IL-22-positive cells infiltrating the granulation tissue. We demonstrated that IL-22 treatment promoted proliferation and injury repair of hyperglycemic keratinocytes and induced activation of STAT3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase transduction pathways in keratinocytes grown in hyperglycemic condition or isolated from diabetic patients. Finally, we demonstrated that IL-22 treatment was able to inhibit diabetic keratinocyte differentiation while promoting vascular endothelial growth factor release.

In experiment 1, mature female llamas with a growing follicle of 7 mm or greater were assigned randomly to four groups (n = 7/group) and given 2 mg of purified SP-NGF in a volume of 2 mL by (1) intramuscular administration, (2) intravenous administration, and (3) intrauterine infusion, or (4) intrauterine infusion of 2 mL of PBS (negative control). Because ovulations were not detected after intrauterine infusion in experiment 1, a second experiment was done to determine if a higher dose of SP-NGF given by intrauterine infusion, similar to a natural dose during copulation, will elicit an ovulatory response. In experiment 2, llamas with a growing follicle of 7 mm or greater were assigned randomly to three groups (n = 6/per group) given an intrauterine infusion of (1) 4 mL of raw seminal plasma, (2) 4 mL of PBS containing 20 mg of purified llama SP-NGF, or 3) 4 mL of PBS (negative control). In both experiments, the ovaries were examined daily by transrectal ultrasonography using a B-mode scanner and power Doppler mode to detect ovulation and to monitor CL growth, regression, and vascularization. Blood samples were collected to determine plasma LH and progesterone concentrations. In experiment 1, only llamas treated by intramuscular or intravenous administration of SP-NGF ovulated (7 of 7 and 6 of 7, respectively). Plasma LH concentration did not differ between the intramuscular and intravenous SP-NGF-treated groups, nor did CL diameter, CL vascularization, or plasma progesterone concentration profiles. In experiment 2, the ovulation rate was 100% for llamas treated by intrauterine infusion of raw seminal plasma or llama SP-NFG, whereas no ovulations were detected in females treated with PBS. Plasma LH concentrations did not differ between groups that ovulated, nor did CL diameter, CL vascularization, or plasma progesterone concentration profiles. We conclude that \u03b2-NGF from llama seminal plasma origin elicits a preovulatory LH surge, followed by ovulation and the development of a functional CL, regardless of the route of administration.

Phosphatiosomes were the basis of a niosomal system containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) and distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine polyethylene glycol (DSPE-PEG). Rolipram was used as the model drug loaded in the phosphatiosomes. Bioimaging, biodistribution, activated neutrophil inhibition, and ALI treatment were performed to evaluate the feasibility of phosphatiosomes as the lung-targeting carriers. An encapsulation percentage of >90% was achieved for rolipram-loaded nanovesicles. The vesicle size and zeta potential of the phosphatiosomes were 154 nm and -34 mV, respectively. Real-time imaging in rats showed a delayed and lower uptake of phosphatiosomes by the liver and spleen. Ex vivo bioimaging demonstrated a high accumulation of phosphatiosomes in the lungs. In vivo biodistribution exhibited increased lung accumulation and reduced brain penetration of rolipram in phosphatiosomes relative to the control solution. Phosphatiosomes improved the lungs/brain ratio of the drug by more than 7-fold. Interaction with pulmonary lipoprotein surfactants and the subsequent aggregation may be the mechanisms for facilitating lung targeting by phosphatiosomes. Rolipram could continue to inhibit active neutrophils after inclusion in the nanovesicles by suppressing O2(-) generation and elevating cAMP. Phosphatiosomes significantly alleviated ALI in mice as revealed by examining their pulmonary appearance, edema, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and histopathology.

They not only produce the diverse neuronal and glial cell types in the brain, but also guide their migration in this process. Recent evidence indicates that neural progenitors also play a critical role in the development of the brain vascular network. At an early stage, neural progenitors have been found to facilitate the ingression of blood vessels from outside the neural tube, through VEGF and canonical Wnt signaling. Subsequently, neural progenitors directly communicate with endothelial cells to stabilize nascent brain vessels, in part through down-regulating Wnt pathway activity. Furthermore, neural progenitors promote nascent brain vessel integrity, through integrin \u03b1v\u03b28-dependent TGF\u03b2 signaling.

This study compared functional activity of human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (hMSC) seeded onto a porous salt-leached poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) scaffolds, with and without the incorporation of silk fibroin fibers and then further investigated their co-culture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cell viability, proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase activity were measured for a range of time points in culture, with osteogenic and angiogenic marker immunolocalization and gene expression at selected stages. Our findings suggest that, despite similar porosity and pore size distribution exhibited by the PDLLA and PDLLA plus silk fibroin scaffolds, there were marked differences in cell distribution and function. In the absence of fibers, a highly osteogenic response was observed in hMSCs in the scaffolds co-cultured with endothelial cells, greater than that observed with hMSCs alone or in either of the scaffolds with fibers added. However, fiber presence clearly better supported endothelial cell cultures, as determined by greater levels of endothelial marker expression at both the gene and protein level after 3 weeks of culture.

A subpopulation termed glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) has been directly related to aggressive invasion; nonetheless, their migratory characteristics and regulation by the microenvironment are still unknown. In this study, we developed a composite matrix of hyaluronan (HA) structurally supported by a collagen-oligomer fibril network to simulate the brain tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. Matrigel-coated microfibers were embedded within the matrix to create a tunable dual niche microenvironment that resembles the vascular network of the brain. This model was compared with the most commonly used in vitro three-dimensional (3D) culture formats, Matrigel and collagen type-I monomer matrices, to study how the mechanical and compositional properties of the ECM alter the migration characteristics of GSC neurospheres. The migration mode, distance, velocity, and morphology of the GSCs were monitored over a 72-h period. The cells altered their migration mode depending on the matrix composition, showing migration by expansive growth in Matrigel matrices, multicellular extension along rigid interfaces (as Matrigel glass and coated microfibers), and mesenchymal single-cell migration in collagen matrices. Velocity and distance of migration within each composition varied according to matrix mechanical properties. In the dual niche system, the presence of HA reduced velocity and number of migratory cells; however, cells that came in contact with the pseudovessels exhibited collective migration by an extensive strand and reached higher velocities than cells migrating individually across the 3D matrix. Our results show that GSCs adopt varied migration mechanisms to invade multiple ECM microenvironments, and the migration characteristics exhibited are highly influenced by the matrix physical properties. Moreover, GSC neurospheres exhibit concomitant single and collective migration as a function of the microenvironment topography to reach the most productive migration strategy.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Despite significant recent advances, therapeutic potential of miR-27b in cardiovascular disease and its effects in adult heart remain unexplored. Here, we assessed the therapeutic potential of miR-27b mimics and inhibitors in rodent models of ischemic disease and cancer.\nWe have used a number of models to demonstrate the effects of miR-27b mimicry and inhibition in vivo, including subcutaneous Matrigel plug assay, mouse models of hind limb ischemia and myocardial infarction and subcutaneous Lewis Lung carcinoma.\nUsing mouse model of myocardial infarction due to the coronary artery ligation, we showed that miR-27b mimic had overall beneficial effects, including increased vascularization, decreased fibrosis and increased ejection fraction.

{"title": "MiR-323 Inhibits Prostate Cancer Vascularization Through Adiponectin Receptor.", "abstract": "The current treatments fail to provide satisfactory cure for aggressive prostate cancers (PCs). Hence, further comprehension of PC metastasis is highly appreciated for improving the levels of therapy. We have previously shown that Adiponectin reduces the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in PCs to suppress tumor-associated neovascularization, possibly through AMPK/mTor signaling. Here, we studied the regulation of Adiponectin signaling in PCs.\nWe analyzed the levels and correlation of Adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and microRNA-323 (miR-323) in the PC specimen, compared to the paired normal prostate tissue. We analyzed the binding of miR-323 to the 3'UTR of AdipoR1 mRNA and its effects on AdipoR1 translation by bioinformatics analysis and by luciferase-reporter assay, respectively. We modified miR-323 levels in PC cells, and examined the effects on the expression of AdipoR1 and VEGF-A, as well as on vessel formation in a human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) transwell collagen gel assay.\nWe detected significantly lower levels of AdipoR1 and significantly higher levels of miR-323 in PC specimen. Moreover, the levels of AdipoR1 and miR-323 are inversely correlated. Moreover, miR-323 was found to bind to the 3\u2019UTR of AdipoR1 mRNA to inhibit its translation. Overexpression of miR-323 in PC cells decreased AdipoR1 protein levels, whereas inhibition of miR-323 increased AdipoR1 protein levels, without affecting AdipoR1 transcripts. Moreover, overexpression of miR-323 increased the levels of VEGF-A and the vessel formation by HUVECs, while inhibition of miR- 323 decreased the levels of VEGF-A and the vessel formation by HUVECs.\nOur data demonstrate that miR-323 may increase VEGF-A-mediated cancer vascularization in PC cells through AdipoR1 suppression.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2015-07-15", "authors": ["QiruoGao", "XudongYao", "JunhuaZheng"], "doi": "10.1159/000430313"}
{"title": "Understanding high endothelial venules: Lessons for cancer immunology.", "abstract": "High endothelial venules (HEVs) are blood vessels especially adapted for lymphocyte trafficking which are normally found in secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes (LN) and Peyer's patches. It has long been known that HEVs develop in non-lymphoid organs during chronic inflammation driven by autoimmunity, infection or allografts. More recently, HEVs have been observed in solid, vascularized tumors and their presence correlated with reduced tumor size and improved patient outcome. It is proposed that newly formed HEV promote antitumor immunity by recruiting naive lymphocytes into the tumor, thus allowing the local generation of cancerous tissue-destroying lymphocytes. Understanding how HEVs develop and function are therefore important to unravel their role in human cancers. In LN, HEVs develop during embryonic and early post-natal life and are actively maintained by the LN microenvironment. Systemic blockade of lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor leads to HEV de-differentiation, but the LN components that induce HEV differentiation have remained elusive.

The first vascularized pancreas transplant was performed by William Kelly and Richard Lillehei, to treat a type 1 diabetes patient, in December 1966. In Brazil, Edison Teixeira performed the first isolated segmental pancreas transplant in 1968. Until the 1980s, pancreas transplants were restricted to a few centers of the United States and Europe. The introduction of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in 1994, led to a significant outcome improvement and consequently, an increase in pancreas transplants in several countries. According to the International Pancreas Transplant Registry, until December 31st, 2010, more than 35 thousand pancreas transplants had been performed. The one-year survival of patients and pancreatic grafts exceeds 95 and 83%, respectively. The better survival of pancreatic (86%) and renal (93%) grafts in the first year after transplantation is in the simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant group of patients. Immunological loss in the first year after transplant for simultaneous pancreas-kidney, pancreas after kidney, and pancreas alone are 1.8, 3.7, and 6%, respectively. Pancreas transplant has 10 to 20% surgical complications requiring laparotomy.

Because vascularization is a major precondition for tumor growth, we analyzed in this study the anti-angiogenic action of geraniol. In vitro, geraniol reduced the migratory activity of endothelial-like eEND2 cells. Western blot analyses further revealed that geraniol downregulates proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and upregulates cleaved caspase-3 (Casp-3) expression in eEND2 cells. Moreover, geraniol blocked vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR-2 signal transduction, resulting in a suppression of downstream AKT and ERK signaling pathways. In addition, geraniol significantly reduced vascular sprout formation in a rat aortic ring assay. In vivo, geraniol inhibited the vascularization of CT26 tumors in dorsal skinfold chambers of BALB/c mice, which was associated with a smaller tumor size when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed a decreased number of Ki67-positive cells and CD31-positive microvessels with reduced VEGFR-2 expression within geraniol-treated tumors.

{"title": "Does Microwave Ablation of the Tumor Edge Allow for Joint-sparing Surgery in Patients With Osteosarcoma of the Proximal Tibia?", "abstract": "Joint-sparing surgery of a patient's native joint for osteosarcoma likely affords better function and comparable survival. However, it sometimes is challenging to resect a juxtaarticular osteosarcoma in a way that preserves the affected epiphysis because wide margins are necessary to minimize the risk of local recurrence. If there was a method to resect a tumor close to the joint and treat a potentially positive margin to prevent recurrence, it might allow salvage of a joint that otherwise might be lost.\nWe therefore asked (1) whether joint-preserving tumor resection could be performed for juxtaarticular osteosarcoma after microwave ablation of the tumor edge under navigation without leading to local recurrences, (2) what is the resulting function, and (3) what are the complications associated with this procedure.\nBetween 2009 and 2011, we treated 11 patients who had juxtaarticular osteosarcoma of the proximal tibia (mean age, 12 years; range, 9-16 years) with joint-preserving surgery by transepiphysis tumor resection after navigation-assisted microwave ablation of the tumor edge; they were followed a minimum of 37 months (mean, 48 months; range 37-62 months), and none was lost to followup. Patients were considered eligible for this procedure if they had a distance from the tumor edge to the articular surface between 10 to 15 mm, good chemotherapy responses, no pathologic fracture and no tumor involvement of major neurovascular structures. Allograft in combination with a vascularized fibula flap was used for segmental reconstruction. We recorded local tumor control, complications, and functional outcomes using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better function.\nThere were no local recurrences.

{"title": "An injectable elastin-based gene delivery platform for dose-dependent modulation of angiogenesis and inflammation for critical limb ischemia.", "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia is a major clinical problem. Despite rigorous treatment regimes, there has been only modest success in reducing the rate of amputations in affected patients. Reduced level of blood flow and enhanced inflammation are the two major pathophysiological changes that occur in the ischemic tissue. The objective of this study was to develop a controlled dual gene delivery system capable of delivering therapeutic plasmid eNOS and IL-10 in a temporal manner. In order to deliver multiple therapeutic genes, an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) based injectable system was designed. The injectable system was comprised of hollow spheres and an in situ-forming gel scaffold of elastin-like polypeptide capable of carrying gene complexes, with an extended manner release profile. In addition, the ELP based injectable system was used to deliver human eNOS and IL-10 therapeutic genes in\u00a0vivo. A subcutaneous dose response study showed enhanced blood vessel density in the treatment groups of eNOS (20\u00a0\u03bcg) and IL-10 (10\u00a0\u03bcg)/eNOS (20\u00a0\u03bcg) and reduced inflammation with IL-10 (10\u00a0\u03bcg) alone. Next, we carried out a hind-limb ischemia model comparing the efficacy of the following interventions; Saline; IL-10, eNOS and IL-10/eNOS. The selected dose of eNOS, exhibited enhanced angiogenesis. IL-10 treatment groups showed reduction in the level of inflammatory cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that eNOS up-regulated major proangiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors, platelet derived growth factor B, and fibroblast growth factor 1, which may explain the mechanism of this approach. These factors help in formation of a stable vascular network. Thus, ELP injectable system mediating non-viral delivery of human IL10-eNOS is a promising therapy towards treating limb ischemia.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-07-08", "authors": ["Biraja CDash", "DilipThomas", "MichaelMonaghan", "OliverCarroll", "XizheChen", "KimberlyWoodhouse", "TimothyO'Brien", "AbhayPandit"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.06.037"}
{"title": "Temporally tunable, enzymatically responsive delivery of proangiogenic peptides from poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels.", "abstract": "Proangiogenic drugs hold great potential to promote reperfusion of ischemic tissues and in tissue engineering applications, but efficacy is limited by poor targeting and short half-lives. Methods to control release duration or provide enzymatically responsive drug delivery have independently improved drug efficacy. However, no material has been developed to temporally control the rate of enzymatically responsive drug release. To address this void, hydrogels are developed to provide sustained, tunable release of Qk, a proangiogenic peptide mimic of vascular endothelial growth factor, via tissue-specific enzymatic activity. After confirmation that sustained delivery of Qk is necessary for proangiogenic effects, a variety of previously identified matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-degradable linkers are used to tether Qk to hydrogels. Of these, three (IPES\u2193LRAG, GPQG\u2193IWGQ, and VPLS\u2193LYSG) show MMP-responsive peptide release. These linkers provide tunable Qk release kinetics, with rates ranging from 1.64 to 19.9 \u00d7 10(-3) h(-1) in vitro and 4.82 to 8.94 \u00d7 10(-3) h(-1) in vivo. While Qk is confirmed to be bioactive as released, hydrogels releasing Qk fail to induce significant vascularization in vivo after one week, likely due to the use of nonenzymatically degradable hydrogels. While Qk is the focus of this study, the approach could easily be adapted to control the delivery of a variety of therapeutic molecules.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2015-07-08", "authors": ["Amy HVan Hove", "ErinAntonienko", "KathleenBurke", "EdwardBrown", "Danielle S WBenoit"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201500304"}

{"title": "Role of Microvascular Disruption in Brain Damage from Traumatic Brain Injury.", "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is acquired from an external force, which can inflict devastating effects to the brain vasculature and neighboring neuronal cells. Disruption of vasculature is a primary effect that can lead to a host of secondary injury cascades. The primary effects of TBI are rapidly occurring while secondary effects can be activated at later time points and may be more amenable to targeting. Primary effects of TBI include diffuse axonal shearing, changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and brain contusions. These mechanical events, especially changes to the BBB, can induce calcium perturbations within brain cells producing secondary effects, which include cellular stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. These secondary effects can be potentially targeted to preserve the tissue surviving the initial impact of TBI. In the past, TBI research had focused on neurons without any regard for glial cells and the cerebrovasculature. Now a greater emphasis is being placed on the vasculature and the neurovascular unit following TBI. A paradigm shift in the importance of the vascular response to injury has opened new avenues of drug-treatment strategies for TBI. However, a connection between the vascular response to TBI and the development of chronic disease has yet to be elucidated. Long-term cognitive deficits are common amongst those sustaining severe or multiple mild TBIs. Understanding the mechanisms of cellular responses following TBI is important to prevent the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

{"title": "NG2 proteoglycan-dependent recruitment of tumor macrophages promotes pericyte-endothelial cell interactions required for brain tumor vascularization.", "abstract": "Early stage growth of intracranial B16F10 tumors is reduced by 87% in myeloid-specific NG2 null (Mac-NG2ko) mice and by 77% in pericyte-specific NG2 null (PC-NG2ko) mice, demonstrating the importance of the NG2 proteoglycan in each of these stromal compartments. In both genotypes, loss of pericyte-endothelial cell interaction results in numerous structural defects in tumor blood vessels, including decreased formation of endothelial cell junctions and decreased assembly of the vascular basal lamina. All vascular deficits are larger in Mac-NG2ko mice than in PC-NG2ko mice, correlating with the greater decrease in pericyte-endothelial cell interaction in Mac-NG2ko animals. Accordingly, tumor vessels in Mac-NG2ko mice have a smaller diameter, lower degree of patency, and higher degree of leakiness than tumor vessels in PC-NG2ko mice, leading to less efficient tumor blood flow and to increased intratumoral hypoxia. While reduced pericyte interaction with endothelial cells in PC-NG2ko mice is caused by loss of NG2-dependent pericyte activation of \u03b21 integrin signaling in endothelial cells, reduced pericyte-endothelial cell interaction in Mac-NG2ko mice is due to a 90% reduction in NG2-dependent macrophage recruitment to tumors. The absence of a macrophage-derived signal(s) in Mac-NG2ko mice results in the loss of pericyte ability to associate with endothelial cells, possibly due to reduced expression of N-cadherin by both pericytes and endothelial cells.", "journal": "Oncoimmunology", "date": "2015-07-03", "authors": ["FusanoriYotsumoto", "Weon-KyooYou", "PilarCejudo-Martin", "KarolinaKucharova", "KenjiSakimura", "William BStallcup"], "doi": "10.1080/2162402X.2014.1001204\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.014\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.010\n10.1016/j.bbcan.2009.02.004\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63568-7\n10.1186/bcr3174\n10.2353/ajpath.2010.090786\n10.1016/j.ccr.2005.08.002\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1278\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.06.023\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.11.006\n10.1007/s10456-013-9378-1\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030637\n10.1083/jcb.200411127\n10.1002/1097-0177\n10.1161/01.RES.0000182903.16652.d7\n10.1002/glia.440150313\n10.1006/scbi.2001.0417\n10.1111/j.1750-3639.2008.00235.x\n10.1126/science.1067431\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210048\n10.1016/j.ccr.2012.02.022\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00810.x\n10.1242/dev.002071\n10.1038/ni.2477\n10.1038/nrc1093\n10.1083/jcb.137.7.1663\n10.1083/jcb.149.6.1263\n10.1371/journal.pone.0015846\n10.1186/1471-2407-12-35\n10.1016/j.canlet.2014.05.008\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.01.011\n10.1096/fj.02-0691\n10.1186/1742-2094-8-158\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2704\n10.1016/j.exphem.2007.04.015\n10.1091/mbc.E04-03-0236\n10.1038/onc.2008.157\n10.1083/jcb.200612084\n10.1172/JCI10555\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199811)177:2<299::AID-JCP12>3.0.CO;2-5\n10.1111/j.1755-148X.2011.00929.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0023062\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0287\n10.1093/neuonc/nor088\n10.1111/j.1440-1789.2011.01266.x\n10.1093/jmcb/mjt010\n10.1093/jnci/djq343\n10.4161/cam.2.3.6279\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.034\n10.1023/A:1008942828960\n10.1038/nature07445"}

{"title": "Improved Angiogenesis in Response to Localized Delivery of Macrophage-Recruiting Molecules.", "abstract": "Successful engineering of complex organs requires improved methods to promote rapid and stable vascularization of artificial tissue scaffolds. Toward this goal, tissue engineering strategies utilize the release of pro-angiogenic growth factors, alone or in combination, from biomaterials to induce angiogenesis. In this study we have used intravital microscopy to define key, dynamic cellular changes induced by the release of pro-angiogenic factors from polyethylene glycol diacrylate hydrogels transplanted in vivo.

Further data from in vivo experiments show that delivery of CSF1 with VEGF can dramatically improve the poor angiogenic response seen with VEGF alone.

The aim of this study was to assess sex differences in tumour biological features and hormone receptor profiles in a cohort of MB patients.\nSixty-four MBs and five normal cerebella were included in the study. Cell proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) and microvessel density (CD31) were evaluated in tumours by immunohistochemistry. Tissues were analysed for oestrogen receptor (ER)\u03b1, ER\u03b21, ER\u03b22, ER\u03b25 and androgen receptor (AR) expression. The results demonstrated sex-specific features in MBs, with tumours from females showing a higher apoptosis/proliferation ratio and less tumour vascularization than tumours from males. MBs were negative for ER\u03b1 and AR, but expressed ER\u03b2 isoforms at similar levels between the sexes. Altogether, these findings indicate that signalling mechanisms that control cell turnover and angiogenesis operate more efficiently in females than in males. The lack of sex differences in the hormone receptor profiles suggests that circulating oestrogens could be the major determinants of the sexual dimorphism observed in MB features.\nHere, we provide molecular support for epidemiological data showing sex differences in MB incidence and outcome, completely defining the hormone receptor profile of the tumours.", "journal": "Histopathology", "date": "2015-07-02", "authors": ["Gian FrancoZannoni", "AlessandraCiucci", "GianlucaMarucci", "DanieleTravaglia", "EgidioStigliano", "Maria PiaFoschini", "GiovanniScambia", "DanielaGallo"], "doi": "10.1111/his.12770"}
{"title": "Surgical management of medulla oblongata hemangioblastomas in one institution: an analysis of 62 cases.", "abstract": "Hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system are highly vascularized benign tumors. When the tumors are located in the medulla oblongata, intraoperative bleeding can make the surgical procedure very difficult. Preoperative embolism has been performed in cases of hemangioblastoma in recent decades. However, the complications of the embolization can result in fatal consequences, especially when the lesions are located in the brainstem. In recent years, selectively blocking the suspicious feeding arteries of the tumors during operation in conjunction with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring has been performed in the Department of Neurosurgery at the West China Hospital. The purpose of this study is to review all cases that underwent this surgical management and to evaluate their outcomes.\nBetween 2003 and 2014, 62 patients (36 female and 26 male, mean age 35.6 years) underwent microsurgery resection of 67 medulla oblongata hemangioblastomas. The suspicious feeding arteries were identified preoperatively by CTA or DSA. During the operation, the suspicious feeding arteries were blocked selectively by motor evoked potential (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potential monitoring (SEP). Based on the retrospectively review of the clinical records and outpatient long-term follow-up visits, their clinical courses were analyzed. Functional outcomes were evaluated according to the classification of McCormick and the Karnofsky Performance Scale.\nThe maximum tumor diameter ranged from 0.8 to 5.1 cm (mean, 2.9 cm). Total tumor resection was achieved in 60 patients. Sixty-one tumors were removed en bloc, and the other six were resected in a piecemeal fashion. The mean follow-up period was 47 months. During the follow-up period, 34 patients remained neurologically stable, 27 patients recovered to a better status and 16 patients developed new transient neurological dysfunction. One patient died. Karnofsky performance scale scores were 100 in 14 patients (22.9%), 90 in 18 patients (29.5%), 80 in 24 patients (39.3%) and 40 to 70 in 5 patients (8.2%). Seventeen cases were associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. In all the cases, tumor recurrence was observed during follow-up in only 2 patients.\nThis study suggests that safe and effective surgical management of medulla oblongata hemangioblastomas can be achieved for most patients, even without preoperative embolization. With the assistance of intraoperative MEP and SEP, mistaken cutting of the vessels that feed the brainstem can be avoided. With improved microsurgical techniques, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring and a better understanding of the vascular pattern of tumors, total and en bloc microsurgical removal can be performed with low mortality and favorable prognosis of neurological function.", "journal": "International journal of clinical and experimental medicine", "date": "2015-07-02", "authors": ["XuesongLiu", "YuekangZhang", "XuhuiHui", "ChaoYou", "FangYuan", "WenjingChen", "SiZhang"], "doi": null}

Thus, they represent a major clinical challenge to reconstructive surgery. Numerous types of grafts have been used to improve bone regeneration. In the case of particle grafts, the capacity for volume rebuilding and space maintaining is still not ideal, particularly for critical-sized bone defects. Although porous block grafts can overcome the above problems of particle grafts, they are still not widely used for critical-sized alveolar defects, because of their reduced efficacy in blood vessel and bone formation. Thus, in the present study, nano-hydroxyapatite/coralline (nHA/coral) blocks were pre-vascularized by coating them with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and then implanted in dogs with critical-sized mandibular defects. This model has possible applications in orthopedic and implant surgery. In vivo results indicate that the nHA/coral blocks allow cell and collagen ingrowth because of their suitable pore size and interconnectivity of pores. In addition, pre-vascularization properties were obtained by coating the scaffolds with VEGF. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations, as well as fluorescence analysis, revealed that the local delivery of VEGF can significantly improve neovascularization and mineralization of newly formed bone at the early stages of bone healing in this dog implantation model.

Pterygium is a formation of fibrous tissue consisting of highly vascularized epithelial and subepithelial tissue that grows excessively and with an abnormal shape on the cornea. Many physical and biological factors are associated with the pathogenesis of pterygium, including heat, dust, and other particles in the atmosphere, and immunological mechanisms, mechanisms involving extracellular matrix reorganization, growth factors, cytokines, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to further investigate the association between polymorphisms in GSTM1 and the formation of pterygium. We collected peripheral blood samples from 90 patients diagnosed with pterygium and from 23 subjects with-out the disease in order to perform molecular analysis of the GSTM1 gene. Subjects with one or two copies of the GSTM1 allele had a normal genotype while those without any copies of the allele had a null geno-type. The chi-square test or the Fisher exact test was performed in order to investigate possible associations between the molecular analysis and the risk of pterygium.

Polymer-coated allografts were used to locally deliver the immunomodulatory small molecule FTY720 in tibial defects created in rat bone marrow chimeras containing genetically-labeled bone marrow for monitoring cell origin and fate. Donor bone marrow contributed significantly to both myeloid and osteogenic cells in remodeling tissue surrounding allografts.

Animals in the T1 and T2 groups received weekly doses of 0.2 mg/kg intraperitoneal zoledronic acid for 3 weeks, while animals in the T3 group received the same treatment for 8 weeks. The control groups C1, C2 and C3 received equivalent doses of saline. The first upper molars of Wistar rats in the C2, T2, C3 and T3 groups were extracted. Cone-beam computerized tomography scans were performed, and the image density was analysed by grey levels. The presence and type of inflammatory infiltrate, vascularization and bone necrosis were assigned by histological qualitative scores. Histomorphometric analysis of bone density was performed in the groups without extraction. No significant differences were found in the bone grey density estimated by grey-level value and histomorphometric analysis between the C1 and T1 groups (P > 0.05). The grey levels in the T3 group were lower (P < 0.05) than in the C3 group, corresponding to the bone defect. Histological assessments showed the presence of bone necrosis in the T3 group and lower levels of bone remodelling in the test groups (T2 and T3) compared to the control groups (C2 and C3). The results of qualitative analyses did not differ significantly between the groups (P > 0.05).

{"title": "Acceleration of skin regeneration in full-thickness burns by incorporation of bFGF-loaded alginate microspheres into a CMCS-PVA hydrogel.", "abstract": "Two important issues in skin tissue engineering are the vascularization and regeneration of the dermis. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is known to promote angiogenesis and accelerate wound healing. Direct delivery of bFGF to the wound area, however, would lead to a loss of bioactivity. To this end, bFGF-loaded alginate microspheres (Ms) were fabricated and incorporated into carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS)-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) to form a composite hydrogel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicated that the incorporation of Ms does not significantly affect the inner structure of CMCS-PVA. In an in vitro study, the release of bFGF from Ms-CMCS-PVA in a sustained manner retained higher bioactivity over a 2-week period. Full-thickness burn wounds were created in the dorsal area of rats for in vivo evaluation of skin regeneration treated with CMCS-PVA hydrogel, with and without bFGF. Compared with the control, CMCS-PVA and bFGF-CMCS-PVA groups, the bFGF/Ms-CMCS-PVA group revealed significantly faster wound recovery rates, with re-epithelialization and regeneration of the dermis. Moreover, the bFGF/Ms-CMCS-PVA group had the highest density of newly formed and mature blood vessels during the 2 mweek treatment period. The ability of the bFGF/Ms-CMCS-PVA hydrogel to accelerate wound healing in a full-thickness burn model suggests its potential for use in dermal tissue regeneration.

{"title": "Bisphenol A alters the cardiovascular response to hypoxia in Danio rerio embryos.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if the cardiovascular response to hypoxia was altered by the presence of bisphenol A (BPA) in Danio rerio embryos. It was expected that BPA exposure would affect cardiovascular parameters during hypoxia more than normoxia due to an interaction between BPA and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1\u03b1) pathway. We demonstrate that BPA exposure has a minimal effect during normoxia but can severely affect the cardiovascular system during a hypoxic event. Cardiovascular response was measured in vivo using video microscopy and digital motion analysis. RBC density increased 35% in hypoxia alone but decreased 48% with addition of 0.25mg/L BPA. Tissue vascularization (% coverage) was unaffected by hypoxia alone but decreased 37% with addition of 0.25mg/L BPA. The diameter and RBC velocity of arteries were more sensitive than veins to BPA exposure during both normoxia and hypoxia. Arterial RBC velocity decreased 42% during normoxia and 52% during hypoxia with 1mg/L BPA. This decrease in velocity may in part be due to the 86% decrease in heart rate (\u0192H) observed during co-exposure to hypoxia and 5mg/L BPA. While stroke volume (SV) was unaffected by treatment, cardiac output (Q) decreased by 69% with co-exposure. \u0192H and Q were not affected by BPA exposure during normoxia. Development ultimately slowed by 146% and mortality rates were 95% during hypoxia when exposed to 5mg/L BPA.

VEGF has long been thought to be a potent neurotrophic factor for the survival of spinal cord neuron. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of VEGF is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of VEGF on spinal cord injury and its mechanisms. Young male Wistar rats were subjected to SCI and then VEGF165 were injected directly into the lesion epicenter 24 h post injury. We detected Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scores and numbers of motor neuron via Nissl staining. The expressions of autophagy related protein Beclin1 and LC3B were determined by Western blot and RT-PCR. We also detected the contents of inflammation factors interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-10(IL-10) in LPS (Lipopolysaccharide) treated spinal neuron-glia co-culture by ELISA. We found that VEGF165 administration increased the BBB score and reduced the loss of motor neuron of rats induced by SCI. VEGF decreased the protein expressions of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 and up-regulated the expressions of Beclin1 and LC3B of rats. In the in vitro study, VEGF165 decreased the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-10 and TNF-a in the medium of LPS treated spinal neuron-glia co-culture, which was partially blocked by 3-MA, the inhibitor of autophagy. In addition, VEGF165 up-regulate the expressions of Beclin1 and LC3B in co-culture cells.

Furthermore, the CP-CSF interface plays a putative role in neurogenesis and has been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases such as the neurodevelopmental disorders schizophrenia and autism. A role for this CNS border was also implicated in sleep disturbances and chronic and/or severe stress, which are risk factors for the development of neuropsychiatric conditions. Understanding the mechanisms by which disturbance of the homeostasis at the CP-CSF interface is involved in these different chronic low-grade inflammatory diseases can give new insights into therapeutic strategies.

Two men (32-year-old and 19-year-old) presented drop foot deformity with defect of the anterior tibialis tendon secondary to a crush injury. The sizes of the soft tissues defects at the foot dorsum were 24 cm \u00d7 8 cm and 20 cm \u00d7 8 cm, respectively. The quadriceps osteotendinous grafts were used to reconstruct the anterior tibialis tendon in both patients. The chimeric DIEP free flaps with skin paddles (24 cm \u00d7 8 cm and 20 cm \u00d7 8 cm) and rectus abdominis fascia (24 cm \u00d7 4 cm and 20 cm \u00d7 4 cm) were used for reconstruction. The skin component based on a musculocutaneous perforator was used for soft tissue reconstruction of the foot dorsum.

The development of retinal vasculature was analysed by endothelial cell staining with isolectin B4. PN-1-deficient (PN-1(-/-)) retina displayed increased vascularization in the postnatal period, with elevated capillary thickness and density, compared to their wild-type littermate (WT). Moreover, PN-1(-/-) retina presented more veins/arteries than WT retina. The kinetics of retinal vasculature development, retinal VEGF expression and overall retinal structure were similar in WT and PN-1(-/-) mice, but we observed a hyperproliferation of vascular cells in PN-1(-/-) retina. Expression of PN-1 was analysed by immunoblotting and X-Gal staining of retinas from mice expressing beta-galactosidase under a PN-1 promoter. PN-1 was highly expressed in the first week following birth and then progressively decreased to a low level in adult retina where it localized on the retinal arteries. PCR arrays performed on mouse retinal RNA identified two angiogenesis-related factors, midkine and Smad5, that were overexpressed in PN-1(-/-) newborn mice and this was confirmed by RT-PCR. Both the higher vascularization and the overexpression of midkine and Smad5 mRNA were also observed in gastrocnemius muscle of PN-1(-/-) mice, suggesting that PN-1 interferes with these pathways.

Here we report that a single intravenous dose of 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(11) or 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(11) VPs was sufficient to extend survival in nude rats bearing U87MG-luc2 or nude mice bearing U251-luc, respectively. Bioluminescence imaging of nude rats showed that VB-111 effectively inhibited tumor growth within four weeks of treatment. This was confirmed in a select group of animals by MRI. In our mouse model we observed that 3 of 10 nude mice treated with VB-111 completely lost U251 luciferase signal and were considered long term survivors. To assess the antiangiogenic effects of VB-111, we evaluated the tumor-associated microvaculature by CD31, a common marker of neovascularization, and found a significant decrease in the microvessel density by IHC. We further assessed the neovasculature by confocal microscopy and found that VB-111 inhibits vascular density in two separate mouse models bearing U251-RFP xenografts. Collectively, this study supports the clinical development of VB-111 as a treatment for GBM.", "journal": "Journal of neuro-oncology", "date": "2015-06-26", "authors": ["AleksandraGruslova", "David ACavazos", "Jessica RMiller", "EyalBreitbart", "Yael CCohen", "LivnatBangio", "NivaYakov", "AnuSoundararajan", "John RFloyd", "Andrew JBrenner"], "doi": "10.1007/s11060-015-1853-7\n10.1056/NEJMra0708126\n10.1038/nrn2175\n10.1016/j.ejps.2013.10.003\n10.1016/bs.apha.2014.06.004\n10.1186/1471-2407-14-151\n10.1586/14737140.2014.956095\n10.1007/s40265-014-0302-9\n10.1097/CAD.0000000000000129\n10.1007/s11060-014-1571-6\n10.1097/JTO.0000000000000366\n10.1155/2012/483040\n10.1172/JCI20007\n10.1172/JCI117784\n10.1038/sj.gt.3301472\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2079\n10.1093/neuonc/nos060\n10.1215/15228517-2007-024\n10.1101/gad.1596707\n10.1007/s00109-013-1019-z\n10.1016/j.neo.2014.06.003\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-0685\n10.1038/sj.cgt.7700750\n10.1593/neo.04391\n10.1215/15228517-2008-061\n10.1093/neuonc/noq150\n10.2214/AJR.06.0280"}
{"title": "Endothelial Cell Proliferation and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Expression in Primary Colorectal Cancer and Corresponding Liver Metastases.", "abstract": ". Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the major causes of cancer death worldwide. Data from the literature indicate differences between the proliferation rate of endothelial cells relative to the morphology growth type, possibly due to origin of specimens (autopsy material, surgery fragments) or quantification methods. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a factor that stimulates the proliferation of endothelial cells. It is expressed in more than 90% of cases of metastatic CRC.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the endothelial cell proliferation and VEGF expression in primary tumors and corresponding liver metastases.\nOur study included 24 recent biopsies of primary tumors and corresponding liver metastases of CRC cases. CD34/ Ki67 double immunostaining and RNA scope assay for VEGF were performed.\nIn the primary tumors analysis of VEGFmRNA expression indicated no significant correlation with differentiation grade, proliferative and non-proliferative vessels in the intratumoral and peritumoral areas. In contrast, in the corresponding liver metastases, VEGFmRNA expression significantly correlated with the total number of non- proliferative vessels and total number of vessels. CD34/ Ki67 double immunostaining in the cases with poorly differentiated carcinoma indicated a high number of proliferating endothelial cells in the peritumoral area and a low number in the intratumoral area for the primary tumor. Moderately differentiated carcinomas of colon showed no proliferating endothelial cells in the intratumoral area in half of the cases included in the study, for both, primary tumor and liver metastasis. In well differentiated CRCs, in primary tumors, a high proliferation rate of endothelial cells in the intratumoral area and a lower proliferation rate in the peritumoral area were found. A low value was found in corresponding liver metastasis.\nThe absence of proliferative endothelial cells in half of the cases for the primary tumors and liver metastases in moderately differentiated carcinoma suggest a vascular mimicry phenomenon. The mismatch between the total number of vessels and endothelial proliferation in primary tumors indicate that a functional vascular network is already formed or the existence of some mechanisms influenced by other angiogenic factors.", "journal": "Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP", "date": "2015-06-25", "authors": ["Balica AmaliaRaluca", "Anca MariaCimpean", "AndreeaCioca", "OctavianCretu", "OvidiuMederle", "AlexandruCiolofan", "PusaGaje", "MariusRaica"], "doi": "10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.11.4549"}

In this clinical study, we review our experience with acellular dermal matrix (ADM) which was used as an adjunct to facilitate difficult cleft palate and palatal fistula closure.\nFrom October 2009 till December 2013, primary cleft palate and fistula repairs in which ADM was used were culled from the cleft surgery files. Acellular dermal matrix was used as an extra layer in between palatal flaps of primary repairs and as a sandwiched sheet separating the flaps used to repair fistulas. In addition to patient, cleft and fistula demographics, records were evaluated for sizes, fistula development, fistula recurrence, extrusion, exposure, and infection.\nAcellular dermal matrix was used in 35 patients with palatal clefts of mean size 15\u200a\u00b1\u200a4\u200a mm and in 15 palatal fistulas. Two-flap palatoplasty technique was the dominant technique for the palate repair. Fistula rate for the palate repair was 8.5% and fistula recurrence rate was 20%. Mean follow-up for the palate and fistula repair patients was 29\u200a\u00b1\u200a15 months and 32\u200a\u00b1\u200a11 months, respectively. In two cases of palatoplasty group and in four cases of fistula repair group, ADM was exposed resulting in total extrusion in two fistula cases.\nIn this ongoing experience of application, ADM has been shown to be a simple, safe, and helpful tool to reduce fistula rate mainly in relatively wide and high tension tenuous cleft palate repairs but less favorable in challenging fistula closure attempts particularly along with poorly vascularized surrounding tissues. However, study design and its results are yet far from strongly recommending routine ADM use in cleft palate surgery.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2015-06-25", "authors": ["HakanAgir", "Gamze GEren", "Emrah KYasar"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000001814"}
{"title": "Three-dimensional reconstruction of serial sections for analysis of the microvasculature of the white pulp and the marginal zone in the human spleen.", "abstract": "Although a number of papers have given useful information on splenic microcirculation by light and/or scanning electron microscopy, controversies remain as to the vascular arrangement, especially in the human spleen. The present study re-examined the microvasculature of the human spleen using a three-dimensional reconstruction of immunohistochemically stained tissue sections, and showed that the central artery does not directly issue follicular arteries in the human spleen; follicular arteries are derived from penicillar arteries outside the follicle and end in the white pulp. We found that the splenic follicle is surrounded by an elaborate system of anastomosed capillaries in both the marginal zone and the superficial layer of the white pulp. Most of these capillaries are also branches of the penicillar arterioles that are issued from the central artery in the same, or a different, white pulp system. Because the endothelia of these capillaries are widely open in the marginal zone, this vascular network may play a major role in supplying blood to the marginal zone. The accumulation of sialoadhesin-positive macrophages was also observed around the vascular network, suggesting an important role for this structure as the front line of immune response.", "journal": "Biomedical research (Tokyo, Japan)", "date": "2015-06-25", "authors": ["SatoshiKusumi", "DaisukeKoga", "TatsuoKanda", "TatsuoUshiki"], "doi": "10.2220/biomedres.36.195"}

We compared the in vitro and in vivo immunomodulatory efficacy of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) and bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs in a rat VCA model.\nBoth cell types were tested in vitro for suppressor function using mixed lymphocyte reactivity assays. AD-MSCs or BM-MSCs were administered intravenously (1 \u00d7 10 or 5 \u00d7 10 cells/animal) to Lewis rat recipients of mismatched Brown Norway hindlimb transplants. Short course tacrolimus (FK-506) monotherapy was withdrawn at postoperative day 21. In vivo regulatory T-cell induction, peripheral blood chimerism, and microchimerism in lymphatic organs were analyzed.\nAD-MSCs and BM-MSCs exhibited strong dose-dependent suppressor function in vitro, which was significantly more pronounced for AD cells. In vivo, all animals revealed peripheral multi-lineage chimerism at four weeks (P < 0.01) independent of cell type and dosage. Regulatory T-cell levels were increased with both cell types, the most in AD-MSC groups. These immunomodulatory effects were only transient. MSC treatment resulted in long-term (>120 day) allograft survival in 47% of the animals, which correlated with durable microchimerism in BM and spleen.\nAD-MSCs and BM-MSCs exert immunomodulatory effects that prolong survival of immunogenic skin-bearing VCA grafts with short course (21 day) tacrolimus induction therapy.

The granuloma's main function is to constrain and prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria while focusing the immune response to a limited area. In some cases these lesions can grow progressively into large granulomas which can undergo central necrosis, thereby leading to their caseation. Macrophages are the most abundant cells present in the granuloma and are known to adapt under hypoxic conditions in order to avoid cell death. Our laboratory has developed a granuloma necrosis model that mimics the human pathology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, using C57BL/6 mice infected intravenously with a low dose of a highly virulent strain of Mycobacterium avium. In this work, a mouse strain deleted of the hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) under the Cre-lox system regulated by the lysozyme M gene promoter was used to determine the relevance of HIF-1\u03b1 in the caseation of granulomas. The genetic ablation of HIF-1\u03b1 in the myeloid lineage causes the earlier emergence of granuloma necrosis and clearly induces an impairment of the resistance against M. avium infection coincident with the emergence of necrosis. The data provide evidence that granulomas become hypoxic before undergoing necrosis through the analysis of vascularization and quantification of HIF-1\u03b1 in a necrotizing mouse model.

Based on their last examination, outcomes were categorized into five groups based on the presence of corneal vessels, appearance of the scar, and the ability to visualize the posterior and/or the anterior segment through the grafted area.\nThere were 82 eyes included in the study, with 68 eyes with sufficient follow-up time for final assessment. Scarring was minimal in 47 eyes, moderate but not enough to obscure visualization of the posterior segment in 12, and severe in nine. There were five eyes that developed phthisis bulbi, glaucoma or were enucleated and nine that were lost to follow up. Graft dehiscence occurred in 19 eyes. Twelve healed without additional surgical intervention while three required a second graft, two became phthisical, and two were enucleated.\nCorneal reconstruction with ACell Vet(\u2122) alone is a viable alternative and results in minimal scarring and complications in cats. In dogs, scarring is more pronounced than in cats and graft dehiscence rate is higher compared to conventional techniques.", "journal": "Veterinary ophthalmology", "date": "2015-06-23", "authors": ["Derek W YChow", "Hans DWestermeyer"], "doi": "10.1111/vop.12294"}

In this study, we propose to evaluate the remodeling, vascularization, and functionality of a chitosan-based, tubular neuromuscular tissue on subcutaneous implantation in the back of athymic rats.\nAligned innervated smooth muscle sheets were bioengineered with the use of human smooth muscle and neural progenitor cells. The innervated sheets were wrapped around tubular chitosan scaffolds. The engineered tubular neuromuscular tissue was implanted subcutaneously in the back of athymic rats. The implant was harvested after 14 days and assessed for morphology, vascularization, and functionality.\nGross examination of the implants showed healthy color with no signs of inflammation. The implanted tissue became vascularized as demonstrated by gross and histologic analysis. Chitosan supported the luminal patency of the tissue. The innervated muscle remodeled around the tubular chitosan scaffold. Smooth muscle maintained its circumferential alignment and contractile phenotype. The functionality of the implant was characterized further by the use of real-time force generation. A cholinergic response was demonstrated by robust contraction in response to acetylcholine. Vasoactive intestinal peptide-, and electrical field stimulation-caused relaxation. In the presence of neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, the magnitude of acetylcholine-induced contraction and vasoactive intestinal peptide-induced relaxation was attenuated whereas electrical field stimulation-induced relaxation was completely abolished, indicating neuronal contribution to the response.\nOur results indicated the successful subcutaneous implantation of engineered tubular neuromuscular tissues. The tissues became vascularized and maintained their myogenic and neurogenic phenotype and function, which provides potential therapeutic prospects for providing implantable replacement GI segments for treating GI motility disorders.", "journal": "Surgery", "date": "2015-06-23", "authors": ["ElieZakhem", "MostafaElbahrawy", "GiuseppeOrlando", "Khalil NBitar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.surg.2015.05.009"}

However, psychosocial functioning of the partner or of particular patient groups such as blind patients are until now less well investigated.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate psychologic, marital, and family functioning of a blind 54-year-old patient, Mr. A, and his partner after facial transplantation.\nDepressive and anxiety symptoms, hopelessness, personality, coping, resilience, illness cognitions, marital support, dyadic adjustment, family functioning, and quality of life of Mr. A and his partner were assessed before and after facial transplantation and at 15 months follow-up. Reliable change index (RCI) was further calculated to evaluate the magnitude of change.\nMost psychologic, marital, and family scores of both Mr. A and his partner were within a normative and healthy range before and after transplant and at 15 months follow-up. Resilience (RCI: 3.6), affective responsiveness (RCI: -3.6), and disease benefits (RCI: 2.6) of Mr. A further improved at 15 months follow-up whereas the physical quality of life (RCI: -14.8) strongly decreased. Only marital support (RCI: -2.1) and depth (RCI: -2.0) of the partner decreased at 15 months.\nThe results of this study point to positive psychosocial outcomes in a blind patient after facial transplantation.

Organic dots with large two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections are highly desired for two-photon fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we report two biocompatible and photostable organic dots fabricated by encapsulating tetraphenylethene derivatives within DSPE-PEG matrix. The two organic dots show absorption maxima at 425 and 483 nm and emit green and red fluorescence at 560 and 645 nm, with high fluorescence quantum yields of 64% and 22%, respectively. Both organic dots exhibit excellent TPA property in the range of 800-960 nm, affording upon excitation at 820 nm remarkably large TPA cross sections of 1.2\u00d710(6) and 2.5\u00d710(6) GM on the basis of dot concentration. The bare fluorophores and their organic dots are biocompatible and have been used to stain living cells for one- and two-photon fluorescence bioimagings. The cRGD-modified organic dots can selectively target integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 overexpressing breast cancer cells for targeted imaging. The organic dots are also applied for real-time two-photon fluorescence in vivo visualization of the blood vasculature of mouse ear, providing the spatiotemporal information about the whole blood vascular network.

Ovulation was synchronized using a progesterone device-based protocol. After six days of ovulation, the cows were slaughtered and the ovaries and CL were collected. The CLs were processed and photomicrographs were taken under light microscopy to assess the vascular volume density (Vv) by stereology, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to perform ultrastructural analysis of the microvasculature. The Vv in stimulated and superovulated cows significantly increased (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001) when compared to control, indicating that the eCG is able to induce angiogenic activity in bovine CL. However, no significant differences were observed between stimulated and superovulated cows. The SEM demonstrated ratings indicative of angiogenesis, marked by several button-shaped projections in the capillaries, and the presence of more dilated capillaries in CL treated with eCG. These morphological findings are evidence of an angiogenic effect of the eCG treatment in CL of cows.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2015-06-23", "authors": ["Carlos Eduardo BezerraMoura", "Nathia NathalyRigoglio", "Janine Karla Fran\u00e7a SBraz", "MarcelloMachado", "Pietro SBaruselli", "Paula De CarvalhoPapa"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.22533"}

Enamel matrix derivative, a complex mixture of proteins, was separated into 13 fractions using size-exclusion chromatography and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Human periodontal ligament fibroblasts were treated with either enamel matrix derivative or the different fractions. Proliferation and cytokine secretion to the cell culture medium were measured and compared to untreated cells. The liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the most abundant peptides were amelogenin and leucine-rich amelogenin peptide related.

{"title": "Performance Enhancement of Pharmacokinetic Diffuse Fluorescence Tomography by Use of Adaptive Extended Kalman Filtering.", "abstract": "Due to both the physiological and morphological differences in the vascularization between healthy and diseased tissues, pharmacokinetic diffuse fluorescence tomography (DFT) can provide contrast-enhanced and comprehensive information for tumor diagnosis and staging. In this regime, the extended Kalman filtering (EKF) based method shows numerous advantages including accurate modeling, online estimation of multiparameters, and universal applicability to any optical fluorophore. Nevertheless the performance of the conventional EKF highly hinges on the exact and inaccessible prior knowledge about the initial values. To address the above issues, an adaptive-EKF scheme is proposed based on a two-compartmental model for the enhancement, which utilizes a variable forgetting-factor to compensate the inaccuracy of the initial states and emphasize the effect of the current data. It is demonstrated using two-dimensional simulative investigations on a circular domain that the proposed adaptive-EKF can obtain preferable estimation of the pharmacokinetic-rates to the conventional-EKF and the enhanced-EKF in terms of quantitativeness, noise robustness, and initialization independence.

In this study, we addressed the underlying molecular mechanisms, focusing specifically on the interactions between MSCs, macrophages and endothelial cells.\nWe isolated macrophages (BM-M\u03a6) from mouse bone-marrow derived cells based on F4/80 expression by flow cytometry. BM-M\u03a6 were treated with different doses of PLGF. Cell number was analyzed by a MTT assay. Macrophage polarization was examined based on CD206 expression by flow cytometry. PLGF levels in macrophage subpopulations were analyzed by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Effects of macrophages on vascularization were evaluated by a collagen gel assay using Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) co-cultured with PLGF-treated macrophages.\nPLGF did not increase macrophage number, but dose-dependently polarized macrophages into a M2 subpopulation. M2 macrophages expressed high levels of PLGF. PLGF-polarized M2 macrophages significantly increased tubular structures in the collagen gel assay.\nOur data suggest that MSCs-derived PLGF may induce macrophage polarization into a M2 subpopulation, which in turn releases more PLGF to promote local neovascularization for augmenting post-injury cardiac muscle repair.

The treatment of non-union remains challenging because of the scaphoid's small size and delicate blood supply. Large animal models are the most reliable method to evaluate the efficacy of new treatment modalities before their translation into clinical practice. The goal of this study was to model a human scaphoid fracture complicated by non-union in Yucatan mini-pigs. Imaging and perfusion studies were used to confirm that the anatomy and blood supply of the radiocarpal bone in mini-pigs were similar to the human scaphoid. A 3 mm osteotomy of the radiocarpal bone was generated and treated with immediate fixation or filled with a dense collagen gel followed by delayed fixation. Bone healing was assessed using quantitative micro computed tomography and histology.

{"title": "Obstructions in Vascular Networks: Relation Between Network Morphology and Blood Supply.", "abstract": "We relate vascular network structure to hemodynamics after vessel obstructions. We consider tree-like networks with a viscoelastic fluid with the rheological characteristics of blood. We analyze the network hemodynamic response, which is a function of the frequencies involved in the driving, and a measurement of the resistance to flow. This response function allows the study of the hemodynamics of the system, without the knowledge of a particular pressure gradient. We find analytical expressions for the network response, which explicitly show the roles played by the network structure, the degree of obstruction, and the geometrical place in which obstructions occur. Notably, we find that the sequence of resistances of the network without occlusions strongly determines the tendencies that the response function has with the anatomical place where obstructions are located. We identify anatomical sites in a network that are critical for its overall capacity to supply blood to a tissue after obstructions. We demonstrate that relatively small obstructions in such critical sites are able to cause a much larger decrease on flow than larger obstructions placed in non-critical sites. Our results indicate that, to a large extent, the response of the network is determined locally. That is, it depends on the structure that the vasculature has around the place where occlusions are found. This result is manifest in a network that follows Murray's law, which is in reasonable agreement with several mammalian vasculatures. For this one, occlusions in early generation vessels have a radically different effect than occlusions in late generation vessels occluding the same percentage of area available to flow. This locality implies that whenever there is a tissue irrigated by a tree-like in vivo vasculature, our model is able to interpret how important obstructions are for the irrigation of such tissue.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-06-19", "authors": ["Aimee MTorres Rojas", "AlejandroMeza Romero", "IgnacioPagonabarraga", "Rui D MTravasso", "EugeniaCorvera Poir\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0128111\n10.1016/S0161-6420(80)35283-4\n10.1016/S0002-9394(00)00384-6\n10.1016/0021-9290(92)90060-E\n10.1016/S0021-9290(99)00207-9\n10.1016/S0021-9290(99)00164-5\n10.1016/S0021-9290(01)00100-2\n10.1080/10255840600857767\n10.1017/S0022112007005836\n10.1017/S0022112007005836\n10.1007/s00330-006-0465-1\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.03.038\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2006.07.008\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.10.005\n10.1016/0169-2607(93)90067-U\n10.1006/jtbi.2003.3151\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.06.003\n10.1021/la103520a\n10.1103/PhysRevE.76.026301\n10.1016/0891-6632(89)90039-1\n10.1073/pnas.12.3.207\n10.1085/jgp.78.4.431\n10.1098/rsif.2007.1022\n10.1016/S0021-9290(00)00173-1\n10.1038/nature01444\n10.1111/j.0269-8463.2004.00913.x\n10.3732/ajb.92.6.985\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2010.08.019"}

The discovery of vasculogenic mimicry (VM) has offered a new horizon for understanding tumor vascularization.

{"title": "Chronic arterial hypertension impedes glioma growth: a multiparametric MRI study in the rat.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most aggressive brain tumor and is almost always fatal. These tumors are highly vascularized and angiogenesis is one of the pre-eminent mechanisms underlying their growth. Chronic arterial hypertension (CAH) is a common and worldwide pathology that markedlly alters the structure and function of the vasculature. Yet, essential hypertension is associated in the brain with potential locally impaired vasoreactivity, disturbed perfusion supply and hypoxia phenomena. Even though CAH is a global burden and has an important impact on brain function, nothing is known about the way this frequent pathology would interact with the evolution of glioma. We sought to determine if arterial hypertension influences gliobastoma growth. In the present study, rat glioma C6 tumor cells were implanted in the caudate-putamen of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) or their normotensive controls, the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The evolution of the tumor was sequentially analyzed by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and the inflammatory response was examined by histochemistry. We found that CAH significantly attenuates the growth of the tumor as, at 21 days, the volume of the tumor was 85.4\u00b134.7 and 126.1\u00b128.8\u2009mm(3), respectively, in hypertensive and normotensive rats (P<0.02). Moreover, cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow were greater in the tumors of hypertensive rats (P<0.05). The lesser growth of the tumor observed in normotensive animals was not due to an enhanced rejection of the tumor cells in WKY rats, the inflammatory response being similar in both groups. For the first time, these results show that CAH impedes the growth of glioblastoma and illustrate the need to further study the impact of hypertension on the evolution of brain tumors.", "journal": "Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension", "date": "2015-06-19", "authors": ["AnneliseLetourneur", "SimonRoussel", "MyriamBernaudin", "FabienFillesoye", "J\u00e9r\u00f4meToutain", "Eric TMacKenzie", "EdwigePetit", "OmarTouzani", "SamuelValable"], "doi": "10.1038/hr.2015.66"}
{"title": "Small-sized granules of biphasic bone substitutes support fast implant bed vascularization.", "abstract": "The present study investigated the influence of granule size of 2 biphasic bone substitutes (BoneCeramic\u00ae 400-700\u00a0\u03bcm and 500-1000\u00a0\u03bcm) on the induction of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) and implant bed vascularization in a subcutaneous implantation model in rats. Furthermore, degradation mechanisms and particle phagocytosis of both materials were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both granule types induced tissue reactions involving primarily mononuclear cells and only small numbers of MNGCs. Higher numbers of MNGCs were detected in the group with small granules starting on day 30, while higher vascularization was observed only at day 10 in this group. TEM analysis revealed that both mono- and multinucleated cells were involved in the phagocytosis of the materials. Additionally, the results allowed recognition of the MNGCs as the foreign body giant cell phenotype. Histomorphometrical analysis of the size of phagocytosed particles showed no differences between the 2 granule types. The results indicate that granule size seems to have impact on early implant bed vascularization and also on the induction of MNGCs in the late phase of the tissue reaction. Furthermore, the results revealed that a synthetic bone substitute material can induce tissue reactions similar to those of some xenogeneic materials, thus pointing to a need to elucidate their \"ideal\" physical characteristics. The results also show that granule size in the range studied did not alter phagocytosis by mononuclear cells.

{"title": "A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Safety of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Inhibitors for the Treatment of Retinopathy of Prematurity.", "abstract": "Laser photocoagulation is the current gold standard treatment for proliferative retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). However, it permanently reduces the visual field and might induce myopia. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors for the treatment of ROP may enable continuing vascularization of the retina, potentially allowing the preservation of the visual field. However, for their use in infants concern remains. This meta-analysis explores the safety of VEGF inhibitors.\nThe Ovid Interface was used to perform a systematic review of the literature in the databases PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library.\nThis meta-analysis included 24 original reports (including 1.457 eyes) on VEGF inhibitor treatment for ROP. The trials were solely observational except for one randomized and two case-control studies. We estimated a 6-month risk of retreatment per eye of 2.8%, and a 6-month risk of ocular complication without the need of retreatment of 1.6% per eye.

{"title": "Strategies to Stimulate Mobilization and Homing of Endogenous Stem and Progenitor Cells for Bone Tissue Repair.", "abstract": "The gold standard for the treatment of critical-size bone defects is autologous or allogenic bone graft. This has several limitations including donor site morbidity and the restricted supply of graft material. Cell-based tissue engineering strategies represent an alternative approach. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered as a source of osteoprogenitor cells. More recently, focus has been placed on the use of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), since vascularization is a critical step in bone healing. Although many of these approaches have demonstrated effectiveness for bone regeneration, cell-based therapies require time consuming and cost-expensive in vitro cell expansion procedures. Accordingly, research is becoming increasingly focused on the homing and stimulation of native cells. The stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) - CXCR4 axis has been shown to be critical for the recruitment of MSCs and EPCs. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key factor in angiogenesis and has been targeted in many studies. Here, we present an overview of the different approaches for delivering homing factors to the defect site by absorption or incorporation to biomaterials, gene therapy, or via genetically manipulated cells. We further review strategies focusing on the stimulation of endogenous cells to support bone repair. Finally, we discuss the major challenges in the treatment of critical-size bone defects and fracture non-unions.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2015-06-18", "authors": ["MariettaHerrmann", "SophieVerrier", "MauroAlini"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2015.00079\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000147780.30124.CF\n10.1161/01.RES.0000182903.16652.d7\n10.1093/emboj/18.14.3964\n10.2147/SCCAA.S48423\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0537\n10.1084/jem.20041385\n10.1155/2014/571510\n10.1016/S0169-409X(98)00016-7\n10.1038/nm1075\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.04.053\n10.1007/s00441-012-1449-x\n10.1016/j.bone.2006.11.004\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.07.003\n10.1016/j.ejpb.2009.04.014\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.11.026\n10.1007/BF00436764\n10.1302/0301-620X.87B10.16226\n10.1161/01.RES.0000126411.29641.08\n10.1002/jbm.a.30771\n10.1016/j.addr.2012.03.013\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.06.080\n10.1016/j.msec.2013.11.023\n10.3109/14653249.2012.655420\n10.1002/jcb.20219\n10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.01014.x\n10.1016/j.bone.2011.06.024\n10.1302/0301-620X.89B12.19671\n10.1359/JBMR.050701\n10.1016/j.bone.2007.06.018\n10.1038/9467\n10.1159/000047893\n10.1073/pnas.1018501108\n10.1515/CCLM.1998.064\n10.1097/01.mlg.0000200792.67802.3b\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.040\n10.1096/fj.02-0514fje\n10.1002/jor.21324\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0762\n10.1007/s10529-009-0007-4\n10.1038/sj.gt.3302439\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0268\n10.1073/pnas.0800069105\n10.1634/stemcells.22-3-415\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.10.016\n10.2147/IJN.S70457\n10.1371/journal.pone.0097035\n10.1359/jbmr.060120\n10.1002/jor.22132\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.10.059\n10.1002/jbmr.2318\n10.1016/j.lfs.2006.08.023\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.01.031\n10.1016/S0020-1383(08)70015-9\n10.2106/JBJS.G.01218\n10.1161/01.RES.0000137878.26174.66\n10.1002/art.24330\n10.1016/j.joms.2005.05.303\n10.1177/0885328214544769\n10.1359/jbmr.2001.16.6.1004\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00319.x\n10.1016/j.bone.2012.01.027\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00545.x\n10.3727/096368910X550189\n10.5966/sctm.2013-0106\n10.1002/jor.20228\n10.1016/S1297-319X(02)00391-3\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.01.033\n10.1186/1471-2474-15-350\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2003.11.008\n10.1172/JCI15994\n10.1002/jor.20658\n10.3928/01477447-20110427-19\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0314\n10.3978/j.issn.1000-9604.2013.11.06\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.02.025\n10.5966/sctm.2013-0126\n10.1002/jor.22134\n10.1007/s00402-012-1641-1\n10.1007/s00167-012-2150-z\n10.1126/science.1247663\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3002614\n10.1016/j.bone.2013.01.005\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.060064\n10.1002/jcp.21309\n10.1002/jor.22277\n10.1016/S8756-3282(01)00690-1\n10.1089/107632702320934010\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0820\n10.1126/science.286.5446.1946\n10.1177/154405910408300304\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2008.01639.x\n10.1074/jbc.M600413200\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0515\n10.1172/JCI18420\n10.1007/s11095-008-9685-1\n10.1016/j.bone.2008.06.019\n10.1177/0022034509349748\n10.1172/JCI15153\n10.1371/journal.pone.0040831\n10.1016/j.jcms.2013.01.037\n10.1016/S0736-0266(01)00142-5\n10.4252/wjsc.v6.i2.144\n10.1073/pnas.1404605111\n10.1254/jphs.08036FP\n10.1007/s00223-007-9020-6\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.07.017\n10.1002/jor.21374\n10.1016/j.orthres.2005.01.013\n10.1186/1741-7015-11-146\n10.1016/j.addr.2014.08.007\n10.1073/pnas.152324099\n10.1002/jgm.392\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2013.05.004\n10.1684/ecn.2009.0174\n10.1002/term.461\n10.1371/journal.pone.0106722\n10.1182/blood-2004-02-0526\n10.1088/1748-6041/6/1/015013\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3180587e4d\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0510\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.060\n10.1007/s10856-013-5138-4\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2014.08.007\n10.1371/journal.pone.0102371\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.08.047\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00377.x\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0222"}
{"title": "The GYF domain protein CD2BP2 is critical for embryogenesis and podocyte function.", "abstract": "Scaffolding proteins play pivotal roles in the assembly of macromolecular machines such as the spliceosome. The adaptor protein CD2BP2, originally identified as a binding partner of the adhesion molecule CD2, is a pre-spliceosomal assembly factor that utilizes its glycine-tyrosine-phenylalanine (GYF) domain to co-localize with spliceosomal proteins. So far, its function in vertebrates is unknown. Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we show that CD2BP2 is crucial for embryogenesis, leading to growth retardation, defects in vascularization, and premature death at embryonic day 10.5 when absent. Ablation of the protein in bone marrow-derived macrophages indicates that CD2BP2 is involved in the alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts from diverse origins. At the molecular level, we identified the phosphatase PP1 to be recruited to the spliceosome via the N-terminus of CD2BP2. Given the strong expression of CD2BP2 in podocytes of the kidney, we use selective depletion of CD2BP2, in combination with next-generation sequencing, to monitor changes in exon usage of genes critical for podocyte functions, including VEGF and actin regulators. CD2BP2-depleted podocytes display foot process effacement, and cause proteinuria and ultimately lethal kidney failure in mice. Collectively, our study defines CD2BP2 as a non-redundant splicing factor essential for embryonic development and podocyte integrity.", "journal": "Journal of molecular cell biology", "date": "2015-06-18", "authors": ["Gesa IAlbert", "ChristophSchell", "Karin MKirschner", "SebastianSch\u00e4fer", "RonaldNaumann", "AlexandraM\u00fcller", "OliverKretz", "BennoKuropka", "MathiasGirbig", "NorbertH\u00fcbner", "EberhardKrause", "HolgerScholz", "Tobias BHuber", "Klaus-PeterKnobeloch", "ChristianFreund"], "doi": "10.1093/jmcb/mjv039"}

The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. We demonstrated that the new endocrine factor EG-VEGF controls the same processes as those described for PPAR\u03b3, suggesting potential regulation of EG-VEGF by PPAR\u03b3. EG-VEGF exerts its functions via prokineticin receptor 1 (PROKR1) and 2 (PROKR2). This study sought to investigate whether EG-VEGF mediates part of PPAR\u03b3 effects on placental development. Three approaches were used: 1) in vitro, using human primary isolated cytotrophoblasts and the extravillous trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo); 2) ex vivo, using human placental explants (n = 46 placentas); and 3) in vivo, using gravid wild-type PPAR\u03b3(+/-) and PPAR\u03b3(-/-) mice. Major processes of placental development that are known to be controlled by PPAR\u03b3, such as trophoblast proliferation, migration, and invasion, were assessed in the absence or presence of PROKR1 and PROKR2 antagonists. In both human trophoblast cell and placental explants, we demonstrated that rosiglitazone, a PPAR\u03b3 agonist, 1) increased EG-VEGF secretion, 2) increased EG-VEGF and its receptors mRNA and protein expression, 3) increased placental vascularization via PROKR1 and PROKR2, and 4) inhibited trophoblast migration and invasion via PROKR2. In the PPAR\u03b3(-/-) mouse placentas, EG-VEGF levels were significantly decreased, supporting an in vivo control of EG-VEGF/PROKRs system during pregnancy. The present data reveal EG-VEGF as a new mediator of PPAR\u03b3 effects during pregnancy and bring new insights into the fine mechanism of trophoblast invasion.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Rat model of heterotopic toe allotransplantation.", "abstract": "Finger allotransplantation is a promising treatment for severe finger destruction. However, more research is required to decrease the risks of this procedure to a level at which the clinical use of this non-life-saving procedure is justified. A proper animal model is essential for the required experiments.\nIn this article, we established a toe transplantation model based on anatomic studies. A tapered dose of Cyclosporine A (CsA) was used as an immunosuppressive therapy in the Brown Norway-to-Lewis allotransplantation experimental group, whereas isotransplantation or allotransplantation without treatment or with ligated pedicles was performed on the control groups. Recipients were assessed daily after operation for any signs of rejection and complications. On postoperative day 90, skin graft test was used to test the level of donor-specific tolerance in the recipients. On postoperative day 120, x-rays and micro-computed tomographies were performed for bone morphology evaluation. The chimerism in the recipient peripheral blood, lymph node, spleen, and thymus was tested by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining. And histologic study of the toe grafts and skin grafts were carried out.\nThe blood supply of the toe graft was confirmed, and accordingly, transplantations were performed. The isografts survived indefinitely. The allografts with ligated pedicles experienced necrosis within 5 d. The allografts without treatment exhibited necrosis within 14 d. Forty percent, 20%, and 40% of the allografts associated with the CsA treatment experienced severe rejection, mild rejection, and nonrejection, according to gross graft appearance, respectively. Skin grafting tests showed three different types of results. X-rays and micro-computed tomographies reveal nearly normal bone morphologies in the bone structures of all surviving animals with grafts. Low levels of donor-specific chimerism were detected in the peripheral blood samples. Spleen, lymph node, and thymus chimerism were also confirmed in the long-term surviving animals with allografts. Histologic evaluation of the long-term survivals revealed similar graft morphologies in the isografts and the nonrejected allografts, inflammatory cell infiltration in the mildly rejected allografts, and degraded cutaneous appendages in the severely rejected allografts.\nWe established a toe allotransplantation model. Moreover, the low rate of chimerism did not introduce specific tolerance, which might explain the high rejection rate.

{"title": "Mutant p53 cooperates with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to regulate VEGFR2 in breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "Mutant p53 impacts the expression of numerous genes at the level of transcription to mediate oncogenesis. We identified vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), the primary functional VEGF receptor that mediates endothelial cell vascularization, as a mutant p53 transcriptional target in multiple breast cancer cell lines. Up-regulation of VEGFR2 mediates the role of mutant p53 in increasing cellular growth in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions. Mutant p53 binds near the VEGFR2 promoter transcriptional start site and plays a role in maintaining an open conformation at that location. Relatedly, mutant p53 interacts with the SWI/SNF complex, which is required for remodeling the VEGFR2 promoter. By both querying individual genes regulated by mutant p53 and performing RNA sequencing, the results indicate that >40% of all mutant p53-regulated gene expression is mediated by SWI/SNF. We surmise that mutant p53 impacts transcription of VEGFR2 as well as myriad other genes by promoter remodeling through interaction with and likely regulation of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Therefore, not only might mutant p53-expressing tumors be susceptible to anti VEGF therapies, impacting SWI/SNF tumor suppressor function in mutant p53 tumors may also have therapeutic potential.", "journal": "Genes & development", "date": "2015-06-18", "authors": ["Neil TPfister", "VitalayFomin", "KausikRegunath", "Jeffrey YZhou", "WenZhou", "LaxmiSilwal-Pandit", "William AFreed-Pastor", "OlegLaptenko", "Suat PengNeo", "JillBargonetti", "MainulHoque", "BinTian", "JayanthaGunaratne", "OlavEngebraaten", "James LManley", "Anne-LiseB\u00f8rresen-Dale", "Paul MNeilsen", "CarolPrives"], "doi": "10.1101/gad.263202.115"}

Cell culture studies have shown that Cx37 is necessary for coordinated activation of the transcription factor NFATc1, which cooperates with Foxc2 (another transcription factor) during lymphatic endothelial development. These data suggest that Cxs, Foxc2, and NFATc1 are part of a common developmental pathway. Here, we present a detailed characterization of Foxc2(+/-)Cx37(-/-) mice, demonstrating that lymphatic network architecture and valve formation rely on the concurrent embryonic expression and function of Foxc2 and Cx37. Foxc2(+/-)Cx37(-/-) mice have lymphedema in utero, exhibit craniofacial abnormalities, show severe dilation of intestinal lymphatics, display abnormal lacteal development, lack lymphatic valves, and typically die perinatally (outcomes not seen in Foxc2(+/-) or Cx37(-/-) mice separately). We provide a rigorous, quantitative documentation of lymphatic vascular network changes that highlight the specific structural alterations that occur in Foxc2(+/-)Cx37(-/-) mice. These data provide further evidence suggesting that Foxc2 and Cx37 are elements in a common molecular pathway directing lymphangiogenesis.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2015-06-17", "authors": ["John DKanady", "Stephanie JMunger", "Marlys HWitte", "Alexander MSimon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.06.004"}
{"title": "Hyperlipidemia Alters Regulatory T Cell Function and Promotes Resistance to Tolerance Induction Through Costimulatory Molecule Blockade.", "abstract": "Recent work from our laboratory has shown that hyperlipidemia promotes accelerated rejection of vascularized cardiac allografts in mice by inducing anti-donor Th17 reactivity and production of IL-17. Here, we show that hyperlipidemia also affects FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs). Hyperlipidemia promotes the development of Tregs that express low levels of CD25. Hyperlipidemia also promotes a decrease in central Tregs and an increase in effector Tregs that appears to account for the increase in the frequency of CD25(low) Tregs. Alterations in Treg subsets also appear to lead to alterations in Treg function. The ability of FoxP3(+) , CD25(high) , CD4(+) Tregs from hyperlipidemic mice to inhibit proliferation of effector T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and CD28 was reduced when compared with Tregs from control mice. Regulatory T cells isolated from hyperlipidemic recipients exhibit increased activation of Akt, and a reduction in Bim levels that permits the expansion of FoxP3(+) CD25(low) CD4(+) T cells. Hyperlipidemic mice were also resistant to tolerance induction using costimulatory molecule blockade consisting of anti-CD154 and CTLA4Ig, a strategy that requires Tregs. Together, our data suggest that hyperlipidemia profoundly affects Treg subsets and function as well as the ability to induce tolerance.", "journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "date": "2015-06-17", "authors": ["JBagley", "JYuan", "AChandrakar", "JIacomini"], "doi": "10.1111/ajt.13351"}
{"title": "A cellular Potts model analyzing differentiated cell behavior during in vivo vascularization of a hypoxic tissue.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessel networks from existing capillary or post-capillary venules, is an intrinsically multiscale process occurring in several physio-pathological conditions. In particular, hypoxic tissue cells activate downstream cascades culminating in the secretion of a wide range of angiogenic factors, including VEGF isoforms. Such diffusive chemicals activate the endothelial cells (ECs) forming the external walls of the nearby vessels that chemotactically migrate toward the hypoxic areas of the tissue as multicellular sprouts. A functional network eventually emerges by further branching and anastomosis processes. We here propose a CPM-based approach reproducing selected features of the angiogenic progression necessary for the reoxygenation of a hypoxic tissue. Our model is able to span the different scale involved in the angiogenic progression as it incorporates reaction-diffusion equations for the description of the evolution of microenvironmental variables in a discrete mesoscopic cellular Potts model (CPM) that reproduces the dynamics of the vascular cells. A key feature of this work is the explicit phenotypic differentiation of the ECs themselves, distinguished in quiescent, stalk and tip. The simulation results allow identifying a set of key mechanisms underlying tissue vascularization. Further, we provide evidence that the nascent pattern is characterized by precise topological properties. Finally, we link abnormal sprouting angiogenesis with alteration in selected cell behavior.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2015-06-17", "authors": ["MarcoScianna", "EleonoraBassino", "LucaMunaron"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2015.05.020"}

A major focus in urology is the identification of new biomarkers with improved accuracy in patients with low-risk prostate cancer. Here, we evaluated two-dimensional neovascular complexity in prostate tumor and nontumor biopsy cores by use of a computer-aided image analysis system and assessed the correlations between the results and selected clinical and pathological parameters of prostate carcinoma.\nA total of 280 prostate biopsy sections from a homogeneous series of 70 patients with low-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score 3+3, prostate-specific antigen [PSA]<10 ng/mL, and clinical stage T1c) who underwent systematic biopsy sampling and subsequent radical prostatectomy were analyzed. For each biopsy, 2-\u00b5m sections were treated with CD34 antibodies and were digitized by using an image analysis system that automatically estimates the surface fractal dimension.\nOur results showed that biopsy sections without cancer were significantly more vascularized than were tumors. No correlations were found between the vascular surface fractal dimension and patient's age, PSA and free-to-total PSA ratios, pathological stage, Gleason score, tumor volume, vascular invasion, capsular penetration, surgical margins, and biochemical recurrence.\nThe value of angiogenesis in prostate cancer is still controversial.

The lateral thigh area is also a useful donor site for nerve grafts. The lateral femoral cutaneous (LFC) nerve can be dissected along with the ALT flap for a substantial length, depending on the requirements of the recipient site. The LFC nerve can be used as a vascularized or non-vascularized nerve graft. The technique offers advantages and it can find clinical applications, satisfying the functional and aesthetic reconstructive requirements of a complex defect. We report the case of a patient who presented with traumatic soft tissue defect of the volar aspect of the wrist and ulnar nerve defect as a complication of a fracture of distal radius. An ALT flap was used to reconstruct the soft tissue defect. The ulnar nerve was resected due to necrosis and the gap was repaired with non-vascularized grafts of the anterior branch of the LFC nerve. The soft tissues were resurfaced successfully without complications. Functional recovery was good for the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve, whereas it was variable for the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The anterolateral thigh area offers significant advantages as donor site in the reconstruction of complex soft tissue defects being a large source of vascularized skin, fat, fascia, muscle and nerve.

Combination of modified free vascularized fibular grafting (FVFG) and a reverse LISS may provide a reasonable means to salvage a painless, functional and native hip. Between August 2010 and August 2012, sixteen patients with femoral neck nonunion were treated with a combined procedure involving modified free vascularized fibular grafting and a reverse LISS. The average age of them is 20.3 years (range 12.0-28.0 years). After removing old implants, the nonunion site was debrided, reduced and fixed with a LISS. The fibular grafts were compacted into a trough in the femoral neck. The Harris Hip score system was used to assess hip function and anteroposterior and frog-lateral hip roentgenograms were used to evaluate bone healing. All femoral neck nonunion healed without severe complications. The mean follow-up time was 32.9 months (range 23.0-47.0 months) and the average union time was 7.6 months (range 5.0-10.0 months).

{"title": "Pooled thrombin-activated platelet-rich plasma: a substitute for fetal bovine serum in the engineering of osteogenic/vasculogenic grafts.", "abstract": "The use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) as a culture medium supplement in cell therapy and clinical tissue engineering is challenged by immunological concerns and the risk of disease transmission. Here we tested whether human, thrombin-activated, pooled, platelet-rich plasma (tPRP) can be substituted for FBS in the engineering of osteogenic and vasculogenic grafts, using cells from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of human adipose tissue. SVF cells were cultured under perfusion flow into porous hydroxyapatite scaffolds for 5\u2009days, with the medium supplemented with either 10% tPRP or 10% FBS and implanted in an ectopic mouse model. Following in vitro culture, as compared to FBS, the use of tPRP did not modify the fraction of clonogenic cells or the different cell phenotypes, but increased by 1.9-fold the total number of cells. After 8\u2009weeks in vivo, bone tissue was formed more reproducibly and in higher amounts (3.7-fold increase) in constructs cultured with tPRP. Staining for human-specific ALU sequences and for the human isoforms of CD31/CD34 revealed the human origin of the bone, the formation of blood vessels by human vascular progenitors and a higher density of human cells in implants cultured with tPRP. In summary, tPRP supports higher efficiency of bone formation by SVF cells than FBS, likely by enhancing cell expansion in vitro while maintaining vasculogenic properties. The use of tPRP may facilitate the clinical translation of osteogenic grafts with intrinsic capacity for vascularization, based on the use of adipose-derived cells.

Most (80%) of them are located on the sylvian bifurcation, the seat of hemodynamic turbulence flow. Morbidity and mortality related to surgery of MCA aneurysms are not negligible. MCA vascularization areas are important eloquence functional territorial of Brain tissue. Indocyanine green videoangiography assistance (ICG-VA) is an emergent tool for intraoperative assessment of aneurysmal occlusion and for checking a possible stenosant clip in vascular area. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the safety of clipping procedure in terms of morbidity, mortality, and efficiency of aneurysm occlusion without using ICG-VA, recurrence and bleeding/rebleeding at short and long terms, and angiographic and clinical follow-ups.\nThis study is a monocentric retrospective study performed at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re-Charles Foix Hospital Center, reporting clinical and angiographic follow-up of consecutive patients treated for MCA aneurysms (ruptured and unruptured) by clipping procedures. From 2002-2012, 251 consecutive patients were admitted at the author's institution for treatment of 263 MCA aneurysms (163 ruptured and 100 unruptured). Procedure-related death and complications were systematically assessed without video-angiography availability. The degree of aneurysms exclusion was evaluated according to the Raymond-Roy scale after the procedure and at long-term angiographic follow-up (mean delay = 36 months).\nThe death rate related to aneurysmal exclusion procedure was 1.2%. The major complication rate related to surgery was 5.3%. Postprocedure, an aneurysm occlusion rate Raymond-Roy grade A or B was 95.6%. Neither recanalization controlled clipped aneurysms nor re-aneurysmal rupture was observed in the long-term clinical follow-up (mean time = 83.5 months). The institution's series of surgical outcomes reported 95.6% of complete exclusion and 4.5% incomplete procedures without ICG-VA. A clip of repositioning rate was estimated at 15% when ICG-VA was used.\nSurgical management is relatively safe for patients, with an acceptable complication rate in the era when ICG-VA was not yet available. Indeed, the main source of procedural ischemia microsurgery is stenosant clip. To limit the occurrence of malposition, the author's center began using ICG-VA a few months ago and expects to reduce its rate of incomplete occlusion.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2015-06-16", "authors": ["SabrinaHallout"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2015.05.069"}
{"title": "Modulation of the tumor vasculature and oxygenation to improve therapy.", "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment is increasingly recognized as a major factor influencing the success of therapeutic treatments and has become a key focus for cancer research. The progressive growth of a tumor results in an inability of normal tissue blood vessels to oxygenate and provide sufficient nutritional support to tumor cells. As a consequence the expanding neoplastic cell population initiates its own vascular network which is both structurally and functionally abnormal. This aberrant vasculature impacts all aspects of the tumor microenvironment including the cells, extracellular matrix, and extracellular molecules which together are essential for the initiation, progression and spread of tumor cells. The physical conditions that arise are imposing and manifold, and include elevated interstitial pressure, localized extracellular acidity, and regions of oxygen and nutrient deprivation. No less important are the functional consequences experienced by the tumor cells residing in such environments: adaptation to hypoxia, cell quiescence, modulation of transporters and critical signaling molecules, immune escape, and enhanced metastatic potential. Together these factors lead to therapeutic barriers that create a significant hindrance to the control of cancers by conventional anticancer therapies. However, the aberrant nature of the tumor microenvironments also offers unique therapeutic opportunities. Particularly interventions that seek to improve tumor physiology and alleviate tumor hypoxia will selectively impair the neoplastic cell populations residing in these environments. Ultimately, by combining such therapeutic strategies with conventional anticancer treatments it may be possible to bring cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis to a halt.", "journal": "Pharmacology & therapeutics", "date": "2015-06-16", "authors": ["Dietmar WSiemann", "Michael RHorsman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pharmthera.2015.06.006"}

The concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its soluble receptors 1 and 2 (sVEGF-R1, sVEGF-R2), and angiopoietins 1 and 2 (ANG-1, ANG-2) were evaluated in 43 JIA patients and 23 healthy controls.

VEGF and its receptors' (sVEGF-R1, sVEGF-R2) serum levels were significantly higher in JIA patients (p = 0.002). We found large variation in serum ANG-1 and ANG-2 levels. The PDUS imaging identified increased synovial microvascular blood flow in 15 (35.7%) examined JIA children. Intensity of joint vascularization correlated with higher serum VEGF and its levels was lowest in grade 0 and highest in grade 3 (p < 0.007 and p < 0.001, resp.).

Of the treated patients, 85 eyes belonged to male patients and 41 eyes belonged to female patients. Patients were aged 10-77 years (mean age 46.14 \u00b1 8.20 years). Surgical methods included penetrating keratoplasty (75 eyes) and lamellar keratoplasty (38 eyes). Follow-up time ranged from 0.5 to 3 years and a total of seven pre-operative keratopathies were observed: walleye, corneal ulcer, bullous keratopathy, corneal degeneration. Eye changes included 72 cases of limbal vascularization and 15 cases of high intraocular pressure. Allograft rejection was observed in 25 eyes.\nThe pre-operative keratopathies associated with the highest incidences of allograft rejection were: viral corneal ulcer, bullous keratopathy, adhesive walleye, and fungal corneal ulcers. The rate of allograft rejection using avascular corneal tissue was 10%, while the rate was 36% with severly-vascularized cornea. The earliest time of rejection was 20 days after surgery, while the latest was 16.4 months after surgery. Heavy corneal vascularization is associated with more rapid post-operative rejection. The rate of allograft rejection was higher after combined surgery when compared to penetrating keratoplasty or lamellar keratoplasty alone, while the rate was higher with penetrating keratoplasty than with lamellar keratoplasty. With increasing graft diameter, there was an increase in post-operative allograft rejection. Allograft rejection was significantly increased when graft diameter was above 7.75 mm.\nThe major cause of corneal allograft rejection is viral corneal ulcers.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and \u03b1-crystallins have been identified to mediate the pathogenesis of retinopathy.

Therefore, we examined the expression and distribution of VEGF, \u03b1A- and \u03b1B-crystallins in the retina using a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR).\n90 C57/BL mice were randomly divided into the OIR and control groups. The OIR group at postnatal day 7 (P7) were kept at high oxidation state (75 \u00b1 5%) for 5 days before returned to normal environment. Retinal tissue was cut into sections. Oxygen induced retinal neovascularization and vascular structural changes were evaluated using retinal fluorescein angiography. The number of endothelial cell nuclei breaking through the retinal internal limiting membrane was counted after H&E staining. The mRNA expression levels of VEGF, \u03b1A- and \u03b1B-crystallins in the mouse retina were determined using real-time RT-PCR. The distribution of \u03b1A- and \u03b1B-crystallins in the retina was detected by fluorescent immunohistochemistry staining.\nOxygen induction triggered new blood vessel formation in the retina and impaired the structure of the retinal vascular network. The number of endothelial cell nuclei breaking through the retinal internal limiting membrane was significantly increased in the OIR group compared to the control group at P13, P17 and P21 (P < 0.01), reaching the peak on P17. The expression levels of VEGF, \u03b1A- and \u03b1B-crystalllins were also significantly different between the OIR and control groups.

Long-term viability of tissue-engineered skin substitutes requires the formation and maturation of neo-vessels to optimize survival and biointegration after implantation. A number of studies have demonstrated the capacity of Adipose Derived Regenerative Cells (ADRCs) to promote angiogenesis and modulate inflammation. On this basis, it was hypothesized that adding ADRCs to a collagen-based matrix (CBM) (i.e. Integra) would enhance formation and maturation of well-organized wound tissue in the setting of acute thermal burns. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether seeding uncultured ADRCs onto CBM would improve matrix properties and enhance healing of the grafted wound.\nFull thickness thermal burns were created on the backs of 8 Gottingen mini-swine. Two days post-injury wounds underwent fascial excision and animals were randomized to receive either Integra seeded with either uncultured ADRCs or control vehicle. Wound healing assessment was performed by digital wound imaging, histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses.\nIn vitro analysis demonstrated that freshly isolated ADRCs adhered and propagated on the CBM. Histological scoring revealed accelerated maturation of wound bed tissue in wounds receiving ADRCs-loaded CBM compared to vehicle-loaded CBM. This was associated with a significant increase in depth of the wound bed tissue and collagen deposition (p<0.05). Blood vessel density in the wound bed was 50% to 69.6% greater in wounds receiving ADRCs-loaded CBM compared to vehicle-loaded CBM (p=0.05) at day 14 and 21. In addition, ADRCs delivered with CBM showed increased blood vessel lumen area and blood vessel maturation at day 21(p=0.05). Interestingly, vascularity and overall cellularity within the CBM were 50% and 45% greater in animals receiving ADRC loaded scaffolds compared to CBM alone (p<0.05).\nThese data demonstrate that seeding uncultured ADRCs onto CBM dermal substitute enhances wound angiogenesis, blood vessel maturation and matrix remodeling.", "journal": "Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries", "date": "2015-06-11", "authors": ["PhilippeFoubert", "SamuelBarillas", "Andreina DGonzalez", "ZeniAlfonso", "SherryZhao", "IsaacHakim", "CarolMeschter", "MayerTenenhaus", "John KFraser"], "doi": "10.1016/j.burns.2015.05.004"}

Operative outcomes and subjective functional evaluation was performed. Of these, 44 patients could be evaluated for functional outcomes, and bite force was measured with an occlusal force meter in 24 patients.\nMajor surgical complications required secondary revisional surgery developed in four patients. A normal diet was possible in 37 patients (84.1%), and a soft diet was possible in 7 patients (15.9%). Conversational ability was rated as excellent in 42 patients (95.5%). The mean bite force on the nonaffected side of the mandible was 187.7 N, and bite force decreased as the number of osteotomies in the VFG increased. Furthermore, bite force was significantly lower (P\u2009=\u20090.001) on the affected side (58.2 N), compared to nonaffected side (191.9 N).\nAlthough masticatory force decreases as the number of osteotomies increases, oral function after mandible reconstruction is satisfactory in most cases. Transfer of a VFG is a safe and reliable method for functional mandible reconstruction. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Characterization and staging of rectal tumors: endoscopic ultrasound versus MRI / CT. Pictorial essay.", "abstract": "Endoscopic ultrasound is recommended for rectal cancer staging. Transrectal ultrasound approach is able to overcome one of the limitations of this technique regarding circumferential rectal stenosis. Prior intrarectal administration of a small amount of fluid contrast agent optimizes the method, making it easier to distinguish the layers of the rectal wall and tumor formation. Endoscopic ultrasound focuses on the gray-scale mode. Additional procedures provide useful information for tumor assessment: Doppler ultrasound helps identify chaotic intratumoral vascularization; 3D ultrasound allows the assessment and accurate measurement of the tumor; elastography can identify focal tumor dysplasia within adenomas; contrast-enhanced ultrasound allows characterization of tumor microvasculature. Even if they are not as accurate in distinguishing rectal wall layers, cross-sectional imaging techniques (CT, MRI) can identify the anatomical relationships of advanced locoregional cancers, as well as possible distant metastasis.

The subjects were successively evaluated by 4 rheumatologists: 2 experienced (team A) and 2 beginners (team B) in US. Seven dorsal and palmar longitudinal scanning positions and a supplementary scan for MCP cartilage were performed. The bone surface (erosions, osteophytes), the intra-articular content (synovial thickening and vascularization, 4 grade scale), and the aspect of the metacarpal head cartilage were analyzed. The anterior palmar recess was measured. The time for examination was recorded.\nErosions were detected in 7% of joints by team A and 2% by team B (p<0.05, kappa agreement 0.567) in subjects over 40 years. The agreement by team A in the detection of the erosions was very good (kappa value 0.83). A moderate positive correlation was obtained between the presence of erosions and age (r= 0.401, p=0.004). Osteophytes were identified only on the dorsal scan in subjects over 50 years (in 3.5% of joints team A, 1.5% team B, p>0.05, kappa value 0.421). No grade 1 synovitis was observed by team A but 4 joints with grade 1 synovitis were identified by team B (p<0.05) from the dorsal scan. The dimensions of the palmar recess had large distribution (MCP 2 between 0.55-1.3 mm; MCP 5 between 0.6-1.2 mm). No statistical significant differences were obtained when comparing the dimensions of the two hands, the values obtained in age-groups (all p>0.05). No statistical significant correlations were obtained between the dimensions of palmar recess and the body mass index or dominant hand (all p>0.05). No pathological findings were found in the examination of the metacarpal head cartilage. Power Doppler investigation found the presence of grade 1 signal in 2.5% joints by team A and 1.5% by team B (p>0.05) only in the dorsal scans. The mean time for examination was 7.8+/-1.74 min in team A and 13.78+/-2.96 min in team B (p<0.05).\nIn healthy subjects pathological findings are occasionally encountered, especially erosions and osteophytes.

In this review, we discuss the various biomaterial-based approaches that are being implemented to direct stem cell fate both in vitro and in vivo. First, we discuss the stem cell types available for cardiac repair and the engineering of naturally and synthetically derived biomaterials to direct their in vitro differentiation to the cell types that comprise heart tissue. Next, we describe biomaterial-based approaches that are being implemented to enhance the in vivo integration and differentiation of stem cells delivered to areas of cardiac damage.

{"title": "NRP1 Regulates CDC42 Activation to Promote Filopodia Formation in Endothelial Tip Cells.", "abstract": "Sprouting blood vessels are led by filopodia-studded endothelial tip cells that respond to angiogenic signals. Mosaic lineage tracing previously revealed that NRP1 is essential for tip cell function, although its mechanistic role in tip cells remains poorly defined. Here, we show that NRP1 is dispensable for genetic tip cell identity. Instead, we find that NRP1 is essential to form the filopodial bursts that distinguish tip cells morphologically from neighboring stalk cells, because it enables the extracellular matrix (ECM)-induced activation of CDC42, a key regulator of filopodia formation. Accordingly, NRP1 knockdown and pharmacological CDC42 inhibition similarly impaired filopodia formation in vitro and in developing zebrafish in vivo. During mouse retinal angiogenesis, CDC42 inhibition impaired tip cell and vascular network formation, causing defects that resembled those due to loss of ECM-induced, but not VEGF-induced, NRP1 signaling. We conclude that NRP1 enables ECM-induced filopodia formation for tip cell function during sprouting angiogenesis.", "journal": "Cell reports", "date": "2015-06-09", "authors": ["AlessandroFantin", "AnastasiaLampropoulou", "GaiaGestri", "ClaudioRaimondi", "ValentinaSenatore", "IanZachary", "ChristianaRuhrberg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.celrep.2015.05.018"}

We addressed these questions at single-cell resolution in zebrafish embryos. We identify the GPI-anchored MMP inhibitor Reck and the adhesion GPCR Gpr124 as integral components of a Wnt7a/Wnt7b-specific signaling complex required for brain angiogenesis and dorsal root ganglia neurogenesis. We further show that this atypical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway selectively controls endothelial tip cell function and hence, that mosaic restoration of single wild-type tip cells in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-deficient perineural vessels is sufficient to initiate the formation of CNS vessels.

Eight patients underwent resection of the fibula for the purpose of a vascularized fibular graft by a surgical team who practiced leaving at least 6\u2009cm residual distal fibula. The age of these children at the time of surgery was between 3 and 12 years. They were reviewed between 3 and 12 years after surgery. Two patients who underwent resection of the middle shaft of the fibula at 3 and 5 years of age developed abnormal growth of the distal tibia, leading to ankle valgus. They were treated with growth modulation of the distal tibial physis and supramalleolar osteotomy with tibiofibular synostosis. Another patient who underwent the entire proximal fibula resection at the age of 6 years had developed hindfoot valgus because of weakness of the tibialis posterior muscle. He required talonavicular fusion and flexor hallucis to tibialis posterior muscle transfer. Patients operated at the age of older than 8 years neither had ankle nor hindfoot deformity. We concluded that resection of the middle shaft of the fibula for the purpose of a vascularized fibula graft, leaving a 6\u2009cm distal fibular stump in children younger than 6 years old, may give rise to abnormal growth of the distal tibial physis, leading to valgus ankle.

Parameters investigated included survival, lung and heart histopathology, pulmonary fibrin and collagen deposition, vascular leakage, right ventricular hypertrophy, and differential mRNA expression in the lungs of key genes involved in BPD pathogenesis, including inflammation, coagulation, and alveolar development. After daily metformin treatment rat pups with experimental BPD had reduced mortality, alveolar septum thickness, lung inflammation, and fibrosis, demonstrated by a reduced influx of macrophages and neutrophils and hyperoxia-induced collagen III and fibrin deposition (25 mg/kg), as well as improved vascularization (100 mg/kg) compared with control treatment.

Recently, we succeeded in fabricating three-dimensional (3D) cell constructs composed of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the majority of cells within the constructs underwent necrosis due to a lack of nutrients and oxygen. We hypothesized that incorporation of vascular endothelial cells would improve the cell survival rate and aid in the fabrication of biomimetic bone tissues in vitro. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of endothelial cells combined with the MSC constructs (MSC/HUVEC constructs) during short- and long-term culture. When human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incorporated into the cell constructs, cell viability and growth factor production were increased after 7 days. Furthermore, HUVECs were observed to proliferate and self-organize into reticulate porous structures by interacting with the MSCs. After long-term culture, MSC/HUVEC constructs formed abundant mineralized matrices compared with those composed of MSCs alone.

{"title": "Identification of TAX2 peptide as a new unpredicted anti-cancer agent.", "abstract": "The multi-modular glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is considered as a key actor within the tumor microenvironment. Besides, TSP-1 binding to CD47 is widely reported to regulate cardiovascular function as it promotes vasoconstriction and angiogenesis limitation. Therefore, many studies focused on targeting TSP-1:CD47 interaction, aiming for up-regulation of physiological angiogenesis to enhance post-ischemia recovery or to facilitate engraftment. Thus, we sought to identify an innovative selective antagonist for TSP-1:CD47 interaction. Protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to design a novel CD47-derived peptide, called TAX2. TAX2 binds TSP-1 to prevent TSP-1:CD47 interaction, as revealed by ELISA and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Unexpectedly, TAX2 inhibits in vitro and ex vivo angiogenesis features in a TSP-1-dependent manner. Consistently, our data highlighted that TAX2 promotes TSP-1 binding to CD36-containing complexes, leading to disruption of VEGFR2 activation and downstream NO signaling. Such unpredicted results prompted us to investigate TAX2 potential in tumor pathology. A multimodal imaging approach was conducted combining histopathological staining, MVD, MRI analysis and \u03bcCT monitoring for tumor angiography longitudinal follow-up and 3D quantification.

Although vascular enhanced permeability and retention can aid targeting, high interstitial fluid pressure and dense extracellular matrix may hinder local penetration. Extravascular diffusivity depends upon nanoparticle size, surface modifications, and tissue vascularization. Gold nanoparticles functionalized with biologically-compatible layers may achieve improved uptake and distribution while enabling cytotoxicity through synergistic combination of chemotherapy and thermal ablation. Evaluation of nanoparticle uptake in vivo remains difficult, as detection methods are limited. We employ hyperspectral imaging of histology sections to analyze uptake and distribution of phosphatidylcholine-coated citrate gold nanoparticles (CGN) and silica-gold nanoshells (SGN) after tail-vein injection in mice bearing orthotopic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. For CGN, the liver and tumor showed 26.5 \u00b1 8.2 and 23.3 \u00b1 4.1 particles/100 \u03bcm2 within 10 \u03bcm from the nearest source and few nanoparticles beyond 50 \u03bcm, respectively.

{"title": "Vascularisation in regenerative therapeutics and surgery.", "abstract": "Vascularisation is often deemed the holy grail of tissue engineering because it is one of the key preconditions that determine the in vivo viability of tissue constructs. Given that a well-developed vascular network allows greater complexity in tissue design and helps regulate tissue metabolism, it appears that the overall outcome of engineered tissue implants depends on the success of microvessel formation, maturation and patterning. Current approaches to vascularising tissue include both in vivo and ex vivo techniques, where blood vessel formation is either spontaneous or guided by physical or biochemical factors. The success of these strategies can then be monitored and evaluated for clinical benefit through numerous standard and novel strategies. Despite the impressive progress in the field of tissue engineering in recent times, there are still numerous technical, immunological, surgical and ethical challenges to overcome. Future prospects in this field are likely to depend on the adoption of a wide-ranging approach incorporating a combination of salient themes such as genetic manipulation, modular assembly and bioreactor coupling.

{"title": "Prognostic value and in vitro biological relevance of Neuropilin 1 and Neuropilin 2 in osteosarcoma.", "abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma increased the long-term survival of patients with localized disease considerably but metastasizing osteosarcoma remained largely treatment resistant. Neuropilins, transmembrane glycoproteins, are important receptors for VEGF dependent hyper-vascularization in tumor angiogenesis and their aberrant expression promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in many solid tumors. Our analysis of Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) immunostaining in a tissue microarray of 66 osteosarcoma patients identified NRP2 as an indicator of poor overall, metastasis-free and progression free survival while NRP1 had no predictive value. Patients with tumors that expressed NRP2 in the absence of NRP1 had a significantly worse prognosis than NRP1(-)/NRP2(-), NRP1(+) or NRP1(+)/NRP2(+) tumors. Moreover, patients with overt metastases and with NRP2-positive primary tumors had a significantly shorter survival rate than patients with metastases but NRP2-negative tumors. Furthermore, the expression of both NRP1 and NRP2 in osteosarcoma cell lines correlated to a variable degree with the metastatic potential of the respective cell line. To address the functional relevance of Neuropilins for VEGF signaling we used shRNA mediated down-regulation and blocking antibodies of NRP1 and NRP2 in the metastatic 143B and HuO9-M132 cell lines. In 143B cells, VEGFA signaling monitored by AKT phosphorylation was more inhibited by blocking of NRP1, whereas in HuO9-M132 cells NRP2 blocking was more effective indicating that NRP1 and NRP2 can substitute each other in the functional interaction with VEGFR1. Altogether, these data point to NRP2 as a powerful prognostic marker in osteosarcoma and together with NRP1 as a novel target for tumor-suppressive therapy.", "journal": "American journal of translational research", "date": "2015-06-06", "authors": ["AleksandarBoro", "Matthias JeArlt", "HaraldLengnick", "BernhardRobl", "MarenHusmann", "JosefineBertz", "WalterBorn", "BrunoFuchs"], "doi": null}

It affects women primarily in the perimenopausal age group. ESSs are morphologically heterogeneous. The distinction between uterine smooth muscle tumors such as cellular leiomyoma and myxoid leiomyosarcoma and low-grade ESS can be problematic when stromal sarcomas show prominent smooth muscle differentiation and abundant myxoid stroma, respectively. We herein present a rare case of fibromyxoid variant of ESS, which was misdiagnosed as hydropic leiomyoma on intraoperative frozen section examination. Grossly, the uterine mass consisted of intracavitary and intramural portions. The intracavitary portion with extensive hydropic degeneration mimicked a hydropic leiomyoma. In contrast, the intramural portion displayed an obvious tongue-like myometrial invasion. Histologically, the tumor consisted of both cellular (20%) and myxoid (80%) areas. In the cellular areas, oval to spindle-shaped tumor cells with bland nuclear features were found to surround concentrically a rich vascular network of arterioles, a characteristic of ESS. In addition, two relatively well-circumscribed nodular lesions showing atypical bizarre nuclei were identified in the myxoid area. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were diffusely and strongly positive for CD10. The present case indicates a wide morphological spectrum of ESS. Fibromyxoid variant of ESS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intracavitary and/or intramural uterine mesenchymal tumors with myxoid differentiation. It is important to avoid confusion between fibromyxoid ESS and myxoid leiomyosarcoma because of the differences in their clinical course, treatment, and prognosis.", "journal": "International journal of clinical and experimental pathology", "date": "2015-06-06", "authors": ["Hyun-SooKim", "GunYoon", "Yoon YangJung", "Yoo-YoungLee", "Sang YongSong"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Tumor-derived microRNA-494 promotes angiogenesis in non-small cell lung cancer.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis, a crucial step in tumor growth and metastasis, is regulated by various pro- or anti-angiogenic factors. Recently, microRNAs have been shown to modulate angiogenic processes by modulating the expression of critical angiogenic factors. However, roles of tumor-derived microRNAs in regulating tumor vascularization remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that delivery of miR-494 into human vascular endothelial cells (ECs) enhanced the EC migration and promoted angiogenesis. The angiogenic effect of miR-494 was mediated by the targeting of PTEN and the subsequent activation of Akt/eNOS pathway. Importantly, co-culture experiments demonstrated that a lung cancer cell line, A549, secreted and delivered miR-494 into ECs via a microvesicle-mediated route. In addition, we found that the expression of miR-494 was induced in the tumor cells in response to hypoxia, likely via a HIF-1\u03b1-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, a specific miR-494 antagomiR effectively inhibited angiogenesis and attenuated the growth of tumor xenografts in nude mice.

The postoperative HHS were 83.8 \u00b1 17.9 points, and it revealed statistical significance when compared to preoperative 61.6 \u00b1 17.0 points (p < 0.05). The VAS scores were reduced from preoperative 6.2 \u00b1 2.0 points to postoperative 2.8 \u00b1 2.3 points, which also manifested outcomes significance (p < 0.05). From radiological aspects, 14 patients acquired well repairmen of the necrotic areas of the femoral head. However, the other 4 patients ultimately suffered femoral head collapse, and the severe pain was gotten rid of after THA surgeries were performed.\nThe un-collapsed hip can achieve biological stability and sufficient blood supply through the hip-preserving surgery and obtain longtime repairmen of the necrotic bone as well as early non-weight-bearing function training, which benefits from distributing the whole body weight load to the hip of one-stage THA. Consequently, we recommend this sort of surgery for clinical practice trial when faced bilateral ONFH in different stages though longer time follow-up and larger samples are essentially needed to address its efficacy.", "journal": "BMC musculoskeletal disorders", "date": "2015-06-05", "authors": ["YirongZeng", "XinyuQi", "WenjunFeng", "JieLi", "FeilongLi", "JianchunZeng", "ChunzhiYi", "JinlunChen"], "doi": "10.1186/s12891-015-0583-5\n10.1007/s11999-009-1159-1\n10.1007/s002640050335\n10.1007/s11999-008-0204-9\n10.1007/s002640050334\n10.1007/s00264-012-1773-5\n10.1016/S0883-5403(06)80086-0\n10.1007/s11999-008-0393-2\n10.1002/micr.20118\n10.1097/00003086-200105000-00015\n10.2106/JBJS.D.02593\n10.1186/1471-2474-8-78\n10.1097/01.blo.0000150312.53937.6f\n10.1007/s11999-008-0211-x"}
{"title": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C for Polycystic Kidney Diseases.", "abstract": "Polycystic kidney diseases (PKD) are genetic disorders characterized by progressive epithelial cyst growth leading to destruction of normally functioning renal tissue. Current therapies have focused on the cyst epithelium, and little is known about how the blood and lymphatic microvasculature modulates cystogenesis. Hypomorphic Pkd1(nl/nl) mice were examined, showing that cystogenesis was associated with a disorganized pericystic network of vessels expressing platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3). The major ligand for VEGFR3 is VEGFC, and there were lower levels of Vegfc mRNA within the kidneys during the early stages of cystogenesis in 7-day-old Pkd1(nl/nl) mice. Seven-day-old mice were treated with exogenous VEGFC for 2 weeks on the premise that this would remodel both the VEGFR3(+) pericystic vascular network and larger renal lymphatics that may also affect the severity of PKD. Treatment with VEGFC enhanced VEGFR3 phosphorylation in the kidney, normalized the pattern of the pericystic network of vessels, and widened the large lymphatics in Pkd1(nl/nl) mice. These effects were associated with significant reductions in cystic disease, BUN and serum creatinine levels. Furthermore, VEGFC administration reduced M2 macrophage pericystic infiltrate, which has been implicated in the progression of PKD. VEGFC administration also improved cystic disease in Cys1(cpk/cpk) mice, a model of autosomal recessive PKD, leading to a modest but significant increase in lifespan. Overall, this study highlights VEGFC as a potential new treatment for some aspects of PKD, with the possibility for synergy with current epithelially targeted approaches.", "journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "date": "2015-06-04", "authors": ["Jennifer LHuang", "Adrian SWoolf", "MariaKolatsi-Joannou", "PeterBaluk", "Richard NSandford", "Dorien J MPeters", "Donald MMcDonald", "Karen LPrice", "Paul J DWinyard", "David ALong"], "doi": "10.1681/ASN.2014090856"}

Most bones develop and heal by endochondral ossification, the replacement of a hypertrophic cartilaginous intermediary with bone. The hypothesis of this study is that a porous scaffold derived from decellularized tissue engineered hypertrophic cartilage will retain the necessary signals to instruct host cells to accelerate endogenous bone regeneration. Cartilage tissue (CT) and hypertrophic cartilage tissue (HT) were engineered using human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, decellularized and the remaining ECM was freeze-dried to generate porous scaffolds. When implanted subcutaneously in nude mice, only the decellularized HT-derived scaffolds were found to induce vascularization and de novo mineral accumulation. Furthermore, when implanted into critically-sized femoral defects, full bridging was observed in half of the defects treated with HT scaffolds, while no evidence of such bridging was found in empty controls. Host cells which had migrated throughout the scaffold were capable of producing new bone tissue, in contrast to fibrous tissue formation within empty controls. These results demonstrate the capacity of decellularized engineered tissues as 'off-the-shelf' implants to promote tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-06-04", "authors": ["Gr\u00e1inne MCunniffe", "TatianaVinardell", "J MaryMurphy", "Emmet MThompson", "AmosMatsiko", "Fergal JO'Brien", "Daniel JKelly"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.05.031"}

We are presenting here our experience of successfully using the modified Capanna technique of combining allograft and free vascularized fibular graft in treating large bone defects in the distal third of the femur.\nBetween April 2012 and October 2013, six patients with post-traumatic long segment bone loss in the distal femur had reconstruction of the bone defect by the Capanna technique. The average age was 33 years (range of 18-49 years). The bone defect ranged from 10 to 20 cm (average 15 cm). Five patients had primary reconstruction while one was done after allograft failure. Bone union time and occurrence of any complications were noted. Follow-up ranged from 7 to 24 months (average 15 months).\nAll grafts went onto union. No patient required secondary procedure to achieve union. Average time to union was 6 months.

We further characterized the Bst(+/-) mouse and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms to assess the feasibility of using this strain as a model for stem cell therapy of retinal degenerative diseases due to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss. We found that, although RGCs are significantly reduced in retinal ganglion cell layer in Bst(+/-) mouse, melanopsin(+) RGCs, also called ipRGCs, appear to be unchanged. Pupillary light reflex was completely absent in Bst(+/-) mice but they had a normal circadian rhythm. In order to examine the pathological abnormalities in Bst(+/-) mice, we performed electron microscopy in RGC and found that mitochondria morphology was deformed, having irregular borders and lacking cristae. The complex activities of the mitochondrial electron transport chain were significantly decreased. Finally, for subretinal vascularization, we also found that angiogenesis is delayed in Bst(+/-) associated with delayed hyaloid regression.

{"title": "Genetic Analysis Reveals a Longevity-Associated Protein Modulating Endothelial Function and Angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Long living individuals show delay of aging, which is characterized by the progressive loss of cardiovascular homeostasis, along with reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, endothelial dysfunction, and impairment of tissue repair after ischemic injury.\nExploit genetic analysis of long living individuals to reveal master molecular regulators of physiological aging and new targets for treatment of cardiovascular disease.\nWe show that the polymorphic variant rs2070325 (Ile229Val) in bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold-containing-family-B-member-4 (BPIFB4) associates with exceptional longevity, under a recessive genetic model, in 3 independent populations. Moreover, the expression of BPIFB4 is instrumental to maintenance of cellular and vascular homeostasis through regulation of protein synthesis. BPIFB4 phosphorylation/activation by protein-kinase-R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase induces its complexing with 14-3-3 and heat shock protein 90, which is facilitated by the longevity-associated variant. In isolated vessels, BPIFB4 is upregulated by mechanical stress, and its knock-down inhibits endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. In hypertensive rats and old mice, gene transfer of longevity-associated variant-BPIFB4 restores endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling, rescues endothelial dysfunction, and reduces blood pressure levels. Furthermore, BPIFB4 is implicated in vascular repair. BPIFB4 is abundantly expressed in circulating CD34(+) cells of long living individuals, and its knock-down in endothelial progenitor cells precludes their capacity to migrate toward the chemoattractant SDF-1. In a murine model of peripheral ischemia, systemic gene therapy with longevity-associated variant-BPIFB4 promotes the recruitment of hematopoietic stem cells, reparative vascularization, and reperfusion of the ischemic muscle.\nLongevity-associated variant-BPIFB4 may represent a novel therapeutic tool to fight endothelial dysfunction and promote vascular reparative processes.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2015-06-03", "authors": ["FrancescoVilla", "AlbinoCarrizzo", "Chiara CSpinelli", "AnnaFerrario", "AlbertoMalovini", "AnnaMaci\u0105g", "AntonioDamato", "AlbertoAuricchio", "GaiaSpinetti", "ElenaSangalli", "ZexuDang", "MicheleMadonna", "MariateresaAmbrosio", "LeopoldoSitia", "PaoloBigini", "GaetanoCal\u00ec", "StefanSchreiber", "ThomasPerls", "SergioFucile", "FrancescaMulas", "AlmutNebel", "RiccardoBellazzi", "PaoloMadeddu", "CarmineVecchione", "Annibale APuca"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305875\n10.1126/science.1141448\n10.1016/j.tibs.2012.03.002\n10.1126/science.1083701\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.003\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.09.013\n10.1038/nature04958\n10.1016/j.arr.2011.11.005\n10.1113/jphysiol.2009.172916\n10.1126/science.1117728\n10.1155/2012/918267\n10.1093/cvr/cvs143\n10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.02051.x\n10.1001/archinternmed.2007.75\n10.1073/pnas.122587599\n10.1073/pnas.1120658109\n10.1042/BST0390977\n10.1007/s10522-007-9116-4\n10.1073/pnas.1936249100\n10.1016/j.mad.2011.06.008\n10.1089/rej.2010.1114\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.236786\n10.1161/01.RES.0000137877.89448.78\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.179952\n10.1016/j.tcm.2004.10.001\n10.1084/jem.20040995\n10.1161/01.RES.0000200440.18768.30\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.12.035\n10.1016/j.tcb.2013.09.002\n10.1038/nbt0307-285\n10.1074/jbc.R400008200\n10.1074/jbc.M205141200\n10.1074/jbc.M803638200\n10.1186/1742-4933-9-26\n10.1038/mt.2008.76\n10.1093/cvr/cvr288\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.254664\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.148254\n10.1161/01.HYP.0000177474.06749.98\n10.1172/JCI1560\n10.1073/pnas.0801030105\n10.1038/ng0194-29\n10.1073/pnas.0809594106\n10.1002/ajh.21440\n10.1186/1742-4933-9-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0071359"}

Furthermore, increased collagen deposition within the wound bed led to faster wound contraction and greater wound vascularization.

The morphological indicators of microvessel density are recommended to use as addi- tional criteria for determining the prognosis of the disease, designing targeted anti-angiogenic drugs, and evaluating the efficiency of performed therapy.\n\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043b\u043b\u044e\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430 (\u0413\u0426\u0420). \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u043b\u043b\u044f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0413\u0426\u0420. \u041c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432, \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u041f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0413\u0426\u0420 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438. \u041c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u044d\u0444\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0438.", "journal": "Arkhiv patologii", "date": "2015-06-02", "authors": ["U NTumanova", "A IShchegolev"], "doi": "10.17116/patol201577250-55"}

{"title": "Hematopoietic stem cell-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts are novel contributors to the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.", "abstract": "Targeting the tumor microenvironment is critical toward improving the effectiveness of cancer therapeutics. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most abundant cell types of the tumor microenvironment, playing an important role in tumor progression. Multiple origins for CAFs have been proposed including resident fibroblasts, adipocytes, and bone marrow. Our laboratory previously identified a novel hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin for CAFs; however, the functional roles of HSC-derived CAFs (HSC-CAFs) in tumor progression have not yet been examined. To test the hypothesis that HSC-CAFs promote tumor progression through contribution to extracellular matrix (ECM) and paracrine production of pro-angiogenic factors, we developed a method to isolate HSC-CAFs. HSC-CAFs were profiled on the basis of their expression of hematopoietic and fibroblastic markers in two murine tumor models. Profiling revealed production of factors associated with ECM deposition and remodeling. Functional in vivo studies showed that co-injection of HSC-CAFs with tumor cells resulted in increased tumor growth rate and significantly larger tumors than tumor cells alone. Immunohistochemical studies revealed increased blood vessel density with co-injection, demonstrating a role for HSC-CAFs in tumor vascularization. Mechanistic in vitro studies indicated that HSC-CAFs play a role in producing vascular endothelial growth factor A and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 in endothelial tube formation and patterning. In vitro and in vivo findings suggest that HSC-CAFs are a critical component of the tumor microenvironment and suggest that targeting the novel HSC-CAF may be a promising therapeutic strategy.", "journal": "Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2015-05-31", "authors": ["Lindsay TMcDonald", "Dayvia LRussell", "Ryan RKelly", "YingXiong", "AnjanMotamarry", "Risha KPatel", "Jeffrey AJones", "Patricia MWatson", "David PTurner", "Dennis KWatson", "Adam CSoloff", "Victoria JFindlay", "Amanda CLaRue"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neo.2015.04.004"}

{"title": "Increased Serine-Arginine (SR) Protein Phosphorylation Changes Pre-mRNA Splicing in Hypoxia.", "abstract": "The removal of introns from mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression. The splicing machinery heavily contributes to biological complexity and especially to the ability of cells to adapt to altered cellular conditions. Inhibitory PAS domain protein (IPAS), a dominant negative regulator of hypoxia-inducible gene expression, is generated from hypoxia inducible transcription factor-3\u03b1 (HIF-3\u03b1) pre-mRNA by an alternative splicing mechanism. Inactivation of the IPAS transcript in mice leads to the neo-vascularization of the cornea, suggesting that IPAS is an important regulator of anti-angiogenesis in this tissue. For the first time we demonstrate that serine-arginine (SR) proteins are involved in oxygen tension-dependent changes in pre-mRNA splicing. SR proteins isolated from hypoxic cells differentially interact with RNA (compared with proteins isolated from cells cultured under normoxic conditions). They possess the differential ability to activate hypoxia-dependent splice sites, and they are more phosphorylated than those isolated from normoxic HeLa cells. We also show that expression of SR protein kinases (CLK1, SRPK1, SRPK2) in hypoxic cells is elevated at mRNA and protein levels. Increased expression of CLK1 kinase is regulated by HIFs. Reduction of CLK1 cellular expression levels reduces hypoxia-dependent full-length carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) mRNA and CAIX protein formation and changes hypoxia-dependent cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61) mRNA isoform formation profiles.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2015-05-30", "authors": ["EgleJakubauskiene", "LaurynasVilys", "YuichiMakino", "LorenzPoellinger", "ArvydasKanopka"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M115.639690"}

Proliferation of hepatic parenchyma is intimately dependent on angiogenesis and resident macrophage-derived cytokines. However the role of circulating monocyte interactions in vascular and hepatic regeneration is not well-defined. We investigated the role of these interactions in regeneration in the presence and absence of intact monocyte adhesion.\nPartial hepatectomy was performed in wild-type mice and those lacking the monocyte adhesion molecule CD11b. Vascular architecture, angiogenesis and macrophage location were analyzed in the whole livers using simultaneous angiography and macrophage staining with fluorescent multiphoton microscopy. Monocyte adhesion molecule expression and sprouting-related pathways were evaluated.\nResident macrophages (Kupffer cells) did not migrate to interact with vessels whereas infiltrating monocytes were found adjacent to sprouting points. Infiltrated monocytes colocalized with Wnt5a, angiopoietin 1 and Notch-1 in contact points and commensurate with phosphorylation and disruption of VE-cadherin. Mice deficient in CD11b showed a severe reduction in angiogenesis, liver mass regeneration and survival following partial hepatectomy, and developed unstable and leaky vessels that eventually produced an aberrant hepatic vascular network and Kupffer cell distribution.\nDirect vascular interactions of infiltrating monocytes are required for an ordered vascular growth and liver regeneration.

High cost and the development of resistance by certain groups of pathogenic bacteria to these drugs encouraged the resurgence of LT, currently used in approximately 20 countries and more recently in Brazil. This study evaluated the behavior and larval density of Cochliomyia macellaria F. (Calliphoridae), one of the most appropriate species for debridement of injuries with necrotic tissue. Tegumentar lesions were induced in Wistar rats by subcutaneously application of 0.2 ml of a 1:4 hydrochloric acid and sterile distilled water in the dorsal region. Five experimental groups were set up: (LT 5) treatment with 5 larvae/cm(2); (LT 15) 15 larvae/cm(2); (LT 25) 25 larvae/cm(2); (DEB) mechanical debridement, and (NUL) animals that did not receive any treatment. In the LT groups, larvae used were sterilized with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and maintained for 12 h in the lesions. The healing process was assessed qualitatively (macroscopically and microscopically) and quantitatively (time interval to complete healing). It was observed that the immature fed only on necrotic tissue, thus C. macellaria is an excellent candidate for use in LT. There was no significant difference in healing time between experimental groups. However, it was observed that in LT 25, there was greater vascularization in tissues when compared to the other treatments. The mechanisms involved in this process are unknown, but it is evident that the larvae have an important role in modulating the host immune response. It is essential that future applications of larval therapy consider using a higher density of larvae (minimum of 25 larvae/cm(2)) than is currently recommended.", "journal": "Parasitology research", "date": "2015-05-30", "authors": ["Mariana PradoNassu", "Patricia JacquelineThyssen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00436-015-4542-8"}

Nevertheless, thoracic surgeons need to be aware of dramatic complications that may occur during this procedure and how best to manage them. We report the case of a severe tear of the right pulmonary artery (PA) during elective VATS upper lobectomy, leading to emergency conversion to control the bleeding. Initial arterial repair was performed by end-to-end anastomosis. Early CT angiography showed thrombosis of the right PA due to anastomotic stenosis.

A CT scan days after surgical lung salvage confirmed the permeability of the PA and normal vascularization of the two remaining right lobes.

Clinical applications may vary from organ replacement, to breast reconstruction or limb regeneration. In growing 3-dimensional tissue constructs, access to a nourishing vascular network is essential.\nIn rats, an arteriovenous loop was surgically established from the femoral vessels and positioned inside a perforated chamber in the groin. Chambers were filled with 2 ml Adipogel, a novel acellular tissue engineering gel -containing growth factors and polymers. Constructs were harvested at 6 and 12 weeks (n=6) and assessed for volume and histological content.\nThe chambers filled with tissue to about half of their content. Histological assessment showed growth of different tissue types within the chamber; not only had a vascular network grown throughout the construct by 12 weeks, adipose, muscular and connective tissue was abundantly present as well. The grown tissue-types seemed to resemble surrounding groin tissue.\nThis in vivo study makes use of a novel technology for tissue generation. In a surgically established vascularized chamber, spontaneous tissue growth within an acellular gel was achieved. Most likely, stem cells residing in adjacent tissues were driven to the chamber to form new tissue.

This study aimed to investigate the correlation between these two methods in murine CNV models induced by subretinal injection.\nCNV was developed in 20 C57BL6/j mice by subretinal injection of adeno-associated viral delivery of a short hairpin RNA targeting sFLT-1 (AAV.shRNA.sFLT-1), as reported previously. After 4 weeks, CNV was imaged by OCT and fluorescence angiography. The scaling factors for each dimension, x, y, and z (\u03bcm/pixel) were recorded, and the corneal curvature standard was adjusted from human (7.7) to mice (1.4). The volume of each OCT image stack was calculated and then normalized by multiplying the number of voxels by the scaling factors for each dimension in Seg3D software (University of Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, available at http://www.sci.utah.edu/cibc-software/seg3d.html). Eighteen mice were prepared for choroidal flatmounts and stained by CD31. The CNV volumes were calculated using scanning laser confocal microscopy after immunohistochemistry staining. Two mice were stained by Hematoxylin and Eosin for observing the CNV morphology.\nThe CNV volume calculated using OCT was, on average, 2.6 times larger than the volume calculated using the laser confocal microscopy. The correlation statistical analysis showed OCT measuring of CNV correlated significantly with the in vitro method (R 2 =0.448, P = 0.001, n = 18).

{"title": "Fabrication of three-dimensional bioplotted hydrogel scaffolds for islets of Langerhans transplantation.", "abstract": "In clinical islet transplantation, allogeneic islets of Langerhans are transplanted into the portal vein of patients with type 1 diabetes, enabling the restoration of normoglycemia. After intra-hepatic transplantation several factors are involved in the decay in islet mass and function mainly caused by an immediate blood mediated inflammatory response, lack of vascularization, and allo- and autoimmunity. Bioengineered scaffolds can potentially provide an alternative extra-hepatic transplantation site for islets by improving nutrient diffusion and blood supply to the scaffold. This would ultimately result in enhanced islet viability and functionality compared to conventional intra portal transplantation. In this regard, the biomaterial choice, the three-dimensional (3D) shape and scaffold porosity are key parameters for an optimal construct design and, ultimately, transplantation outcome. We used 3D bioplotting for the fabrication of a 3D alginate-based porous scaffold as an extra-hepatic islet delivery system. In 3D-plotted alginate scaffolds the surface to volume ratio, and thus oxygen and nutrient transport, is increased compared to conventional bulk hydrogels. Several alginate mixtures have been tested for INS1E \u03b2-cell viability. Alginate/gelatin mixtures resulted in high plotting performances, and satisfactory handling properties. INS1E \u03b2-cells, human and mouse islets were successfully embedded in 3D-plotted constructs without affecting their morphology and viability, while preventing their aggregation. 3D plotted scaffolds could help in creating an alternative extra-hepatic transplantation site. In contrast to microcapsule embedding, in 3D plotted scaffold islets are confined in one location and blood vessels can grow into the pores of the construct, in closer contact to the embedded tissue. Once revascularization has occurred, the functionality is fully restored upon degradation of the scaffold.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2015-05-29", "authors": ["GMarchioli", "Lvan Gurp", "P Pvan Krieken", "DStamatialis", "MEngelse", "C Avan Blitterswijk", "M B JKarperien", "Ede Koning", "JAlblas", "LMoroni", "A Avan Apeldoorn"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/2/025009"}
{"title": "Identification of the Lipodepsipeptide MDN-0066, a Novel Inhibitor of VHL/HIF Pathway Produced by a New Pseudomonas Species.", "abstract": "Throughout recent history, metabolites of microbial origin have had an extraordinary impact on the welfare of humanity. In fact, natural products have largely been--and still are--considered an exceedingly valuable platform for the discovery of new drugs against diverse pathologies. Such value is partly due to their higher complexity and chemical diversity as compared to those of synthetic and combinatorial compounds. Mutations in the Von Hippel-Lindau (vhl) gene are responsible for VHL disease, congenital polycythemia, and are found in many sporadic tumor types. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality for these patients arises from progression of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) or end-stage renal disease. Inactivation of the Von Hippel-Lindau (vhl) tumor suppressor gene arises in the majority of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) as well as in other types of cancer and is associated with a high degree of vascularization and poor prognosis. Loss of pVHL function thus represents a pathognomonic molecular defect for therapeutic exploitation. In this study, renal carcinoma cell lines with naturally occurring vhl mutations (RCC4 VA) and their genetically matched wild-type vhl (RCC4 VHL) counterparts were seeded onto 96-well plates and treated with a collection of 1,040 organic extracts obtained from 130 bacterial strains belonging to at least 25 genera of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. This strategy allowed us to identify several extracts obtained from bacterial strain F-278,770T, the type strain of the recently proposed new species Pseudomonas granadensis, showing biological activities not associated with previously known bioactive metabolites. The fractionation and structural elucidation of one of these extracts led to the discovery of a new lipodepsipeptide (MDN-0066) with specific toxicity in pVHL deficient cells that is not detectable in cells with pVHL expression rescue. This specific toxicity is associated with apoptosis induction in VHL deficient cell line as demonstrated with PARP activation and Annexin V staining. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of selectively targeting the loss of the vhl tumor suppressor gene for potential clinical benefit.

We observe that coronary vessels form in zebrafish by angiogenic sprouting of arterial cells derived from the endocardium at the atrioventricular canal. Endothelial cells express the CXC-motif chemokine receptor Cxcr4a and migrate to vascularize the ventricle under the guidance of the myocardium-expressed ligand Cxcl12b. cxcr4a mutant zebrafish fail to form a vascular network, whereas ectopic expression of Cxcl12b ligand induces coronary vessel formation. Importantly, cxcr4a mutant zebrafish fail to undergo heart regeneration following injury.

At day 2 after birth (P2), (OSX)GFP-cre was highly expressed in the osteoblasts in the bone surface of the metaphysis and in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes (PHCs) and inner layer of perichondral cells (IPCs). From P7, (OSX)GFP-cre was highly expressed in PHCs, IPCs, cartilage canals (CCs), and osteoblasts (OBs) in the epiphyseal secondary ossification center (SOC), but was only slightly expressed in the OBs in the metaphysis. Compared with the control mice, the IPC proliferation was decreased in the (OSX)IGF-IRKOs. In these mice, fewer IPCs invaded into the cartilage, resulting in delayed formation of the CC and SOC. Immunohistochemistry indicated a reduction of vessel number and lower expression of VEGF and ephrin B2 in the IPCs and SOC of (OSX)IGF-IRKOs. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the mRNA levels of the matrix degradation markers, MMP-9, 13 and 14, were decreased in the (OSX)IGF-IRKOs compared with the controls. The (OSX)IGF-IRKO also showed irregular morphology of the growth plate and less trabecular bone in the tibia and femur from P7 to 7 weeks, accompanied by decreased chondrocyte proliferation, altered chondrocyte differentiation, and decreased osteoblast differentiation. Our data indicate that during postnatal bone development, IGF-I signaling in OSX-expressing IPCs promotes IPC proliferation and cartilage matrix degradation and increases ephrin B2 production to stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and vascularization. These processes are required for normal CC formation in the establishment of the SOC. Moreover, IGF-I signaling in the OSX-expressing PHC is required for growth plate maturation and osteoblast differentiation in the development of the metaphysis.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2015-05-27", "authors": ["YongmeiWang", "AliciaMenendez", "ChakFong", "Hashem ZElAlieh", "TakuoKubota", "RogerLong", "Daniel DBikle"], "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.2563"}

While systemic drugs often show detrimental side effects, their ultrasound-triggered local release at the selected tissue may improve safety and specifity of therapy. An increasing amount of animal and preclinical studies demonstrates how ultrasound can also be used for increasing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drug release to solid tumors. In particular, this technique may be functional to reach uniform delivery of chemotherapeutic agents throughout tumors, which is naturally restricted by their abnormal vascularization and interstitial pressure. This review deals with the physical mechanisms of ultrasound, the different kinds of drug carriers (microbubbles, liposomes and micelles) and the biological phenomena useful for cancer treatment (hyperthermia, sonoporation, enhanced extravasation, sonophoresis and blood-brain barrier disruption), showing how much ultrasonic drug delivery is a promising method in the oncological field.", "journal": "Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology", "date": "2015-05-27", "authors": ["IonUdroiu"], "doi": null}

Genome-wide expression analysis after ER\u03b22 expression in prostate cancer cells revealed that hypoxia was an overrepresented theme. Here we show that ER\u03b22 interacts with and stabilizes HIF-1\u03b1 protein in normoxia, thereby inducing a hypoxic gene expression signature. HIF-1\u03b1 is known to stimulate metastasis by increasing expression of Twist1 and increasing vascularization by directly activating VEGF expression. We found that ER\u03b22 interacts with HIF-1\u03b1 and piggybacks to the HIF-1\u03b1 response element present on the proximal Twist1 and VEGF promoters. These findings suggest that at least part of the oncogenic effects of ER\u03b22 is mediated by HIF-1\u03b1 and that targeting of this ER\u03b22 - HIF-1\u03b1 interaction may be a strategy to treat prostate cancer.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-05-27", "authors": ["PrasenjitDey", "Laura AVelazquez-Villegas", "MichelleFaria", "AnthonyTurner", "PhilpJonsson", "PaulWebb", "CeciliaWilliams", "Jan-\u00c5keGustafsson", "Anders MStr\u00f6m"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0128239\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1343\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0249\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3795\n10.1002/pros.10171\n10.1073/pnas.111150898\n10.1038/onc.2013.384\n10.1073/pnas.1221654110\n10.1016/j.ccr.2010.02.030\n10.1677/ERC-09-0294\n10.1210/me.2012.1227\n10.1016/j.ccr.2010.05.024\n10.1126/science.1066373\n10.1074/jbc.M002740200\n10.1038/35017054\n10.1093/emboj/19.16.4298\n10.1074/jbc.C100442200\n10.1002/jcb.23289\n10.1074/jbc.M111.299537\n10.1038/ncb1691\n10.1096/fj.10-159806\n10.1128/MCB.01514-06\n10.1016/B978-0-12-418687-3.00018-5\n10.1186/1471-2164-7-75\n10.1126/science.1073440\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4353\n10.1007/s00432-013-1467-4\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2013.07.023"}

A methacrylic acid-based biomaterial is a vascular regenerative material that enhances diabetic healing without the use of cells or growth factors. The bioactive nature of this material is thought to be associated with its anionic charge or surface chemistry. Contact between the methacrylic acid-based biomaterial and tissue begins with protein (including complement) adsorption and is followed by interaction of the biomaterial with resident and infiltrating cells in the wound bed (e.g., macrophages and endothelial cells). This results in changes to their surface receptors to activate phosphorylation cascades that lead to differential activation of signalling pathways such as those involving osteopontin and sonic hedgehog. These changes modulate the phenotype of the cells in the wound bed, eventually improving vessel formation and wound healing.

A mixture of LMWH and P yields a dispersion of N/MPs (100 nm-3 \u03bcm in diameter).

Those aggregates substantially promoted cellular viability, and induced vascularization and fibrous tissue formation in vivo. The LMWH/P N/MPs, in combination with ADSCs or BMSCs, are effective cell-carriers and are potential promising novel therapeutic agents for inducing vascularization and fibrous tissue formation in ischemic disease by transplantation of the ADSCs and LMWH/P N/MPs-aggregates.

Decellularization removed cells but preserved the 3-dimensional cardiac macro and microstructure and the native vascular network in a perfusable state.

An analysis performed by the National Centre for Health Outcomes Development (NCHOD) has demonstrated an increasing trend in emergency readmissions in the UK. Vascular surgery has been reported to have high readmission rates second only to congestive heart failure. This study aims to identify diagnoses and other clinical risk factors for high unplanned readmission rates. This may be the first step to sparing both the health care system and patients of unnecessary readmissions.\nThe overall 30 day readmission rate for Leeds Vascular Institute was 8.8%. The two diagnoses with the highest readmission rates were lower limb ischaemia and diabetic foot sepsis.

The majority of the patients readmitted under the care of vascular surgery required further surgical treatment.\nVascular units should focus on holistic and multidisciplinary treatment of lower limb ischaemia and diabetic foot sepsis, in order to prevent readmissions.

{"title": "Skin regeneration in deep second-degree scald injuries either by infusion pumping or topical application of recombinant human erythropoietin gel.", "abstract": "Large doses of recombinant growth factors formulated in solution form directly injected into the body is usual clinical practice in treating second-degree scald injuries, with promising results, but this approach creates side effects; furthermore, it may not allow appropriate levels of the factor to be sensed by the target injured tissue/organ in the specific time frame, owing to complications arising from regeneration. In this research, two delivery methods (infusion pumping and local topical application) were applied to deliver recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) for skin regeneration. First, rHuEPO was given in deep second-degree scald injury sites in mice by infusion pump. Vascularization was remarkably higher in the rHuEPO pumping group than in controls. Second, local topical application of rHuEPO gel was given in deep second-degree scald injury sites in rats. Histological analysis showed that epithelialization rate was significantly higher in the rHuEPO gel-treated group than in controls. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the rHuEPO gel-treated group showed remarkably higher expression of skin regeneration makers than the control group. An accurate method for visualization and quantification of blood vessel networks in target areas has still not been developed up to this point, because of technical difficulties in detecting such thin blood vessels. A method which utilizes a series of steps to enhance the image, removes noise from image background, and tracks the vessels edges for vessel segmentation and quantification has been used in this study. Using image analysis methods, we were able to detect the microvascular networks of newly formed blood vessels (less than 500 \u03bcm thickness), which participate in the healing process, providing not only nutrition and oxygen to grow tissues but also necessary growth factors to grow tissue cells for complete skin regeneration. The rHuEPO-treated group showed higher expression of stem cell markers (CD 31, CD 90, CD 71, and nestin), which actively contribute to in-wound-healing processes for new hair follicle generation as well as skin regeneration. Collectively, both rHuEPO group pumping into the systemic circulation system, and injection into the local injury area, prompted mice and rats to form new blood vessel networks in scald injury sites, which significantly participate in the scald healing process. These results may lead to the development of novel treatments for scald wounds.", "journal": "Drug design, development and therapy", "date": "2015-05-26", "authors": ["PriyaGiri", "SabineEbert", "Ulf-DietrichBraumann", "MathiasKremer", "ShibashishGiri", "Hans-G\u00fcntherMachens", "AugustinusBader"], "doi": "10.2147/DDDT.S79425"}

{"title": "Effects of microbeam radiation therapy on normal and tumoral blood vessels.", "abstract": "Microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) is a new form of preclinical radiotherapy using quasi-parallel arrays of synchrotron X-ray microbeams. While the deposition of several hundred Grays in the microbeam paths, the normal brain tissues presents a high tolerance which is accompanied by the permanence of apparently normal vessels. Conversely, the efficiency of MRT on tumor growth control is thought to be related to a preferential damaging of tumor blood vessels. The high resistance of the healthy vascular network was demonstrated in different animal models by in vivo biphoton microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, and histological studies. While a transient increase in permeability was shown, the structure of the vessels remained intact. The use of a chick chorioallantoic membrane at different stages of development showed that the damages induced by microbeams depend on vessel maturation. In vivo and ultrastructural observations showed negligible effects of microbeams on the mature vasculature at late stages of development; nevertheless a complete destruction of the immature capillary plexus was found in the microbeam paths. The use of MRT in rodent models revealed a preferential effect on tumor vessels. Although no major modification was observed in the vasculature of normal brain tissue, tumors showed a denudation of capillaries accompanied by transient increased permeability followed by reduced tumor perfusion and finally, a decrease in number of tumor vessels. Thus, MRT is a very promising treatment strategy with pronounced tumor control effects most likely based on the anti-vascular effects of MRT.", "journal": "Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)", "date": "2015-05-26", "authors": ["AudreyBouchet", "Raph\u00e4elSerduc", "Jean AlbertLaissue", "ValentinDjonov"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmp.2015.04.014"}

{"title": "Tumor-induced loss of mural Connexin 43 gap junction activity promotes endothelial proliferation.", "abstract": "Proper functional association between mural cells and endothelial cells (EC) causes EC of blood vessels to become quiescent. Mural cells on tumor vessels exhibit decreased attachment to EC, which allows vessels to be unstable and proliferative. The mechanisms by which tumors prevent proper association between mural cells and EC are not well understood. Since gap junctions (GJ) play an important role in cell-cell contact and communication, we investigated whether loss of GJ plays a role in tumor-induced mural cell dissociation.\nMural cell regulation of endothelial proliferation was assessed by direct co-culture assays of fluorescently labeled cells quantified by flow cytometry or plate reader. Gap junction function was assessed by parachute assay. Connexin 43 (Cx43) protein in mural cells exposed to conditioned media from cancer cells was assessed by Western and confocal microscopy; mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression vectors or siRNA were utilized to overexpress or knock down Cx43. Tumor growth and angiogenesis was assessed in mouse hosts deficient for Cx43.\nUsing parachute dye transfer assay, we demonstrate that media conditioned by MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells diminishes GJ communication between mural cells (vascular smooth muscle cells, vSMC) and EC. Both protein and mRNA of the GJ component Connexin 43 (Cx43) are downregulated in mural cells by tumor-conditioned media; media from non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells had no effect. Loss of GJ communication by Cx43 siRNA knockdown, treatment with blocking peptide, or exposure to tumor-conditioned media diminishes the ability of mural cells to inhibit EC proliferation in co-culture assays, while overexpression of Cx43 in vSMC restores GJ and endothelial inhibition. Breast tumor cells implanted into mice heterozygous for Cx43 show no changes in tumor growth, but exhibit significantly increased tumor vascularization determined by CD31 staining, along with decreased mural cell support detected by NG2 staining.\nOur data indicate that i) functional Cx43 is required for mural cell-induced endothelial quiescence, and ii) downregulation of Cx43 GJ by tumors frees endothelium to respond to angiogenic cues. These data define a novel and important role for maintained Cx43 function in regulation of vessel quiescence, and suggest its loss may contribute to pathological tumor angiogenesis.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2015-05-24", "authors": ["MayurChoudhary", "ChristineNaczki", "WenhongChen", "Keith DBarlow", "L DouglasCase", "Linda JMetheny-Barlow"], "doi": "10.1186/s12885-015-1420-9\n10.1083/jcb.105.3.1455\n10.1182/blood-2009-05-222364\n10.1016/j.regpep.2004.05.023\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64920-6\n10.1161/hc0102.101437\n10.1007/s00018-010-0551-z\n10.1172/JCI119410\n10.1016/0026-2862(87)90052-5\n10.1161/01.RES.0000091259.84556.D5\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.015\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.06.004\n10.1083/jcb.122.1.157\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1073/pnas.171305298\n10.1007/BF00300234\n10.1161/01.RES.84.3.298\n10.1016/0014-4800(70)90084-5\n10.1161/01.RES.0000173461.36221.2e\n10.1152/ajpheart.91488.2007\n10.1161/01.RES.76.3.498\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2004.10.001\n10.1042/bst0290606\n10.1002/art.27287\n10.1167/iovs.09-4489\n10.1016/S0039-6060(97)90045-3\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0212\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6600082\n10.1016/j.mvr.2007.05.003\n10.1038/nm0603-685\n10.1172/JCI117736\n10.1016/j.humpath.2005.03.013\n10.1167/iovs.03-0360\n10.2337/diabetes.51.5.1565\n10.1006/mvre.2002.2413\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2007.08.009\n10.1152/ajpheart.01012.2005\n10.1128/MCB.00577-07\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2012.05.014\n10.1038/nrc2895\n10.1093/cvr/cvn112\n10.1007/s10456-013-9335-z"}

Here, using Epo-Cy5.5 as theranostic near-infrared fluorescent probe we analyzed the effects of rhuEpo as co-medication to carboplatin in non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC)-xenografts with different tumor cell EpoR-expression (H838 ~8-fold higher than A549). Nude mice bearing subcutaneous A549 and H838 NSCLC-xenografts received either only carboplatin or carboplatin and co-medication of rhuEpo in two different doses. Tumor sizes and relative blood volumes (rBV) were longitudinally measured by 3D-contrast-enhanced ultrasound (3D-US). Tumoral EpoR-levels were determined by combined fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT)/ micro computed tomography (\u00b5CT) hybrid imaging. We found that rhuEpo predominantly acted on the tumor endothelium. In both xenografts, rhuEpo co-medication significantly increased vessel densities, diameters and the amount of perfused vessels. Accordingly, rhuEpo induced EpoR-phoshorylation and stimulated proliferation of endothelial cells. However, compared with solely carboplatin-treated tumors, tumor growth was significantly slower in the groups co-medicated with rhuEpo. This is explained by the Epo-mediated vascular remodeling leading to improved drug delivery as obvious by a more than 2-fold higher carboplatin accumulation and significantly enhanced tumor apoptosis. In addition, co-medication of rhuEpo reduced tumor hypoxia and diminished intratumoral EpoR-levels which continuously increased during carboplatin (Cp) -treatment. These findings suggest that co-medication of rhuEpo in well balanced doses can be used to improve the accumulation of anticancer drugs.

Given the dense stroma and poor vascularization, accessibility to nutrients is limited in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of autophagy in promoting the survival of human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells exposed to nutrient-deprived media (NDM) lacking glucose, amino acids, and serum. NDM inhibited Akt activity and phosphorylation of p70 S6K, and induced AMPK activation and mitochondrial depolarization. NDM also time-dependently increased LC3-II accumulation, number of GFP-LC3 puncta, and colocalization between GFP-LC3 and lysosomes. These results suggested that autophagy was progressively activated through Akt- and AMPK-mTOR pathway in nutrient-deficient PANC-1 cells. Autophagy inhibitors (chloroquine and wortmannin) or silencing of Atg5 augmented PANC-1 cell death in NDM. In cells exposed to NDM, chloroquine and wortmannin induced apoptosis and Z-VAD-fmk inhibited cytotoxicity of these inhibitors. These data demonstrate that autophagy is anti-apoptotic and sustains the survival of PANC-1 cells following extreme nutrient deprivation.

Providing the wound bed with a dermal scaffold populated by autologous dermal and epidermal cellular components can further entice host cell infiltration and vascularization to achieve permanent wound closure in a single stage. However, the high porosity and the lack of a supportive basement membrane in most commercially available dermal scaffolds hinders organized keratinocyte proliferation and stratification in vitro and may delay re-epithelization in vivo. The objective of this study was to develop a method to enable the in vitro production of a human skin equivalent (HSE) that included a porous scaffold and dermal and epidermal cells expanded ex vivo, with the potential to be used for definitive treatment of skin defects in a single procedure. A collagen-glycosaminoglycan dermal scaffold (Integra(\u00ae)) was populated with adult fibroblasts. A near-normal skin architecture was achieved by the addition of coagulated human plasma to the fibroblast-populated scaffold before seeding cultured keratinocytes. This resulted in reducing scaffold pore size and improving contact surfaces. Skin architecture and basement membrane formation was further improved by the addition of aprotinin (a serine protease inhibitor) to the culture media to inhibit premature clot digestion. Histological assessment of the novel HSE revealed expression of keratin 14 and keratin 10 similar to native skin, with a multilayered neoepidermis morphologically comparable to human skin. Furthermore, deposition of collagen IV and laminin-511 were detected by immunofluorescence, indicating the formation of a continuous basement membrane at the dermal-epidermal junction. The proposed method was efficient in producing an in vitro near native HSE using the chosen off-the-shelf porous scaffold (Integra).

{"title": "Structure and vascularization of the ventricular myocardium in Holocephali: their evolutionary significance.", "abstract": "It was generally assumed that the ventricle of the primitive vertebrate heart was composed of trabeculated, or spongy, myocardium, supplied by oxygen-poor luminal blood. In addition, it was presumed that the mixed ventricular myocardium, consisting of a compacta and a spongiosa, and its supply through coronary arteries appeared several times throughout fish evolution. Recent work has suggested, however, that a fully vascularized, mixed myocardium may be the primitive condition in gnathostomes. The present study of the heart ventricles of four holocephalan species aimed to clarify this controversy. Our observations showed that the ventricular myocardium of Chimaera monstrosa and Harriotta raleighana consists of a very thin compacta overlying a widespread spongiosa. The ventricle of Hydrolagus affinis is composed exclusively of trabeculated myocardium. In these three species there is a well-developed coronary artery system. The main coronary artery trunks run along the outflow tract, giving off subepicardial ventricular arteries. The trabeculae of the spongiosa are irrigated by branches of the subepicardial arteries and by penetrating arterial vessels arising directly from the main coronary trunks at the level of the conoventricular junction. The ventricle of Rhinochimaera atlantica has only spongy myocardium supplied by luminal blood. Small coronary arterial vessels are present in the subepicardium, but they do not enter the myocardial trabeculae. The present findings show for the first time that in a wild living vertebrate species, specifically H. affinis, an extensive coronary artery system supplying the whole cardiac ventricle exists in the absence of a well-developed compact ventricular myocardium. This is consistent with the notion derived from experimental work that myocardial cell proliferation and coronary vascular growth rely on distinct developmental programs. Our observations, together with data in the literature on elasmobranchs, support the view that the mixed ventricular myocardium is primitive for chondrichthyans. The reduction or even lack of compacta in holocephali has to be regarded as a derived anatomical trait. Our findings also fit in with the view that the mixed myocardium was the primitive condition in gnathostomes, and that the absence of compact ventricular myocardium in different actinopterygian groups is the result of a repeated loss of such type of cardiac muscle during fish evolution.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2015-05-23", "authors": ["Ana CDur\u00e1n", "Miguel AL\u00f3pez-Unzu", "CristinaRodr\u00edguez", "BorjaFern\u00e1ndez", "MiguelLorenzale", "AndreaLinares", "FranciscaSalmer\u00f3n", "Valent\u00ednSans-Coma"], "doi": "10.1111/joa.12317"}
{"title": "The multi-organ chip--a microfluidic platform for long-term multi-tissue coculture.", "abstract": "The ever growing amount of new substances released onto the market and the limited predictability of current in vitro test systems has led to a high need for new solutions for substance testing. Many drugs that have been removed from the market due to drug-induced liver injury released their toxic potential only after several doses of chronic testing in humans. However, a controlled microenvironment is pivotal for long-term multiple dosing experiments,\u00a0as even minor alterations in extracellular conditions may greatly influence the cell physiology. We focused within our research program on the generation of a microengineered bioreactor, which can be dynamically perfused by an on-chip pump and combines at least two culture spaces for multi-organ applications. This circulatory system mimics the in vivo conditions of primary cell cultures better and assures a steadier,\u00a0more quantifiable extracellular relay of signals to the cells. For demonstration purposes, human liver equivalents, generated by aggregating differentiated HepaRG cells with human hepatic stellate cells in hanging drop plates, were cocultured with human skin punch biopsies for up to 28 days inside the microbioreactor. The use of cell culture inserts enables the skin to be cultured at an air-liquid interface, allowing topical substance exposure. The microbioreactor system is capable of supporting these cocultures at near physiologic fluid flow and volume-to-liquid ratios, ensuring stable and organotypic culture conditions. The possibility of long-term cultures enables the repeated exposure to substances. Furthermore, a vascularization of the microfluidic channel circuit using human dermal microvascular endothelial cells yields a physiologically more relevant vascular model.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2015-05-21", "authors": ["Eva-MariaMaterne", "IlkaMaschmeyer", "Alexandra KLorenz", "ReykHorland", "Katharina M SSchimek", "MathiasBusek", "FrankSonntag", "RolandLauster", "UweMarx"], "doi": "10.3791/52526"}

The muscle tissues (both human and murine) were minced with scalpels into small pieces (< 1 mm(3)) and aliquoted in portions of 200 mm(3). These portions were either cryopreserved in 10% dimethylsulfoxide or freshly implanted. Syngeneic or xenogeneic MSCs were added to the minced muscles directly before implantation. Implants were collected at 7, 14, 30 or 45 d after transplantation and processed for (immuno)histological analysis. The progression of muscle regeneration was assessed using a standard histological staining (hematoxylin-phloxin-saffron). Antibodies recognizing Pax7 and von Willebrand factor were used to detect the presence of satellite cells and blood vessels, respectively. To enable detection of the bone marrow-derived MSCs or their derivatives we used MSCs previously transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing a cytoplasmic LacZ gene. X-gal staining of the fixed tissues was used to detect \u03b2-galactosidase-positive cells and myofibers.\nMyoregeneration in implants of fresh murine muscle was evident as early as day 7, and progressed with time to occupy 50% to 70% of the implants. Regeneration of fresh human muscle was slower. These observations of fresh muscle implants were in contrast to the regeneration of cryopreserved murine muscle that proceeded similarly to that of fresh tissue except for day 45 (P < 0.05). Cryopreserved human muscle showed minimal regeneration, suggesting that the freezing procedure was detrimental to human satellite cells. In fresh and cryopreserved mouse muscle supplemented with LacZ-tagged mouse MSCs, \u03b2-galactosidase-positive myofibers were identified early after grafting at the well-vascularized periphery of the implants. The contribution of human MSCs to murine myofiber formation was, however, restricted to the cryopreserved mouse muscle implants. This suggests that fresh murine muscle tissue provides a suboptimal environment for maintenance of human MSCs. A detailed analysis of the histological sections of the various muscle implants revealed the presence of cellular structures with a deviating morphology. Additional stainings with alizarin red and alcian blue showed myofiber calcification in 50 of 66 human muscle implants, and encapsulated cartilage in 10 of 81 of murine muscle implants, respectively.\nIn mouse models the engagement of human MSCs in myoregeneration might be underestimated.

We report a face-transplant patient who developed cutaneous clinicopathologic changes suggestive of CR.\nThe recipient was a 27-year-old man with severe disfigurement of the lower face due to a pyrotechnic explosion. He received a facial allograft, including mandible, cheeks, lips, and chin, in November 2009. Immunosuppression included antithymocyte globulins and bone-marrow infusion then steroids, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil.\nDuring the first posttransplant year the acute rejection episodes were characterized by reversible oedema and erythema of the graft. Subsequently, the patient developed primary asymptomatic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, followed by EBV+ B-cell lymphoma and hepatic EBV-associated posttransplant smooth muscle tumors; therefore, the immunosuppressive treatment was greatly reduced. Since the second posttransplant year, the allografted facial skin became progressively sclerotic and presented pigmented macules on a background of hypopigmentation and teleangiectasias, resulting in a poikilodermatous aspect. Skin biopsies showed epidermal atrophy, basal cell vacuolization, and diffuse dermal sclerosis in the absence of significant dermal cell infiltration. The dermal capillaries showed thickened walls and narrowed lumina, whereas the large vessels did not show significant alterations. Neither donor-specific antibodies nor vascular Cd4 deposits were detected.A dysfunction of the graft functions occurred.

Remote ischemic preconditioning is an inexpensive noninvasive technique that has been used in animal models and multicenter clinical trials to protect organ systems. In this work, the authors describe a novel animal model for analyzing the efficacy of fat grafting, and investigate the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning on volume retention.\nSubcutaneous adipose tissue samples from green fluorescent protein/luciferase-expressing FVB mice were obtained with or without pretreatment with a temporary hind-limb tourniquet. The samples were injected into the dorsal skin folds of wild-type FVB mice. The viability of the transferred tissue was examined over a 28-day period with quantitative bioluminescence after luciferin injection. Transferred tissue was also explanted for histologic analysis.\nThe remote ischemic preconditioning group had significantly increased bioluminescence at days 0, 1, and 28. Histologic analysis at day 28 confirmed the presence of vascularized adipose in both groups. However, significant amounts of interstitial fibrosis were found in the control group, whereas substantially less was found in the remote ischemic preconditioning group. The remote ischemic preconditioning group retained a substantially greater amount of green fluorescent protein, suggesting increased survival of donor adipocytes.\nIn this work, the authors describe a novel animal model for quantitative evaluation of fat grafting using in vivo bioluminescence of adipocytes from luciferase-expressing mice.

We aimed to assess the involvement of this agonist and its receptor in ovarian cancer angiogenesis.\nSecretion of LPI by three ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR-3, OVCAR-5 and COV-362) was tested by mass spectrometry. Involvement of cancer cell-derived LPI on angiogenesis was tested in the in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay along with the assessment of the effect of LPI on proliferation, network formation, and migration of neonatal and adult human endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs). Engagement of GPR55 was verified by using its pharmacological inhibitor CID16020046 and diminution of GPR55 expression by four different target-specific siRNAs.

Applied LPI stimulated proliferation, network formation, and migration of neonatal ECFCs\u2005in vitro and angiogenesis in the in vivo\u2005CAM. The pharmacological GPR55 inhibitor CID16020046 inhibited LPI-stimulated ECFC proliferation, network formation and migration in vitro as well as ovarian carcinoma cell- and LPI-induced angiogenesis in vivo. Four target-specific siRNAs against GPR55 prevented these effects of LPI on angiogenesis.

However, since MRI, PET and SPECT cannot resolve individual islets, optical techniques are required to assess the specificity of these tracers. We propose to combine Optical Coherence Microscopy (OCM) with fluorescence detection in a single optical platform to facilitate these initial screening steps from cell culture up to living rodents. OCM can image islets and vascularization without any labeling. Thereby, it alleviates the need of both genetically modified mice to detect islets and injection of external dye to reveal vascularization. We characterized Cy5.5-exendin-3, an agonist of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R), for which other imaging modalities have been used and can serve as a reference. Cultured cells transfected with GLP1R and incubated with Cy5.5-exendin-3 show full tracer internalization. We determined that a dose of 1\u2009\u03bcg of Cy5.5-exendin-3 is sufficient to optically detect in vivo the tracer in islets with a high specificity. In a next step, time-lapse OCM imaging was used to monitor the rapid and specific tracer accumulation in murine islets and its persistence over hours.

{"title": "Interstitial hydraulic conductivity and interstitial fluid pressure for avascular or poorly vascularized tumors.", "abstract": "A correct description of the hydraulic conductivity is essential for determining the actual tumor interstitial fluid pressure (TIFP) distribution. Traditionally, it has been assumed that the hydraulic conductivities both in a tumor and normal tissue are constant, and that a tumor has a much larger interstitial hydraulic conductivity than normal tissue. The abrupt transition of the hydraulic conductivity at the tumor surface leads to non-physical results (the hydraulic conductivity and the slope of the TIFP are not continuous at tumor surface). For the sake of simplicity and the need to represent reality, we focus our analysis on avascular or poorly vascularized tumors, which have a necrosis that is mostly in the center and vascularization that is mostly on the periphery. We suggest that there is an intermediary region between the tumor surface and normal tissue. Through this region, the interstitium (including the structure and composition of solid components and interstitial fluid) transitions from tumor to normal tissue. This process also causes the hydraulic conductivity to do the same. We introduce a continuous variation of the hydraulic conductivity, and show that the interstitial hydraulic conductivity in the intermediary region should be monotonically increasing up to the value of hydraulic conductivity in the normal tissue in order for the model to correspond to the actual TIFP distribution. The value of the hydraulic conductivity at the tumor surface should be the lowest in value.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2015-05-20", "authors": ["L JLiu", "MSchlesinger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.05.012"}

Current models of the cerebral microvasculature are discrete, and hence only able to model the perfusion over small voxel sizes before becoming computationally prohibitive. Larger models are required to provide comparisons and validation against imaging data. In this work, multi-scale homogenization methods were employed to develop continuum models of blood flow in a capillary network model of the human cortex. Homogenization of the local scale blood flow equations produced an averaged form of Darcy\u05f3s law, with the permeability tensor encapsulating the capillary bed topology. A statistically accurate network model of the human cortex microvasculature was adapted to impose periodicity, and the elements of the permeability tensor calculated over a range of voxel sizes. The permeability tensor was found to converge to an effective permeability as voxel size increased. This converged permeability tensor was isotropic, reflecting the mesh-like structure of the cerebral microvasculature, with off-diagonal terms normally distributed about zero. A representative elementary volume of 375\u00b5m, with a standard deviation of 4.5% from the effective permeability, was determined. Using the converged permeability values, the cerebral blood flow was calculated to be around 55mLmin(-1)100g(-1), which is in very close agreement with experimental values.

The most common hepatic artery (HA) replacement is the right hepatic artery (RRHA). Variations of the HA are particularly important consideration when choosing the best surgical procedure or if radiological abdominal intervention is required. In this study, we evaluated the anatomical details of the RRHA origin.\nRetrospective investigation of clinical data from 1569 patients who underwent an abdominal MDCT was performed. The anatomy of RRHA origin was described based on four parameters measured: D--the distance between SMA origin and the RRHA origin, L--the lumen at the place of origin, AH--the origin angle from the SMA in horizontal plane, and AV--the origin angle from the SMA in vertical plane.\nRRHA arising from SMA was detected in 10.13 % of cases (159/1569) and its anatomy was subjected to variations. Mean (\u00b1SD) of parameters D, L, AH and AV was 27.34 mm \u00b1 6.83, 3.29 mm \u00b1 1.17, 97.27\u00ba \u00b1 26.69 and 89.73\u00ba \u00b1 20.81, respectively.

Seven peripubertal stallions were treated with Durateston and castrated either 4 (treatment group 1 [TG1]) or 12 weeks (TG2) after the last injection. The castration of seven untreated control stallions (control group [CG]) took place within the same time. In the testicular specimens, volume density (VD), numerical density (ND), and area of vessels were determined morphometrically. Immunohistochemically, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGF-R2; angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) and its receptor Tie2 as well as of transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1) was investigated. Morphometrically, the VD of TG1 (P = 0.000) and TG2 (P = 0.001) vessels and the ND of arterioles and venules and capillaries were higher (TG1, TG2: P < 0.05), and the area of capillary cross sections was smaller (TG1, TG2: P < 0.05) than that in the CG. Compared to TG2 horses, TG1 animals showed a higher (P < 0.05) VD and ND of vascular structures and a smaller (P < 0.05) area of capillary cross sections. In numerous vascular structures, especially of TG1, the TGF-\u03b1 and, to a less extent, the Ang2 and VEGF-R2 expression was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that in the CG. Sertoli cells in TG2 were characterized by a significantly higher expression (P < 0.05) of VEGF-R2 than in the CG. In summary, the most and smallest vessels could be detected in the testes of TG1. Most likely this is explainable by the highest expression of some angiogenic factors (TGF-\u03b1, Ang2) and receptors (VEGF-R2) investigated. This expression behavior may be stimulated by testosterone. As a significant decrease of morphometric parameters could be detected in TG2 compared to TG1, the stimulatory effect of testosterone seems to be temporary.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2015-05-20", "authors": ["ATeubner", "KM\u00fcller", "C PBartmann", "HSieme", "EKlug", "BZingrebe", "H-ASchoon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.03.022"}

However, conventional tissue engineering methods by seeding cells into biodegradable scaffolds have intrinsic limitations such as inflammatory responses and fibrosis arising from the degradation of scaffolds. On the other hand, we have developed cell sheet engineering as a scaffold-free approach for cardiac tissue engineering. Confluent cultured cells are harvested as an intact cell sheet using a temperature-responsive culture surface. By layering cardiac cell sheets, it is possible to form electrically communicative three-dimensional cardiac constructs. Cell sheet transplantation onto damaged hearts in several animal models has revealed improvements in heart functions. Because of the lack of vasculature, the thickness of viable cardiac cell sheet-layered tissues is limited to three layers. Pre-vascularized structure formation within cardiac tissue and multi-step transplantation methods has enabled the formation of thick vascularized tissues in vivo. Furthermore, development of original bioreactor systems with vascular beds has allowed reconstruction of three-dimensional cardiac tissues with a functional vascular structure in vitro. Large-scale culture systems to generate pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac cells can create large numbers of cardiac cell sheets.

Here we investigate the role of the pleiotropic transcription/splicing factor and RNA-binding protein nuclease-sensitive element-binding protein 1 (YBX1/YB-1) in increasing the oncogenic potential of epithelial MDCK cells. Characterization of MDCK cells expressing YBX1 (MDCKYBX1 cells) revealed a partial EMT phenotype, including cytosolic relocalization of E-cadherin, increased cell scattering, and anchorage-independent growth. Subcutaneous injection of parental MDCK cells into NOD/SCID mice did not form tumours. Critically, MDCKYBX1 cells established viable tumour xenografts, and immuno-histochemical staining indicated murine vascularization by CD31+ endothelial cells. We analysed the total secretome (containing soluble and extracellular vesicles) of MDCKYBX1 cells to investigate regulation of the tumour microenvironment. YBX1 expression elevated release of secreted factors known to enhance angiogenesis (TGF-\u03b2, CSF-1, NGF, VGF, ADAM9 and ADAM17), compared to MDCK cells. Importantly, treatment with MDCKYBX1 cell-derived secretome increased recipient 2F-2B endothelial cell motility.

{"title": "VEGFR2-Targeted Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound to Distinguish between Two Anti-Angiogenic Treatments.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of BR55, an ultrasound contrast agent specifically targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), to distinguish the specific anti-VEGFR2 therapy effect of sunitinib from other anti-angiogenic effects of a therapy (imatinib) that does not directly inhibit VEGFR2. Sunitinib, imatinib and placebo were administered daily for 11 d (264 h) to 45 BalbC mice bearing ectopic CT26 murine colorectal carcinomas. During the course of therapy, B-mode ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound and VEGFR2-targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound were performed to assess tumor morphology, vascularization and VEGFR2 expression, respectively. The angiogenic effects on these three aspects were characterized using tumor volume, contrast-enhanced area and differential targeted enhancement. Necrosis, microvasculature and expression of VEGFR2 were also determined by histology and immunostaining. B-Mode imaging revealed that tumor growth was significantly decreased in sunitinib-treated mice at day 11 (p < 0.05), whereas imatinib did not affect growth. Functional evaluation revealed that the contrast-enhanced area decreased significantly (p < 0.02) and by similar amounts under both anti-angiogenic treatments by day 8 (192 h): -23% for imatinib and -21% for sunitinib. No significant decrease was observed in the placebo group. Targeted contrast-enhanced imaging revealed lower differential targeted enhancement, that is, lower levels of VEGFR2 expression, in sunitinib-treated mice relative to placebo-treated mice from 24 h (p < 0.05) and relative to both placebo- and imatinib-treated mice from 48 h (p < 0.05). Histologic assessment of tumors after the final imaging indicated that necrotic area was significantly higher for the sunitinib group (21%) than for the placebo (8%, p < 0.001) and imatinib (11%, p < 0.05) groups. VEGFR2-targeted ultrasound was able to sensitively differentiate the anti-VEGFR2 effect from the reduced area of tumor with functional flow produced by both anti-angiogenic agents. BR55 molecular imaging was, thus, able both to detect early therapeutic response to sunitinib in CT26 tumors as soon as 24 h after the beginning of the treatment and to provide early discrimination (48 h) between tumor response during anti-angiogenic therapy targeting VEGFR2 expression and response during anti-angiogenic therapy not directly acting on this receptor.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2015-05-20", "authors": ["ThomasPayen", "AlexandreDizeux", "CapucineBaldini", "DelphineLe Guillou-Buffello", "MicheleLamuraglia", "EvaComperat", "OlivierLucidarme", "S LoriBridal"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2015.04.010"}

Changes in the levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase type 9 (MMP-9) and CD31 were assessed in the mouse cancer induced by injection of colon cancer cells. We observed that G-CSF increased the number of circulating neutrophils, but facilitated tumor growth. However, G-CSF treatment did not affect radiation-induced cytotoxicity and cell viability in CT26 cells in vitro. Increased levels of myeloperoxidase, a neutrophil marker and those of vascular endothelial growth factor were observed in tumors with G-CSF supplementation. In addition, we found that increased levels of CD31 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were correlated with the enhanced tumor growth after G-CSF treatment.

Further morphogenesis involves the formation of a tubular avascular SV, which remains until premetamorphic larval stages. Folding and vascularization of the SV occurs mostly during metamorphosis, when S. maximus settle down on the bottom. Proliferative cells were placed within the SV itself and in the neighbouring infundibular hypothalamus. Their putative relationship with the growth of the SV is discussed. The CaBPs analysed are expressed in coronet cells.

{"title": "The Ovarian Antral Follicle: Living on the Edge of Hypoxia or Not?", "abstract": "Oocytes within antral follicles are thought to have restricted access to O2, as follicle vascularity is not adjacent and both granulosa and cumulus cells are metabolically active. Indeed, measured follicular antrum partial pressure (pO2) is regarded as low, but accurate and direct measurement represents a technical challenge that has yet to be overcome. The oocyte itself is highly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for survival and competence for further development following fertilization, and it has been suggested that follicular pO2 levels are correlated with this capacity for further development. It is clear that gonadotropins are involved in regulating antrum formation, follicle vascularization, cellular differentiation, and the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), which are mainly regulated by dissolved O2 concentration. A newly discovered player in this story is the intracellular production of hemoglobin by both granulosa and cumulus cells, as well as the oocyte. Furthermore, cellular hemoglobin levels are dynamic, responding to the ovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. We hypothesize that this gas transport and antioxidant molecule is involved in the prevention of hypoxic response signaling by HIFs within the preovulatory antral follicle; and the transition of granulosa cells to luteal tissue by facilitating the stabilization of HIFs, enabling induction of luteinization signaling. Another possible role is by sequestering nitric oxide (NO) during the ovulatory period, which may facilitate the resumption of meiosis in the oocyte.

The CC chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) has been reported to be involved in the process of alloimmune interaction. Spiegelmers are l-oligonucleotides that can be designed to bind to pharmacologically relevant target molecules. Here, we tested a high-affinity Spiegelmer-based MCP-1 inhibitor (mNOX-E36) in an allogeneic heart transplant model. Fully vascularized allogeneic heterotopic heart transplantations from BALB/c to C57BL/6 mice were performed. Mice were either treated with the anti-MCP-1-Spiegelmer (mNOX-E36) in monotherapy or in combination with subtherapeutic doses of cyclosporine A (CsA) (10 mg/kgBW/day) for 10 days. Controls received equivalent doses of a non-functional Spiegelmer (revmNOX-E36). Graft survival of allogeneic heart transplants was slightly but significantly prolonged under mNOX-E36 monotherapy (median graft survival 10 day \u00b1 0.7) compared to revmNOX-E36 (median graft survival 7 day \u00b1 0.3; P = 0.001). A synergistic beneficial effect could be seen when mNOX-E36 was administered in combination with subtherapeutic doses of CsA (18 day \u00b1 2.8 versus 7 day \u00b1 0.3; P < 0.0001). Levels of inflammatory cytokines and 'alarmins' were significantly reduced, and the number of F4/80(+) cells was lower under combination therapy (1.8% \u00b1 1.3%; versus 14.6% \u00b1 4.4%; P = 0.0002). This novel inhibitor of the MCP-1/CCR2 axis (mNOX-E36), which has already proven efficacy and tolerability in early clinical trials, alleviates acute rejection processes in allogeneic transplantation especially when combined with subtherapeutic doses of CsA.

It is based on the descending branch of the peroneal artery perforator. However, damage to the perimalleolar vascularization or anatomic variations of the descending branch often causes flap necrosis. Because septocutaneous perforators from the anterior tibial artery participate in the vascular network of superficial peroneal nerve in the distal lower leg, a modified SPNC flap is designed based on the anterior tibial artery perforator. Seven patients with soft tissue defect over the forefoot were treated by this modified technique. Six patients had accompanied injuries at the lateral perimalleolar region, and 1 patient had an anatomic variation of the descending branch of the peroneal artery perforator. The size of defect ranged from 12 \u00d7 5 to 15 \u00d7 9 cm. All 7 flaps survived completely without complications. The size of the flaps ranged from 13 \u00d7 6 to 16 \u00d7 10 cm. No severe venous congestion occurred. The mean follow-up was 9.4 months (range, 6-14 months). All patients were satisfied with the texture and color of the flaps. Two patients complained about the thickness of the flaps, but did not want further operation. The donor sites healed uneventfully and no painful neuroma occurred. In conclusion, the modified SPNC flap based on an anterior tibial artery perforator is a feasible salvage procedure when the traditional design is unreliable.

{"title": "Stress-mediated progression of solid tumors: effect of mechanical stress on tissue oxygenation, cancer cell proliferation, and drug delivery.", "abstract": "Oxygen supply plays a central role in cancer cell proliferation. While vascular density increases at the early stages of carcinogenesis, mechanical solid stresses developed during growth compress tumor blood vessels and, thus, drastically reduce not only the supply of oxygen, but also the delivery of drugs at inner tumor regions. Among other effects, hypoxia and reduced drug delivery compromise the efficacy of radiation and chemo/nanotherapy, respectively. In the present study, we developed a mathematical model of tumor growth to investigate the interconnections among tumor oxygenation that supports cancer cell proliferation, the heterogeneous accumulation of mechanical stresses owing to tumor growth, the non-uniform compression of intratumoral blood vessels due to the mechanical stresses, and the insufficient delivery of oxygen and therapeutic agents because of vessel compression. We found that the high vascular density and increased cancer cell proliferation often observed in the periphery compared to the interior of a tumor can be attributed to heterogeneous solid stress accumulation. Highly vascularized peripheral regions are also associated with greater oxygenation compared with the compressed, less vascularized inner regions. We also modeled the delivery of drugs of two distinct sizes, namely chemotherapy and nanomedicine. Model predictions suggest that drug delivery is affected negatively by vessel compression independently of the size of the therapeutic agent.

The main goal of this study was to determine the relevance of the VEGFR-2 activating pathway for colon carcinoma (CC) metastasis. The initial event is ligand-induced receptor activation through tyrosine autophosphorylation.\nVEGFR-2, its ligands VEGF-C and VEGF-D and the phosphorylated (activated) receptor forms pVEGFR-2(Tyr1175) and pVEGFR-2(Tyr1214) were investigated immunohistochemically in different tumor compartments (intratumoral (zone 1) - invasive front (zone 2) - extratumoral soft tissue (zone 3)) and various cell types (tumor cells, inflammatory cells, macro- and microvasculature) in 84 non-metastatic, lymphogenous-metastatic and haematogenous-metastatic CC.\nVEGF-D produced by tumor cells has an autocrine affinity for its receptor VEGFR-2. In tumor budding regions VEGF-D-induced receptor activation by autophosphorylation at Tyr1214 seems to be a possible initial event of the VEGFR-2-mediated signaling pathway, but without effect on metastatic behaviour. In inflammatory cells of almost all CC VEGFR-2 phosphorylation at Tyr 1175 and Tyr 1214 was detectable without accompanying receptor expression, suggesting receptor activation without cell surface expression. Peritumoral inflammatory cells also expressed paracrine acting VEGF-C. The autocrine VEGF-D/VEGFR-2 signaling axis and receptor autophosphorylation at Tyr1214 appear to be main events for capillaries in all three tumor zones and for small vessels in zone 1 and 2. Independent of the metastatic status a large number of cases with capillary immunopositivity in the angiogenically active invasive front was documented, especially for VEGF-D, VEGFR-2 and pVEGFR-2(Tyr1214). VEGFR-2 positive extratumoral capillaries were significantly more common in distant metastatic CC. In all tumor compartments the investigated biomolecules were also detected in different frequencies in the macrovasculature, which is responsible for sufficient tumor vascularization. In addition, vascular paracrine-acting VEGF-C production was widely detected, but without zone and vessel-type dependence.\nThe VEGFR-2 activating pathway is closely involved in tumor cell-associated, vessel-mediated and immuno-inflammatory processes in colon carcinoma and appears to contribute to tumor survival and growth as well as maintenance of the infiltrative phenotype rather than to promote metastasis.", "journal": "Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR", "date": "2015-05-15", "authors": ["CarenJayasinghe", "NektariaSimiantonaki", "SylviaHabedank", "Charles JamesKirkpatrick"], "doi": "10.1186/s13046-015-0162-5\n10.1038/nature04478\n10.1186/s12885-015-1130-3\n10.3109/08977194.2012.704917\n10.1038/sj.neo.7900186\n10.1186/1471-2407-10-184\n10.1159/000048262\n10.1159/000070301\n10.1111/j.1600-0463.2011.02752.x\n10.1186/s12885-015-1013-7"}

MAGP-2 can also interact with \u03b1v\u03b23 integrins via a RGD sequence that is not found in MAGP-1. Morpholino knockdown of MAGP-1 expression in zebrafish resulted in abnormal vessel wall architecture and altered vascular network formation.

Inactivation of the gene for MAGP-2 in mice produced a neutropenia yet had minimal effects on bone or adipose homeostasis. Double knockouts had phenotypes characteristic of each individual knockout as well as several additional traits only seen when both genes are inactivated.

Three-dimensional structure and microcirculation are two fundamental parameters for evaluating vascularization. Microscopic techniques with cellular level resolution, fast continuous observation, and robust 3D postimage processing are essential for evaluation, but have not been applied previously because of technical difficulties. In this study, we report novel video-rate confocal microscopy and 3D postimage processing techniques to accomplish this goal. In an immune-deficient mouse model, vascularized bone tissue was successfully engineered using human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffold. Video-rate (30 FPS) intravital confocal microscopy was applied in vitro and in vivo to visualize the vascular structure in the engineered bone and the microcirculation of the blood cells. Postimage processing was applied to perform 3D image reconstruction, by analyzing microvascular networks and calculating blood cell viscosity. The 3D volume reconstructed images show that the hMSCs served as pericytes stabilizing the microvascular network formed by HUVECs. Using orthogonal imaging reconstruction and transparency adjustment, both the vessel structure and blood cells within the vessel lumen were visualized. Network length, network intersections, and intersection densities were successfully computed using our custom-developed software. Viscosity analysis of the blood cells provided functional evaluation of the microcirculation. These results show that by 8 weeks, the blood vessels in peripheral areas function quite similarly to the host vessels. However, the viscosity drops about fourfold where it is only 0.8\u2009mm away from the host.

{"title": "Targeted delivery as key for the success of small osteoinductive molecules.", "abstract": "Molecules such as growth factors, peptides and small molecules can guide cellular behavior and are thus important for tissue engineering. They are rapidly emerging as promising compounds for the regeneration of tissues of the musculoskeletal system. Growth factors have disadvantages such as high cost, short half-life, supraphysiological amounts needed, etc. Therefore, small molecules may be an alternative. These molecules have been discovered using high throughput screening. Small osteoinductive molecules exhibit several advantages over growth factors owing to their small sizes, such as high stability and non-immunogenicity. These molecules may stimulate directly signaling pathways that are important for osteogenesis. However, systemic application doesn't induce osteogenesis in most cases. Therefore, local administration is needed. This may be achieved by using a bone graft material providing additional osteoconductive properties. These graft materials can also act by themselves as a delivery matrix for targeted and local delivery. Furthermore, vascularization is necessary in the process of osteogenesis. Many of the small molecules are also capable of promoting vascularization of the tissue to be regenerated. Thus, in this review, special attention is given to molecules that are capable of inducing both angiogenesis and osteogenesis simultaneously. Finally, more recent preclinical and clinical uses in bone regeneration of those molecules are described, highlighting the needs for the clinical translation of these promising compounds.", "journal": "Advanced drug delivery reviews", "date": "2015-05-12", "authors": ["Elizabeth RBalmayor"], "doi": "10.1016/j.addr.2015.04.022"}
{"title": "Management of Facial Paralysis due to Extracranial Tumors.", "abstract": "Treatment of advanced parotid or cutaneous malignancies often requires sacrifice of the facial nerve as well as resection of the parotid gland and surrounding structures. In addition to considerations regarding reinnervation and dynamic reanimation, reconstruction in this setting must take into account unique factors such as soft tissue volume deficits and the high likelihood of adjunctive radiation therapy. Furthermore, considerations of patient comorbidities including advanced age and poor long-term prognosis often influence reconstructive modality. The optimal reconstructive technique would provide potential for restoration of facial tone and voluntary movement as well as immediate restoration of facial support and function. Beyond considerations of facial movement and rest position, restoration of lost soft tissue volume is critical to obtain facial symmetry. To control long-term volume in the setting of adjunctive radiation therapy, vascularized tissue is required. In this chapter, we describe a comprehensive approach to the management of radical parotidectomy and similar facial defects that addresses these concerns and also describes management strategies over time. Specific techniques employed include anterolateral thigh free flaps, nerve grafting utilizing motor nerves to the vastus lateralis muscle, and orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer. Further considerations relative to the eye, forehead, and long-term facial refinement are also discussed.", "journal": "Facial plastic surgery : FPS", "date": "2015-05-12", "authors": ["MichaelFritz", "Bryan NRolfes"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0035-1549045"}

As the key factor for sound regeneration is the development of an adequate vascular supply for the construct, the current modalities using extrinsic vascularization are incapable of regenerating such complex defects. Our group has recently introduced the intrinsic axial vascularization technique to regenerate mandibular defects using the arteriovenous loop (AVL). The technique has shown promising results in terms of efficient vascularization and bone regeneration at the preclinical level. In this article, we have conducted a narrative literature review about using the AVL to vascularize tissue-engineering constructs at the preclinical level.

In this study, we present a pH-responsive scaffold that increases oxygen transport, as confirmed by our finite element model analysis, and cell proliferation relative to a non-responsive scaffold.

The authors report a novel technique involving a rotational temporal bone flap with a temporalis muscle vascularized pedicle, which was used to repair an anterior fossa bony and soft-tissue defect created by recurrent malignancy. A 55-year-old man with history of scalp avulsion during a motor vehicle accident, anterior fossa/nasopharyngeal malignant neuroendocrine carcinoma postresection, and bone flap infection presented with a recurrence of his skull base malignancy. The tumor was located in the anterior fossa, extending interhemispherically and down through the cribriform plate, ethmoid air cells, and extending into the nasopharyngeal cavity. Resection of the recurrent tumor was performed. The bony defect in the anterior skull base was repaired with a novel vascularized rotational temporal bone flap, with acceptable separation of the nasopharynx from the intracranial cavity.

{"title": "Micro-CT Analysis of Radiation-Induced Osteopenia and Bone Hypovascularization in Rat.", "abstract": "Treatment of carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract often requires external radiation therapy. However, radiation affects all the components of bone, with different degrees of sensitivity, and may produce severe side effects such as mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Intraosseous vascularization is thought to be decreased after irradiation, but its impact on total bone volume is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare intraosseous vascularization, cortical bone thickness, and total bone volume in a rat model of ORN versus nonirradiated rats, using a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis after intracardiac injection of a contrast agent. The study was performed on 8-week-old Lewis 1A rats (n = 14). Eleven rats underwent external irradiation on the hind limbs by a single 80-Gy dose. Three rats did not receive irradiation and served as controls for statistical analysis. Eight weeks after the external irradiation, all the animals received a barium sulfate intracardiac injection under general anesthesia. All samples were analyzed with the micro-computed tomography system at a resolution of 5.5 \u03bcm. The images were later processed to create 3D reconstructions and study vascularization, bone volume, and cortical thickness. Data from irradiated and nonirradiated rats were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. No animal died after irradiation. Nineteen irradiated tibias and six nonirradiated tibias were included for micro-CT analysis. The vessel percentage was significantly lower in irradiated bones (p = 0.0001). The distance between the vessels, a marker of vascular destruction, was higher after irradiation (p = 0.001). The vessels were also more altered distally after irradiation (p = 0.028). Cortical thickness was severely decreased after irradiation, sometimes even reduced to zero. Both trabecular and cortical structures were destroyed after irradiation, with wide bone gaps. Finally, both total bone volume (p = 0.0001) and cortical thickness (p = 0.0001) were significantly decreased in irradiated tibias compared to nonirradiated tibias. These results led to multiple spontaneous fractures in the irradiated group, and the destruction of intraosseous vessels observed macroscopically with the radiographic preview. This study revealed the impact of radiation on intraosseous vasculature and cortical bone with a micro-CT analysis in a rat ORN model. Hypovascularization and osteopenia are consistent with the literature, contributing a morphological scale with high resolution. Visualization of the vasculature by micro-CT is an innovative technique to see the changes after radiation, and should help adjust bone tissue engineering in irradiated bone.", "journal": "Calcified tissue international", "date": "2015-05-09", "authors": ["GuillaumeMichel", "PaulineBlery", "PaulPilet", "J\u00e9r\u00f4meGuicheux", "PierreWeiss", "OlivierMalard", "FlorentEspitalier"], "doi": "10.1007/s00223-015-0010-9"}

In a dorsal thoracic site, a 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009cm Adipogel implant was inserted within a subdermal fat layer defect. In a dorsal lumbar site, an Adipogel implant was inserted in a subfascial pocket. Contralateral control defects remained empty.

The postnatal retinal vascularization was evaluated using immunostaining of wholemount retinas prepared at different postnatal days by collagen IV staining and/or TSP2 promoter driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. The organization of astrocytes was evaluated by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining. Retinal vascular densities were determined using trypsin digestion preparation of wholemount retinas at 3- and 6-weeks of age. Retinal neovascularization was assessed during the oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR). Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was assessed using laser-induced CNV.\nUsing the TSP2-GFP reporter mice, we observed significant expression of TSP2 mRNA in retinas of postnatal day 5 (P5) mice, which increased by P7 and remained high up to P42. Similar results were observed in retinal wholemount preparations, and western blotting for GFP with the highest level of GFP was observed at P21. In contrast to high level of mRNA at P42, the GFP fluorescence or protein level was dramatically downregulated. The primary retinal vasculature developed at a faster rate in TSP2(-/-) mice compared with TSP2(+/+) mice up to P5. However, the developing retinal vasculature in TSP2(+/+) mice caught up with that of TSP2(-/-) mice after P7.

TSP2(-/-) mice also exhibited a similar sensitivity to the hyperoxia-mediated vessel obliteration and similar level of neovascularization during OIR as TSP2(+/+) mice.

{"title": "Sunitinib but not VEGF blockade inhibits cancer stem cell endothelial differentiation.", "abstract": "Different mechanisms of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis are involved in the development of the tumor vasculature. Among them, cancer stem cells are known to contribute to tumor vasculogenesis through their direct endothelial differentiation. Here, we investigated the effect of anti-angiogenic therapy on vasculogenesis of cancer stem cells derived from breast and renal carcinomas. We found that all the anti-angiogenic approaches impaired proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells once differentiated into endothelial cells in vitro and reduced murine angiogenesis in vivo. At variance, only VEGF-receptor inhibition using the non-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sunitinib or the anti-VEGF-receptor 2 neutralizing antibody, but not VEGF blockade using Bevacizumab, impaired the process of endothelial differentiation in vitro, suggesting a VEGF-independent mechanism. In addition, tyrosine kinase inhibition by Sunitinib but not VEGF blockade using the soluble VEGF trap sFlk1 inhibited the cancer stem cell-induced vasculogenesis in vivo. Accordingly, Sunitinib but not Bevacizumab inhibited the induction of hypoxia-inducible factor pathway occurring during endothelial differentiation under hypoxia.

Complications and functional outcomes are reported.\nTwelve patients with a mean age of 15.8 years (range, 3 to 49 years) were included in the study. Eight femur defects and four tibia defects were reconstructed. The mean follow-up time was 41.4 months. Two constructs were removed because of infection, three patients required bone grafting for nonunion, one patient required an additional operation to excise a skin paddle, and one patient experienced a lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. The mean time to achieve full weight bearing was 14.3 months.\nThe use of a free fibula flap inside a massive bone allograft after bone tumor resection provides an option for lower extremity reconstruction. The allograft component increases the initial strength of the reconstruction, whereas the vascularized fibula component is thought to increase the biologic potential for osteosynthesis and ultimately provide a potentially lifelong durable reconstruction. Patients who achieve oncologic control are likely to enjoy a highly functional long-term outcome.\nTherapeutic, IV.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2015-05-07", "authors": ["Katie EWeichman", "WojciechDec", "Carol DMorris", "Babak JMehrara", "Joseph JDisa"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0000000000001463"}

The mid-term functional and radiological outcomes of biological reconstructions after resection of bone sarcomas in children are presented in this study. Eighteen patients [average age 12.5 years (range 4-22 years)] with primary sarcomas of long bones underwent wide surgical resection and biological reconstruction. The bone defects were managed by intercalary (n=14), osteoarticular (n=3) reconstructions and arthrodesis (n=1) with a vascularized fibular graft (VFG). VFG was combined with a massive allograft in seven lower extremity reconstructions. The average follow-up was 45.7 months (range 25-78 months). Graft union and graft hypertrophy was observed in 17 (94.4%) of 18 patients at 12 months. The VFG-allograft osteointegration rate was 100% at 24 months. The average final follow-up Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scores for lower and upper extremity reconstructions were 79.7% (range 66.6-90%) and 80.9% (range 53.3-100%), respectively. Four (22.2%) complications, including nonunion (n=1), implant failure (n=1), infection (n=1) and skin necrosis (n=1), required reoperation. The disease relapsed in three (16.6%) patients.

This process is enhanced by growth factors secreted by both inflammatory and endothelial cells in response to physical stress. Although therapeutic promotion of arteriogenesis is of great interest for ischaemic diseases, little is known about the modulation of the signalling cascades via microRNAs. We observed that miR-132/212 expression was significantly upregulated after occlusion of the femoral artery. miR-132/212 knockout (KO) mice display a slower perfusion recovery after hind-limb ischaemia compared to wildtype (WT) mice. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrates a clear trend towards smaller collateral arteries in KO mice. Although Ex vivo aortic ring assays score similar number of branches in miR-132/212 KO mice compared to WT, it can be stimulated with exogenous miR-132, a dominant member of the miR-132/212 family. Moreover, in in vitro pericyte-endothelial co-culture cell assays, overexpression of miR-132 and mir-212 in endothelial cells results in enhanced vascularization, as shown by an increase in tubular structures and junctions. Our results suggested that miR-132/212 may exert their effects by enhancing the Ras-Mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK signalling pathway through direct inhibition of Rasa1, and Spred1. The miR-132/212 cluster promotes arteriogenesis by modulating Ras-MAPK signalling via direct targeting of its inhibitors Rasa1 and Spred1.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2015-05-07", "authors": ["ZhiyongLei", "Alainvan Mil", "Maarten MBrandt", "SebastianGrundmann", "ImoHoefer", "MichielSmits", "HamidEl Azzouzi", "TaroFukao", "CarolineCheng", "Pieter ADoevendans", "Joost P GSluijter"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.12586"}

SkM has been identified as a secretory tissue, releasing myokines that regulate multiple processes, including vascularization. We sought to determine how myokines secreted from T2D myotubes might influence SkM angiogenesis. Conditioned media (CM) were generated by myotubes from T2D and nondiabetic (ND) subjects. Primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC) and SkM explants were exposed to CM or recombinant myokines, and tube number or capillary outgrowth was determined as well as measurement of protein expression and phosphorylation. CM from ND myotubes stimulated tube formation of HUVEC to a greater extent than T2D myotubes (T2D-CM = 100%, ND-CM = 288 \u00b1 90% after 48 h, P < 0.05). The effects of T2D myotube CM were mediated by IL-8, not IL-15 or GRO\u03b1, and were due not to cell damage but rather through regulating tube production and maintenance (response to T2D-IL-8 = 100%, response to ND-IL-8 = 263 \u00b1 46% after 48 h, P < 0.05). A similar effect was seen in SkM explants with exposure to IL-8. The dose-dependent effect of IL-8 on tube formation was also observable in the PI3K and FAK signaling pathways and mediated at least in part by PI3K, leading to regulation of Tie2 expression. These results suggest that elevated levels of IL-8 secreted from T2D myotubes create a muscle microenvironment that supports reduced capillarization in T2D.

Recent studies have suggested that insulin administration might attenuate the cognitive dysfunctions through the modulatory effect on the expression of NMDA receptors and on the brain insulin signaling. Intrahepatic pancreatic islet transplantation is known as an efficient tool for correcting impaired insulin signaling. We examined the capacity of syngeneic islets grafted into the cranial subarachnoid cavity to attenuate behavioral dysfunctions in rats exposed to MK-801. Animals were examined in the open field (OF) and the Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests following acute or subchronic administration of MK-801. We found well-vascularized grafted islets expressing insulin, glucagon and somatostatin onto the olfactory bulb and prefrontal cortex. Significantly higher levels of insulin were detected in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of transplanted animals compared to the non-transplanted rats. All animals expressed normal peripheral glucose homeostasis for two months after transplantation. OF tests revealed that rats exposed to MK-801 treatment, showed hyper-responsiveness in motility parameters and augmented center field exploration compared to intact controls and these effects were attenuated by the grafted islets. Moreover, in the MWM, the rats treated with MK-801 showed impairment of spatial memory that were partially corrected by the grafted islets. In conclusion, intracranial islet transplantation leads to the expression of islet hormones in the brain and attenuates behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions in rats exposed to MK-801 administration without altering the peripheral glucose homeostasis.", "journal": "Hormones and behavior", "date": "2015-05-07", "authors": ["KonstantinBloch", "IritGil-Ad", "IgorTarasenko", "AlexeyVanichkin", "MichalTaler", "Shay HenryHornfeld", "PninaVardi", "AbrahamWeizman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yhbeh.2015.04.019"}

These techniques include biological or synthetic dressings, grafts, regional flaps, and free-vascularized flaps. Among these, the dural graft has demonstrated promising results in repairing the skull-base defects. Our aim is to report a new, innovative technique for partial glossectomy and floor of mouth defect repair using a biological dural graft dressing when primary repair was not feasible and the patient did not consent to dermal graft or flap interventions.\nThis article reports the outcomes from a novel intervention of partial glossectomy repair using a biological dural dressing derived from bovine type-I collagen in a 57-year-old female patient with recurrent T1N1M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the left-sided tongue during the 12 month period of follow-up.\nThe best option for large tongue defects is a free flap, while for a moderate defect is a regional oral flap. The biological graft, as an acellular dermal graft has been well known to facilitate secondary healing in the tongue as an alternative to the split-thickness skin graft. In the current study, the dural dressing in tongue reconstruction was likewise shown to be an effective biological dressing; hence, the collagen membrane is biologically acceptable to the oral mucosa and an excellent wound graft material. However, it is absolutely contraindicated in bovine hypersensitive patients.\nThe biological dural graft dressing appears to be an effective method for tongue reconstruction, as it promotes adequate wound healing and it preserves function.", "journal": "International journal of surgery case reports", "date": "2015-05-06", "authors": ["Khalid BAl-Ghamdi", "Zainab ABakhsh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijscr.2015.04.029"}

A better outcome was observed in patients with intratumoral TLOs, and this was independent of other survival factors. The PDC tissues with intratumoral TLOs showed significantly higher infiltration of T and B cells and lower infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, as well as significantly higher expression of Th1- and Th17-related genes.

The high spatial and temporal resolution of Magnetic Resonance Imaging makes it the election imaging modality to monitor in vivo the vascular volume changes. Commonly used MRI methods to obtain this information rely on the administration of contrast agents that modify the bulk water relaxation times but, unfortunately, they can provide only an estimate of vV since they are not fully retained in the vascular space. Herein, Gd-loaded Red Blood Cells (Gd-RBCs) are proposed as a contrast agent able to provide quantitative information on tumor vascularization. Being Gd-RBCs fully retained in the vascular space, the proposed method does not suffer for the limitations associated to the use of extracellular Gd-agents that quickly extravasate in the leaky tumor vasculature. Furthermore, the long half-life and biocompatibility of Gd-RBCs allows repeating the measurement many times upon their administration; this ensures the possibility to in vivo evaluate the change of vascular volume during tumor growth. For these reasons, Gd-RBCs may represent a highly biocompatible imaging reporter of vasculature, able to quantitatively assess changes in the vascular volume in the ROI.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-05-06", "authors": ["GiuseppeFerrauto", "EnzaDi Gregorio", "WalterDastr\u00f9", "StefaniaLanzardo", "SilvioAime"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.04.026"}

However, this option is limited by the disparity between the number of patients needing transplantation and the number of available livers. This issue is becoming more severe as the population ages and as the number of new cases of end-stage liver failure increases. Patients fortunate enough to receive a transplant are required to receive immunosuppressive therapy and must live with the associated morbidity. Whole organ engineering of the liver may offer a solution to this liver donor shortfall. It has been shown that perfusion decellularization of a whole allogeneic or xenogeneic liver generates a three-dimensional ECM scaffold with intact macro and micro architecture of the native liver. A decellularized liver provides an ideal transplantable scaffold with all the necessary ultrastructure and signaling cues for cell attachment, differentiation, vascularization, and function.

Reinjection of ranibizumab after three initial monthly loading was administered on an as-needed basis, guided by the optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). The main outcomes were the changes of the mean best corrected Snellen visual acuity (VA), central macular thickness (CMT) by OCT, the changes of polyps and branching vascular network by FA and ICGA, and total number of injections received by patients during the 12mo.\nThe mean best corrected Snellen visual acuities at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12mo after primary injection were 0.77\u00b10.59, 0.76\u00b10.53, 0.70\u00b10.47, 0.63\u00b10.43, 0.61\u00b10.43, 0.62\u00b10.42 logMAR, respectively, and showed significant improvement at 3, 6, 12mo (P=0.003, P=0.002, P=0.018, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

The method of Biomicroscopic Video-Imaging of the microcirculation of oral mucosa is performed through the technique of computerized capillaroscopy and the related software.\nFrom the results it is evident that immediately after achieving the expansion of the upper maxilla (t1), a slight decrease in the number of vessels per mm\u00b2 can be observed. In addition, a slight ectasia can be observed in these vessels in comparison to t0. Comparing the videocapillaroscopic images of t1 and t2, an increase in the capillaries per mm\u00b2 can be observed.\nEctasia of the capillaries, though subject to strictly individual variables, can be considered perfectly normal and it is compatible with the normal biology and physiology of vessel microcirculation.", "journal": "Minerva stomatologica", "date": "2015-05-06", "authors": ["GBilello", "GCurr\u00f2", "PMessina", "GScardina"], "doi": null}

CCSC was shown to be extremely effective in alleviation of pain. Reports on CCSC for the treatment of stump neuroma pain have disappeared from the literature, with a shift toward neuromodulation for the treatment of pain irrespective of etiology.\nWe observed 8 lower limb amputees undergoing CCSC of the sciatic nerve during a follow-up of 12 years. All had the same stump neuroma pain rendering them unable to wear their prostheses. The sciatic nerve was explored at the midthigh area, much proximal to the amputation site, and a short circuit was established between the tibial and peroneal parts of the nerve. Assessment was by means of pain quantification as per the quadruple visual analogue scale, medication intake, and ability to use prostheses.\nThe median worst quadruple visual analogue scale before surgery was 8.0. After surgery it decreased to 2.5 (P = 0.00094). Medication intake was reduced from regular intake of a combination of opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, and pregabalin in all patients to irregular intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug alone in 3 of 8 patients.

Expression levels of Ascl2, Esx1 and Fosl1 mRNA dramatically decreased in DEHP-treated placenta at GD 13. DEHP administration disrupted labyrinth vascularization of placentas, and inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of placenta by the activation of caspase-3 and -8, up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein at GD 13.

{"title": "Comprehensive analysis of glycolytic enzymes as therapeutic targets in the treatment of glioblastoma.", "abstract": "Major efforts have been put in anti-angiogenic treatment for glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive and highly vascularized brain tumor with dismal prognosis. However clinical outcome with anti-angiogenic agents has been disappointing and tumors quickly develop escape mechanisms. In preclinical GBM models we have recently shown that bevacizumab, a blocking antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, induces hypoxia in treated tumors, which is accompanied by increased glycolytic activity and tumor invasiveness. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of patient derived GBM cells including stem cell lines revealed a strong up-regulation of glycolysis-related genes in response to severe hypoxia. We therefore investigated the importance of glycolytic enzymes in GBM adaptation and survival under hypoxia, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that shRNA-mediated attenuation of glycolytic enzyme expression interfered with GBM growth under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in all cellular models. Using intracranial GBM xenografts we identified seven glycolytic genes whose knockdown led to a dramatic survival benefit in mice. The most drastic effect was observed for PFKP (PFK1, +21.8%) and PDK1 (+20.9%), followed by PGAM1 and ENO1 (+14.5% each), HK2 (+11.8%), ALDOA (+10.9%) and ENO2 (+7.2%). The increase in mouse survival after genetic interference was confirmed using chemical inhibition of PFK1 with clotrimazole. We thus provide a comprehensive analysis on the importance of the glycolytic pathway for GBM growth in vivo and propose PFK1 and PDK1 as the most promising therapeutic targets to address the metabolic escape mechanisms of GBM.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-05-02", "authors": ["MorganeSanzey", "Siti AminahAbdul Rahim", "AnaisOudin", "AnneDirkse", "TonyKaoma", "LaurentVallar", "ChristelHerold-Mende", "RolfBjerkvig", "AnnaGolebiewska", "Simone PNiclou"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0123544\n10.1093/neuonc/nos273\n10.1038/nrd3455\n10.1056/NEJMoa1308573\n10.1056/NEJMc1402987#SA1\n10.1007/s00401-012-1066-5\n10.1073/pnas.1014480108\n10.1517/14728222.2011.588211\n10.1126/science.1160809\n10.1016/j.nbd.2011.06.007\n10.3171/2012.9.JNS112134\n10.1038/nature11331\n10.1038/nature06734\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1868\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1800\n10.1002/cam4.219\n10.1093/brain/awt025\n10.1371/journal.pone.0021800\n10.1096/fj.08-109611\n10.1038/nprot.2008.211\n10.1093/nar/gkn923\n10.1039/c4mb00287c\n10.1007/s00401-013-1173-y\n10.1016/j.abb.2010.03.013\n10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.01.012\n10.1038/onc.2011.490\n10.3389/fonc.2013.00038\n10.1007/s00109-013-0996-2\n10.1186/1476-4598-9-81\n10.1186/1471-2407-11-524\n10.1084/jem.20101470"}

The protocol acquisition consisted of a 216 \u00d7 216 A-scan that was repeated 5 times in the same position, in 3 \u00d7 3 mm centered into the fovea.\nAll 52 eyes showed 2 separate vascular networks in the inner retina: the superficial network, located in the nerve fiber layer and in the ganglion cell layer, and the deep network, detected in the outer plexiform layer. The superficial and deep networks showed interconnections of vertical vessels. The reference planes to observe the 2 networks were defined at 60 \u03bcm, with an inner limiting membrane reference (6 \u03bcm offset), and 30 \u03bcm, with an inner plexiform layer reference (60 \u03bcm offset), respectively.\nOptical coherence tomography angiography can separately detect the superficial vascular and the deep vascular networks. These networks are overlaid and seem to be fused when seen with standard angiographies.

{"title": "Urosepsis and postrenal acute renal failure in a neonate following circumcision with Plastibell device.", "abstract": "Plastibell is one of the three most common devices used for neonatal circumcision in the United States, with a complication rate as low as 1.8%. The Plastibell circumcision device is commonly used under local anesthesia for religious circumcision in male neonates, because of cosmetic reasons and ease of use. Occasionally, instead of falling off, the device may get buried under the skin along the shaft of the penis, thereby obstructing the normal flow of urine. Furthermore, the foreskin of neonates is highly vascularized, and hence, hemorrhage and infection are possible when the skin is cut. Necrosis of penile skin, followed by urethral obstruction and renal failure, is a serious surgical mishap requiring immediate corrective surgery and medical attention. We report a case of fulminant urosepsis, acute renal failure, and pyelonephritis in a 4-day-old male neonate secondary to impaction of a Plastibell circumcision device. Immediate medical management was initiated with fluid resuscitation and mechanical ventilation; thereby correcting life threatening complications.

Most cell therapy-based experimental and clinical protocols integrate some degree of recipient conditioning/induction with antibodies or other immunosuppressive agents. We investigated the susceptibility of ASCs and BM-MSCs to anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) and tacrolimus. Rat ASCs and BM-MSCs were exposed to varying concentrations of tacrolimus and ALS in vitro. Serum from ALS-treated animals was added to cell cultures. Viability, susceptibility, and cytotoxicity parameters were evaluated. ALS inhibited ASC and BM-MSC viability and susceptibility in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. ASCs were more susceptible to both ALS and tacrolimus than BM-MSCs. Trypsinized and adherent ASCs were significantly smaller than BM-MSCs. This is the first report on the viability and susceptibility characteristics of BM-MSCs or ASCs to collateral effects of ALS and tacrolimus.

{"title": "Ex Situ Limb Perfusion System to Extend Vascularized Composite Tissue Allograft Survival in Swine.", "abstract": "Organ perfusion systems have successfully been applied in solid organ transplantations. Their use in limb transplantation and replantation has not been widely investigated. In this study, we tested the potential for ex situ perfusion system to prolong limb allograft viability in a swine forelimb amputation/replantation model.\nFourteen swine were used. In group 1 (n = 4), we perfused 4 amputated limbs for 12 hours using warm (27 \u00b0C-32 \u00b0C) autologous blood. Group 2 (n = 3) served as a cold preservation control group, preserving limbs for 6 hours at 4 \u00b0C. All limbs were transplanted into healthy swine (n = 7) and observed for another 12 hours. Hemodynamic variables of circulation, as well as perfusate gases and electrolytes (pH, pCO2, pO2, O2 saturation, Na(+), K(+), Cl(-), Ca(2+), HCO3(-), glucose, lactate) were measured. Muscle samples were used to measure single-muscle fiber contractility.\nIn the control group, no microcirculation was observed after 6 hours of cold storage. In the pump perfusion group, all limbs displayed a gradual increase in lactate levels (P < 0.05) during ex situ perfusion that returned to normal after transplantation and reperfusion (P = 0.05).

We recently reported the repair and functional recovery after treatment with human marrow-isolated adult multilineage inducible (MIAMI) cells adhered to neurotrophin-3 (NT3) releasing pharmacologically active microcarriers (PAMs) in hemiparkinsonian rats. In order to comprehend this effect, the goal of the present work was to elucidate the survival, differentiation, and neuroprotective mechanisms of MIAMI cells and human neural stem cells (NSCs), both adhering to NT3-releasing PAMs in an ex vivo organotypic model of nigrostriatal degeneration made from brain sagittal slices. It was shown that PAMs led to a marked increase in MIAMI cell survival and neuronal differentiation when releasing NT3. A significant neuroprotective effect of MIAMI cells adhering to PAMs was also demonstrated. NSCs barely had a neuroprotective effect and differentiated mostly into dopaminergic neuronal cells when adhering to PAM-NT3. Moreover, those cells were able to release dopamine in a sufficient amount to induce a return to baseline levels. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses identified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stanniocalcin-1 as potential mediators of the neuroprotective effect of MIAMI cells and NSCs, respectively. It was also shown that VEGF locally stimulated tissue vascularization, which might improve graft survival, without excluding a direct neuroprotective effect of VEGF on dopaminergic neurons.

The electric organ cells (electrocytes) of the electric fish Eigenmannia virescens generate action potentials (APs) with Na(+) currents >10 \u03bcA and repolarize the AP with Na(+)-activated K(+) (KNa) channels. To better understand the role of morphology and ion channel localization in determining the metabolic cost of electrocyte APs, we used two-photon three-dimensional imaging to determine the fine cellular morphology and immunohistochemistry to localize the electrocytes' ion channels, ionotropic receptors, and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPases. We found that electrocytes are highly polarized cells \u223c 1.5 mm in anterior-posterior length and \u223c 0.6 mm in diameter, containing \u223c 30,000 nuclei along the cell periphery. The cell's innervated posterior region is deeply invaginated and vascularized with complex ultrastructural features, whereas the anterior region is relatively smooth. Cholinergic receptors and Na(+) channels are restricted to the innervated posterior region, whereas inward rectifier K(+) channels and the KNa channels that terminate the electrocyte AP are localized to the anterior region, separated by >1 mm from the only sources of Na(+) influx. In other systems, submicrometer spatial coupling of Na(+) and KNa channels is necessary for KNa channel activation. However, our computational simulations showed that KNa channels at a great distance from Na(+) influx can still terminate the AP, suggesting that KNa channels can be activated by distant sources of Na(+) influx and overturning a long-standing assumption that AP-generating ion channels are restricted to the electrocyte's posterior face.", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "date": "2015-05-01", "authors": ["YueBan", "Benjamin ESmith", "Michael RMarkham"], "doi": "10.1152/jn.00475.2014"}

Both osteogenesis and angiogenesis are key processes for bone regeneration. This study investigated the vascularization potential of a novel combination of human dental pulp stromal cells (HDPSCs) with 45S5 Bioglass\u00ae scaffolds for tissue-engineered mineral constructs in vivo and in vitro. 45S5 Bioglass scaffolds were produced by the foam replication technique with the standard composition of 45\u2009wt% SiO2, 24.5\u2009wt% Na2O, 24.5\u2009wt% CaO, and 6\u2009wt% P2O5. HDPSCs were cultured in monolayers and on porous 45S5 Bioglass scaffolds under angiogenic and osteogenic conditions for 2-4 weeks. HDPSCs expressed endothelial gene markers (CD34, CD31/PECAM1, and VEGFR2) under both conditions in the monolayer. A combination of HDPSCs with 45S5 Bioglass enhanced the expression of these gene markers. Positive immunostaining for CD31/PECAM1 and VEGFR2 and negative staining for CD34 supported the gene expression data, while histology revealed evidence of endothelial cell-like morphology within the constructs. More organized tubular structures, resembling microvessels, were seen in the constructs after 8 weeks of implantation in vivo. In conclusion, this study suggests that the combination of HDPSCs with 45S5 Bioglass scaffolds offers a promising strategy for regenerating vascularized bone grafts.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Coculture experiments of arterial tissue with NCCs or chondrocytes demonstrated that NCC-derived VEGF promotes blood vessel growth and that blood vessels secrete factors to instruct chondrocyte proliferation. Computed tomography and X-ray scans of patients with hemifacial microsomia also showed that jaw hypoplasia correlates with mandibular artery dysgenesis.

Thymosin \u03b24 (T\u03b24) is a growth factor that has been shown to promote angiogenesis and dermal wound repair. However, the underlying mechanisms based on T\u03b24 function have not yet been fully investigated. In the present study, we investigated how T\u03b24 improves dermal burn wound healing via actin cytoskeletal remodelling and the action of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), which are a vital set of chaperone proteins that respond to heat shock. Our in vitro results achieved with the use of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) revealed a possible signal between T\u03b24 and HSP70. Moreover, we confirmed that remodelling of filamentous actin (F-actin) was regulated by T\u03b24-induced HSP70 in HUVECs. Based on these in vitro results, we confirmed the healing effects of T\u03b24 in an adapted dermal burn wound in vivo model. T\u03b24 improved wound-healing markers, such as wound closure and vascularization. Moreover, T\u03b24 maintained the long-term expression of HSP70, which is associated with F-actin regulation during the wound-healing period. These results suggest that an association between T\u03b24 and HSP70 is responsible for the healing of burn wounds, and that this association may regulate F-actin remodelling.

This study was designed to prove our hypothesis that blocking the VEGF-Src signaling pathway by specific Src siRNA is able to prevent destructive repair in a SAON rabbit model. Destructive repair in SAON was induced in rabbits. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after SAON induction, VEGF, anti-VEGF, Src siRNA, Src siRNA+VEGF, control siRNA, and saline were introduced via intramedullary injection into proximal femora for each group, respectively. Vascularization and permeability were quantified by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. At week 6 after SAON induction, proximal femurs were dissected for micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT)-based trabecular architecture with finite element analysis (FEA), \u03bcCT-based angiography, and histological analysis. Histological evaluation revealed that VEGF enhanced destructive repair, whereas anti-VEGF prevented destructive repair and Src siRNA and Src siRNA+VEGF prevented destructive repair and enhanced reparative osteogenesis. Findings of angiography and histomorphometry were consistent with those determined by DCE MRI. Src siRNA inhibited VEGF-mediated vascular hyperpermeability but preserved VEGF-induced neovascularization. Bone resorption was enhanced in the VEGF group and inhibited in the anti-VEGF, Src siRNA, Src siRNA+VEGF groups as determined by both 3D \u03bcCT and 2D histomorphometry. FEA showed higher estimated failure load in the Src siRNA and Src siRNA+VEGF groups when compared to the vehicle control group.

{"title": "Evaluation of bone height of the free fibula flap in mandible reconstruction.", "abstract": "Use of a vascularized free fibula flap has become a preferred method of mandible reconstruction after oncologic surgical ablation. Despite its many advantages, the low vertical height of the graft is a potential drawback and severe long-term atrophy of fibular bones may cause stress fracture and is disadvantageous for osseointegrated dental implants and facial contours. Therefore, it is important to investigate the degree of resorption based on the fibular height and the factors related to resorption over time. The influence of aspects of the intraoperative surgical procedure, such as preservation of a nutrient artery from the peroneal artery to the fibula bone marrow and the number of segmental osteotomies, has not been examined previously. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the change in fibular height and the factors influencing resorption, including those associated with the surgical procedure.\nA retrospective analysis was performed in 19 patients who underwent free vascularized fibular mandibular reconstruction for oncologic surgical defects without radiotherapy. Postoperative Panorex examinations were used to evaluate fibular height, and 7 factors with a potential influence on long-term fibular height were evaluated: age, gender, length of the mandible defect, number of segmental osteotomies, preservation of a direct nutrient artery from the peroneal artery to the fibula bone marrow, length of follow-up, and delayed placement of osseointegrated dental implants.\nFibular bone height decreased in 13 patients (68%), was unchanged in 2 (11%), and increased in 4 (21%). Segmental osteotomies and female gender were significant factors promoting fibular bone resorption (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively), and preservation of a nutrient artery to the bone marrow, male gender, and delayed placement of osseointegrated dental implants were significant factors inhibiting bone resorption (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05, respectively).

The renal artery divides into anterior and posterior divisions, from which approximately five segmental terminal arteries originate. The renal veins are not terminal. Variations in the vascular and lymphatic channels are common; thus, concurrent lymphadenectomy is not routinely indicated during PN for cT1 renal masses in the setting of clinically negative lymph nodes. Renal-protocol contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is used for standard imaging. Anatomy-based nephrometry scoring systems allow standardized academic reporting of tumor characteristics and predict PN outcomes (complications, remnant function, possibly histology). Anatomy-based novel surgical approaches may reduce ischemic time during PN; these include early unclamping, segmental clamping, tumor-specific clamping (zero ischemia), and unclamped PN. Cancer cure after PN relies on complete resection, which can be achieved by thin margins. Post-PN renal function is impacted by kidney quality, remnant quantity, and ischemia type and duration.\nSurgical renal anatomy underpins imaging, nephrometry scoring systems, and vascular control techniques that reduce global renal ischemia and may impact post-PN function. A contemporary ideal PN excises the tumor with a thin negative margin, delicately secures the tumor bed to maximize vascularized remnant parenchyma, and minimizes global ischemia to the renal remnant with minimal complications.\nIn this report we review renal surgical anatomy.

{"title": "Longitudinal analysis of osteogenic and angiogenic signaling factors in healing models mimicking atrophic and hypertrophic non-unions in rats.", "abstract": "Impaired bone healing can have devastating consequences for the patient. Clinically relevant animal models are necessary to understand the pathology of impaired bone healing. In this study, two impaired healing models, a hypertrophic and an atrophic non-union, were compared to physiological bone healing in rats. The aim was to provide detailed information about differences in gene expression, vascularization and histology during the healing process. The change from a closed fracture (healing control group) to an open osteotomy (hypertrophy group) led to prolonged healing with reduced mineralized bridging after 42 days. RT-PCR data revealed higher gene expression of most tested osteogenic and angiogenic factors in the hypertrophy group at day 14. After 42 days a significant reduction of gene expression was seen for Bmp4 and Bambi in this group. The inhibition of angiogenesis by Fumagillin (atrophy group) decreased the formation of new blood vessels and led to a non-healing situation with diminished chondrogenesis. RT-PCR results showed an attempt towards overcoming the early perturbance by significant up regulation of the angiogenic regulators Vegfa, Angiopoietin 2 and Fgf1 at day 7 and a further continuous increase of Fgf1, -2 and Angiopoietin 2 over time. However \u00b5CT angiograms showed incomplete recovery after 42 days. Furthermore, lower expression values were detected for the Bmps at day 14 and 21.

One of the targets is endoglin, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) co-receptor, which mediates proliferation, differentiation and migration of endothelial cells forming neovasculature. However, its specific, safe and long-lasting targeting remains the challenge. Therefore, in our study we evaluated the transfection efficacy, vascular targeted effects and therapeutic potential of the plasmid silencing endoglin with the tissue specific promoter, specific for endothelial cells marker endothelin-1 (ET) (TS plasmid), in comparison to the plasmid with constitutive promoter (CON plasmid), in vitro and in vivo. Tissue specificity of TS plasmid was demonstrated in vitro on several cell lines, and its antiangiogenic efficacy was demonstrated by reducing tube formation of 2H11 endothelial cells. In vivo, on a murine mammary TS/A tumor model, we demonstrated good antitumor effect of gene electrotransfer (GET) of either of both plasmids in treatment of smaller tumors still in avascular phase of growth, as well as on bigger tumors, already well vascularized. In support to the observations on predominantly vascular targeted effects of endoglin, histological analysis has demonstrated an increase in necrosis and a decrease in the number of blood vessels in therapeutic groups. A significant antitumor effect was observed in tumors in avascular and vascular phase of growth, possibly due to both, the antiangiogenic and the vascular disrupting effect. Furthermore, the study indicates on the potential use of TS plasmid in cancer gene therapy since the same efficacy as of CON plasmid was determined.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-04-25", "authors": ["MonikaStimac", "TanjaDolinsek", "UrsaLampreht", "MajaCemazar", "GregorSersa"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0124913\n10.1002/jcb.22764\n10.1016/j.canlet.2010.09.004\n10.1038/cgt.2008.43\n10.1371/journal.pone.0058723\n10.1093/cvr/cvp332\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4478\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0098\n10.1089/hyb.2008.0014\n10.1002/ijc.23314\n10.1002/ijc.24482\n10.1007/s00262-012-1357-7\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2004.06.891\n10.1007/s00232-013-9550-y\n10.1186/1471-2407-13-38\n10.1200/JCO.2007.15.6794\n10.1089/humc.2012.240\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01217.x\n10.2478/raon-2013-0002\n10.1007/s00232-013-9548-5\n10.1007/s10456-008-9101-9\n10.1007/s11912-013-0365-x\n10.1002/jgm.1414\n10.1007/s00232-013-9534-y\n10.1371/journal.pone.0083398\n10.1186/1472-6750-10-58\n10.1186/1479-5876-9-39\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010611\n10.1016/j.molimm.2009.01.021\n10.1038/cgt.2013.71\n10.7785/tcrtexpress.2013.600252\n10.1038/mt.2011.263\n10.1517/14728222.12.5.637\n10.1016/j.addr.2010.11.003\n10.1073/pnas.1103519108\n10.1038/mt.2008.144"}

Indeed, breast cancer-associated stromal cells not only increase the quantity of deposited Fn but also modify its conformation. However, (i) the interplay between mechanical and conformational properties of early tumor-associated Fn networks and (ii) its effect on tumor vascularization remain unclear. Here, we first used the Surface Forces Apparatus to reveal that 3T3-L1 preadipocytes exposed to tumor-secreted factors generate a stiffer Fn matrix relative to control cells. We then show that this early matrix stiffening correlates with increased molecular unfolding in Fn fibers, as determined by F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer. Finally, we assessed the resulting changes in adhesion and proangiogenic factor (VEGF) secretion of newly seeded 3T3-L1s, and we examined altered integrin specificity as a potential mechanism of modified cell-matrix interactions through integrin blockers. Our data indicate that tumor-conditioned Fn decreases adhesion while enhancing VEGF secretion by preadipocytes, and that an integrin switch is responsible for such changes. Collectively, our findings suggest that simultaneous stiffening and unfolding of initially deposited tumor-conditioned Fn alters both adhesion and proangiogenic behavior of surrounding stromal cells, likely promoting vascularization and growth of the breast tumor.

Owing to the hierarchical porous structure and high affinity between VEGF and 26SCS, the 26SCS-modified PLGA (S-PLGA) scaffold possesses excellent entrapment and sustained release of VEGF. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a cell model, the VEGF-loaded S-PLGA scaffold shows desirable cell viability and attachment. The bioactivity of released VEGF is validated by intracellular nitric oxide secretion and capillary tube formation, demonstrating the improved capacity of VEGF-mediated pro-angiogenesis ascribed to 26SCS incorporation.

Inhibition of two \"risky\" miRNAs, miR-148a and miR-31, in orthotopic xenograft GBM mouse models suppressed tumor growth and thereby prolonged animal survival. Intracranial tumors treated with uncomplexed miR-148a and miR-31 antagomirs exhibited reduced proliferation, stem cell depletion, and normalized tumor vasculature. Growth-promoting functions of these two miRNAs were, in part, mediated by the common target, the factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (FIH1), and the downstream pathways involving hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1\u03b1 and Notch signaling. Therefore, miR-31 and miR-148a regulate glioma growth by maintaining tumor stem cells and their niche, and providing the tumor a way to activate angiogenesis even in a normoxic environment.

The aim of this study was to observe the feasibility of chitosan-\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate composite in repairing limb bone defects, and to evaluate the therapeutic effects on osteogenesis. Beagle mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were divided into an experimental group that was cultured with an injectable form of chitosan-\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate composite and a control group. The effect of the composite on bone tissue growth was evaluated by MTT assay. In addition, 12-month-old beagles were subjected to 15-mm femur defects and subsequently implanted with scaffolds to observe the effects on osteogenesis and vascularization. The dogs were subdivided into two groups of five animals: Group A, which was implanted with scaffold-MSC compounds, and Group B, which was implanted with scaffolds alone. The dogs were observed on the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 12th weeks post-implantation. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the composite was compatible with MSCs, with similar outcomes in the control and experimental groups. MTT analysis additionally showed that the MSCs in the experimental group grew in a similar manner to those in the control group. The composite did not significantly affect the MSC growth or proliferation. In combination with MSCs, the scaffold materials were effective in the promotion of osteogenesis and vascularization. In conclusion, the chitosan-\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate composite was compatible with the MSCs and did not affect cellular growth or proliferation, therefore proving to be an effective injectable composite for tissue engineered bone.

Since DBM is prepared in powder form its handling properties are not optimal and limit the clinical use of this material. Various synthetic and biological carriers have been used to enhance the DBM handling. In this study we evaluated the effect of gamma irradiation on the physical-chemical properties of Pluronic and on bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) amount in DBM samples. In vivo studies were carried out to investigate the effect on bone regeneration of a gamma irradiated DBM-Pluronic F127 (DBM-PF127) composite implanted in the femur of rats. Gamma irradiation effects (25 kGy) on physical-chemical properties of Pluronic F127 were investigated by rheological and infrared analysis. The BMP-2/BMP-7 amount after DBM irradiation was evaluated by ELISA. Bone regeneration capacity of DBM-PF127 containing 40% (w/w) of DBM was investigated in transcortical holes created in the femoral diaphysis of Wistar rat. Bone porosity, repaired bone volume and tissue organization were evaluated at 15, 30 and 90 days by Micro-CT and histological analysis. The results showed that gamma irradiation did not induce significant modification on physical-chemical properties of Pluronic, while a decrease in BMP-2/BMP-7 amount was evidenced in sterilized DBM. Micro-CT and histological evaluation at day 15 post-implantation revealed an interconnected trabeculae network in medullar cavity and cellular infiltration and vascularization of DBM-PF127 residue. In contrast a large rate of not connected trabeculae was observed in Pluronic filled and unfilled defects.

Failure in achieving these objectives leads to severe deformity and functional impairment, which significantly compromises the quality of life of young patients. Because of its biological and morphological characteristics, the proximal fibula epiphyseal transfer has proven to be an excellent option in limb salvage surgery in pediatric oncologic cases meeting all the reconstructive requirements.\nBetween 1992-2006, 8 children with a mean age of 7.3 years (range 4-11 years old) diagnosed with malignant bone tumor of the distal radius underwent tumor resection and immediate microsurgical reconstruction of the distal part of the radius with vascularized proximal fibular transfer, which included the physis and a variable length of the diaphysis. The anterior tibial vascular network supplied all of the grafts. One patient died to lung metastasis, 3.5 years after surgery; a second patient was lost at follow-up. The remaining 6 patients were periodically followed up both clinically, measuring range of motion, grip strength and the sensation of the hand, and by means of standard x rays, bone scan and CT scan.\nThe mean follow-up was 13.2 years (range, 8-22 years). All the transfers survived and underwent fusion at the recipient site. In our experience the fibular growth expected after the transplant, ranges between 0.7 and 1.4\u2009cm per year. In this series growth arrest occurred in only one patient after trauma. Serial radiographs and CT scans revealed progressive remodeling over time of the new articular surface. The functional result was rated as excellent in all but the one patient, in whom the distal portion of the ulna had to be resected because of tumor invasion. No major complication occurred at the recipient site. Peroneal nerve palsy occurred at the or site in 3 patients. The palsy was transient in 2 patients, but it persisted in one. No instability of the knee joint was observed.\nOur long-term results confirm that a vascularized transfer of the proximal fibula provides a reliable and durable reconstruction of the distal radius in children. Even after 22 years, the reconstructed joint resulted to be free of pain and degenerative changes thus maintaining a nearly normal range of motion. The described procedure is therefore highly recommended in case of distal radius reconstruction in growing children.", "journal": "Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...", "date": "2015-04-22", "authors": ["MInnocenti", "CBaldrighi", "GMenichini"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0035-1547304"}

BPND of treated U87MG tumors decreased significantly at day 1 (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and the difference was more significant at day 3 (p\u2009<\u20090.01), compared with the control group. However, the tracer uptake (%ID/g) derived from static images at 1-h time point did not show significant difference between the treated and control tumors until day 3. Little difference in tracer uptake (%ID/g) or BPND was found between treated and control A549 tumors. Considering the tracer retention in tumor and the slower clearance due to damaged tumor vasculature after treatment, BPND representing the actual specific binding portion appears to be more sensitive and accurate than the semiquantitative parameters (such as %ID/g) derived from static images to assess the early response of tumor to VDA treatment.\nQuantitative analysis based on dynamic PET with [(18)F]FPPRGD2 shows advantages in distinguishing effective from ineffective treatment during the course of VEGF121/rGel therapy at early stage and is therefore more sensitive in assessing therapy response than static PET.", "journal": "Molecular imaging and biology", "date": "2015-04-22", "authors": ["NingGuo", "FanZhang", "XiaomengZhang", "JinxiaGuo", "LixinLang", "Dale OKiesewetter", "GangNiu", "QuanzhengLi", "XiaoyuanChen"], "doi": "10.1007/s11307-015-0854-4"}
{"title": "Pituitary function and morphology in Fabry disease.", "abstract": "Endocrine abnormalities are known to affect patients with Fabry disease (FD). Pituitary gland theoretically represents an ideal target for FD because of high vascularization and low proliferation rate. We explored pituitary morphology and function in a cohort of FD patients through a prospectic, monocentric study at an Academic Tertiary Center. The study population included 28 FD patients and 42 sex and age-matched normal subjects. The protocol included a contrast enhancement pituitary MRI, the assessment of pituitary hormones, anti-pituitary, and anti-hypothalamus antibodies. At pituitary MRI, an empty sella was found in 11 (39%) FD patients, and in 2 (5%) controls (p < 0.001). Pituitary volume was significantly smaller in FD than in controls (p < 0.001). Determinants of pituitary volume were age and alpha-galactosidase enzyme activity. Both parameters resulted independently correlated at multivariate analysis. Pituitary function was substantially preserved in FD patients. Empty sella is a common finding in patients with FD. The major prevalence in the elderly supports the hypothesis of a progressive pituitary shrinkage overtime. Pituitary function seems not to be impaired in FD.

High risk was defined as a history of graft rejection, three or more quadrants of vascularization, or the presence or history of intraocular inflammation. An initial CsA dose of 3-5 mg/kg per day was given for 3-7 days, followed by 2.5-3.5 mg/kg per day for approximately 1 month. The concentration of CsA was maintained at the target trough level of 120-150 ng/ml for at least 6 months or until serious complications developed. The relationship between the cumulative dose and duration of CsA administration and the adverse systemic effects, including the frequency of herpes keratitis, was evaluated. The incidence of herpes keratitis in the study subjects was compared with the incidence in 185 patients who had not received CsA therapy following penetrating keratoplasty.\nThe mean survival time of the grafts was 33.6 months. Adverse effects occurred in 81.8 % of subjects. Hypertension, elevated liver enzyme levels, elevated serum creatinine level, and decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were observed in 14.8, 6.8, 5.7, and 5.7 % of subjects, respectively. Simvastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis also developed in one case. Some patients exhibited minor complications, with gastrointestinal problems and hypertrichosis recorded in 5.7 and 3.4 % of subjects, respectively. Hypertension and hepatotoxicity most frequently occurred after 4 to 8 weeks of medication, while ANC decrease and nephrotoxicity generally developed after 24 weeks of treatment, with incidence related to the cumulative dose. Herpes keratitis occurred more frequently (31.8 %) in the CsA-treated subjects than in subjects that did not receive CsA therapy (p\u2009=\u20090.005).

Prophylaxis is a major issue. Although many risk factors (old donor age, marginal graft, prolonged ischemia time, living-donor liver transplant, partial liver transplant, donation after cardiac death, hepatic arterial thrombosis, organ preservation, chronic rejection, and other donor and recipient characteristics) do not directly affect biliary complications, accumulation of the factors mentioned above, should be avoided.

{"title": "Notch activation enhances lineage commitment and protective signaling in cardiac progenitor cells.", "abstract": "Phase I clinical trials applying autologous progenitor cells to treat heart failure have yielded promising results; however, improvement in function is modest, indicating a need to enhance cardiac stem cell reparative capacity. Notch signaling plays a crucial role in cardiac development, guiding cell fate decisions that underlie myocyte and vessel differentiation. The Notch pathway is retained in the adult cardiac stem cell niche, where level and duration of Notch signal influence proliferation and differentiation of cardiac progenitors. In this study, Notch signaling promotes growth, survival and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells into smooth muscle lineages in vitro. Cardiac progenitor cells expressing tamoxifen-regulated intracellular Notch1 (CPCeK) are significantly larger and proliferate more slowly than control cells, exhibit elevated mTORC1 and Akt signaling, and are resistant to oxidative stress. Vascular smooth muscle and cardiomyocyte markers increase in CPCeK and are augmented further upon ligand-mediated induction of Notch signal. Paracrine signals indicative of growth, survival and differentiation increase with Notch activity, while markers of senescence are decreased. Adoptive transfer of CPCeK into infarcted mouse myocardium enhances preservation of cardiac function and reduces infarct size relative to hearts receiving control cells. Greater capillary density and proportion of vascular smooth muscle tissue in CPCeK-treated hearts indicate improved vascularization. Finally, we report a previously undescribed signaling mechanism whereby Notch activation stimulates CPC growth, survival and differentiation via mTORC1 and paracrine factor expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that regulated Notch activation potentiates the reparative capacity of CPCs in the treatment of cardiac disease.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2015-04-22", "authors": ["NatalieGude", "EriJoyo", "HaruhiroToko", "PearlQuijada", "MarloVillanueva", "NirmalaHariharan", "VeronicaSacchi", "SilviaTruffa", "AnyaJoyo", "MirkoVoelkers", "RobertoAlvarez", "Mark ASussman"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-015-0488-3\n10.1038/nature04940\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306146\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61590-0\n10.1073/pnas.0808357105\n10.1074/jbc.M109.046441\n10.1083/jcb.200806104\n10.1089/scd.2011.0463\n10.1038/nbt.1497\n10.1161/CIRCULATI0NAHA.112.092627\n10.1084/jem.20081427\n10.1161/CIRCULATI0NAHA.113.006591\n10.1016/j.devcel.2012.01.014\n10.1161/CIRCULATI0NAHA.109.884403\n10.1016/B978-0-12-398459-3.00007-1\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0751\n10.1038/nm0405-367\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176826\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.164749\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.04766.x\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61648-6\n10.1038/nrg2279\n10.1073/pnas.0709663105\n10.1007/s00395-013-0346-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029246\n10.1016/j.ceb.2007.02.012\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05099.x\n10.3109/08977194.2014.889694\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060161\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301152\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.151381\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.203034\n10.1002/stem.319\n10.1161/CIRCULATI0NAHA.110.947531\n10.1371/journal.pone.0038811\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60195-0\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.08.724\n10.1161/CIRCULATI0NAHA.111.047159\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302302\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.04.047\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243071\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehs269\n10.1007/s00395-012-0320-2\n10.3109/14017431.2010.511256\n10.1016/j.tcm.2007.01.003\n10.1007/s00395-013-0373-x\n10.1586/14779072.2014.972941\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.09.001\n10.1073/pnas.1404605111\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302500\n10.1586/14779072.2013.814830\n10.1038/nm.3656\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.218487\n10.1073/pnas.0600635103\n10.1161/01.RES.0000183733.53101.11\n10.1161/CIRCULATI0NAHA.112.131110\n10.1016/j.jmb.2005.11.097"}
{"title": "RNA sequencing reveals a slow to fast muscle fiber type transition after olanzapine infusion in rats.", "abstract": "Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs), like olanzapine, exhibit acute metabolic side effects leading to metabolic inflexibility, hyperglycemia, adiposity and diabetes. Understanding how SGAs affect the skeletal muscle transcriptome could elucidate approaches for mitigating these side effects. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were infused intravenously with vehicle or olanzapine for 24h using a dose leading to a mild hyperglycemia. RNA-Seq was performed on gastrocnemius muscle, followed by alignment of the data with the Rat Genome Assembly 5.0. Olanzapine altered expression of 1347 out of 26407 genes. Genes encoding skeletal muscle fiber-type specific sarcomeric, ion channel, glycolytic, O2- and Ca2+-handling, TCA cycle, vascularization and lipid oxidation proteins and pathways, along with NADH shuttles and LDH isoforms were affected. Bioinformatics analyses indicate that olanzapine decreased the expression of slower and more oxidative fiber type genes (e.g., type 1), while up regulating those for the most glycolytic and least metabolically flexible, fast twitch fiber type, IIb. Protein turnover genes, necessary to bring about transition, were also up regulated. Potential upstream regulators were also identified. Olanzapine appears to be rapidly affecting the muscle transcriptome to bring about a change to a fast-glycolytic fiber type. Such fiber types are more susceptible than slow muscle to atrophy, and such transitions are observed in chronic metabolic diseases. Thus these effects could contribute to the altered body composition and metabolic disease olanzapine causes. A potential interventional strategy is implicated because aerobic exercise, in contrast to resistance exercise, can oppose such slow to fast fiber transitions.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-04-22", "authors": ["Christopher JLynch", "YupingXu", "AndrasHajnal", "Anna CSalzberg", "Yuka ImamuraKawasawa"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0123966\n10.3810/pgm.2012.07.2577\n10.1016/j.ecl.2013.05.006\n10.1093/schbul/sbq053\n10.1097/JCP.0b013e31829e8333\n10.1371/journal.pone.0022662\n10.1038/oby.2006.6\n10.1038/mp.2010.33\n10.1152/physrev.00031.2010\n10.1097/MCO.0b013e328360272d\n10.1267/ahc.10041\n10.1100/2012/637978\n10.2337/db06-0981\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.01.036\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00242.2006\n10.1038/nrg2484\n10.1002/dvdy.20371\n10.1074/jbc.M512552200\n10.1006/bbrc.1996.5958\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00149.2012\n10.1111/j.1432-0436.2006.00118.x\n10.1172/JCI36277\n10.1078/0171-9335-00383\n10.1002/bies.20061\n10.1006/geno.1995.1259\n10.1242/jcs.004739\n10.1093/nar/gkl381\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2007.03.013\n10.1159/000235698\n10.1152/japplphysiol.91435.2008\n10.1091/mbc.E08-12-1251\n10.1139/y03-110\n10.3892/ijmm.2013.1453\n10.1152/ajpendo.00459.2005\n10.1073/pnas.1212976110\n10.1111/j.1748-1716.1986.tb07993.x\n10.2337/db06-0655\n10.1016/S0006-291X(03)00730-7\n10.1038/nrendo.2014.171\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016807\n10.1002/phy2.246\n10.1152/ajpregu.00056.2008\n10.1093/schbul/sbs196\n10.1097/JCP.0b013e318184b4c500004714-200810000-00004\n10.1007/s00415-004-0295-5"}

In the current study, a new antimicrobial carbopol-based hydrogel formulated with boron and pluronic block copolymers was evaluated for its healing activity using in vitro cell culture techniques and an experimental burn model. Cell viability, gene expression, and wound healing assays showed that gel formulation increased wound healing potential. In vitro tube-like structure formation and histopathological examinations revealed that gel not only increased wound closure by fibroblastic cell activity, but also induced vascularization process. Moreover, gel formulation exerted remarkable antimicrobial effects against bacteria, yeast, and fungi. Migration, angiogenesis, and contraction-related protein expressions including collagen, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor-\u03b21, vimentin, and vascular endothelial growth factor were considerably enhanced in gel-treated groups. Macrophage-specific antigen showed an oscillating expression at the burn wounds, indicating the role of initial macrophage migration to the wound site and reduced inflammation phase.

{"title": "Engineering \u03b2-cell islets or islet-like structures for type 1 diabetes treatment.", "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by the destruction of the \u03b2-cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. The current primary treatment for type 1 diabetes is insulin injections administered multiple times throughout the day. However, this treatment cannot provide sustained physiological release of insulin and the insulin amount is not finely tuned to the glycemia condition. Pancreatic transplantation or islet transplantation would be the preferred treatment strategy but the lack of donor tissue and immunoincompatibility has been shown to be a roadblock to their widespread use. Bioengineering strategies are poised to combat these challenges. Islet encapsulation is expected to offer both immunoisolation and immunomodulation effects by: (1) physically protecting islets from the attacks of immunoglobulins, complements, and host immune cells, and (2) delivering immune regulatory and immunomodulatory factors locally to the islets to protect those islets from immune rejection. Semi-permeable coatings using biocompatible biomaterials can be used for immunoisolating islets away from the host immune systems. Immunoisolation technology also provides an opportunity to use other cell sources for cell therapy to treat type 1 diabetes. Recently, some studies reported that co-transplantation of islets with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can control graft inflammation. MSCs have immunomodulatory property. They are able to secrete anti-inflammatory factors and repress the activity of various immune cells. Growth factors like interleukin 10 (IL-10) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) also have immune regulatory properties. Therefore immunoisolation and immunomodulation technologies can be integrated and applied to \u03b2-cell encapsulation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Through engineering \u03b2-cell islets or islet-like microtissues, the viability and function of transplanted \u03b2-cells may be improved.

Betaine treatment attenuated this increase in VEGF and HIF-1\u03b1 expression via suppression of diabetes-induced Akt activation in the retinas of the diabetic rats. The results suggested that betaine may potentially be used to delay the onset of complications associated with diabetic retinopathy via inhibition of retinal neovascularization in patients with diabetes.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2015-04-22", "authors": ["Young-GiunKim", "Hyung-HoLim", "Suh-HaLee", "Mal-SoonShin", "Chang-JuKim", "Hyeon JeongYang"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2015.3613\n10.2337/diacare.27.5.1036\n10.1167/iovs.02-0807\n10.1016/j.exer.2006.01.016\n10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00292-0\n10.1016/S1359-6446(04)03202-7\n10.1074/jbc.C200328200\n10.1179/016164105X25144\n10.1167/iovs.08-2591\n10.1016/S0968-0004(01)01958-2\n10.1161/01.RES.0000022200.71892.9F\n10.1007/s10571-007-9181-x\n10.1248/bpb.29.1597\n10.1016/j.neulet.2008.07.078\n10.1016/j.fitote.2008.02.014\n10.1007/s10456-007-9066-0\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.05.015\n10.1097/00002093-200107000-00008\n10.1016/j.neulet.2003.10.023\n10.1155/EDR.2000.131\n10.1016/j.phymed.2007.07.058\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.10.024\n10.1016/S0014-4835(03)00189-1\n10.1038/nm0603-669\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64773-6\n10.1096/fj.01-0944rev\n10.1038/cr.2008.70\n10.1097/01.iio.0000212142.15794.30\n10.1016/j.ajo.2006.06.068\n10.3727/000000003108749062\n10.1093/carcin/bgm232\n10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01657-4\n10.1038/79510\n10.1007/s00125-010-1727-7"}
{"title": "Biomaterials based strategies for skeletal muscle tissue engineering: existing technologies and future trends.", "abstract": "Skeletal muscles have a robust capacity to regenerate, but under compromised conditions, such as severe trauma, the loss of muscle functionality is inevitable. Research carried out in the field of skeletal muscle tissue engineering has elucidated multiple intrinsic mechanisms of skeletal muscle repair, and has thus sought to identify various types of cells and bioactive factors which play an important role during regeneration. In order to maximize the potential therapeutic effects of cells and growth factors, several biomaterial based strategies have been developed and successfully implemented in animal muscle injury models. A suitable biomaterial can be utilized as a template to guide tissue reorganization, as a matrix that provides optimum micro-environmental conditions to cells, as a delivery vehicle to carry bioactive factors which can be released in a controlled manner, and as local niches to orchestrate in situ tissue regeneration. A myriad of biomaterials, varying in geometrical structure, physical form, chemical properties, and biofunctionality have been investigated for skeletal muscle tissue engineering applications. In the current review, we present a detailed summary of studies where the use of biomaterials favorably influenced muscle repair. Biomaterials in the form of porous three-dimensional scaffolds, hydrogels, fibrous meshes, and patterned substrates with defined topographies, have each displayed unique benefits, and are discussed herein. Additionally, several biomaterial based approaches aimed specifically at stimulating vascularization, innervation, and inducing contractility in regenerating muscle tissues are also discussed. Finally, we outline promising future trends in the field of muscle regeneration involving a deeper understanding of the endogenous healing cascades and utilization of this knowledge for the development of multifunctional, hybrid, biomaterials which support and enable muscle regeneration under compromised conditions.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-04-22", "authors": ["Taimoor HQazi", "David JMooney", "MatthiasPumberger", "SvenGeissler", "Georg NDuda"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.110"}
{"title": "Acellular bi-layer silk fibroin scaffolds support functional tissue regeneration in a rat model of onlay esophagoplasty.", "abstract": "Surgical management of long-gap esophageal defects with autologous gastrointestinal tissues is frequently associated with adverse complications including organ dysmotility, dysphagia, and donor site morbidity. In order to develop alternative graft options, bi-layer silk fibroin (SF) scaffolds were investigated for their potential to support functional tissue regeneration in a rodent model of esophageal repair. Onlay esophagoplasty was performed with SF matrices (N\u00a0=\u00a040) in adult rats for up to 2\u00a0m of implantation. Parallel groups consisted of animals implanted with small intestinal submucosa (SIS) scaffolds (N\u00a0=\u00a022) or sham controls receiving esophagotomy alone (N\u00a0=\u00a020). Sham controls exhibited a 100% survival rate while rats implanted with SF and SIS scaffolds displayed respective survival rates of 93% and 91% prior to scheduled euthanasia. Animals in each experimental group were capable of solid food consumption following a 3\u00a0d post-op liquid diet and demonstrated similar degrees of weight gain throughout the study period. End-point \u03bc-computed tomography at 2\u00a0m post-op revealed no evidence of contrast extravasation, fistulas, strictures, or diverticula in any of the implant groups. Ex\u00a0vivo tissue bath studies demonstrated that reconstructed esophageal conduits supported by both SF and SIS scaffolds displayed contractile responses to carbachol, KCl and electrical field stimulation while isoproterenol produced tissue relaxation. Histological (Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin and eosin) and immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluations demonstrated both implant groups produced de novo formation of skeletal and smooth muscle bundles positive for contractile protein expression [fast myosin heavy chain (MY32) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)] within the graft site. However, SF matrices promoted a significant 4-fold increase in MY32+ skeletal muscle and a 2-fold gain in \u03b1-SMA+ smooth muscle in comparison to the SIS cohort as determined by histomorphometric analyses. A stratified squamous, keratinized epithelium expressing cytokeratin 5 and involucrin proteins was also present at 2\u00a0m post-op in all experimental groups. De novo innervation and vascularization were evident in all regenerated tissues indicated by the presence of synaptophysin (SYP38)+ boutons and vessels lined with CD31 expressing endothelial cells. In respect to SIS, the SF group supported a significant 4-fold increase in the density of SYP38+ boutons within the implant region. Evaluation of host tissue responses revealed that SIS matrices elicited chronic inflammatory reactions and severe fibrosis throughout the neotissues, in contrast to SF scaffolds. The results of this study demonstrate that bi-layer SF scaffolds represent promising biomaterials for onlay esophagoplasty, capable of producing superior regenerative outcomes in comparison to conventional SIS scaffolds.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-04-22", "authors": ["KhalidAlgarrahi", "DebraFranck", "Chiara EGhezzi", "VivianCristofaro", "XuehuiYang", "Maryrose PSullivan", "Yeun GooChung", "SaifAffas", "RussellJennings", "David LKaplan", "Carlos REstrada", "Joshua RMauney"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.092\n10.1038/gimo13"}

FE-SEM images indicate that the average fiber diameter increased from 392 to 541\u00a0nm when the coating bilayers varied from 5 to 20.5. Besides, the excellent biocompatibility and enhanced attachment and spreading of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) of prepared nanofibrous mats are confirmed by MTT and SEM results. Furthermore, the LBL structured (CS/collagen)n nanofibrous mats greatly improve the cell migration in\u00a0vitro, promote re-epithelialization and vascularization in\u00a0vivo, and up-regulate the expression of collagen \u2163 and \u03b1-tubulin, as well as the Integrin \u03b21 and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr-397. The levels of expressed protein are significantly enhanced with increasing coating bilayers via immunohistochemistry and western blotting analyses. Collectively, these results suggest that the LBL structured biomimetic nanofibrous matrices may enhance cell migration and further promote the skin regeneration by up-regulating the secretion of ECM protein and triggering Integrin/FAK signaling pathway, which demonstrate the potential use of the nanofibrous mats to rapidly restore the structural and functional properties of wounded skin.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-04-22", "authors": ["RongHuang", "WangzhouLi", "XiaoxingLv", "ZhanjunLei", "YongqianBian", "HongbingDeng", "HongjunWang", "JinqingLi", "XueyongLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.076"}
{"title": "Correlations between immune response and vascularization qRT-PCR gene expression clusters in squamous cervical cancer.", "abstract": "The tumour microenvironment comprises a network of immune response and vascularization factors. From this network, we identified immunological and vascularization gene expression clusters and the correlations between the clusters. We subsequently determined which factors were correlated with patient survival in cervical carcinoma.\nThe expression of 42 genes was investigated in 52 fresh frozen squamous cervical cancer samples by qRT-PCR. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis and mixed-model analyses were performed to identify gene expression clusters. Correlations and survival analyses were further studied at expression cluster and single gene level.\nWe identified four immune response clusters: 'T cells' (CD3E/CD8A/TBX21/IFNG/FOXP3/IDO1), 'Macrophages' (CD4/CD14/CD163), 'Th2' (IL4/IL5/IL13/IL12) and 'Inflammation' (IL6/IL1B/IL8/IL23/IL10/ARG1) and two vascularization clusters: 'Angiogenesis' (VEGFA/FLT1/ANGPT2/ PGF/ICAM1) and 'Vessel maturation' (PECAM1/VCAM1/ANGPT1/SELE/KDR/LGALS9). The 'T cells' module was correlated with all modules except for 'Inflammation', while 'Inflammation' was most significantly correlated with 'Angiogenesis' (p\u2009<\u20090.001). High expression of the 'T cells' cluster was correlated with earlier TNM stage (p\u2009=\u20090.007). High CD3E expression was correlated with improved disease-specific survival (p\u2009=\u20090.022), while high VEGFA expression was correlated with poor disease-specific survival (p\u2009=\u20090.032). Independent predictors of poor disease-specific survival were IL6 (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20092.3, p\u2009=\u20090.011) and a high IL6/IL17 ratio combined with low IL5 expression (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20094.2, p\u2009=\u20090.010).\n'Inflammation' marker IL6, especially in combination with low levels of IL5 and IL17, was correlated with poor survival. This suggests that IL6 promotes tumour growth, which may be suppressed by a Th17 and Th2 response.

{"title": "[Secondary orthopaedic complications after childhood tumors of the musculoskeletal system].", "abstract": "Multidisciplinary care, modern care management, and medical progress have brought significant gains in modern survival rates for children and adolescents with tumors of the musculoskeletal system.\nThe surgical approach must rest on the consideration of the long-term orthopedic sequelae likely to be caused by the elected treatment (limb amputation versus limb conservation - reconstruction choices), as well as by adjuvant therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Complications due to allograft reconstructions (infections, fractures, pseudoarthritis) occur within the range of 0 to 36 months. After 36 months, allograft longevity is fair, but 10 years later, 60% of grafts are likely to have failed and been removed. Joint prostheses have overall survival rates of 75% over 10 years, and 52% over 20 years. As for allografts, infectious complications occur within the first few years, while later prosthetic replacements are mostly due to mechanical causes. Assessing the long-term evolution of biological reconstructions proves a lot more challenging, due to the lack of hindsight and available information, except for vascularized fibula grafts, which show good long-term results. Numerous medical reviews have been published that address the quality of life of children treated for malignant tumors of the musculoskeletal system. They mostly consist in comparative studies between limb conservation and limb amputation, and point to similar results overall. Such data must be taken into account when deciding on a treatment for a child or an adolescent: quality of life, the function of the affected limb, the probable need for re-operation all encourage to favor reconstructions whenever they are possible, as they come closest to normal anatomy.\nToo frequently, medical knowledge remains fragmented among multiple disciplines, because of the difficulty of organizing follow-up over the very long-term.

{"title": "Targeting cMET with INC280 impairs tumour growth and improves efficacy of gemcitabine in a pancreatic cancer model.", "abstract": "Expression and activation of the cMET receptor have been implicated in tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy in human pancreatic cancer. In this regard we assessed the effects of targeting cMET in pancreatic cancer models in vitro and in vivo.\nHuman (L3.6pl, BxP3, HPAF-II, MiaPaCa2) and murine (Panc02) pancreatic cancer cell lines, endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were used for the experiments. Furthermore, the human pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa2 with acquired resistance to gemcitabine was employed (MiaPaCa2(G250)). For targeting the cMET receptor, the oral available, ATP-competitive inhibitor INC280 was used. Effects of cMET inhibition on cancer and stromal cells were determined by growth assays, western blotting, motility assays and ELISA. Moreover, orthotopic xenogeneic and syngeneic mouse (BALB-C nu/nu; C57BL/6) models were used to assess in vivo efficacy of targeting cMET alone and in combination with gemcitabine.\nTreatment with INC280 impairs activation of signaling intermediates in pancreatic cancer cells and ECs, particularly when cells were stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Moreover, motility of cancer cells and ECs in response to HGF was reduced upon treatment with INC280. Only minor effects on VSMCs were detected. Interestingly, MiaPaCa2(G250) showed an increase in cMET expression and cMET inhibition abrogated HGF-induced effects on growth, motility and signaling as well as DFX-hypoxia HIF-1alpha and MDR-1 expression in vitro. In vivo, therapy with INC280 alone led to inhibition of orthotopic tumor growth in xenogeneic and syngeneic models. Similar to in vitro results, cMET expression was increased upon treatment with gemcitabine, and combination of the cMET inhibitor with gemcitabine improved anti-neoplastic capacity in an orthotopic syngeneic model. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant inhibition of tumor cell proliferation (Ki67) and tumor vascularization (CD31). Finally, combination of gemcitabine with INC280 significantly prolonged survival in the orthotopic syngeneic tumor model even when treatment with the cMET inhibitor was initiated at an advanced stage of disease.\nThese data provide evidence that targeting cMET in combination with gemcitabine may be effective in human pancreatic cancer and warrants further clinical evaluation.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2015-04-18", "authors": ["FranziskaBrandes", "KatharinaSchmidt", "ChristineWagner", "JuliaRedekopf", "Hans J\u00fcrgenSchlitt", "Edward KennethGeissler", "Sven ArkeLang"], "doi": "10.1186/s12885-015-1064-9\n10.1093/annonc/mdt010\n10.3322/caac.21166\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2009.236\n10.1056/NEJMoa1011923\n10.1038/376768a0\n10.1083/jcb.200701086\n10.1073/pnas.0306068101\n10.1200/JCO.2011.40.3774\n10.1038/nrc3205\n10.1007/s10620-010-1416-x\n10.1245/s10434-012-2277-7\n10.1038/cddis.2013.158\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0175\n10.1371/journal.pone.0040420\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1157\n10.1593/neo.12878\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0312\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0373\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1104\n10.1002/hep.22685\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1700\n10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303588\n10.1097/00006676-200010000-00004\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1779\n10.1136/gut.2010.226092\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65561-7\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0837\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5960\n10.2174/1871520611313040009\n10.1245/s10434-007-9435-3\n10.3748/wjg.v18.i8.736\n10.1245/s10434-007-9583-5\n10.1053/j.gastro.2011.08.009\n10.1038/sj.onc.1206056\n10.1186/1471-2407-12-4\n10.1097/MPA.0b013e3181c15619"}

{"title": "Enhanced vascularization in hybrid PCL/gelatin fibrous scaffolds with sustained release of VEGF.", "abstract": "Creating a long-lasting and functional vasculature represents one of the most fundamental challenges in tissue engineering. VEGF has been widely accepted as a potent angiogenic factor involved in the early stages of blood vessel formation. In this study, fibrous scaffolds that consist of PCL and gelatin fibers were fabricated. The gelatin fibers were further functionalized by heparin immobilization, which provides binding sites for VEGF and thus enables the sustained release of VEGF. In vitro release test confirms the sustained releasing profile of VEGF, and stable release was observed over a time period of 25 days.

For example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the master regulator of physiological blood vessel growth and is one of the main molecular targets of therapeutic angiogenesis approaches. However, angiogenesis is a complex process and there is a need to develop rational therapeutic strategies based on a firm understanding of basic vascular biology principles, as evidenced by the disappointing results of initial clinical trials of angiogenic factor delivery. In particular, the spatial localization of angiogenic signals in the extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial to ensure the proper assembly and maturation of new vascular structures.

We propose an automatic observer-independent quantitative method (including downloadable source code) to analyze vascularization using two-dimensional microscopic images of histological cross-sections and advanced postprocessing, based on a 'positive- and negative-experts' model and a (corrected) nearest neighbour classification, in a vascularized tissue engineering model.\nAn established angioinductive rat arteriovenous loop model was used to compare the new automatic analysis with a common 2D method and a \u03bcCT algorithm. Angiogenesis was observed at three different time points (5, 10 and 15 days).\nIn line with previous results, formation of functional new vessels that arose from the venous graft was evident within the three-dimensional construct and a significant (p < 0.05) increase in vessel count and area was observed over time. The proposed automatic analysis obtained precise values for vessel count and vessel area that were similar to the manually gained data. The algorithm further provided vectorized parameterization of the newly formed vessels for advanced statistical analysis. Compared to the \u03bcCT-based three-dimensional analyses, the presented two-dimensional algorithm was superior in terms of small vessel detection as well as cost and time efficiency.\nThe quantitative evaluation method, using microscopic images of stained histological sections, 'positive- and negative-experts'-based vessel segmentation, and nearest neighbour classification, provides a user-independent and precise but also time- and cost-effective tool for the analysis of vascularized constructs.

{"title": "Impact of metabolic heterogeneity on tumor growth, invasion, and treatment outcomes.", "abstract": "Histopathologic knowledge that extensive heterogeneity exists between and within tumors has been confirmed and deepened recently by molecular studies. However, the impact of tumor heterogeneity on prognosis and treatment remains as poorly understood as ever. Using a hybrid multiscale mathematical model of tumor growth in vascularized tissue, we investigated the selection pressures exerted by spatial and temporal variations in tumor microenvironment and the resulting phenotypic adaptations. A key component of this model is normal and tumor metabolism and its interaction with microenvironmental factors. The metabolic phenotype of tumor cells is plastic, and microenvironmental selection leads to increased tumor glycolysis and decreased pH. Once this phenotype emerges, the tumor dramatically changes its behavior due to acid-mediated invasion, an effect that depends on both variations in the tumor cell phenotypes and their spatial distribution within the tumor. In early stages of growth, tumors are stratified, with the most aggressive cells developing within the interior of the tumor. These cells then grow to the edge of the tumor and invade into the normal tissue using acidosis. Simulations suggest that diffusible cytotoxic treatments, such as chemotherapy, may increase the metabolic aggressiveness of a tumor due to drug-mediated selection. Chemotherapy removes the metabolic stratification of the tumor and allows more aggressive cells to grow toward blood vessels and normal tissue. Antiangiogenic therapy also selects for aggressive phenotypes due to degradation of the tumor microenvironment, ultimately resulting in a more invasive tumor. In contrast, pH buffer therapy slows down the development of aggressive tumors, but only if administered when the tumor is still stratified. Overall, findings from this model highlight the risks of cytotoxic and antiangiogenic treatments in the context of tumor heterogeneity resulting from a selection for more aggressive behaviors.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2015-04-17", "authors": ["MarkRobertson-Tessi", "Robert JGillies", "Robert AGatenby", "Alexander R AAnderson"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1428"}

Previous scars can limit the vascularized territories suitable for transfer and can lead to significant partial flap necrosis.\nA retrospective review of abdominal free flap breast reconstructions performed by the senior author (GKL) over 5 years (2008-2013). Patients were grouped based on the presence or absence of abdominal scars and specific type/location of scar(s). In addition, we analyzed patient information. including demographics, body mass index, smoking history, comorbid conditions, and most importantly, surgical techniques to optimize vascular perfusion.\nWe identified 169 patients that underwent abdominal perforator free flap breast reconstruction. One hundred nine patients underwent previous abdominal surgery. Within this group, we had 2 complete flap losses, 5 major flap complications, 9 minor flap complications, and 9 donor site complications. Sixty patients had no previous abdominal surgery. Of these patients, we had no complete flap losses, 2 major flap complications, 1 minor flap complication, and 4 donor site complications. Patients with previous abdominal surgeries undergoing abdominal free flap breast reconstruction had a statistically significant higher rate of flap complications (P=0.02). Donor site wound healing complications were not statistically significant (P=0.5). The subgroup of patients that had both a previous intra-abdominal surgery scar and Pfannenstiel scar (21 patients) were at greatest risk for both free flap (19% of patients) and donor site wound healing (19% of patients) complications.\nAbdominal scars increase the risk of complications to the free flap. Unlike previous studies, patients with abdominal scars do not appear to have a statistically significant increase for donor site complications. Using the data from our study, we developed an algorithm for abdominal flap harvest in patients with abdominal scars. The algorithm emphasizes the importance of bipedicled perforator flaps and supercharging/turbocharging when blood flow is required across scars or when a large volume of tissue is needed crossing the midline. In specific cases, where perforator viability is in question because of a previous abdominal surgical procedure, we recommend the inclusion of muscle (Muscle-Sparing-transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous vs transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous).", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2015-04-16", "authors": ["MatthewNykiel", "CedricHunter", "Gordon KLee"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0000000000000509"}

Diffuse villous edema is related to fetal vascularization and associated with an increase of venous pressure; in our low-risk population, it is conceivable that these changes of fetal flow and pressure occurred in labor during the alteration of fetal heart rate. An increased number of syncytial knots and villous branching abnormalities have been previously associated with chronic placental hypoxic condition; in our low-risk population they could reflect a clinically undetectable hypoxic situation that acted during pregnancy reducing fetal resources to bear labor and delivery.\nPlacental histology provides useful information related to fetal acidemia in low-risk term pregnancy.", "journal": "Early human development", "date": "2015-04-16", "authors": ["LauraAvagliano", "AnnaLocatelli", "LuanaDanti", "SalvatoreFelis", "FedericoMecacci", "Gaetano PietroBulfamante"], "doi": "10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2015.03.004"}

In the Fut8(+/+) and Fut8(+/-) mice, multiple large and vascularized nodules were induced with an increased expression of Fut8 after DEN and PB treatment. However, the formation of HCC in Fut8(-/-) mice was suppressed almost completely. This potent inhibitory effect of Fut8 deficiency on tumorigenesis was also confirmed by the abolished tumor formation of Fut8 KO human hepatoma cell line cells by use of a xenograft tumor model. Furthermore, loss of the Fut8 gene resulted in attenuated responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the HepG2 cell line, which provides the possible mechanisms for the contribution of Fut8 to hepatocarcinogensis.

In contrast, when the same retrovirus is injected into the spinal cord of adult rats the resulting tumors are more indolent and display a unique histology characterized by nests of tumor cells separated by a dense vascular network without areas of necrosis. To study whether these differences are determined by the tumor cell of origin or due to microenvironmental influences, we conducted a series of transplantation experiments. Cells were independently isolated from PDGF-induced brain and cord tumors then subsequently transplanted into naive rat forebrains and spinal cords. The resulting tumors were characterized by histological analysis, marker expression profiling, PDGFR subtyping, and latency to tumor-induced morbidity. Tumor phenotypes were found to be consistently predicted by the tissue into which they were transplanted rather than by the tissue of origin.

Besides the biocompatibility for encapsulated cells, the mechanical and hydrophilic properties of the microgel are the utmost two factors for assembly and structure preservation. Herein, we developed a new composite hydrogel based on photocrosslinkable methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) and methacrylated alginate (AlgMA) for modular tissue engineering assembly. Based on the high cellular bioactivity of GelMA, inflexible AlgMA with a large number of hydrophilic groups was introduced to optimize the hydrogel assembly performance. The results revealed that the mechanical stiffness, swelling ratio and hydrophilicity were improved greatly, and the nutrient permeability as well as the cellular activity remained at a relatively high level simultaneously. The enhanced stiffness and hydrophilicity were helpful for the surface tension driven assembly, and the high nutrient permeability was conducive to the activity of encapsulated cells. Moreover, microgels with different shapes were fabricated, and microengineered complex structures constructed with spatial organized cell distribution and specific functions, such as osteon-like structure containing both osteogenic and vascularized area, were successfully generated by \"Lock and key\" and \"Concentric double-ring\" assemblies.

{"title": "Tracking mouse bone marrow monocytes in vivo.", "abstract": "Real time multiphoton imaging provides a great opportunity to study cell trafficking and cell-to-cell interactions in their physiological 3-dimensionnal environment. Biological activities of immune cells mainly rely on their motility capacities. Blood monocytes have short half-life in the bloodstream; they originate in the bone marrow and are constitutively released from it. In inflammatory condition, this process is enhanced, leading to blood monocytosis and subsequent infiltration of the peripheral inflammatory tissues. Identifying the biomechanical events controlling monocyte trafficking from the bone marrow towards the vascular network is an important step to understand monocyte physiopathological relevance. We performed in vivo time-lapse imaging by two-photon microscopy of the skull bone marrow of the Csf1r-Gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP (MacBlue) mouse. The MacBlue mouse expresses the fluorescent reporters enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) under the control of a myeloid specific promoter, in combination with vascular network labelling. We describe how this approach enables the tracking of individual medullar monocytes in real time to further quantify the migratory behaviour within the bone marrow parenchyma and the vasculature, as well as cell-to-cell interactions.

Animal models have been developed that attempt to mimic these conditions for the purpose of furthering our understanding of the complexity of chronic wounds. The model described herein is a rat ischemic skin flap model that permits a prolonged reduction of blood flow resulting in wounds that become ischemic and resemble a chronic wound phenotype (reduced vascularization, increased inflammation and delayed wound closure). It consists of a bipedicled dorsal flap with 2 ischemic wounds placed centrally and 2 non-ischemic wounds lateral to the flap as controls. A novel addition to this ischemic skin flap model is the placement of a silicone sheet beneath the flap that functions as a barrier and a splint to prevent revascularization and reduce contraction as the wounds heal. Despite the debate of using rats for wound healing studies due to their quite distinct anatomic and physiologic differences compared to humans (i.e., the presence of a panniculus carnosus muscle, short life-span, increased number of hair follicles, and their ability to heal infected wounds) the modifications employed in this model make it a valuable alternative to previously developed ischemic skin flap models.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2015-04-14", "authors": ["Andrea NTrujillo", "Shannon LKesl", "JacobSherwood", "MackWu", "Lisa JGould"], "doi": "10.3791/52637"}

Among the various available augmentation materials there is evidence that avascular fibula bone grafts possess a reliable resistance against resorption and may thus provide a valuable source to reduce the loss of vertical bone height after reconstruction of the severely atrophied mandible and maxilla. The purpose of the present study was to assess long-term crestal bone level stability in avascular fibula bone grafts. 8 edentulous female patients (average age 70.6 years) with Class-VI-atrophy and less than 5 mm residual bone volume received onlay-grafting with avascular fibula bone grafts and were monitored with a mean observation time of 133.7 months (121-186). A total of 39 implants were placed in the maxilla and mandible. Three patients received immediate and five patients delayed implant placement 3 months after grafting. All patients were provided with bar-retained dentures. Postoperative evaluation included clinical implant success (Buser) and radiographic examinations (orthopantomogram) to quantify crestal bone resorption. Grafting was successfully performed in all patients with no regrafting necessary. All implants but one, lost 2 years after abutment connection, remained successfully integrated and fulfilled the Buser criteria, rendering to a success rate of 97%. Mean bone resorption after 10 years was mesial 1.4 mm and distal 1.4 mm at each implant-site. Maximum bone resorption occurred between postoperative and first year, thereafter no significant resorption was measured in re-examinations up to 15 years.

Ultrasound (US) images were scored 0-3 for the degree of vascularity by two radiologists blinded to the diagnosis. Corresponding pathologic specimens were evaluated for vascularization of chorionic villi, degree of inflammation, morphology of maternal arteries, chorionic villous preservation, and percentage of clot, membranes, chorionic villi, and decidua/myometrium. Statistical analysis, including multiple linear regression, was performed.\nRPOC with histologically avascular chorionic villi or those with markedly reduced vascularization had significantly lower US vascularity scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.030) than those with chorionic villi showing normal or decreased vascularization. Sonographically avascular RPOC had a significantly lower percentage villi (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028) and higher percentage of decidua (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) than specimens where US showed any Doppler vascularity. Histologic vascularity of villi (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) and non-observation of maternal arteries (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) were significant predictors of US vascularity scores in multivariate linear regression analysis, while inflammation of villi (p\u00a0=\u00a00.053) was a marginally significant predictor.\nHistologic vascularity of villi appears to contribute to the observed variation in sonographic vascularity.

{"title": "Spatial and temporal mapping of heterogeneity in liposome uptake and microvascular distribution in an orthotopic tumor xenograft model.", "abstract": "Existing paradigms in nano-based drug delivery are currently being challenged. Assessment of bulk tumor accumulation has been routinely considered an indicative measure of nanomedicine potency. However, it is now recognized that the intratumoral distribution of nanomedicines also impacts their therapeutic effect. At this time, our understanding of the relationship between the bulk (i.e., macro-) tumor accumulation of nanocarriers and their intratumoral (i.e., micro-) distribution remains limited. Liposome-based drug formulations, in particular, suffer from diminished efficacy in vivo as a result of transport-limiting properties, combined with the heterogeneous nature of the tumor microenvironment. In this report, we perform a quantitative image-based assessment of macro- and microdistribution of liposomes. Multi-scalar assessment of liposome distribution was enabled by a stable formulation which co-encapsulates an iodinated contrast agent and a near-infrared fluorescence probe, for computed tomography (CT) and optical microscopy, respectively. Spatio-temporal quantification of tumor uptake in orthotopic xenografts was performed using CT at the bulk tissue level, and within defined sub-volumes of the tumor (i.e., rim, periphery and core). Tumor penetration and relative distribution of liposomes were assessed by fluorescence microscopy of whole tumor sections. Microdistribution analysis of whole tumor images exposed a heterogeneous distribution of both liposomes and tumor vasculature. Highest levels of liposome uptake were achieved and maintained in the well-vascularized tumor rim over the study period, corresponding to a positive correlation between liposome and microvascular density. Tumor penetration of liposomes was found to be time-dependent in all regions of the tumor however independent of location in the tumor. Importantly, a multi-scalar comparison of liposome distribution reveals that macro-accumulation in tissues (e.g., blood, whole tumor) may not reflect micro-accumulation levels present within specific regions of the tumor as a function of time.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2015-04-12", "authors": ["Sandra NEkdawi", "James M PStewart", "MichaelDunne", "ShawnStapleton", "NicholasMitsakakis", "Yannan NDou", "David AJaffray", "ChristineAllen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.04.006"}

Although human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is not endogenously synthesized by livestock, it binds the LH receptor, stimulating P4 synthesis. We hypothesized treating pregnant ewes with hCG would increase serum P4, number of corpora lutea (CLs) and concepti, augment steroidogenic enzymes, and increase membrane P4 receptors (PAQRs) and angiogenic factors in reproductive tissues. The objective was to determine molecular alterations induced by hCG in pregnant sheep that may promote pregnancy. Ewes received either 600\u200aIU of hCG or saline i.m. on day 4 post mating. Blood samples were collected daily from day 0 until tissue collection for serum P4 analysis. Reproductive tissues were collected on either day 13 or 25 of gestation and analyzed for PAQRs, CXCR4, proangiogenic factors and steroidogenic enzymes. Ewes receiving hCG had more CL and greater serum P4, which remained elevated. On day 25, StAR protein production decreased in CL from hCG-treated ewes while HSD3B1 was unchanged; further, expression of CXCR4 significantly increased and KDR tended to increase. PAQR7 and CXCR4 protein was increased in caruncle tissue from hCG-treated ewes. Maternal hCG exposure influenced fetal extraembryonic tissues, as VEGFA, VEGFB, FLT1, and ANGPT1 expression increased. Our results indicate hCG increases serum P4 due to augmented CL number per ewe. hCG treatment resulted in greater PAQR7 and CXCR4 in maternal endometrium and promoted expression of proangiogenic factors in fetal extraembryonic membranes.

{"title": "Improvement of endurance of DMD animal model using natural polyphenols.", "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common form of muscular dystrophy, is characterized by muscular wasting caused by dystrophin deficiency that ultimately ends in force reduction and premature death. In addition to primary genetic defect, several mechanisms contribute to DMD pathogenesis. Recently, antioxidant supplementation was shown to be effective in the treatment of multiple diseases including muscular dystrophy. Different mechanisms were hypothesized such as reduced hydroxyl radicals, nuclear factor-\u03baB deactivation, and NO protection from inactivation. Following these promising evidences, we investigated the effect of the administration of a mix of dietary natural polyphenols (ProAbe) on dystrophic mdx mice in terms of muscular architecture and functionality.

The duration of this transition is highly variable between patients and reliable predictive markers do not exist. We noticed in a subset of cases of GII, obtained by awake neurosurgery, the presence of microfoci with high cellular density, high vascular density, or minimal endothelial proliferation, which we called GII+. Our aim was to investigate whether these foci display immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics similar to GIII and whether their presence is correlated to poor prognosis. We analyzed cell proliferation, hypoxia, vascularization, and alterations of tumorigenic pathways by immunohistochemistry (Ki-67, CD31, HIF-1-alpha, EGFR, P-AKT, P53, MDM2) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (EGFR, MDM2, PDGFRA) in the hypercellular foci of 16 GII+ cases. We compared overall survival between GII, GII+, and GIII. Ki-67, and CD31 expression was higher in the foci than in the tumor background in all cases. Aberrant expression of protein markers and genomic aberrations were also observed in some foci, distinct from the tumor background. Survival was shorter in GII+ than in GII cases. Our results suggest that these foci are the early histological hallmark of anaplastic transformation, which is supported by molecular aberrations. Our study is the first to demonstrate intratumoral morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular heterogeneity in resection specimens of GII, the presence of which is correlated to shorter survival. Our findings question the discriminative capacity of the current glioma classification and provide arguments in favor of the creation of a grade intermediate between GII and GIII, to optimize the treatment strategy of GII.", "journal": "Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology", "date": "2015-04-11", "authors": ["Zo\u00e9Pedeutour-Braccini", "FannyBurel-Vandenbos", "CatherineGoz\u00e9", "CoralieRoger", "AudreyBazin", "Val\u00e9rieCostes-Martineau", "HuguesDuffau", "Val\u00e9rieRigau"], "doi": "10.1007/s00428-014-1712-5"}
{"title": "Acceleration of vascular sprouting from fabricated perfusable vascular-like structures.", "abstract": "Fabrication of vascular networks is essential for engineering three-dimensional thick tissues and organs in the emerging fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this study, we describe the fabrication of perfusable vascular-like structures by transferring endothelial cells using an electrochemical reaction as well as acceleration of subsequent endothelial sprouting by two stimuli: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and fluidic shear stress. The electrochemical transfer of cells was achieved using an oligopeptide that formed a dense molecular layer on a gold surface and was then electrochemically desorbed from the surface. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), adhered to gold-coated needles (\u03d5600 \u03bcm) via the oligopeptide, were transferred to collagen gel along with electrochemical desorption of the molecular layer, resulting in the formation of endothelial cell-lined vascular-like structures. In the following culture, the endothelial cells migrated into the collagen gel and formed branched luminal structures. However, this branching process was strikingly slow (>14 d) and the cell layers on the internal surfaces became disrupted in some regions. To address these issues, we examined the effects of the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, PMA, and shear stress generated by medium flow. Addition of PMA at an optimum concentration significantly accelerated migration, vascular network formation, and its stabilization. Exposure to shear stress reoriented the cells in the direction of the medium flow and further accelerated vascular network formation. Because of the synergistic effects, HUVECs began to sprout as early as 3 d of perfusion culture and neighboring vascular-like structures were bridged within 5 d. Although further investigations of vascular functions need to be performed, this approach may be an effective strategy for rapid fabrication of perfusable microvascular networks when engineering three-dimensional fully vascularized tissues and organs.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-04-11", "authors": ["TatsuyaOsaki", "TakahiroKakegawa", "TatsutoKageyama", "JunkoEnomoto", "TadashiNittami", "JunjiFukuda"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0123735\n10.1126/science.8493529\n10.1097/01.asn.0000119683.59068.f0\n10.1016/S0963-6897(98)00030-X\n10.1056/NEJM199410063311401\n10.1056/NEJMoa040455\n10.1054/ijom.2001.0130\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0314\n10.1016/s0026-2862(03)00045-1\n10.1161/01.res.83.10.1059\n10.1039/B615486g\n10.1039/b618409j\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.03.031\n10.1038/nmat3357.22751181\n10.1002/Bit.20903\n10.1002/lt.22157\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.03.045\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.11.104\n10.1002/term.519\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2011.0739\n10.1016/0092-8674(93)90573-9\n10.1677/erc.0.0070165\n10.1007/s00441-003-0745-x\n10.1083/jcb.200302047\n10.1038/Nature05571\n10.1016/j.molmed.2004.02.001\n10.1073/pnas.1105316108\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.001\n10.1007/s10439-010-9986-5\n10.1038/nprot.2009.221\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.062\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.06.014\n10.1182/blood-2012-08-452292\n10.1007/BF00620887\n10.1016/0092-8674(85)90104-7.2411423\n10.1039/B812184B\n10.1038/386671a0\n10.1152/ajpheart.00065.200400065.2004\n10.1038/21218\n10.1038/sj.cr.7290105"}

Here we identify a key role for serine and glycine metabolism in the survival of brain cancer cells within the ischaemic zones of gliomas. In human glioblastoma multiforme, mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2) and glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) are highly expressed in the pseudopalisading cells that surround necrotic foci. We find that SHMT2 activity limits that of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) and reduces oxygen consumption, eliciting a metabolic state that confers a profound survival advantage to cells in poorly vascularized tumour regions. GLDC inhibition impairs cells with high SHMT2 levels as the excess glycine not metabolized by GLDC can be converted to the toxic molecules aminoacetone and methylglyoxal. Thus, SHMT2 is required for cancer cells to adapt to the tumour environment, but also renders these cells sensitive to glycine cleavage system inhibition.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2015-04-10", "authors": ["DohoonKim", "Brian PFiske", "KivancBirsoy", "ElizavetaFreinkman", "KenjiroKami", "Richard LPossemato", "YakovChudnovsky", "Michael EPacold", "Walter WChen", "Jason RCantor", "Laura MShelton", "Dan YGui", "ManjaeKwon", "Shakti HRamkissoon", "Keith LLigon", "Seong WooKang", "MatijaSnuderl", "Matthew GVander Heiden", "David MSabatini"], "doi": "10.1038/nature14363"}

Previous studies have shown positive effects of either laser or light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapies on treating TMDs, but their action and mechanism in the inflammatory infiltrate of the temporomandibular joint are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to assess, through histological analysis, the effectiveness of using laser light (\u03bb 780\u00a0nm, 70\u00a0mW, continous wave (CW), 10\u00a0J) and LED (\u03bb 850\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u00a0nm, 100\u00a0mW, CW, 10\u00a0J) on the inflammation of the temporomandibular joint of rats induced by carrageenan.

We evaluated retinal blood flow velocity with laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) made in Japan, and found that cases in which both macular edema and retinal blood flow velocity improved after anti-VEGF therapy had better prognosis. In ischemic CRVO at final visit, mean retinal blood velocity was less than 50% of fellow eyes after 1st anti-VEGF therapy, suggesting that those cases might have poor prognosis.

In our study, we constructed a complex containing highly proliferative fibroblasts that can secrete extracellular matrix components and growth factors to chemotaxize endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in an attempt to create an ideal microenvironment for quick vascularization. Amniotic membrane microparticles (mAM) rich in type IV collagen (COL IV) and laminin (LN) were prepared, and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were infected with lentivirus (LV) of overexpression of SDF-1\u03b1 to construct SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF. Using the rotary cell culture system (RCCS), mAM was loaded with HDF or SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF to construct HDF-mAM and SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF-mAM complexes. The complexes were able to secrete various types of active peptides (IL-6, IL-8, TGF-\u03b2, and bFGF) during in vitro culture. In addition, SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF-mAM complex highly expressed SDF-1\u03b1. Transwell assay showed SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF-mAM complex had an apparent chemotactic effect on EPCs. Transplantation of complexes onto full-thickness skin defects of C57BL mice further demonstrated that SDF-1\u03b1 expression and the number of peripheral EPCs at days 3, 5, and 7 in the SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF-mAM group were significantly higher than that in other groups (p\u2009<\u20090.01).

In conclusion, HDF-mAM had a strong proliferative activity and could be used to create a sound microenvironment for quick vascularization by secreting multiple cytokines and extracellular matrix components.

We examined a novel detergent, sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES), to determine whether it could overcome the drawbacks associated with SDS using rat heart and kidney. Both organs were perfused in an antegrade fashion with either SLES or SDS. Although immunohistochemistry for collagen I, IV, laminin, and fibronectin showed similar preservation in both detergents, morphological analysis using scanning electron microscopy and an assay of glycosaminoglycan content on ECMs showed that SLES-treated tissues had better-preserved ECMs than SDS-treated tissues. Mesenteric transplantation revealed SLES did not induce significant inflammation, as opposed to SDS. Platelet adhesion to decellularized tissues was significantly reduced with SLES. Overall, SLES could replace older detergents such as SDS in the decellularization process for generation of transplantable recellularized organs.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Ectopic adhesion and growth are believed to occur under the influence of a favorable hormonal environment and immunological factors. The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of a targeted therapy with an antibody-based pharmacodelivery of interleukin 4 (F8-IL4) in a mouse model of experimentally induced endometriosis. Endometriosis-like lesions were induced in Balb/c mice. The animals were treated intravenously with F8-IL4 or with untargeted IL4 (KSF-IL4). Twelve days after disease induction, the lesions were isolated. A significant reduction in the number of total lesions/mouse and in the total volume of lesions/mouse was observed in mice treated with F8-IL4 compared to controls (P = .029 and P = .006, respectively), while no difference was found between KSF-IL4-treated mice and their controls. Gene expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Expression of genes involved in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix invasion, and neovascularization was significantly downregulated in F8-IL4-treated mice compared to their controls (integrin \u03b21: P = .02; metalloproteinase [MMP] 3: P = .02; MMP9: P = .04; vascular endothelial growth factor: P = .04). Gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL1\u03b1, and IL6) did not vary in the ectopic lesions isolated from F8-IL4-treated mice compared to their controls. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a significantly reduced expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin in the lesions of mice treated with F8-IL4. Our results show that the antibody-mediated targeted delivery of IL4 inhibits the development of endometriosis in a syngeneic mouse model by likely impairing adhesion, invasion, and vascularization of the ectopic endometrium.", "journal": "Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)", "date": "2015-04-09", "authors": ["FedericaQuattrone", "Ana MariaSanchez", "MariaPannese", "TeresaHemmerle", "PaolaVigan\u00f2", "MassimoCandiani", "FelicePetraglia", "DarioNeri", "PaolaPanina-Bordignon"], "doi": "10.1177/1933719115578930"}

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) along with two-dimensional (2D) US were used to characterize the biodegradation and neovascularization of silk protein (8 wt%) hydrogel implants in rats. Cylinder-shaped silk hydrogel plugs were implanted into the space between the hind limb thigh muscles in Wistar rats (n\u2009=\u20096). The increase of echogenicity in 2D US revealed tissue-ingrowth-accompanied gel degradation over 18 weeks. The shape and size of the implanted gels remained qualitatively unchanged until week 15, as confirmed by Bland and Altman analysis and visualization of retrieved samples. Using CEUS, neovascularization was monitored by the presence of microbubbles in the gel area, and the dynamic vascularization process was indicated by the contrast enhancement values, which showed a relatively low level (< 5 dB) during weeks 1-8 and significantly increased levels (around 20 dB at week 15 and\u2009>\u200935 dB at week 18), suggesting that major vascularization had occurred in the gel implants by this time point. Histological and scanning electron microscopic analysis of explants revealed time-dependent increases in the pore size of the gel matrix, the presence of endothelial and red blood cells and the number of blood vessels in the gel implants, indicating that degradation and vascularization did occur in silk gel implants during the time period.

{"title": "Local and systemic effects of the multifaceted epicardial adipose tissue depot.", "abstract": "Epicardial adipose tissue is a unique and multifaceted fat depot with local and systemic effects. This tissue is distinguished from other visceral fat depots by a number of anatomical and metabolic features, such as increased fatty acid metabolism and a unique transcriptome enriched in genes that are associated with inflammation and endothelial function. Epicardial fat and the heart share an unobstructed microcirculation, which suggests these tissues might interact. Under normal physiological conditions, epicardial fat has metabolic, thermogenic (similar to brown fat) and mechanical (cardioprotective) characteristics. Development of pathological conditions might drive the phenotype of epicardial fat such that it becomes harmful to the myocardium and the coronary arteries. The equilibrium between protective and detrimental effects of this tissue is fragile. Expression of the epicardial-fat-specific transcriptome is downregulated in the presence of severe and advanced coronary artery disease. Improved local vascularization, weight loss and targeted medications can restore the protective physiological functions of epicardial fat. Measurements of epicardial fat have several important applications in the clinical setting: accurate measurement of its thickness or volume is correlated with visceral adiposity, coronary artery disease, the metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease and cardiac changes. On account of this simple clinical assessment, epicardial fat is a reliable marker of cardiovascular risk and an appealing surrogate for assessing the efficacy of drugs that modulate adipose tissues.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

The following proangiogenic factors were examined: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12). As different surfaces lead to different cell reactions, titanium and PCL coating were compared. The growing into the porous titanium structure of primary osteoblasts was examined by cross sections. Primary osteoblasts seeded on the different surfaces were compared using Live Cell Imaging (LCI). Cross sections showed cells had proliferated, but not migrated after seven days. Although the cell count was lower on titanium PCL implants in LCI, the cell count and cell spreading area development showed promising results for titanium PCL implants.

{"title": "Systems biology of the microvasculature.", "abstract": "The vascular network carries blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen to tissues and providing a pathway for communication between distant organs. The network is hierarchical and structured, but also dynamic, especially at the smaller scales. Remodeling of the microvasculature occurs in response to local changes in oxygen, gene expression, cell-cell communication, and chemical and mechanical stimuli from the microenvironment. These local changes occur as a result of physiological processes such as growth and exercise, as well as acute and chronic diseases including stroke, cancer, and diabetes, and pharmacological intervention. While the vasculature is an important therapeutic target in many diseases, drugs designed to inhibit vascular growth have achieved only limited success, and no drug has yet been approved to promote therapeutic vascular remodeling. This highlights the challenges involved in identifying appropriate therapeutic targets in a system as complex as the vasculature. Systems biology approaches provide a means to bridge current understanding of the vascular system, from detailed signaling dynamics measured in vitro and pre-clinical animal models of vascular disease, to a more complete picture of vascular regulation in vivo. This will translate to an improved ability to identify multi-component biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of therapy that are easy to measure in vivo, as well as better drug targets for specific disease states.

In this technical note, the combination of vascularized iliac crest flap and vascularized medial femoral condyle flap (MFC) is described. The vascularized iliac crest flap is reported to be the gold standard for maxilla reconstruction. There is, however, no consensus on the best method for orbital and nasal wall reconstruction. The MFC flap can be harvested as a thin corticoperiosteal flap or as an osteomyocutaneous flap. Due to the periosteal blood supply, this flap can be customized for an individual defect of the upper hemi-midface. It is therefore of great benefit in orbital and nasal wall reconstruction. By combining the deep circumflex iliac artery (DCIA) bone flap and the MFC flap, the best standard reconstruction technique of the hemi-maxilla can be combined with a new anatomical precise microvascular reconstruction technique of the orbit.

Genetic lineage tracing reveals extensive endothelial plasticity in the postinfarct heart, showing that endocardial flowers develop by arteriogenesis of Cx40(-) cells and by outgrowth of pre-existing coronary arteries. Finally, endocardial flowers exhibit angiogenic features, including early VEGFR2 expression and active proliferation of adjacent endocardial and smooth muscle cells.\nArterial endothelial foci within the endocardium reveal extensive endothelial cell plasticity in the infarct zone and identify the endocardium as a site of endogenous arteriogenesis and source of endothelial cells to promote vascularization in regenerative strategies.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2015-04-03", "authors": ["LucileMiquerol", "J\u00e9romeThireau", "PatriceBideaux", "RachelSturny", "SylvainRichard", "Robert GKelly"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.306476"}

Several components of the cardiac injury microenvironment have been identified, yet no factor on its own is known to stimulate overt myocardial hyperplasia in a mature, uninjured animal. In this study, we find evidence that Neuregulin1 (Nrg1), previously shown to have mitogenic effects on mammalian cardiomyocytes, is sharply induced in perivascular cells after injury to the adult zebrafish heart. Inhibition of Erbb2, an Nrg1 co-receptor, disrupts cardiomyocyte proliferation in response to injury, whereas myocardial Nrg1 overexpression enhances this proliferation. In uninjured zebrafish, the reactivation of Nrg1 expression induces cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation, overt muscle hyperplasia, epicardial activation, increased vascularization, and causes cardiomegaly through persistent addition of wall myocardium.

Altered expression of proteoglycans on tumor and stromal cell membranes affects cancer cell signaling, growth and survival, cell adhesion, migration and angiogenesis. Despite the high complexity and heterogeneity of breast cancer, the rapid evolution in our knowledge that proteoglycans are among the key players in the breast tumor microenvironment suggests their potential as pharmacological targets in this type of cancer. It has been recently suggested that pharmacological treatment may target proteoglycan metabolism, their utilization as targets for immunotherapy or their direct use as therapeutic agents.

Here we shed light on the steps involved in structural formation of the mineralized tissue in midshafts of C57BL/6 femurs, shortly after birth. By combining 3D micrometer-resolution X-ray microtomography with 2D histology, we study the transformation of the tissue from a partially-mineralized scaffold into a compact bone structure. We identify three growth phases that take place during murine long bone maturation: During a patterning phase (I) mineralized struts form a loosely connected foam-like cortical network. During a transitioning phase (II), the extensive non-mineralized tracts vanish, transforming the foam into a fully continuous mass, by 14 days of age. Concomitantly, closed porosity increases to about \u223c 1.4%, and stays at this level, also found in maturity. During a shaping phase (III), the bones gradually attain their characteristic intricate adult form.

Human menisci were sampled from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Histological staining (H&E, PAS/Alcian Blue for neutral and charged carbohydrate residues) and (immuno)histochemistry were performed for detection of HA, CD44, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (EDG-1) as a marker for endothelial cells, CD3 as a marker for T-cells, CD20 as a marker for B-cells and CD68 as a marker for macrophages. The extracellular matrix in the vascularized zone showed higher amounts of HA as well as acid carbohydrate residues in comparison to the poorly vascularized zones of the meniscus in both disease entities. EDG-1 positive endothelial cells were present in all zones, with fewer cells being detected in the inner zones of the rheumatoid menisci than in the osteoarthritic ones.

The distribution patterns of the extracellular matrix components as well as the CD44-positive cells and the inflammation markers in the peripheral zone resembled the distribution in synovial tissue, indicating that both synovia and meniscus were involved in pathological changes in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.\nthe distribution of extracellular glycoconjugates and of cells modulating their synthesis showed similar results in both arthropathies, not enabling a differentiation between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis but underlining the role of these markers in inflammation and degradation in human meniscus.", "journal": "Acta histochemica", "date": "2015-04-02", "authors": ["Inga KatharinaFuhrmann", "J\u00f6rnSteinhagen", "WolfgangR\u00fcther", "UdoSchumacher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.acthis.2014.12.009"}

The high metabolic demand and insufficient vascularization of tumors cause a deficiency of oxygen and nutrients. Oncogenic mutations map to signaling events via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), metabolic pathways, and mitochondrial function. These alterations have been linked with cellular stresses, in particular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, hypoxia, and oxidative stress. Yet tumors survive these challenges and acquire highly energy-demanding traits, such as overgrowth and invasiveness. In this review we focus on stresses that occur in cancer cells and discuss them in the context of mTOR signaling. Of note, many tumor traits require mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity, but mTORC1 hyperactivation eventually sensitizes cells to apoptosis. Thus, mTORC1 activity needs to be balanced in cancer cells. We provide an overview of the mechanisms contributing to mTOR regulation by stress and suggest a model wherein stress granules function as guardians of mTORC1 signaling, allowing cancer cells to

{"title": "Study of restorative processes in brain laceration in the first seven days after traumatic brain injury.", "abstract": "Traumatic brain injuries represent the main cause of death and invalidity all over the world. Persons surviving a severe traumatic brain injury often present long-term disabilities, sensitive and motor deficits, cognitive, vegetative or mental disorders. Brain injuries are directly caused by the traumatic agent, and indirectly caused by the action of cells involved in the restorative process. The main cells involved in the restorative process are microglias and astrocytes. By using an experimental model, we investigated the reaction of these cells in the first week after a severe brain injury, followed by brain laceration. Of the two cell types, the most rapid and intense reaction was held by the macroglias, also known as resident macrophages of the central nervous system. Alongside the activation of local microglias, in the restorative process there were also involved blood monocytes that turned into macrophages. 24 hours after the injury, the number of macrophage cells\u00f7mm\u00b2 at brain wound level increased 2-4 times, after three days - 10-12 times, and after seven days - over 20 times. The astrocyte reaction was slower, their activation being signaled no sooner than three days from injury, when their number in the perilesional brain parenchyma increased approximately two times, while after seven days - approximately 4-5 times. Both astrocytes and macrophages (microglias), besides their beneficial effects in restoring traumatic brain injuries, may have unfavorable effects upon the nervous cells in the immediate proximity of the injury. Destruction of vascular network by the traumatic agent, and the extremely slow restore of vascularization, partially explain brain neurons death on extend areas.", "journal": "Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie", "date": "2015-04-01", "authors": ["CharoulaFlorou", "BogdanC\u0103t\u0103lin", "OanaBadea", "Tudor AdrianB\u0103l\u015feanu", "Cristina EugeniaVasilescu", "Lauren\u0162iuMogoant\u0103", "FlorinGrosu", "MariusMatei", "AdrianaTurculeanu"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Anisotropic silk biomaterials containing cardiac extracellular matrix for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Cardiac malformations and disease are the leading causes of death in the United States in live-born infants and adults, respectively. In both of these cases, a decrease in the number of functional cardiomyocytes often results in improper growth of heart tissue, wound healing complications, and poor tissue repair. The field of cardiac tissue engineering seeks to address these concerns by developing cardiac patches created from a variety of biomaterial scaffolds to be used in surgical repair of the heart. These scaffolds should be fully degradable biomaterial systems with tunable properties such that the materials can be altered to meet the needs of both in vitro culture (e.g. disease modeling) and in vivo application (e.g. cardiac patch). Current platforms do not utilize both structural anisotropy and proper cell-matrix contacts to promote functional cardiac phenotypes and thus there is still a need for critically sized scaffolds that mimic both the structural and adhesive properties of native tissue. To address this need, we have developed a silk-based scaffold platform containing cardiac tissue-derived extracellular matrix (cECM). These silk-cECM composite scaffolds have tunable architectures, degradation rates, and mechanical properties. Subcutaneous implantation in rats demonstrated that addition of the cECM to aligned silk scaffold led to 99% endogenous cell infiltration and promoted vascularization of a critically sized scaffold (10 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 2.5\u2009mm) after 4\u2009weeks in vivo. In vitro, silk-cECM scaffolds maintained the HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and promoted a more functional phenotype in both cell types. This class of hybrid silk-cECM anisotropic scaffolds offers new opportunities for developing more physiologically relevant tissues for cardiac repair and disease modeling.", "journal": "Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)", "date": "2015-04-01", "authors": ["Whitney LStoppel", "DongjianHu", "Ibrahim JDomian", "David LKaplan", "Lauren DBlack"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-6041/10/3/034105"}
{"title": "Using bimodal MRI/fluorescence imaging to identify host angiogenic response to implants.", "abstract": "Therapies that promote angiogenesis have been successfully applied using various combinations of proangiogenic factors together with a biodegradable delivery vehicle. In this study we used bimodal noninvasive monitoring to show that the host response to a proangiogenic biomaterial can be drastically affected by the mode of implantation and the surface area-to-volume ratio of the implant material. Fluorescence/MRI probes were covalently conjugated to VEGF-bearing biodegradable PEG-fibrinogen hydrogel implants and used to document the in vivo degradation and liberation of bioactive constituents in an s.c. rat implantation model. The hydrogel biodegradation and angiogenic host response with three types of VEGF-bearing implant configurations were compared: preformed cylindrical plugs, preformed injectable microbeads, and hydrogel precursor, injected and polymerized in situ. Although all three were made with identical amounts of precursor constituents, the MRI data revealed that in situ polymerized hydrogels were fully degraded within 2 wk; microbead degradation was more moderate, and plugs degraded significantly more slowly than the other configurations. The presence of hydrogel degradation products containing the fluorescent label in the surrounding tissues revealed a distinct biphasic release profile for each type of implant configuration. The purported in vivo VEGF release profile from the microbeads resulted in highly vascularized s.c. tissue containing up to 16-fold more capillaries in comparison with controls. These findings demonstrate that the configuration of an implant can play an important role not only in the degradation and resorption properties of the materials, but also in consequent host angiogenic response.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2015-04-01", "authors": ["AlexandraBerdichevski", "HaneenSimaan Yameen", "HagitDafni", "MichalNeeman", "DrorSeliktar"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1502232112"}
{"title": "CD14-expressing cancer cells establish the inflammatory and proliferative tumor microenvironment in bladder cancer.", "abstract": "Nonresolving chronic inflammation at the neoplastic site is consistently associated with promoting tumor progression and poor patient outcomes. However, many aspects behind the mechanisms that establish this tumor-promoting inflammatory microenvironment remain undefined. Using bladder cancer (BC) as a model, we found that CD14-high cancer cells express higher levels of numerous inflammation mediators and form larger tumors compared with CD14-low cells. CD14 antigen is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked glycoprotein and has been shown to be critically important in the signaling pathways of Toll-like receptor (TLR). CD14 expression in this BC subpopulation of cancer cells is required for increased cytokine production and increased tumor growth. Furthermore, tumors formed by CD14-high cells are more highly vascularized with higher myeloid cell infiltration. Inflammatory factors produced by CD14-high BC cells recruit and polarize monocytes and macrophages to acquire immune-suppressive characteristics. In contrast, CD14-low BC cells have a higher baseline cell division rate than CD14-high cells. Importantly, CD14-high cells produce factors that further increase the proliferation of CD14-low cells. Collectively, we demonstrate that CD14-high BC cells may orchestrate tumor-promoting inflammation and drive tumor cell proliferation to promote tumor growth.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2015-04-01", "authors": ["Ming TCheah", "James YChen", "DebashisSahoo", "HumbertoContreras-Trujillo", "Anne KVolkmer", "Ferenc AScheeren", "Jens-PeterVolkmer", "Irving LWeissman"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1424795112"}
{"title": "Influence of mouse strain on ovarian tissue recovery after engraftment with angiogenic factor.", "abstract": "For women facing gonadotoxic treatment, cryopreservation of ovarian tissue with subsequent retransplantation during remission is a promising technique for fertility preservation. However, follicle loss within grafted ovarian tissue can be caused by ischemia and progressive revascularization. Several xenograft models using different immunodeficient rodent lines are suitable for studying ovarian tissue survival and follicular viability after frozen-thawed ovarian cortex transplantation. SCID mice, which are deficient for functional B and T cells, are the most commonly used mice for ovarian xenograft studies. However, due to incomplete immunosuppression, NOD-SCID mice displaying low NK cell function and an absence of circulating complement might be more appropriate. The present study aims to define the most appropriate immunodeficient mouse strain for ovarian tissue xenotransplantation by comparing ovarian graft recovery in SCID and NOD-SCID mice following engraftment in the presence of isoform 111 of vascular endothelial growth factor.\nSheep ovarian cortex fragments were embedded in a collagen matrix, with or without VEGF111, before being stitched onto the ovaries of SCID and NOD-SCID mice. Transplants were recovered after 3\u00a0days to study early revascularization or after 3\u00a0weeks to evaluate follicle preservation and tissue fibrosis through histological analyses.\nAt day 3, vessels were largely reorganized in the ovarian grafts of both mouse strains. After 3\u00a0weeks, the cortical tissue was clearly identifiable in SCID mice but not in NOD-SCID mice. Upon VEGF111 treatment, vascularization was significantly improved 3\u00a0days after transplantation in SCID mice. This increase in vessel density was correlated with better follicular preservation in SCID mice 3\u00a0weeks after transplantation.

{"title": "Hypothalamic innate immune reaction in obesity.", "abstract": "Findings from rodent and human studies show that the presence of inflammatory factors is positively correlated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Obesity-associated inflammatory responses take place not only in the periphery but also in the brain. The hypothalamus contains a range of resident glial cells including microglia, macrophages and astrocytes, which are embedded in highly heterogenic groups of neurons that control metabolic homeostasis. This complex neural-glia network can receive information directly from blood-borne factors, positioning it as a metabolic sensor. Following hypercaloric challenge, mediobasal hypothalamic microglia and astrocytes enter a reactive state, which persists during diet-induced obesity. In established mouse models of diet-induced obesity, the hypothalamic vasculature displays angiogenic alterations. Moreover, proopiomelanocortin neurons, which regulate food intake and energy expenditure, are impaired in the arcuate nucleus, where there is an increase in local inflammatory signals. The sum total of these events is a hypothalamic innate immune reactivity, which includes temporal and spatial changes to each cell population. Although the exact role of each participant of the neural-glial-vascular network is still under exploration, therapeutic targets for treating obesity should probably be linked to individual cell types and their specific signalling pathways to address each dysfunction with cell-selective compounds.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

However, despite their limited conveyable volume, local flaps sometimes require a wide dissection area and long new incisions. Composite grafts also have serious limitations and require a well-vascularized recipient bed. To overcome these limitations, we used a free vascularized perivascular tissue flap based on the descending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery. Using this method, we performed reconstructions for seven patients (four cases in head and neck region and three cases in lower limb) with various soft tissue defects (ranged from 4.0\u00a0cm(3) to 40.0\u00a0cm(3)). This flap was easily elevated, without the need for precise preoperative flap design, and the flap volume was adjustable regardless of whether deep fascia and muscle were included.

Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (Hif-1\u03b1) was recently demonstrated to involve in the tissue fibrosis and influenced by Ang II. However, whether Hif-1\u03b1 contributed to the Ang II-mediated cardiac fibrosis after MI, and whether interaction or synergetic roles between Hif-1\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 pathways existed in the process was unclear. In vitro, cardiac cells were incubated under hypoxia or Ang II to mimic ischaemia. In vivo, valsartan was intravenously injected into Sprague-Dawley rats with MI daily for 1 week; saline and hydralazine (another anti-hypertensive agent like valsartan) was used as control. The fibrosis-related proteins were detected by Western blotting. Cardiac structure and function were assessed with multimodality methods. We demonstrated in vitro that hypoxia would induce the up-regulation of Ang II, TGF-\u03b2/Smad and Hif-1\u03b1, which further induced collagen accumulation. By blocking with valsartan, a blocker of Ang II type I (AT1) receptor, we confirmed that the up-regulation of TGF-\u03b2/Smad and Hif-1\u03b1 was through the Ang II-mediated pathway. By administering TGF-\u03b2 or dimethyloxalylglycine, we determined that both TGF-\u03b2/Smad and Hif-1\u03b1 contributed to Ang II-mediated collagen accumulation and a synergetic effect between them was observed. Consistent with in vitro results, valsartan significantly attenuated the expression of TGF-\u03b2/Smad, Hif-1\u03b1 and fibrosis-related protein in rats after MI. Heart function, infarcted size, wall thickness as well as myocardial vascularization of ischaemic hearts were also significantly improved by valsartan compared with saline and hydralazine.

To examine the efficacy of targeting HoxA5 therapeutically to quell pathologic or tumor angiogenesis, we generated an inducible, transgenic mouse model of sustained HoxA5 expression in ECs. During pathologic angiogenesis, sustained HoxA5 regulates expression several angiogenic effector molecules, notably increased expression of TSP-2 and reduced expression of VEGF, thus leading to inhibition of pathological angiogenesis in tissues. To evaluate if this impressive reduction of vascularization could also impact tumor angiogenesis, HoxA5 mice were bred with a mouse model of de novo squamous carcinogenesis, e.g., K14-HPV16 mice. Activation of EC-HoxA5 significantly reduced infiltration by mast cells into neoplastic skin, an early hallmark of progression to dysplasia, reduced angiogenic vasculature, and blunted characteristics of tumor progression. To evaluate HoxA5 as a therapeutic, topical application of a HoxA5 transgene onto early neoplastic skin of K14-HPV16 mice similarly resulted in a significant impairment of angiogenic vasculature and progression to dysplasia to a similar extent as observed with genetic delivery of HoxA5.

For this reason, in recent years many studies have examined a variety of human osteoblast and endothelial cell co-culture systems in order to distribute osteoblasts on all parts of the bone scaffold and at the same time provide conditions for the endothelial cells to migrate to form a network of capillary-like structures throughout the osteoblast-colonized scaffold. The movement and proliferation of endothelial cells to form capillary-like structures is known as angiogenesis and is dependent on a variety of pro-angiogenic factors.

{"title": "Hematopoietic stem cell-derived adipocytes and fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment.", "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is complex and constantly evolving. This is due, in part, to the crosstalk between tumor cells and the multiple cell types that comprise the TME, which results in a heterogeneous population of tumor cells and TME cells. This review will focus on two stromal cell types, the cancer-associated adipocyte (CAA) and the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). In the clinic, the presence of CAAs and CAFs in the TME translates to poor prognosis in multiple tumor types. CAAs and CAFs have an activated phenotype and produce growth factors, inflammatory factors, cytokines, chemokines, extracellular matrix components, and proteases in an accelerated and aberrant fashion. Through this activated state, CAAs and CAFs remodel the TME, thereby driving all aspects of tumor progression, including tumor growth and survival, chemoresistance, tumor vascularization, tumor invasion, and tumor cell metastasis. Similarities in the tumor-promoting functions of CAAs and CAFs suggest that a multipronged therapeutic approach may be necessary to achieve maximal impact on disease. While CAAs and CAFs are thought to arise from tissues adjacent to the tumor, multiple alternative origins for CAAs and CAFs have recently been identified. Recent studies from our lab and others suggest that the hematopoietic stem cell, through the myeloid lineage, may serve as a progenitor for CAAs and CAFs. We hypothesize that the multiple origins of CAAs and CAFs may contribute to the heterogeneity seen in the TME. Thus, a better understanding of the origin of CAAs and CAFs, how this origin impacts their functions in the TME, and the temporal participation of uniquely originating TME cells may lead to novel or improved anti-tumor therapeutics.", "journal": "World journal of stem cells", "date": "2015-03-31", "authors": ["YingXiong", "Lindsay TMcDonald", "Dayvia LRussell", "Ryan RKelly", "Katie RWilson", "MeenalMehrotra", "Adam CSoloff", "Amanda CLaRue"], "doi": "10.4252/wjsc.v7.i2.253"}
{"title": "Transcriptomal changes and functional annotation of the developing non-human primate choroid plexus.", "abstract": "The choroid plexuses are small organs that protrude into each brain ventricle producing cerebrospinal fluid that constantly bathes the brain. These organs differentiate early in development just after neural closure at a stage when the brain is little vascularized. In recent years the plexus has been shown to have a much more active role in brain development than previously appreciated thereby it can influence both neurogenesis and neural migration by secreting factors into the CSF. However, much of choroid plexus developmental function is still unclear. Most previous studies on this organ have been undertaken in rodents but translation into humans is not straightforward since they have a different timing of brain maturation processes. We have collected choroid plexus from three fetal gestational ages of a non-human primate, the baboon, which has much closer brain development to humans. The transcriptome of the plexuses was determined by next generation sequencing and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was used to annotate functions and enrichment of pathways of changes in the transcriptome. The number of unique transcripts decreased with development and the majority of differentially expressed transcripts were down-regulated through development suggesting a more complex and active plexus earlier in fetal development.

{"title": "Advanced targeted therapies in cancer: Drug nanocarriers, the future of chemotherapy.", "abstract": "Cancer is the second worldwide cause of death, exceeded only by cardiovascular diseases. It is characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation and an absence of cell death that, except for hematological cancers, generates an abnormal cell mass or tumor. This primary tumor grows thanks to new vascularization and, in time, acquires metastatic potential and spreads to other body sites, which causes metastasis and finally death. Cancer is caused by damage or mutations in the genetic material of the cells due to environmental or inherited factors. While surgery and radiotherapy are the primary treatment used for local and non-metastatic cancers, anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapy, hormone and biological therapies) are the choice currently used in metastatic cancers. Chemotherapy is based on the inhibition of the division of rapidly growing cells, which is a characteristic of the cancerous cells, but unfortunately, it also affects normal cells with fast proliferation rates, such as the hair follicles, bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract cells, generating the characteristic side effects of chemotherapy. The indiscriminate destruction of normal cells, the toxicity of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, as well as the development of multidrug resistance, support the need to find new effective targeted treatments based on the changes in the molecular biology of the tumor cells. These novel targeted therapies, of increasing interest as evidenced by FDA-approved targeted cancer drugs in recent years, block biologic transduction pathways and/or specific cancer proteins to induce the death of cancer cells by means of apoptosis and stimulation of the immune system, or specifically deliver chemotherapeutic agents to cancer cells, minimizing the undesirable side effects. Although targeted therapies can be achieved directly by altering specific cell signaling by means of monoclonal antibodies or small molecules inhibitors, this review focuses on indirect targeted approaches that mainly deliver chemotherapeutic agents to molecular targets overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells. In particular, we offer a detailed description of different cytotoxic drug carriers, such as liposomes, carbon nanotubes, dendrimers, polymeric micelles, polymeric conjugates and polymeric nanoparticles, in passive and active targeted cancer therapy, by enhancing the permeability and retention or by the functionalization of the surface of the carriers, respectively, emphasizing those that have received FDA approval or are part of the most important clinical studies up to date. These drug carriers not only transport the chemotherapeutic agents to tumors, avoiding normal tissues and reducing toxicity in the rest of the body, but also protect cytotoxic drugs from degradation, increase the half-life, payload and solubility of cytotoxic agents and reduce renal clearance. Despite the many advantages of all the anticancer drug carriers analyzed, only a few of them have reached the FDA approval, in particular, two polymer-protein conjugates, five liposomal formulations and one polymeric nanoparticle are available in the market, in contrast to the sixteen FDA approval of monoclonal antibodies. However, there are numerous clinical trials in progress of polymer-protein and polymer-drug conjugates, liposomal formulations, including immunoliposomes, polymeric micelles and polymeric nanoparticles. Regarding carbon nanotubes or dendrimers, there are no FDA approvals or clinical trials in process up to date due to their unresolved toxicity. Moreover, we analyze in detail the more promising and advanced preclinical studies of the particular case of polymeric nanoparticles as carriers of different cytotoxic agents to active and passive tumor targeting published in the last 5 years, since they have a huge potential in cancer therapy, being one of the most widely studied nano-platforms in this field in the last years. The interest that these formulations have recently achieved is stressed by the fact that 90% of the papers based on cancer therapeutics with polymeric nanoparticles have been published in the last 6 years (PubMed search).", "journal": "European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V", "date": "2015-03-31", "authors": ["EdgarP\u00e9rez-Herrero", "AlbertoFern\u00e1ndez-Medarde"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejpb.2015.03.018"}

Mathematical models can be used to analyze the intratumoral drug/DDS disposition and pharmacological effects and to assist in choice of optimal anticancer treatment strategies.\nThe mathematical models that have been applied by different research groups to describe the intratumoral disposition of anticancer drugs/DDSs are summarized in this article. The properties of these models and of their suitability for prediction of the drug/DDS intratumoral disposition and pharmacological effects are reviewed.\nCurrently available mathematical models appear to neglect some of the major factors that govern the drug/DDS intratumoral disposition, and apparently possess limited prediction capabilities.

Osteoblastic differentiation and mineral deposition were studied by staining for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and von Kossa, respectively, and measurements for ALP activity and calcium concentration (Ca). Cell proliferation was assayed with Alamar blue. The mechanism(s) were further studied by Transwell(\u00ae) cell culture experiments.\nBoth ALP and mineralization (von Kossa and Ca) were significantly higher in the MSC-MNC co-cultures compared to plain MSC cultures. VEGF alone had no effect on osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs, but further enhanced differentiation in co-culture settings. The mechanism was shown to require cell-cell contact between MSCs and MNCs and the factors contributing to further differentiation appear to be soluble. No differences were observed in cell proliferation.\nOur study demonstrates that the in vitro ALP activity and mineralization of human BM-MSCs is more efficient in the presence of PB-MNCs, and exogenously added VEGF further enhances the stimulatory effect. This indicates that PB-MNCs could be a potential cell source in development of co-culture systems for novel tissue engineering applications for enhanced bone healing.", "journal": "Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR", "date": "2015-03-31", "authors": ["KJoensuu", "LUusitalo", "J JAlm", "H TAro", "T AHentunen", "T JHeino"], "doi": "10.1016/j.otsr.2015.01.014"}

Although endometriosis contributes to 50% of female infertility cases, medical treatments are incompatible with pregnancy. Angiogenesis, the growth of blood vessels from existing vasculature, plays a crucial role in endometriotic lesion growth and survival. Previously, we demonstrated the effectiveness of thrombospondin-1 analog, ABT-898 (Abbott Laboratories) to inhibit endometriotic lesion vascularization in mice. We have now evaluated the trans-generational implications of ABT-898 treatment before and during mouse pregnancy. We hypothesized that ABT-898 would target lesion vasculature without affecting pregnancy, offspring development, or ovarian and uterine vascularity in mice. Endometriosis was induced using human endometrium in \u03b2-estradiol-primed BALB/c-Rag-2-/-Il2r\u03b3-/- mice receiving intraperitoneal injections of ABT-898 (25 mg/kg) or 5% dextrose control for 21 days. Ultrasound assessment of lesion vascularization revealed a reduction in blood flow supplying treated lesions. Excised ABT-898 treated lesions stained for CD31+ endothelial cells exhibited a decrease in microvessel density. Following confirmation of estrous cycling, mice were bred and treated with ABT-898 on gestation days 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. ABT-898 did not affect estrous cycling or pregnancy parameters including litter size across generations and offspring weight gain. Quantification of angiogenic cytokine plasma levels revealed no significant differences between treatment groups. Vimentin staining of the uterus and ovary revealed no observable effects of ABT-898. Similarly, no obvious histological anomalies were observed in the kidney, liver, ovary, or uterus following ABT-898 treatment.

In the present study, we set out to investigate the underlying mechanisms that lead offspring of undernourished mothers to premature ovarian aging. Pregnant dams were randomized to 1) a standard diet throughout pregnancy and lactation (control), 2) a calorie-restricted (50% of control) diet during pregnancy, 3) a calorie-restricted (50% of control) diet during pregnancy and lactation, or 4) a calorie-restricted (50% of control) diet during lactation alone. The present study shows that early life undernutrition-induced reduction of adult ovarian follicles may be mediated by increased ovarian endoplasmic reticulum stress in a manner that increased follicular apoptosis but not autophagy. These changes were associated with a loss of ovarian vessel density and are consistent with an accelerated ovarian aging phenotype.

Clinical outcome measures were interval between admission and surgery, length of ITU/HDU and hospital stays, post-operative complications, in hospital and one year mortality.\n25 patients were admitted. The median age was 39 years (range 30-53 years) with a female to male ratio of 1:3.3. The median interval between admission and surgery was 23 hours (range 2-195 hours), however, this was significantly less when the admitting specialty was directly to vascular surgery (median 4 hours, range 2-7) compared with other specialties (median 38 hours, range 7-195 hours). Ten patients required HDU/ITU care with a median duration of 4 days (range 1-12 days). Five patients (20%) required amputation, of whom two (40%) had a prosthetic limb fitted. There was one in hospital death (4%). Another patient died while awaiting limb fitting 4 months post discharge, giving a 1 year mortality of 8%.\nNSTI in IVDUs carries high risk of amputation with a very low rate of limb fitting. Intervention is significantly delayed when the admitting specialty is not vascular surgery, and half of these patients require HDU/ITU care, with significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and referral to vascular surgery is crucial in management of these patients.", "journal": "European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery", "date": "2015-03-26", "authors": ["DMittapalli", "RVelineni", "NRae", "AHowd", "S ASuttie", "NoneNone"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejvs.2015.02.002"}

The general distribution and variation of the vascular anatomy of the distally based venocutaneous flap on the medial plantar artery of the hallux with medial plantar vein and nutrient vessels were investigated. This study especially focused on the vascularization of the medial side of the foot and the determination of the contribution of the nutrient vessels of medial plantar vein and medial dorsal cutaneous nerve to flap viability. Experiments were conducted to obtain information for operating procedures and to understand the vascular reliability of the flap.\nThirty cadavers were available for this anatomical study after arterial injection. The tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone was adopted as the anatomical landmark. Microdissection was conducted under a microscope, and details of the course and distribution of the medial plantar vein and the communication of the medial plantar artery of the hallux with the fascial vascular network surrounding the medial plantar vein were recorded. The flap-raising procedure was performed in a fresh cadaver specimen.\nThe medial plantar vein was incorporated by the medial end of the dorsal pedal vein arch and medial dorsal vein of the hallux around the first metatarsal-medial cuneiform joint. It traveled along the medial margin of the foot and drained into the great saphenous vein at the level of the medial malleolar. The outer diameter of the nerve at the intermalleolar line was 3.2 \u00b1 0.5 mm. These nutrifying arteries to the medial plantar vein were present segmentally and mainly came from the medial plantar artery of the hallux, which traveled forward in the fascia between the abductor hallucis tendon and the first metatarsal bone, emerged into the superficial layer 2.2 \u00b1 0.7 cm proximal to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, and gave off many minute branches. These branches communicated with the fascial vascular network surrounding the medial plantar vein, supplying the fascia and integument of the medial foot.\nReliable venocutaneous flap with medial plantar vein and nutrient vessel flaps can be raised based solely on the perforator of the medial plantar artery of the hallux.

{"title": "Development and preparation of a low-immunogenicity porcine dermal scaffold and its biocompatibility assessment.", "abstract": "Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) has been widely used in repair and reconstruction of tissue defect. Therapeutic effect of porcine ADM (PADM) is inferior to that of human ADM (HADM). Relatively high immunogenicity and the resulting strong inflammatory response are major issue in application of PADM. We therefore treated reticular layer PADM (Rl-PADM) with matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and obtained a low-immunogenicity porcine dermal scaffold (LIPDS). Highly immunogenic components, tissue structure, cytocompatibility, and postgrafting histological changes of LIPDS were further investigated. Compared with Rl-PADM, LIPDS showed that the epithelial root sheath, cell debris, laminin, and type IV collagen were almost entirely removed, the structure remained normal, and the interfibrous space was relatively enlarged. Cytocompatibility of LIPDS was similar to that of HADM but superior to Rl-PADM. With regard to the extent of tissue ingrowth in terms of host fibroblasts infiltration and vascularization, LIPDS exhibited clear advantages over Rl-PADM after they had been subcutaneously transplanted in a rat model. In addition, no excessive inflammatory response was observed in LIPDS group up to 28 days postgraft, and the morphosis of collagenous fibers kept essentially normal. However, there were stronger inflammatory response and obvious collagen spallation in Rl-PADM group. The processes of integration and remodeling after the LIPDS grafting were similar to those of a normal wound healing response. The LIPDS graft was vascularized at a relatively high speed. Thus, as an implantable scaffold material, LIPDS is a superior template for guiding tissue regeneration and remodeling.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

Pelnac-treated animals displayed reduced granulation tissue during the first 6 days of treatment compared to the animals treated with Integra at the same time period. The number of inflammatory cells (neutrophils) was similar in both groups during the period, significantly reducing at the end of inflammatory phase (9th day of treatment) consistent with the progression of healing process.

In surgical technique, the posterolateral wall of the sphenoid sinus was opened by EEA. After cyst debridement, a vascularized nasoseptal flap with a width of approximately 4 cm was inserted into the lumen with a silicone T-tube with a diameter of 7 mm.

Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) are susceptible to tumor signalling and can be recruited to tumor regions. The precise role of MSCs in tumor development is still under debate since both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects have been reported. In this study we analysed the participation of renal CSC-derived EVs in the interaction between tumor and MSCs. We found that CSC-derived EVs promoted persistent phenotypical changes in MSCs characterized by an increased expression of genes associated with cell migration (CXCR4, CXCR7), matrix remodeling (COL4A3), angiogenesis and tumor growth (IL-8, Osteopontin and Myeloperoxidase). EV-stimulated MSCs exhibited in vitro an enhancement of migration toward the tumor conditioned medium. Moreover, EV-stimulated MSCs enhanced migration of renal tumor cells and induced vessel-like formation. In vivo, EV-stimulated MSCs supported tumor development and vascularization, when co-injected with renal tumor cells.

We incubated human umbilical vein endothelial cells on scaffolds with interconnections of various sizes. Results showed that scaffolds with a 150 \u03bcm interconnection size ameliorated endothelial cell function evidenced by promoting cell adhesion and migration, increasing cell proliferation and enhancing expression of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecules and vascular endothelial growth factor.

Implantation with scaffolds with 150 \u03bcm interconnection size significantly improved neovascularization as shown by micro-CT as compared to scaffolds with 100 and 120 \u03bcm interconnection sizes. Moreover, the aforementioned positive effects were abolished by blocking PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway with LY-294002.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Arg supplementation on uterine artery hemodynamics between 40 and 140 days of gestation. At 41 days of gestation, 17 Holstein heifers (448 \u00b1 73.9 kg) were surgically fitted with a catheter in the peritoneal cavity. After surgery, nine heifers received a daily intraperitoneal infusion of 40 mg of Arg/kg of body weight (BW; ARG), whereas the remaining eight heifers received a daily intraperitoneal infusion of saline solution at equivalent volumes as ARG heifers relative to BW (CTRL). Daily infusions took place every 12 hours until heifers reached 146 days of pregnancy. At 41, 62, 83, 104, 125, and 146 days of pregnancy, all heifers were body weighed, bled, and uterine blood flow volume (FV) and other hemodynamics were determined using Doppler ultrasonography. The measurements included heart rate, FV, pulsatility index, and resistance index. Plasma concentrations of amino acids (AAs), nitric oxide, glucose, insulin growth factor, progesterone (P4), growth hormone, and prolactin were analyzed. In a second experiment, we evaluated Arg metabolism when infused either intravenously or intraperitoneally. Overall, FV did not differ between the treatments, but it increased (P < 0.001) with pregnancy day. Uterine blood FV evolved differently between the treatments, with CTRL heifers having a greater (P < 0.05) FV (1104 \u00b1 65.42 mL/min) at 146 days of pregnancy than in ARG heifers (806 \u00b1 65.32 mL/min). Pulsatility index and resistance index decreased throughout pregnancy but did not differ between the treatments. Heart rate was decreased (P < 0.05) in ARG (74 \u00b1 1.4 beats/min) compared with CTRL heifers (81 \u00b1 1.5 beats/min). Plasma concentrations of Arg tended (P < 0.09) to be greater in ARG than those in CTRL heifers, but carnitine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan were lower (P < 0.05) in ARG than those in CTRL heifers. The proportion of essential AAs (with respect to total AAs) in plasma was greater (P < 0.05) in CTRL (73 \u00b1 2.4%) than that in ARG heifers (65 \u00b1 2.3%).

However, plasma P4 concentration was greater (P < 0.05) in ARG than in CTRL heifers.

Free flap surgery has continued to evolve, with developments in perforator and chimeric flaps, and new flaps continue to be described. An appreciation of the surgical history is important in understanding where we are today.

{"title": "Pelvic ring reconstruction with a double-barreled free vascularized fibula graft after resection of malignant pelvic bone tumor.", "abstract": "In patients undergoing limb-salvage internal hemipelvectomy, pelvic ring reconstruction is mandatory to maintain the stability of the pelvis and the spinal column, which finally expected to achieve a good functional outcome. However, no optimal reconstruction method has been established. In addition, no previous reports have highlighted the long-term complications of pelvic ring reconstruction after internal hemipelvectomy. We aimed to analyze the outcome of pelvic ring reconstruction using a double-barreled free vascularized fibula graft (VFG) after internal hemipelvectomy with special reference to long-term complications.\nWe conducted a retrospective review of 9 consecutive patients (5 male, 4 female; mean age 31 years) who underwent pelvic ring reconstruction using a double-barreled free VFG after internal hemipelvectomy (P1, n = 4; P1 + 4, n = 3; P1 + 2, n = 2) at our institution between 1998 and 2013. The mean follow-up period was 55 months (range 3-131 months).\nThe mean length of the bone defect was 9 cm. The methods of fixation included a Cotrel-Dubosset rod (n = 4), screw (n = 3), and screw and plate (n = 2). Bone union was achieved in 5 of 8 patients (63 %) over a 1-year follow-up. The mean period required for bone union was 5.4 months (range 3-7 months). There were 3 early postoperative complications: 2 deep infections resulting in graft removal and 1 implant failure resulting in non-union. Among 3 patients, 2 developed scoliosis within 5 years. One patient developed lumbar disc hernia as a result of scoliosis, for which surgical intervention was required. The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 57 % at the last follow-up.\nIn conclusion, this reconstruction method can achieve an early and high rate of bone union and provide good functional outcome. However, follow-up with careful attention to postoperative complications, including deep infection in the early postoperative period and spinal deformity in the long term, is necessary.", "journal": "Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery", "date": "2015-03-22", "authors": ["KoichiOgura", "MinoruSakuraba", "ShimpeiMiyamoto", "TomohiroFujiwara", "HirokazuChuman", "AkiraKawai"], "doi": "10.1007/s00402-015-2197-7\n10.1016/j.otsr.2009.04.008\n10.1097/01.blo.0000203485.90711.1b\n10.1097/01.blo.0000180046.97466.bc\n10.1007/s11999-012-2643-6\n10.1302/0301-620X.92B7.23497\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181706ff2\n10.1097/01.prs.0000181736.85276.78\n10.1302/0301-620X.96B2.32514\n10.1001/archsurg.1988.01400330097015\n10.1097/00003086-200107000-00025\n10.1097/01.blo.0000150371.77314.52"}

Besides, there is also an increased risk of postsurgical wound complications for diabetic patient. It has been revealed that traditional Chinese medicine may promote healing and inhibit scar formation, while the changes of morphology and physiology of wounds on such medicine treatment still remain elusive. In this study, we first used the ultralow temperature preparation method to produce mixed superfine powder from Agrimonia pilosa (A), Nelumbo nucifera (N), Boswellia carteri (B), and Pollen typhae (P), named as ANBP. Applying ANBP on 40 streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice (4-6 weeks, 20 \u00b1 2 g), we observed that the wound healing process was accelerated and the wound healing time was shortened (14 days, P < .05). Pathological observation using hematoxylin-eosin staining indicated that inflammatory cells were reduced (P < .05) while the thickness of granulation tissue and length of epithelial tongue were increased (P < .05). The vascular density was increased on 7 and 14 days after ANBP treatment. Masson and Sirius red staining showed that, at the early stage of trauma, the expressions of Col I and Col III, especially Col III, were increased in the ANBP group (P < .05). Studies in vitro demonstrated that tubular formation was significantly increased after ANBP treatment on human vascular endothelial cells in a dose-dependent way. Taken together, our studies revealed that ANBP treatment could accelerate wound healing, promote vascularization, and inhibit inflammation, suggesting the potential clinic application of ANBP for diabetes mellitus and refractory wounds.", "journal": "The international journal of lower extremity wounds", "date": "2015-03-22", "authors": ["QianHou", "Wen-JunHe", "LiChen", "Hao-JieHao", "Jie-JieLiu", "LiangDong", "ChuanTong", "Mei-RongLi", "Zhong-ZhiZhou", "Wei-DongHan", "Xiao-BingFu"], "doi": "10.1177/1534734615575244"}

Diabetic ulcers do not heal easily due to diabetic neuropathy and reduced blood flow, and nonhealing ulcers may progress to gangrene, which necessitates amputation of the patient's foot. This study attempted to develop a new cell-based therapy for nonhealing diabetic ulcers using a full-thickness skin defect in a rat model of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Allogeneic adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) were harvested from the inguinal fat of normal rats, and ASC sheets were created using cell sheet technology and transplanted into full-thickness skin defects in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. The results indicate that the transplantation of ASC sheets combined with artificial skin accelerated wound healing and vascularization, with significant differences observed 2 weeks after treatment. The ASC sheets secreted large amounts of several angiogenic growth factors in vitro, and transplanted ASCs were observed in perivascular regions and incorporated into the newly constructed vessel structures in vivo. These results suggest that ASC sheets accelerate wound healing both directly and indirectly in this diabetic wound-healing model. In conclusion, allogeneic ASC sheets exhibit potential as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetic ulcers.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2015-03-22", "authors": ["YukaKato", "TakanoriIwata", "ShunichiMorikawa", "MasayukiYamato", "TeruoOkano", "YasukoUchigata"], "doi": "10.2337/db14-1133"}
{"title": "Inosculation of blood vessels allows early perfusion and vitality of bladder grafts--implications for bioengineered bladder wall.", "abstract": "Bioengineered bladder tissue is needed for patients with neurogenic bladder disease as well as for cancer. Current technologies in bladder tissue engineering have been hampered by an inability to efficiently initiate blood supply to the graft, ultimately leading to complications that include graft contraction, ischemia, and perforation. To date, the biological mechanisms of vascularization on transplant have not been suitably investigated for urologic tissues. To better understand the mechanisms of neovascularization on bladder wall transplant, a chimeric mouse model was generated such that angiogenesis and vasculogenesis could be independently assessed in vivo. Green fluorescence protein (GFP) transgenic mice received bone marrow transplants from \u03b2-galactosidase (LacZ) transgenic animals and then subsequent bladder wall transplants from wild-type donor mice. Before euthanization, the aorta was infused with fluorescent microbeads (fluorospheres) to identify perfused vessels. The contributions of GFP (angiogenesis) and LacZ (vasculogenesis) to the formation of CD31-expressing blood vessels within the wild-type graft were evaluated by immunohistochemistry at different time points and locations within the graft (proximal, middle, and distal) to provide a spatiotemporal analysis of neovascularization. The GFP index, a measure of angiogenic host ingrowth, was significantly higher at proximal versus mid or distal regions in animals 2-16 weeks post-transplant. However, GFP index did not increase over time in any area. Within 7 days post-transplant, perfusion of primarily wild-type, donor blood vessels in the most distal areas of the graft was observed by intraluminal fluorospheres. In addition, chimeric host-donor (GFP-wild type) blood vessels were evident in proximal areas. The contribution of vasculogenesis to vascularization of the graft was limited, as LacZ cells were not specifically associated with the endothelial cells of blood vessels, but rather found primarily in areas of inflammation. The data suggest that angiogenesis of host blood vessels into the proximal region leads to inosculation between host and donor vessels and subsequent perfusion of the graft via pre-existing graft vessels within the first week after transplant. As such, the engineering of graft blood vessels and the promotion of inosculation might prevent graft contraction, thereby potentiating the use of bioengineered bladder tissue for transplantation.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The HIFs regulate placentation and vascularization by stimulation of VEGF gene expression. This study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of HIF gene family and VEGF in the cat uterus during pregnancy. Tissue samples of the whole uterine wall were collected after ovariohysterectomy and allocated to the following groups: embryo positive (group 1 [G1], n = 7, 7 days after mating), early pregnancy (group 2 [G2], n = 7, 20 days after mating), mid-pregnancy (group 3 [G3], n = 7, 24 days after mating), late pregnancy (group 4 [G4], n = 7, 30-45 days after mating), and oocyte positive groups (group 5 [G5], n = 7, 7 days after induction of ovulation with GnRH analog). Relative mRNA levels were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. As housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used. The relative gene expression of HIF1A in G5 was found to be significantly higher than that of other groups (G1, G2, G3, and G4) (P < 0.05). In addition, the expression of HIF2A in G5 was higher than that of G1 and HIF2A gene expression at placentation sites of G4 was higher than in G1, G2, and G3 (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry indicated that HIF1A, HIF2A, and VEGF expressions were observed in different cell types of uterine and placental tissues in late pregnancy and oocyte groups.

{"title": "Transcriptional repression caused by Dof5.8 is involved in proper vein network formation in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves.", "abstract": "Vascular plants have a network of vasculature in their leaves, which supplies water and nutrients and exports photoassimilates to other tissues. The vascular network is patterned during the development of leaf primordia through the induction of provascular differentiation by auxin. Arabidopsis thaliana Dof5.8, encoding a Dof-type transcription factor, is expressed early in provascular cells under the control of the MONOPTEROS transcription factor, also known as auxin response factor 5 (ARF5). Here, we report the effect of overexpressing Dof5.8 in provascular cells on the formation of the vascular network. Overexpression of Dof5.8 inhibited the formation of higher-order veins in cotyledons and leaves, probably through transcriptional repression by Dof5.8. The expression of auxin-associated transcription factor genes, DORNR\u00f6SCHEN and SHI-RELATED SEQUENCE 5, was downregulated in the Dof5.8 overexpressors, and overexpression of these genes partially rescued the impaired formation of higher-order veins in Dof5.8-overexpressing lines, suggesting that the overexpression of Dof5.8 modulates the auxin response and leads to impaired vein formation in A. thaliana.", "journal": "Journal of plant research", "date": "2015-03-22", "authors": ["MinekoKonishi", "ShuichiYanagisawa"], "doi": "10.1007/s10265-015-0712-0"}
{"title": "The effects of exendin-4 treatment on graft failure: an animal study using a novel re-vascularized minimal human islet transplant model.", "abstract": "Islet transplantation has become a viable clinical treatment, but is still compromised by long-term graft failure. Exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, has in clinical studies been shown to improve insulin secretion in islet transplanted patients. However, little is known about the effect of exendin-4 on other metabolic parameters. We therefore aimed to determine what influence exendin-4 would have on revascularized minimal human islet grafts in a state of graft failure in terms of glucose metabolism, body weight, lipid levels and graft survival. Introducing the bilateral, subcapsular islet transplantation model, we first transplanted diabetic mice with a murine graft under the left kidney capsule sufficient to restore normoglycemia. After a convalescent period, we performed a second transplantation under the right kidney capsule with a minimal human islet graft and allowed for a second recovery. We then performed a left-sided nephrectomy, and immediately started treatment with exendin-4 with a low (20\u03bcg/kg/day) or high (200\u03bcg/kg/day) dose, or saline subcutaneously twice daily for 15 days. Blood was sampled, blood glucose and body weight monitored. The transplanted human islet grafts were collected at study end point and analyzed. We found that exendin-4 exerts its effect on failing human islet grafts in a bell-shaped dose-response curve. Both doses of exendin-4 equally and significantly reduced blood glucose. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), C-peptide and pro-insulin were conversely increased. In the course of the treatment, body weight and cholesterol levels were not affected. However, immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in beta cell nuclei count and reduced TUNEL staining only in the group treated with a low dose of exendin-4 compared to the high dose and control. Collectively, these results suggest that exendin-4 has a potential rescue effect on failing, revascularized human islets in terms of lowering blood glucose, maintaining beta cell numbers, and improving metabolic parameters during hyperglycemic stress.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-03-21", "authors": ["AfafSahraoui", "Maria S\u00f6rhedeWinzell", "TracyGorman", "Dave MSmith", "StankoSkrtic", "MereteHoeyem", "ShadabAbadpour", "LarsJohansson", "OlleKorsgren", "AkselFoss", "HanneScholz"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0121204\n10.2337/dc12-0063\n10.1007/s11892-011-0217-8\n10.1097/TP.0b013e3181e25a40\n10.1155/2014/451035\n10.1371/journal.pone.0092066\n10.1111/j.1432-2277.2011.01275.x\n10.1016/B978-0-12-800101-1.00002-8\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.10.054\n10.3727/096368910X557263\n10.1016/j.metabol.2012.07.010\n10.3727/096368909X474456\n10.1097/TP.0b013e31817c4ab3\n10.1210/en.2011-1895\n10.1124/dmd.111.042291\n10.1371/journal.pone.0049152"}

Cell therapy with strong angiogenic factors could be an effective strategy to rescue the ischemic brain. We investigated whether cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP)-Ang1, a soluble, stable and potent Ang1 variant, enhances the angiogenesis of human cord blood derived endothelial progenitor cells (hCB-EPCs) for rescuing brain from ischemic injury. COMP-Ang1 markedly improved the tube formation of capillaries by EPCs and incorporation of EPCs into tube formation with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) upon incubation on matrigel in vitro. COMP-Ang1 stimulated the migration of EPCs more than HUVECs in a scratch wound migration assay. The transplanted EPCs and COMP-Ang1 were incorporated into the blood vessels and decreased the infarct volume in the rat ischemic brain. Molecular studies revealed that COMP-Ang1 induced an interaction between Tie2 and FAK, but AKT was separated from the Tie2-FAK-AKT complex in the EPC plasma membrane. Tie2-FAK increased pp38, pSAPK/JNK, and pERK-mediated MAPK activation and interacted with integrins \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23, \u03b14, \u03b21, finally leading to migration of EPCs. AKT recruited mTOR, SDF-1, and HIF-1\u03b1 to induce angiogenesis.

Recent works in animal models have advanced our understanding of the molecular and cellular players in vascular anastomosis, but questions remain related to cellular dynamics and control of this process, in vitro. In this study, we exploited a three-dimensional (3-D) culture platform to examine the dynamics of endothelial cell (EC) during and after vascular anastomosis by allowing angiogenesis and vasculogenesis to proceed in parallel. We show that anastomosis occurs between sprouts formed by angiogenesis from an endothelium and tubes formed by vasculogenesis in the bulk of a 3-D matrix. This fusion leads to highly connected vessels that span from the surface of the matrix into the bulk in a manner that depends on cell density and identity. Further, we observe and analyze intermixing of endothelial cells of distinct origin (surface versus bulk) within the vessels structures that are formed; we provide evidence that the cells migrate along pre-existing vessels segments as part of this intermixing process. We conclude that anastomosis can occur between vessels emerging by angiogenesis and vasculogenesis and that this process may play an important role in contexts such as wound healing.", "journal": "Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro", "date": "2015-03-20", "authors": ["AnthonyDiaz-Santana", "MengrouShan", "Abraham DStroock"], "doi": "10.1039/c5ib00052a\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2012.0430"}

We analyse three functional imaging techniques that can be useful tools for achieving this objective.\nThe three different imaging modalities from one selected patient are ADC maps, DCE-MRI, and 18F-FDG PET/CT, because they are widely used and give a great amount of complementary information. We show the relationship between these three datasets and evaluate them as markers for tumour response or hypoxia marker. Thus, vascularization measured using DCE-MRI parameters can determine tumour hypoxia, and ADC maps can be used for evaluating tumour response.\nADC and DCE-MRI include information from 18F-FDG, as glucose metabolism is associated with hypoxia and tumour cell density, although 18F-FDG includes more information about the malignancy of the tumour. The main disadvantage of ADC maps is the distortion, and we used only low distorted regions, and extracellular volume calculated from DCE-MRI can be considered equivalent to ADC in well-vascularized areas.\nA dataset for achieving the biologically guided radiotherapy must include a tumour density study and a hypoxia marker.

Microporous (20\u00a0\u03bcm) and macroporous (200\u00a0\u03bcm) scaffolds were functionalized with low, medium, or high molecular weight fucoidans (named LMWF, MMWF, and HMWF, respectively). In vitro, addition of fucoidans promoted endothelial progenitor cells proliferation in both micro- and macroporous scaffolds. While control scaffolds without fucoidans loaded with VEGF165 (100\u00a0ng) showed a fast burst release in PBS during the first 24\u00a0h, MMWF significantly reduced the VEGF165 release (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Surface plasmon resonance experiments confirmed a direct interaction between MMWF and VEGF165, characterized by an affinity K D (K d/K a) of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-9)\u00a0M. In a subcutaneous angiogenesis model in mice, fucoidan functionalized scaffolds showed a more intense vascularization response than control groups. Expression of isolectin-B4 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, as well as confinement of erythrocytes, demonstrated the neoformed blood vessels functionality. There was a significant difference in neovessel area and neovessel density between MMWF scaffolds or VEGF165 scaffolds and MMWF+VEGF165 scaffolds (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for all cases).

Blocking the CD40:CD154 pathway with anti-CD154 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is exceptionally potent in inducing mixed chimerism, but these mAbs are clinically not available. Defining the roles of donor and recipient CD40 in a murine allogeneic BMT model, we show that CD4 or CD8 activation through an intact direct or CD4 T cell activation through the indirect pathway is sufficient to trigger BM rejection despite CTLA4Ig treatment. In the absence of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cell activation via the direct pathway, in contrast, leads to a state of split tolerance. Interruption of the CD40 signals in both the direct and indirect pathway of allorecognition or lack of recipient CD154 is required for the induction of chimerism and tolerance. We developed a novel BMT protocol that induces mixed chimerism and donor-specific tolerance to fully mismatched cardiac allografts relying on CD28 costimulation blockade and mTOR inhibition without targeting the CD40 pathway.

{"title": "Controlled release of vascular endothelial growth factor from spray-dried alginate microparticles in collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffolds for promoting vascularization and bone repair.", "abstract": "A major limitation with current tissue-engineering approaches is creating functionally vascularized constructs that can successfully integrate with the host; this often leads to implant failure, due to avascular necrosis. In order to overcome this, the objective of the present work was to develop a method to incorporate growth factor-eluting alginate microparticles (MPs) into freeze-dried, collagen-based scaffolds. A collagen-hydroxyapatite (CHA) scaffold, previously optimized for bone regeneration, was functionalized for the sustained delivery of an angiogenic growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), with the aim of facilitating angiogenesis and enhancing bone regeneration. VEGF was initially encapsulated in alginate MPs by spray-drying, producing particles of\u2009<\u200910\u2009\u00b5m in diameter. This process was found to effectively encapsulate and control VEGF release while maintaining its stability and bioactivity post-processing. These VEGF-MPs were then incorporated into CHA scaffolds, leading to homogeneous distribution throughout the interconnected scaffold pore structure. The scaffolds were capable of sustained release of bioactive VEGF for up to 35\u2009days, which was proficient at increasing tubule formation by endothelial cells in vitro. When implanted in vivo in a rat calvarial defect model, this scaffold enhanced vessel formation, resulting in increased bone regeneration compared to empty-defect and VEGF-free scaffolds. This biologically functionalized scaffold, composed entirely of natural-based materials, may offer an ideal platform to promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration.

The treatment of choice is by pulsed dye LASER (PDL), and requires several sessions. The efficacy of this treatment is at present evaluated on the basis of clinical inspection and of digital photographs taken throughout the treatment. LASER-Doppler imaging (LDI) is a noninvasive method of imaging the perfusion of the tissues by the microcirculatory system (capillaries). The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that LDI allows a quantitative, numerical evaluation of the efficacy of the PDL treatment of PWS.\nThe PDL sessions were organized according to the usual scheme, every other month, from September 1, 2012, to September 30, 2013. LDI imaging was performed at the start and at the conclusion of the PDL treatment, and simultaneously on healthy skin in order to obtain reference values. The results evidenced by LDI were analyzed according to the \"Wilcoxon signed-rank\" test before and after each session, and in the intervals between the three PDL treatment sessions.\nOur prospective study is based on 20 new children. On average, the vascularization of the PWS was reduced by 56% after three laser sessions. Compared with healthy skin, initial vascularization of PWS was 62% higher than that of healthy skin at the start of treatment, and 6% higher after three sessions. During the 2 months between two sessions, vascularization of the capillary network increased by 27%.\nThis study shows that LDI can demonstrate and measure the efficacy of PDL treatment of PWS in children.

{"title": "Neuronal and vascular interactions.", "abstract": "The brain, which represents 2% of body mass but consumes 20% of body energy at rest, has a limited capacity to store energy and is therefore highly dependent on oxygen and glucose supply from the blood stream. Normal functioning of neural circuits thus relies on adequate matching between metabolic needs and blood supply. Moreover, not only does the brain need to be densely vascularized, it also requires a tightly controlled environment free of toxins and pathogens to provide the proper chemical composition for synaptic transmission and neuronal function. In this review, we focus on three major factors that ensure optimal brain perfusion and function: the patterning of vascular networks to efficiently deliver blood and nutrients, the function of the blood-brain barrier to maintain brain homeostasis, and the regulation of cerebral blood flow to adequately couple energy supply to neural function.", "journal": "Annual review of neuroscience", "date": "2015-03-19", "authors": ["Benjamin JAndreone", "BaptisteLacoste", "ChenghuaGu"], "doi": "10.1146/annurev-neuro-071714-033835"}
{"title": "Wing bone laminarity is not an adaptation for torsional resistance in bats.", "abstract": "Torsional loading is a common feature of skeletal biomechanics during vertebrate flight. The importance of resisting torsional loads is best illustrated by the convergence of wing bone structure (e.g., long with thin walls) across extant bats and birds. Whether or not such a convergence occurs at the microstructural level is less clear. In volant birds, the humeri and ulnae often contain abundant laminar bony tissue in which primary circumferential vascular canals course concentrically about the long axis of the bone. These circumferential canals and the matrix surrounding them presumably function to resist the tissue-level shear stress caused by flight-induced torsion. Here, we assess whether or not laminar bone is a general adaptive feature in extant flying vertebrates using a histological analysis of bat bones. We sampled the humeri from six adult taxa representing a broad phylogenetic and body size range (6-1,000 g). Transverse thick sections were prepared from the midshaft of each humerus. Bone tissue was classified based on the predominant orientation of primary vascular canals. Our results show that humeri from bats across a wide phylogenetic and body size range do not contain any laminar bone. Instead, humeri are essentially avascular in bats below about 100 g and are poorly vascularized with occasional longitudinal to slightly radial canals in large bats. In contrast, humeri from birds across a comparable size range (40-1,000 g) are highly vascularized with a wide range in bone laminarity. Phylogenetically-informed scaling analyses reveal that the difference in vascularity between birds and bats is best explained by higher somatic relative growth rates in birds. The presence of wing bone laminarity in birds and its absence in bats suggests that laminar bone is not a necessary biomechanical feature in flying vertebrates and may be apomorphic to birds.", "journal": "PeerJ", "date": "2015-03-18", "authors": ["Andrew HLee", "Erin L RSimons"], "doi": "10.7717/peerj.823\n10.7882/AZ.2010.022\n10.1002/jmor.1052250106\n10.1038/nature05634\n10.1046/j.1420-9101.2002.00472.x\n10.1111/j.1469-7998.1990.tb04039.x\n10.1086/410622\n10.1016/S0764-4469(00)00181-5\n10.1098/rspb.2008.0912\n10.1101/gad.1620408\n10.1016/S0003-4339(98)80134-2\n10.1080/10635150591003461\n10.1006/jhev.2002.0574\n10.1371/currents.tol.c1af68dda7c999ed9f1e4b2d2df7a08e\n10.1139/z06-195\n10.1002/jmor.10604\n10.1007/s003600050202\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00442.x\n10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00118.x\n10.1016/S1631-0691(02)01429-4\n10.1242/jeb.00841\n10.1098/rspb.2010.0117\n10.1179/his.1994.17.4.357\n10.1086/303327\n10.1007/s003600050203\n10.1111/1365-2656.12086\n10.1093/biomet/76.2.297\n10.3161/1733-5329(2006)8[1:AMFDTM]2.0.CO;2\n10.1038/nature11631\n10.3161/150811012X654312\n10.1644/1545-1410(2000)639<0001:PH>2.0.CO;2\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btq166\n10.1093/jmammal/81.1.234\n10.1644/1545-1410(2000)642<0001:PV>2.0.CO;2\n10.1111/j.0021-8782.2004.00275.x\n10.1080/02724634.2013.743898\n10.1371/journal.pone.0106094\n10.1086/286013\n10.1080/002229300299417\n10.1186/1471-2148-13-55\n10.1371/journal.pone.0037335\n10.1242/jeb.01553\n10.1146/annurev.nutr.19.1.247\n10.1242/jeb.059865\n10.1098/rstb.1987.0030\n10.1002/evan.1019\n10.1111/j.1469-7998.1996.tb05295.x\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btg412\n10.1002/ajpa.10117\n10.1006/jhev.1999.0322\n10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.06.008\n10.1111/j.0269-8463.2004.00856.x\n10.1098/rspb.2011.0968\n10.1002/jmor.10963\n10.1002/ar.22402\n10.1111/j.0021-8782.2004.00318.x\n10.1002/ajpa.20686\n10.1038/359726a0\n10.1159/000109964\n10.1126/science.1105113\n10.1016/j.cub.2013.09.014\n10.1007/s00360-005-0042-y\n10.1098/rspb.2010.2290\n10.1093/icb/ict029\n10.1007/s00223-002-2124-0\n10.1007/s003600050126\n10.1098/rsbl.2009.0773\n10.2307/1380844"}

Hypoxia, characterized by oxygen levels below normal, is a known adverse factor to cancer treatment. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is a central regulator of the pathophysiological response of mammalian cells to low oxygen levels. HIF-1\u03b1 activates the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which in turn promotes angiogenesis through its ability to stimulate the growth, migration and invasion of endothelial cells to form new blood vessels, contributing to tumor progression. In this study, we evaluated the serum concentration and gene expression of VEGF and HIF-1\u03b1 linking them with clinicopathological parameters and survival of dogs with mammary tumors in order to infer the possible prognostic value of these factors. We collected blood and tumor fragments of 24 female dogs with malignant mammary tumors (study group) and 26 non-affected female dogs (control group) to verify the gene expression of VEGF and HIF-1\u03b1 by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and the serum levels by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent). The results showed high serum levels of VEGF in the study group and its correlation between abundant vascularization, lymph node involvement, metastasis, death rate and low survival (p<0.05). The serum percentage of HIF-1\u03b1 in female dogs with mammary neoplasia was lower than that in the control group and higher in female dogs with tumor metastasis and history of tumor recurrence (p<0.05). Regarding gene expression, there was a gene overexpression of VEGFA in female dogs with poor outcome, in contrast to the gene underexpression of HIF-1A. Taken together, these results suggested that VEGF is important in tumor progression and can be used as a potential prognostic marker in the clinic and may be useful in predicting tumor progression in dogs with mammary neoplasia.", "journal": "Oncology reports", "date": "2015-03-18", "authors": ["Marina GobbeMoschetta", "Larissa BazelaMaschio", "Bruna VictorassoJardim-Perassi", "Gabriela BottaroGelaleti", "Juliana RamosLopes", "CamilaLeonel", "Naiane Do NascimentoGon\u00e7alves", "L\u00edvia CarvalhoFerreira", "Gustavo RodriguesMartins", "Thaiz FerrazBorin", "Debora Aparecida Pires De CamposZuccari"], "doi": "10.3892/or.2015.3856"}

Scaffolds must provide a balance of shape, biomechanical function and biocompatibility in order to achieve tissue replacement success. Different tissues can have different requirements for success, which has led to the development of various materials with unique characteristics. Articular cartilage scaffolds have the most robust clinical experience, with many scaffolds, mostly constructed of natural materials, showing promise, but levels of success vary. Tendon scaffolds also have proven clinical applications, with human-dermis-derived scaffolds showing the most potential. Synthetic and naturally derived meniscus scaffolds have been investigated in few clinical studies, but the results are encouraging. Bone scaffolds are limited to amorphous pastes and putties, owing to difficulties achieving adequate vascularization and biomechanical optimization. The complex physiological function and vascular demands of skeletal muscle have limited the widespread clinical use of scaffolds for engineering this tissue.

Therefore, antracycline-based polychemotherapy combined with rituximab has been recommended as first-line treatment. Yet, despite this regimen, the 5-year survival rate remains 50-66% only. Angiogenesis, the formation of a vascular network, is essential for the pathogenesis of nodal lymphomas. So far, no study has analysed angiogenesis and its key factors in PCLBCL/LT. The present study was aimed at characterizing angiogenesis in PCLBCL/LT to identify the angiogenic molecules as potential therapeutic targets. The intra-tumoral microvessel density (MVD) was assessed by immunohistochemical studies of CD20 and CD31. The MVD was higher in PCLBCL/LT compared with indolent PCBCL. Analyses of open-source microarray data showed correlation between the angiogenic molecule angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and pan-endothelial cell markers. ELISA studies determined a shift between Ang-2 and Ang-1 towards Ang-2 in the peripheral blood of PCLBCL/LT patients. Immunofluorescence costainings against the Ang receptor Tie2/angiogenic integrins/CD34 revealed that the vasculature in both aggressive and indolent PCBCL tumors harbours an endothelial cell subpopulation with reduced expression of Tie2. In contrast, the alternative Ang-2 binding partners, angiogenic integrins, are strongly expressed in PCBCL. In line with these findings, downstream targets of Ang-2-integrin signalling, that is phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase at Tyr397, and sprouting angiogenesis are enhanced in PCLBCL/LT.

The nonseminomatous variant of TGCTs is characterized by the presence of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues together with a population of pluripotent cancer stem cells, the so-called embryonal carcinoma. One of the main causes of the resistance of these tumors to therapy is their ability to invade adjacent tissues and metastasize into distant sites of the body. Both of these tumor processes are highly favored by the neovascularization of the malignant tissue. New vessels can be generated by means of angiogenesis or vasculogenesis, and both have been observed to occur during tumor vascularization. Nevertheless, the precise contribution of each process to the neoplastic vascular bed of TGCTs remains unknown. In addition, another process known as tumor-derived vasculogenesis, in which malignant cells give rise to endothelial cells, has also been reported to occur in a number of tumor types, including experimental TGCTs. The participation and cross talk of these 3 processes in tumor vascularization is of particular interest, given the embryonic origin of teratocarcinomas. Thus, in the present review, we discuss the importance of all 3 vascularization processes in the growth, invasion, and metastasis of testicular teratocarcinomas and summarize the current state of knowledge of the TGCT microenvironment and its relationship with vascularization.

Here, we report a rare case of a pituicytoma that was completely removed from a child through a staged operation using the TSA. A 13-year-old girl was admitted with a 1-year history of visual disturbance and amenorrhea. Visual field examination showed left total blindness and right temporal hemianopsia. Laboratory results revealed hormonal levels all within normal ranges. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a homogeneous, highly enhancing sellar and suprasellar mass, typically suggestive of a pituitary adenoma. TSA surgery revealed the tumor had a rubbery-firm consistency, hypervascularity, and profuse bleeding. We removed the tumor partially and planned a second-stage operation.\nGross total removal is the treatment of choice for this type of tumor. Attempted resection of these presumed adenomas or meningiomas using the TSA often results in unexpectedly heavy intraoperative bleeding due to the high vascularity of this rare tumor, making surgery challenging, especially in children where the tumor is within a relatively narrow corridor. While pituicytomas are a rare differential diagnosis for sellar or parasellar tumors in children, total removal by second-stage TSA surgery is indicated in the case of profuse bleeding or uncertainty of biopsy. Following first-stage TSA surgery and pathologic confirmation of pituicytoma, the strategy is typically gross total removal during second-stage TSA surgery.\nAlthough very rare in children, a pituicytoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of a mass in the sellar area if the tumor is highly enhancing or very vascular.

EC network length, connectivity, branching, quantified by means of a 3D morphometric image analysis method, as well as proliferation and metabolic activity were reduced in a dose-dependent fashion by BG and Cu-BG ionic release products. This reduction was less prominent for BG compared to an equivalent concentration of Cu-BG, which was attributed to a lower extent of silicon release and calcium consumption. Moreover, a CuCl2 dose equivalent to the highest concentration of Cu-BG exhibited no effect on ECs.

Firstly, we show that in breast cancer patients the pro-angiogenic activity of TEM increased drastically from blood to tumor, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment shapes the highly pro-angiogenic phenotype of TEM. Secondly, we predicted in silico all minimal perturbations transitioning the highly pro-angiogenic phenotype of tumor TEM to the weak pro-angiogenic phenotype of blood TEM and vice versa. In silico predicted perturbations were validated experimentally using patient TEM. In addition, gene expression profiling of TEM transitioned to a weak pro-angiogenic phenotype confirmed that TEM are plastic cells and can be reverted to immunological potent monocytes. Finally, the relapse-free survival analysis showed a statistically significant difference between patients with tumors with high and low expression values for genes encoding transitioning proteins detected in silico and validated on patient TEM. In conclusion, the inferred TEM regulatory network accurately captured experimental TEM behavior and highlighted crosstalk between specific angiogenic and inflammatory signaling pathways of outstanding importance to control their pro-angiogenic activity. Results showed the successful in vitro reversion of such an activity by perturbation of in silico predicted target genes in tumor derived TEM, and indicated that targeting tumor TEM plasticity may constitute a novel valid therapeutic strategy in breast cancer.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2015-03-15", "authors": ["NicolasGuex", "IsaacCrespo", "SylvianBron", "AssiaIfticene-Treboux", "EvelineFaes-Van't Hull", "SolangeKharoubi", "RobinLiechti", "PatriciaWerffeli", "MarkIbberson", "FrancoisMajo", "Mich\u00e4elNicolas", "JulienLaurent", "AbhishekGarg", "KhalilZaman", "Hans-AntonLehr", "Brian JStevenson", "CurzioR\u00fcegg", "GeorgeCoukos", "Jean-Fran\u00e7oisDelaloye", "IoannisXenarios", "Marie-Agn\u00e8sDoucey"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004050\n10.1049/iet-syb.2010.0039\n10.1007/978-1-60761-987-1_27\n10.1042/BSE0450029\n10.1007/s10441-010-9097-6\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001039\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btn336\n10.1186/1752-0509-3-97\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000438\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000595\n10.1016/j.mib.2010.04.003\n10.1186/1752-0509-5-109\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001099\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4453\n10.1089/cmb.2011.0031\n10.1371/journal.pone.0020074\n10.1186/1752-0509-5-44\n10.1186/1752-0509-3-98\n10.2353/ajpath.2010.090786\n10.1089/scd.2008.0385\n10.1038/nrc2444\n10.1016/j.tcb.2010.06.006\n10.1155/2010/132641\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3181\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3684\n10.1089/cmb.2009.0121\n10.2353/ajpath.2009.080676\n10.103/jid.2011.9\n10.4049/jimmunol.0902360\n10.1186/1479-5876-8-4\n10.1007/s10549-009-0674-9\n10.1038/msb.2011.78\n10.1002/cyto.a.20969\n10.1182/blood-2008-01-134486"}

The injected tumor cells formed masses in which nitric oxide production could be detected by the use of the cell-permeant DAF-FM-DA (diaminofluorophore 4-amino-5-methylamino-2'-7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate) and DAR-4M-AM (diaminorhodamine-4M). This method revealed that nitric oxide production could be co-localized with the tumor xenograft in 46% of the embryos. In 85% of these embryos, tumors were vascularized and blood vessels were observed on day 4 post injection. Furthermore, we demonstrated by qRT-PCR that the transplanted glioma cells highly expressed Nos2, Vegfa and Cyclin D1 mRNA. In the xenografted embryos we also found increased zebrafish vegfa expression. Glioma and zebrafish derived Vegfa and tumor Cyclin D1 expression could be down regulated by the nitric oxide scavenger 2-(4-Carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide or CPTIO.

In this report, we describe the use of the left triangular ligament as an onlay autologous vascularized flap to bridge the anterior residual defect after posterior cruroplasty.\nA novel technique of paraesophageal hiatal hernia repair is described. Posterior hiatoplasty is performed, including the approximation of the diaphragmatic crural fibers to the extent possible.

{"title": "An examination of the variation in maternal placentae across the genus Poeciliopsis (Poeciliidae).", "abstract": "Placentae show considerable diversity in a number of nonmammalian, viviparous organisms, including amphibians, reptilian sauropsids, teleost fish, and chondrichthyes. However, the evolutionary processes driving the evolution of placenta are still debated. In teleost fishes, the genus Poeciliopsis (Poeciliidae) offers a rare opportunity for studying placental evolution: extensive placentation has evolved three independent times within the last 750,000 years and there is substantial interspecific variation in the degree of embryonic, maternal nutrient provisioning and development of the placenta. In poeciliids, the placenta is composed of a hypertrophied maternal follicular epithelium apposed to a highly vascularized embryonic pericardial sac. To better understand placental evolution, we have undertaken a comprehensive comparative study of the maternal follicle in eight closely related Poeciliopsis species that span the range in postfertilization, embryonic, maternal nutrient provisioning (from lecithotrophs, to moderate matrotrophs, to extensive matrotrophs). Using light and scanning electron microscopy, we found that the species that provide extensive postfertilization maternal nutrient provisioning (extensive matrotrophs) have thicker follicles and more extensive folding of the follicular epithelium compared to the lecithotrophs and moderate matrotrophs. Follicle sections and histology revealed that epithelial folds of the extensive matrotrophs are comprised primarily of cuboidal and columnar cells and are richly supplied with capillaries. Among the extensive matrotrophs, enhancements of follicle traits corresponded with increases in the level of maternal nutrient provisioning. Hypertrophied maternal follicles with richly vascularized folds can serve to increase the surface area and, thus, facilitate the transfer of substances between the mother and developing embryo. Finally, we found egg envelopes in the lecithotrophs and moderate matrotrophs, but not in the extensive matrotrophs. Morphological studies, like this one, can provide a better understanding of the natural variation in the structure and functioning of maternal and offspring traits associated with matrotrophy and, thus, insights into the processes driving placental evolution.

Plexin-B2, an axon guidance receptor important for mediating neural progenitor cell migration during development, is upregulated in gliomas, but its function therein remains poorly understood. Combining bioinformatic analyses, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry of patient samples, we demonstrate that Plexin-B2 is consistently upregulated in all types of human gliomas and that its expression levels correlate with glioma grade and poor survival. Activation of Plexin-B2 by Sema4C ligand in glioblastoma cells induced actin-based cytoskeletal dynamics and invasive migration in vitro. This proinvasive effect was associated with activation of the cell motility mediators RhoA and Rac1. Furthermore, costimulation of Plexin-B2 and the receptor tyrosine kinase Met led to synergistic Met phosphorylation. In intracranial glioblastoma transplants, Plexin-B2 knockdown hindered invasive growth and perivascular spreading, and resulted in decreased tumor vascularity.

{"title": "Acceleration of vascularized bone tissue-engineered constructs in a large animal model combining intrinsic and extrinsic vascularization.", "abstract": "During the last decades, a range of excellent and promising strategies in Bone Tissue Engineering have been developed. However, the remaining major problem is the lack of vascularization. In this study, extrinsic and intrinsic vascularization strategies were combined for acceleration of vascularization. For optimal biomechanical stability of the defect site and simplifying future transition into clinical application, a primary stable and approved nanostructured bone substitute in clinically relevant size was used. An arteriovenous (AV) loop was microsurgically created in sheep and implanted, together with the bone substitute, in either perforated titanium chambers (intrinsic/extrinsic) for different time intervals of up to 18 weeks or isolated Teflon(\u00ae) chambers (intrinsic) for 18 weeks. Over time, magnetic resonance imaging and micro-computed tomography (CT) analyses illustrate the dense vascularization arising from the AV loop. The bone substitute was completely interspersed with newly formed tissue after 12 weeks of intrinsic/extrinsic vascularization and after 18 weeks of intrinsic/extrinsic and intrinsic vascularization. Successful matrix change from an inorganic to an organic scaffold could be demonstrated in vascularized areas with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Using the intrinsic vascularization method only, the degradation of the scaffold and osteoclastic activity was significantly lower after 18 weeks, compared with 12 and 18 weeks in the combined intrinsic-extrinsic model. Immunohistochemical staining revealed an increase in bone tissue formation over time, without a difference between intrinsic/extrinsic and intrinsic vascularization after 18 weeks. This study presents the combination of extrinsic and intrinsic vascularization strategies for the generation of an axially vascularized bone substitute in clinically relevant size using a large animal model. The additional extrinsic vascularization promotes tissue ingrowth and remodeling processes of the bone substitute. Extrinsic vessels contribute to faster vascularization and finally anastomose with intrinsic vasculature, allowing microvascular transplantation of the bone substitute after a shorter prevascularization time than using the intrinsic method only. It can be reasonably assumed that the usage of perforated chambers can significantly reduce the time until transplantation of bone constructs.

TMP also reduced the levels of serum lipid dramatically by haematological examination. According to the micro-CT quantification, TMP could improve the microstructure of the trabecular bone and increases bone mineral density in steroid-induced ONFH rats. Moreover, TMP significantly increased the vessel volume, vessel surface, percentage of vessel volume, and vessel thickness of the femoral heads by micro-CT. Interestingly, the downregulation of VEGF and FLK1 proteins in the sera and necrotic femoral heads could be reversed by TMP treatment, and this was true for their mRNA expressions in femoral heads. In conclusion, these findings suggest for the first time that TMP may prevent steroid-induced ONFH and also enhance femoral head vascularization by inhibiting the effect of steroid on VEGF/FLK1 signal pathway.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2015-03-12", "authors": ["YiniJiang", "ChunfangLiu", "WeihengChen", "HuiWang", "ChaoWang", "NaLin"], "doi": "10.1155/2015/315850\n10.3760/cma.j.issn.0366-6999.20120663\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2009.00545.x\n10.1302/0301-620x.83b2.10323\n10.2106/jbjs.f.00773\n10.1007/s12020-011-9580-0\n10.1007/s00776-010-1516-7\n10.1053/sarh.2002.33724b\n10.1007/s11999-008-0696-3\n10.1302/0301-620x.91b3.21846\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.12.004\n10.1111/j.1742-7843.2009.00470.x\n10.1016/j.neulet.2004.09.013\n10.1159/000326082\n10.1016/j.burns.2006.07.002\n10.1016/j.lfs.2009.01.003\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2169\n10.1097/00005344-199001000-00025\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.1996.tb15778.x\n10.1677/joe-08-0552\n10.1007/s00223-010-9385-9\n10.1002/art.1780401119\n10.3727/096368910X522234\n10.1016/j.jbspin.2009.04.002\n10.1016/j.bcp.2006.08.027\n10.1007/s10165-011-0473-0\n10.1186/1471-2474-12-215\n10.1080/10623320600904211\n10.1093/ndt/gfr212\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2007.00120.x\n10.1016/j.orthres.2004.08.013\n10.1016/s8756-3282(96)00133-0\n10.1038/9467"}

For this purpose, 12 animals were inoculated intranasally with non-cytopathic BVDV-1; 12 days later, 10 of them were coinfected intranasally with BHV-1. These animals were euthanized in batches of two at 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 or 14 dpi with BHV-1. Another 10 calves were inoculated solely with BHV-1 and euthanized in batches of two at 1, 2, 4, 7 or 14 dpi with BHV-1; two uninoculated calves were used as negative controls. Thymus samples from these animals were processed for viral detection and histopathological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural studies focused on BVDV/BHV-1 antigens, cortex:medulla ratio, apoptosis (TUNEL and caspase-3), collagen deposition, and factor VIII endothelial detection. Our study revealed the immunohistochemical presence of BVDV antigen in all animals in the BVDV-infected group, unlike BHV-1 detection, which was observed in animals in both infection groups only by molecular techniques. BVDV-preinfected animals showed severe atrophic changes associated with reduced cortex:medulla ratio, higher presence of cortical apoptosis, and increased collagen deposition and vascularization. However, calves solely infected with BHV-1 did not show atrophic changes. These findings could affect not only the numbers of circulating and local mature T cells but also the T cell-mediated immunity, which seems to be impaired during infections with this virus, thus favoring pathogenic effects during secondary infections.", "journal": "Veterinary microbiology", "date": "2015-03-12", "authors": ["FRomero-Palomo", "M ARisalde", "VMolina", "SLauzi", "M JBautista", "J CG\u00f3mez-Villamandos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.02.018"}

Up to 30% of patients with cleft palate also have associated cardiac and vascular defects. VEGFa, a critical growth factor involved in multiple developmental processes including angiogenesis and ossification, is also required for palate development. Conditional deletion of VEGFa in cranial neural crest (CNC) cells using Wnt1-Cre (VEGFaCKO) resulted in cleft palate in mice. The phenotype included reduced proliferation of cells within the palatal shelves, abnormal palatal shelf elongation and elevation, and the inability to undergo fusion. Vascularization of the VEGFaCKO palatal shelves was greatly reduced, suggesting a non-cell autonomous role of VEGFa signaling from the CNC-derived cells to the endothelium during vessel formation. Defective vascular development was coupled with deficient intramembranous ossification of maxillary and palatal mesenchyme. In vitro assessment of CNC-derived palatal mesenchymal cells from VEGFaCKO mice demonstrated normal ossification after BMP2 stimulation, suggesting that inadequate expression of Bmp2 in VEGFaCKO mice was, in part, responsible for reduced ossification. Taken together, these data demonstrate that VEGFa produced in the CNC-derived mesenchyme drives proliferation, vascularization, and ossification, all of which are critical for palate development.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2015-03-12", "authors": ["CynthiaHill", "BritniJacobs", "LucyKennedy", "SarahRohde", "BinZhou", "ScottBaldwin", "StevenGoudy"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-015-2150-7"}

Kidney cotransplantation along with a short course of high-dose immunosuppression enables tolerance of heart allografts across a full major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatch. In this study, we investigated whether tolerance of VCAs across full MHC disparities could be achieved in animals already tolerant of heart and kidney allografts.\nMiniature swine that were tolerant of heart and/or kidney allografts long term underwent transplantation of myocutaneous VCA across the same MHC barrier. Before VCA transplant, group 1 (n = 3) underwent class I-mismatched kidney transplantation; group 2 (n = 3) underwent 2 sequential class I-mismatched kidney transplantations; group 3 (n = 2) underwent haploidentical MHC-mismatched heart/kidney transplantation; and group 4 (n = 2) underwent full MHC-mismatched heart/kidney transplantation.\nAll 3 animals in group 1 and 2 of 3 animals in group 2 showed skin rejection within 85 days; 1 animal in group 2 showed prolonged skin survival longer than 200 days. Animals in groups 3 and 4 showed skin rejection within 30 days and regained in vitro evidence of donor responsiveness.\nThis is the first preclinical study in which hearts, kidneys, and VCAs have been transplanted into the same recipient. Despite VCA rejection, tolerance of heart and kidney allografts was maintained.

{"title": "[Combined treatment of arteriovenous malformations of the head and neck].", "abstract": "An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a vascular developmental abnormality conditioned by impaired embryonic morphogenesis and characterized by the development of an abnormal connection between arteries and veins. More than 50% of the total number of patients suffering from this pathology are those having the pathological foci localizing in the area of the head and neck. At present, a combined method is both a generally accepted and the most radical one used for treatment for AVM. However, in the majority of cases, excision of the malformation leaves an extensive and complicated defect of tissues, whose direct closure leads to coarse cicatricious deformities. Over the period from 2004 to 2012, we followed up a total of 37 patients presenting with arteriovenous malformations of the head and neck. At admission the patients underwent preoperative examination including clinical tests, ultrasound duplex scanning, arteriography, MRT, and computed tomography. 24-72 hours prior to the operative intervention the patients were subjected to embolisation of the main vessels supplying the vascular malformation. Excision of the AVM was in 8 cases followed by primary closure of the postoperative wound, in 17 patients the defect was closed by transposition of the axial flaps, and 12 subjects underwent free transplantation of composite complexes of tissues. Relapse of the disease was revealed in 17 patients. In the majority of cases, relapses developed during the first year after the operative intervention (10 cases). The control of the disease's course was obtained in 20 patients. In 8 of the 12 patients with free transplantation of flaps we managed to obtain long-term control over the disease's course (more than 5 years). Hence, free microsurgical transplantation of compound complexes of tissues may be considered as a method of choice for closing the defect after excising an AVM in the area of the head and neck.

{"title": "RoY peptide-modified chitosan-based hydrogel to improve angiogenesis and cardiac repair under hypoxia.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) still represents the \"Number One Killer\" in the world. The lack of functional vasculature of the infracted myocardium under hypoxia is one of the main problems for cardiac repair. In this study, a thermosensitive chitosan chloride-RoY (CSCl-RoY) hydrogel was developed to improve angiogenesis under hypoxia after MI. First, RoY peptides were conjugated onto the CSCl chain via amide linkages, and our data show that the conjugation of RoY peptide to CSCl does not interfere with the temperature sensitivity. Then, the effect of CSCl-RoY hydrogels on vascularization in vitro under hypoxia was investigated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Results show that CSCl-RoY hydrogels can promote the survival, proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs under hypoxia compared with CSCl hydrogel. Further investigations suggest that CSCl-RoY hydrogels can modulate the expression of membrane surface GRP78 receptor of HUVECs under hypoxia and then activate Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways related to cell survival/proliferation, thereby enhancing angiogenic activity of HUVECs under hypoxia. To assess its therapeutic properties in vivo, a MI model was induced in rats by the left anterior descending artery ligation. CSCl or CSCl-RoY hydrogels were injected into the border of infracted hearts. The results demonstrate that the introduction of RoY peptide can not only improve angiogenesis at MI region but also improve the cardiac functions.

However, skin rejection and side effects of long-term immunosuppression still remain a major hurdle for wide adoption of this excellent reconstructive technique. Histopathologic changes during acute skin rejection in vascular composite allotransplantation often mimic inflammatory skin disorders and are hard to distinguish. Hence, the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic markers specific for skin rejection is of particular clinical need. Here we present novel markers allowing for early differentiation between rejection in hind limb allotransplantation and contact hypersensitivity. Assessment of Ccl7, Il18, and Il1b expression is most indicative of distinguishing skin rejection from skin inflammatory disorders. Gene expression levels varied significantly across skin types and regions, indicating localization specific mechanism of leukocyte migration and infiltration. Expression of Il12b, Il17a, and Il1b gene expression levels differed significantly between rejection and inflammation, independent of the skin type.

{"title": "Elongation Factor 2 Kinase Is Regulated by Proline Hydroxylation and Protects Cells during Hypoxia.", "abstract": "Protein synthesis, especially translation elongation, requires large amounts of energy, which is often generated by oxidative metabolism. Elongation is controlled by phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which inhibits its activity and is catalyzed by eEF2 kinase (eEF2K), a calcium/calmodulin-dependent \u03b1-kinase. Hypoxia causes the activation of eEF2K and induces eEF2 phosphorylation independently of previously known inputs into eEF2K. Here, we show that eEF2K is subject to hydroxylation on proline-98. Proline hydroxylation is catalyzed by proline hydroxylases, oxygen-dependent enzymes which are inactivated during hypoxia. Pharmacological inhibition of proline hydroxylases also stimulates eEF2 phosphorylation. Pro98 lies in a universally conserved linker between the calmodulin-binding and catalytic domains of eEF2K. Its hydroxylation partially impairs the binding of calmodulin to eEF2K and markedly limits the calmodulin-stimulated activity of eEF2K. Neuronal cells depend on oxygen, and eEF2K helps to protect them from hypoxia. eEF2K is the first example of a protein directly involved in a major energy-consuming process to be regulated by proline hydroxylation. Since eEF2K is cytoprotective during hypoxia and other conditions of nutrient insufficiency, it may be a valuable target for therapy of poorly vascularized solid tumors.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2015-03-11", "authors": ["Claire E JMoore", "HalinaMikolajek", "SergioRegufe da Mota", "XueminWang", "Justin WKenney", "J\u00f6rn MWerner", "Christopher GProud"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.01457-14\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb19169.x\n10.1126/scisignal.2002718\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.04.055\n10.1016/S0014-5793(99)01034-0\n10.1021/bi0007270\n10.1016/S0079-6107(03)00060-9\n10.1007/s00018-009-0215-z\n10.1038/nrm3311\n10.1074/jbc.M309773200\n10.1016/S0960-9822(02)01077-1\n10.1016/j.molcel.2008.04.009\n10.3109/10409231003627991\n10.1128/MCB.26.10.3955-3965.2006\n10.1128/MCB.25.21.9554-9575.2005\n10.1074/jbc.M111.299180\n10.1093/emboj/20.16.4360\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203077\n10.1128/MCB.00166-06\n10.1128/MCB.25.19.8732-8747.2005\n10.1128/MCB.24.7.2986-2997.2004\n10.1042/BJ20111536\n10.1128/MCB.00388-14\n10.1002/jcb.21882\n10.1016/j.molcel.2010.09.022\n10.1074/jbc.M113.477182\n10.1042/BJ20020916\n10.1073/pnas.1215450109\n10.1016/j.molcel.2008.03.003\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00929-2\n10.1053/j.gastro.2007.09.033\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1751\n10.1093/hmg/11.13.1497\n10.1101/gad.1256804\n10.1038/onc.2012.465\n10.1073/pnas.0909353106\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4036\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4400851\n10.1124/jpet.113.205989\n10.1038/nature11055\n10.1073/pnas.0602235103\n10.1073/pnas.1311750111\n10.1073/pnas.1314482111\n10.1042/0264-6021:3530621\n10.15252/emmm.201404402"}

{"title": "The vascularized periosteum flap as novel tissue engineering model for repair of cartilage defects.", "abstract": "Periosteum is a promising tissue engineering scaffold in research of cartilage repair; so far however, periosteum transfers have not been realized successfully because of insufficient nourishment of the graft. In a translational approach we, for the first time, designed a vascularized periosteum flap as 'independent' biomaterial with its own blood supply to address this problem and to reconstruct circumscript cartilage defects. In six 3-month-old New Zealand rabbits, a critical size cartilage defect of the medial femur condyle was created and covered by a vascularized periosteum flap pedicled on the saphenous vessels. After 28\u00a0days, formation of newly built cartilage was assessed macroscopically, histologically and qualitatively via biomechanical compression testing, as well as on molecular biological level via immunohistochemistry. All wounds healed completely, all joints were stable and had full range of motion. All flaps survived and were perfused through their pulsating pedicles. They showed a stable attachment to the bone, although partially incomplete adherence. Hyaline cartilage with typical columnar cell distribution and positive Collagen II staining was formed in the transferred flaps. Biomechanical testing revealed a significantly higher maximum load than the positive control, but a low elasticity.

Interest in developing angiogenesis inhibitor drugs as possible treatments for cancer led to the synthesis of analogs of fumagillin. Preclinical studies of various analog drugs confirmed that they inhibited angiogenesis, but they also were associated with weight loss as an adverse effect. Because adipose tissue can grow and regress throughout adulthood, is highly vascularized, and has angiogenic properties, interest in investigating anti-angiogenic agents in animal models of obesity found that fumagillin analogs caused dose-dependent reversible weight reduction and adipose tissue loss. Beloranib, a fumagillin analog that is an angiogenesis inhibitor and associated with decreased adiposity in animals, has been studied in phase I clinical trials for cancer. It is currently being investigated for the treatment of obesity and related conditions. Three phase I and three phase II studies found significant degrees of weight loss and acceptable tolerability for beloranib compared to placebo, justifying further clinical development of the drug for obesity.", "journal": "Journal of psychosocial nursing and mental health services", "date": "2015-03-10", "authors": ["Robert HHowland"], "doi": "10.3928/02793695-20150219-01"}

S. in 2007. In this article, we present a reconstruction of a traumatic plantar foot defect with a medial triceps brachii (MTB) free flap.\nA 53-year-old man sustained an accidental gunshot wound to the right foot. The patient was admitted after the failure of a sural flap procedure performed in another hospital. He presented with a soft-tissue defect with calcaneal exposition and osteomyelitis. The defect was reconstructed with a MTB free flap anastomosed to his dorsalis pedis vessels.\nFlap raising time was 52 min. There were no intraoperative complications. The total flap surface was 38.5 cm\u00b2. The pedicle length was 3 cm. The diameters of the artery and vein of the flap pedicle were 1.1 mm and 1.4 mm, respectively. Ischemia time was 28 min. His donor site healed uneventfully without any morbidity, and the scar was well concealed. The flaps survived and there was no partial flap necrosis. A split-thickness skin graft was performed 12 days postoperatively. Two months later, he had a completely healed wound with no contour abnormality. The total follow-up was 24 months. The patient was able to walk normally.\nMTB free flap appears to be an excellent option for plantar foot defects in patients with preserved vascularization of the foot. Due to the anatomical shape of the flap, the position of its pedicle, and the moldability of the muscle, we predict that the use of the MTB free flap will grow and develop rapidly for reconstruction of ankle and foot defects.", "journal": "Journal of cosmetic and laser therapy : official publication of the European Society for Laser Dermatology", "date": "2015-03-10", "authors": ["Franck MarieLecl\u00e8re", "VincentCasoli"], "doi": "10.3109/14764172.2015.1022188"}

{"title": "Enzymatic regulation of functional vascular networks using gelatin hydrogels.", "abstract": "To manufacture tissue engineering-based functional tissues, scaffold materials that can be sufficiently vascularized to mimic the functionality and complexity of native tissues are needed. Currently, vascular network bioengineering is largely carried out using natural hydrogels as embedding scaffolds, but most natural hydrogels have poor mechanical stability and durability, factors that critically limit their widespread use. In this study, we examined the suitability of gelatin-phenolic hydroxyl (gelatin-Ph) hydrogels that can be enzymatically crosslinked, allowing tuning of the storage modulus and the proteolytic degradation rate, for use as injectable hydrogels to support the human progenitor cell-based formation of a stable and mature vascular network. Porcine gelatin-Ph hydrogels were found to be cytocompatible with human blood-derived endothelial colony-forming cells and white adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells, resulting in >87% viability, and cell proliferation and spreading could be modulated by using hydrogels with different proteolytic degradability and stiffness. In addition, gelatin was extracted from mouse dermis and murine gelatin-Ph hydrogels were prepared. Importantly, implantation of human cell-laden porcine or murine gelatin-Ph hydrogels into immunodeficient mice resulted in the rapid formation of functional anastomoses between the bioengineered human vascular network and the mouse vasculature. Furthermore, the degree of enzymatic crosslinking of the gelatin-Ph hydrogels could be used to modulate cell behavior and the extent of vascular network formation in vivo. Our report details a technique for the synthesis of gelatin-Ph hydrogels from allogeneic or xenogeneic dermal skin and suggests that these hydrogels can be used for biomedical applications that require the formation of microvascular networks, including the development of complex engineered tissues.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-03-10", "authors": ["Chia-HuiChuang", "Ruei-ZengLin", "Han-WenTien", "Ya-ChunChu", "Yen-ChengLi", "Juan MMelero-Martin", "Ying-ChiehChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.02.024"}

{"title": "Thyroid ultrasound features and risk of carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.", "abstract": "Thyroid nodules are a common finding in the general population, and their detection is increasing with the widespread use of ultrasound (US). Thyroid cancer is found in 5-15% of cases depending on sex, age, and exposure to other risk factors. Some US parameters have been associated with increased risk of malignancy. However, no characteristic seems sufficiently reliable in isolation to diagnose malignancy. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of US features for thyroid malignancy in patients with unselected thyroid nodules and nodules with indeterminate fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology.\nElectronic databases were reviewed for studies published prior to July 2012 that evaluated US features of thyroid nodules and reported postoperative histopathologic diagnosis. A manual search of references of review and key articles, and previous meta-analyses was also performed. A separate meta-analysis was performed including only nodules with indeterminate cytology. Analyzed features were solid structure, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, absence of halo, microcalcifications, central vascularization, solitary nodule, heterogeneity, taller than wide shape, and absence of elasticity.\nFifty-two observational studies (12,786 nodules) were included. Nine studies included nodules with indeterminate cytology as a separate category, comprising 1851 nodules. In unselected nodules, all US features were significantly associated with malignancy with an odds ratio varying from 1.78 to 35.7, and microcalcifications, irregular margins, and a taller than wide shape had high specificities (Sp; 87.8%, 83.1%, 96.6%) and positive likelihood ratios (LHR; 3.26, 2.99, 8.07). Absence of elasticity was the single feature with the best diagnostic performance (sensitivity 87.9%, Sp 86.2%, and positive LHR 6.39). The presence of central vascularization was the most specific US feature in nodules with indeterminate cytology (Sp 96% and positive LHR 2.13).\nUS features in isolation do not provide reliable information to select nodules that should have a FNA performed. A combination of US characteristics with higher likelihood ratios and consequently with higher post-test probabilities of malignancy-microcalcifications, or a taller than wide shape, or irregular margins, or absence of elasticity-will probably identify nodules with an increased risk for malignancy.

In addition to its extracellular function, recent studies suggest an intracellular activity of HPSE with a largely unknown significance during tumor progression. Therefore, we investigated the relevance of the dual functions of HPSE to malignant melanoma in vitro, as well as in different mouse melanoma models based on the intradermal or intravenous injection of melanoma cells. Consistent with its extracellular action, an HPSE deficiency led to a reduced shedding of the glycocalyx accompanied by a reduced availability of vascular endothelial growth factor, affecting tumor growth and vascularization. In contrast, we measured an elevated expression of the protumorigenic factors pentraxin-3, tissue factor, TNF-\u03b1 and most prominently, MMP-9, upon HPSE knockdown. In vivo, an HPSE deficiency was related to increased lymph node metastasis. Since the inhibition of its extracellular function with heparin was unable to block the gene regulatory impact of HPSE, we proposed an intracellular mechanism. Immunostaining revealed a counter-staining of HPSE and NF-\u03baB in the nucleus, suggesting a close relationship between both proteins. This finding was further supported by the discovery of a direct charge-driven molecular interaction between HPSE and DNA by using atomic force microscopy and a co-precipitation approach. Our findings are novel and point towards a dual function for HPSE in malignant melanoma with a protumorigenic extracellular activity and a tumor-suppressive nuclear action.

Therefore, well characterized vascular models with human relevance are needed for basic research, embryotoxicity testing, development of therapeutic strategies and for tissue engineering. We have previously shown that the in vitro vascular model based on co-culture of human adipose stromal cells (hASC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is able to induce an extensive vascular-like network with high reproducibility. In this work we developed a defined serum-free vascular stimulation medium (VSM) and performed further characterization in terms of cell identity, maturation and structure to obtain a thoroughly characterized in vitro vascular model to replace or reduce corresponding animal experiments. The results showed that the novel vascular stimulation medium induced intact and evenly distributed vascular-like network with morphology of mature vessels.

Cells were cultured on 10\u03bcm micropost-textured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates in either proliferative basal medium (BM) or osteogenic medium (OM). In vitro data revealed that cells on microtextured substrates in OM had dense coverage of extracellular matrix, whereas cells in BM displayed more cell spreading and branching. Cells on microtextured substrates in OM demonstrated a higher gene expression of osteoblast-specific markers, namely collagen I, alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin, accompanied by substantial amount of bone matrix formation and mineralization. To further investigate the osteogenic capacity, hMSCs on microtextured substrates under different biochemical stimuli were implanted into subcutaneous pockets on the dorsal aspect of immunocompromised mice to study capacity for ectopic bone formation. In vivo data revealed greater expression of osteoblast-specific markers coupled with increased vascular invasion on microtextured substrates with hMSCs cultured in OM. Together, these data represent a novel regenerative strategy that incorporates defined surface microtextures and biochemical stimuli to direct combined osteogenesis and re-vascularization of engineered bone scaffolds for musculoskeletal repair and relevant bone tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-03-05", "authors": ["ShangSong", "Eun JungKim", "Chelsea SBahney", "TheodoreMiclau", "RalphMarcucio", "ShuvoRoy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.02.021"}
{"title": "Disruption of STAT3 signalling promotes KRAS-induced lung tumorigenesis.", "abstract": "STAT3 is considered to play an oncogenic role in several malignancies including lung cancer; consequently, targeting STAT3 is currently proposed as therapeutic intervention. Here we demonstrate that STAT3 plays an unexpected tumour-suppressive role in KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma (AC). Indeed, lung tissue-specific inactivation of Stat3 in mice results in increased Kras(G12D)-driven AC initiation and malignant progression leading to markedly reduced survival. Knockdown of STAT3 in xenografted human AC cells increases tumour growth. Clinically, low STAT3 expression levels correlate with poor survival and advanced malignancy in human lung AC patients with smoking history, which are prone to KRAS mutations. Consistently, KRAS mutant lung tumours exhibit reduced STAT3 levels. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that STAT3 controls NF-\u03baB-induced IL-8 expression by sequestering NF-\u03baB within the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting IL-8-mediated myeloid tumour infiltration and tumour vascularization and hence tumour progression. These results elucidate a novel STAT3-NF-\u03baB-IL-8 axis in KRAS mutant AC with therapeutic and prognostic relevance.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2015-03-04", "authors": ["BeatriceGrabner", "DanielSchramek", "Kristina MMueller", "Herwig PMoll", "JasminSvinka", "ThomasHoffmann", "EvaBauer", "LeanderBlaas", "NataschaHruschka", "KatalinZboray", "PatriciaStiedl", "HariniNivarthi", "EdithBogner", "WolfgangGruber", "ThomasMohr", "Ralf HarunZwick", "LukasKenner", "ValeriaPoli", "FritzAberger", "DagmarStoiber", "GerdaEgger", "HaraldEsterbauer", "JohannesZuber", "RichardMoriggl", "RobertEferl", "Bal\u00e1zsGy\u0151rffy", "Josef MPenninger", "HelmutPopper", "EmilioCasanova"], "doi": "10.1038/ncomms7285"}
{"title": "Metabolic rewiring of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: New routes to follow within the maze.", "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a debilitating and almost universally fatal malignancy. Despite advances in understanding of the oncogenetics of the disease, very few clinical benefits have been shown. One of the main characteristics of PDAC is the tumor architecture where tumor cells are surrounded by a firm desmoplasia. By reducing vascularization, thus both oxygen and nutrients delivery to the tumor, this stroma causes the appearance of hypoxic zones driving metabolic adaptation in surviving tumor cells in order to cope with challenging conditions. This metabolic reprogramming promoted by environmental constraints enhances PDAC aggressiveness. In this review, we provide a brief overview of previous works regarding the importance of glucose and glutamine addiction of PDAC cells. In particular we aim to highlight the need for exploring the impact of metabolites other than glucose and glutamine, such as non-essential amino acids and oncometabolites, to find new treatments. We also discuss the need for progress in methodology for metabolites detection. The overall purpose of our review is to emphasize the need to look beyond what is currently known, with a focus on amino acid availability, in order to improve our understanding of PDAC biology.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2015-03-04", "authors": ["OrianneOlivares", "SophieVasseur"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.29501"}

Osteopontin (OPN) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are characterized by a convergence in function for regulating cell motility and angiogenesis, the response to hypoxia, and apoptosis. Often, they are co-expressed or one molecule induces the other, however, in some settings OPN-associated pathways and VEGF-associated pathways are distinct. Their relationships affect the pathogenesis in cancer, where they contribute to progression and angiogenesis and serve as markers for poor prognosis. The inhibition of OPN may reduce VEGF levels and suppress tumor progression. In vascular pathologies, these two cytokines mediate remodeling, but may also perpetuate inflammation and narrowing of the arteries.

Levels of Hsp90 decreased in the thymus when animals were exposed to the highest power level (12 W), but only one group did not show recovery after 24 h.

{"title": "Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell administration does not improve corneal graft survival outcome.", "abstract": "The effect of local and systemic injections of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (AD-MSC) into rabbit models of corneal allograft rejection with either normal-risk or high-risk vascularized corneal beds was investigated. The models we present in this study are more similar to human corneal transplants than previously reported murine models. Our aim was to prevent transplant rejection and increase the length of graft survival. In the normal-risk transplant model, in contrast to our expectations, the injection of AD-MSC into the graft junction during surgery resulted in the induction of increased signs of inflammation such as corneal edema with increased thickness, and a higher level of infiltration of leukocytes. This process led to a lower survival of the graft compared with the sham-treated corneal transplants. In the high-risk transplant model, in which immune ocular privilege was undermined by the induction of neovascularization prior to graft surgery, we found the use of systemic rabbit AD-MSCs prior to surgery, during surgery, and at various time points after surgery resulted in a shorter survival of the graft compared with the non-treated corneal grafts. Based on our results, local or systemic treatment with AD-MSCs to prevent corneal rejection in rabbit corneal models at normal or high risk of rejection does not increase survival but rather can increase inflammation and neovascularization and break the innate ocular immune privilege. This result can be partially explained by the immunomarkers, lack of immunosuppressive ability and immunophenotypical secretion molecules characterization of AD-MSC used in this study.

Despite these features, PDAC shows no reduction in the uptake of glucose that fuels tumour cell survival.

Since basal microvilli are not present on normal pancreatic blood vessels, their presence may add diagnostic value and blocking their function is a potential new treatment strategy for PDAC.

A multi-scale mathematical method which simulates drug transport to a solid tumor is used in this study to investigate how capillary network structure affects drug delivery.

The effect of heterogeneous dynamic network on interstitial fluid flow and drug delivery is investigated by this multi-scale method. The sprouting angiogenesis model is used for generating capillary network and then fluid flow governing equations are implemented to calculate blood flow through the tumor-induced capillary network and fluid flow in normal and tumor tissues. Finally, convection-diffusion equation is used to simulate drug delivery. Three approaches are used to simulate drug transport based on the developed mathematical method: without a vascular network, using a static vascular network, and a dynamic vascular network.

However, the courses of the ILA and HLA are described in diverse ways, and there is no obvious standard for distinguishing between them. The aim of this study was to elucidate the distribution patterns of the ILA and HLA, and the significance of the HLA in the vascularization of the lower lip.\nSixty-three hemifaces from 18 Korean and 19 Thai cadavers were used in this study. The distribution patterns of the arteries of the lower lip area were classified based on the assumption that the HLA travels in the middle of the lower lip area, while the ILA runs along the lower lip border. The arterial distribution pattern of the HLA was classified into three types (I-III): type I, where the HLA ran horizontally in the lower lip area; type II, where the HLA curved upward to the vermilion border of the lower lip; and type III, where the HLA bifurcated into two branches. The ILA was also classified into three types (A-C): type A, where the ILA was not observed; type B, ILA was ramified from facial artery at the level of mouth corner; and type C, ILA arose from the superior labial artery (SLA) and supplied the lower lip vermillion border.\nTypes I, II, and III were observed in 52.4 % (33/63), 39.7 % (25/63), and 7.9 % (5/63) of cases, respectively; and types A, B, and C were observed in 52.4 % (33/63), 36.5 % (23/63), and 11.1 % (7/63) of cases.

{"title": "Increasing mitochondrial muscle fatty acid oxidation induces skeletal muscle remodeling toward an oxidative phenotype.", "abstract": "Adult skeletal muscle is a dynamic, remarkably plastic tissue, which allows myofibers to switch from fast/glycolytic to slow/oxidative types and to increase mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (mFAO) capacity and vascularization in response to exercise training. mFAO is the main muscle energy source during endurance exercise, with carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) being the key regulatory enzyme. Whether increasing muscle mFAO affects skeletal muscle physiology in adulthood actually remains unknown. To investigate this, we used in vivo electrotransfer technology to express in mouse tibialis anterior (TA), a fast/glycolytic muscle, a mutated CPT1 form (CPT1mt) that is active but insensitive to malonyl-CoA, its physiologic inhibitor. In young (2-mo-old) adult mice, muscle CPT1mt expression enhanced mFAO (+40%), but also increased the percentage of oxidative fibers (+28%), glycogen content, and capillary-to-fiber density (+45%). This CPT1mt-induced muscle remodeling, which mimicked exercise-induced oxidative phenotype, led to a greater resistance to muscle fatigue. In the context of aging, characterized by sarcopenia and reduced oxidative capacity, CPT1mt expression in TAs from aged (20-mo-old) mice partially reversed aging-associated sarcopenia and fiber-type transition, and increased muscle capillarity. These findings provide evidence that mFAO regulates muscle phenotype and may be a potential target to combat age-related decline in muscle function.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2015-02-26", "authors": ["CaroleH\u00e9nique", "AbdelhakMansouri", "EliskaVavrova", "V\u00e9roniqueLenoir", "ArnaudFerry", "CatherineEsnous", "ElodieRamond", "JeanGirard", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricBouillaud", "CarinaPrip-Buus", "IsabelleCohen"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.14-257717"}

Electrospun PEI scaffolds have shown advantageous properties, such as enhanced endothelial cell adherence, proliferation and low platelet adhesion in in vitro experiments. In this study, the in vivo behaviour of electrospun PEI scaffolds and PEI films was examined in a murine subcutaneous implantation model. Electrospun PEI scaffolds and films were surgically implanted subcutaneously in the dorsae of mice. The surrounding subcutaneous tissue response was examined via histopathological examination at 7 and 28\u2009days after implantation. No serious adverse events were observed for both types of PEI implants. The presence of macrophages or foreign body giant cells in the vicinity of the implants and the formation of a fibrous capsule indicated a normal foreign body reaction towards PEI films and scaffolds. Capsule thickness and inflammatory infiltration cells significantly decreased for PEI scaffolds during days 7-28 while remaining unchanged for PEI films. The infiltration of cells into the implant was observed for PEI scaffolds 7\u2009days after implantation and remained stable until 28\u2009days of implantation. Additionally some, but not all, PEI scaffold implants induced the formation of functional blood vessels in the vicinity of the implants. Conclusively, this study demonstrates the in vivo biocompatibility of PEI implants, with favourable properties of electrospun PEI scaffolds regarding tissue integration and wound healing.

{"title": "Multifractal dimension and lacunarity of yolk sac vasculature after exposure to magnetic field.", "abstract": "Several studies have reported about the effects of magnetic fields (MFs) on vascular tissue. Extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) can promote either inhibition or stimulation of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, depending upon the intensity and time of exposure to the MF. To investigate the possible effects of ELF-MF on vascular processes, it is necessary to employ methods that allow parameterization of the vascular network. Vascular network is a structure with fractal geometry; therefore, fractal methods have been used to evaluate its morphometric complexity. Here, we used the lacunarity parameter (complementary method of fractal analysis) and multifractal analyses to investigate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in the embryonic yolk sac membrane (YSM) of Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) with and without exposure to an external MF of 1 mT and 60 Hz. Lacunarity results showed that the vascular density was lower for the group exposed to the magnetic field for 9 h/day. In addition, multifractal analysis showed reduced vascularization in the experimental groups (6 h/day and 9 h/day of exposure to MF). Furthermore, multifractal analysis showed difference between the groups exposed for 12 and 24 h/day. Using multifractal methods (generalized dimensions and singularity spectrum), it was possible to characterize the vascular network of the quail embryo YSM as a multifractal object, therefore proving this method to be a more appropriate application than the traditional monofractal methods.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2015-02-26", "authors": ["Edbhergue Ventura LolaCosta", "Romildo de AlbuquerqueNogueira"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2015.02.002"}

Methods\u2003A survey with hypothetical Kienb\u00f6ck disease cases stratified by the Lichtman staging system was distributed to the American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) members. Questions and responses reflected common treatment strategies. Results\u2003Of a total of 375 worldwide respondents, preferred treatments of Kienb\u00f6ck disease were as follows: for Stage I disease, an initial trial of splinting was favored (74%), followed by radial shortening osteotomy for continued symptoms. For Stage II disease, 63% of surgeons preferred surgical intervention, particularly radial shortening osteotomy. For Stage IIIa with negative ulnar variance, 69% chose radial shortening osteotomy.

Using this process, we fabricated an electrospun scaffold with a large pore (pore size >40 \u03bcm) while simultaneously controlling the thickness. We demonstrate that the large pore size triggered rapid infiltration (160 \u03bcm in 4 hours of cell culture) of individual endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and rapid cell colonization after seeding EPC spheroids.

Recent evidence has shown that EPCs also exist in the adipose tissue. As adipose tissue is plentiful in the human body and can be easily harvested through a minimally invasive method, the aim of this study was to culture and characterize EPCs from adipose tissue (ADEPCs) and investigate their potential for the neovascularization of tissue-engineered bladder. Adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was isolated and used for the culture of ADEPCs and adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs). After SVF was cultured for one week, ADEPCs with typical cobblestone morphology emerged and could be isolated from ADSCs according to their different responses to trypsinization. Rat bladder smooth muscle cells (RBSMCs) were isolated and cultured from rat bladder. RBSMCs exhibited typical spindle-shaped morphology. ADEPCs had higher proliferative potential than ADSCs and RBSMCs. ADEPCs stained positive for CD34, Stro-1, VEGFR-2, eNOS and CD31 but negative for \u03b1-SMA, CD14 and CD45. ADSCs stained positive for CD34, Stro-1 and \u03b1-SMA but negative for VEGFR-2, eNOS, CD31, CD14 and CD45. RBSMCs stained only positive for \u03b1-SMA. ADEPCs could be expanded from a single cell at an early passage to a cell cluster containing more than 10,000 cells. ADEPCs were able to uptake DiI-Ac-LDL, bind UEA-1 and form capillary-like structures in three-dimensional scaffolds (Matrigel and bladder acellular matrix). ADEPCs were also able to enhance the human umbilical vein endothelial cells' capability of capillary-like tube formation on Matrigel.

A critical component of healthy placental function is the proper development of its vascular network. Poor vascularization of the placenta can lead to fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, and in some cases fetal death. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which uterine stressors influence the development of the placental vasculature and contribute to placental dysfunction is of central importance to ensuring a healthy pregnancy. In this review we discuss how oxidative stress observed in maternal smoking, maternal obesity, and preeclampsia has been associated with aberrant angiogenesis and placental dysfunction resulting in adverse pregnancy outcomes. We also highlight that oxidative stress can influence the expression of a number of transcription factors important in mediating angiogenesis. Therefore, understanding how oxidative stress affects redox-sensitive transcription factors within the placenta may elucidate potential therapeutic targets for correcting abnormal placental angiogenesis and function.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2015-02-24", "authors": ["Robyn DPereira", "Nicole EDe Long", "Ruijun CWang", "Fereshteh TYazdi", "Alison CHolloway", "SandeepRaha"], "doi": "10.1155/2015/814543\n10.1152/physrev.00040.2011\n10.1016/j.placenta.2014.01.003\n10.1016/j.ajog.2007.06.025\n10.1016/S0140-6736(99)01676-1\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002766\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033370\n10.1177/1933719113508815\n10.1053/plac.2002.0802\n10.1016/j.placenta.2004.11.010\n10.1111/j.1471-0528.1991.tb13450.x\n10.1186/1746-1596-5-24\n10.1080/09513590701350291\n10.1385/ENDO:19:1:103\n10.1101/cshperspect.a006585\n10.1136/jclinpath-2011-200092\n10.1097/GRF.0b013e3181eb68fe\n10.1016/S0049-3848(13)70013-6\n10.1111/j.1471-0528.2005.00437.x\n10.1016/S0940-9602(99)80060-0\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.060265\n10.1016/S0301-2115(03)00168-4\n10.1146/annurev.bi.64.070195.000525\n10.1016/S0968-0004(00)01674-1\n10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2010.10.016\n10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.00978.x\n10.1016/S0143-4004(98)90018-2\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64849-3\n10.1007/s00418-004-0677-x\n10.1016/S0143-4004(02)90865-9\n10.1046/j.1365-2265.2002.01638.x\n10.1007/BF02912897\n10.1177/1933719109359704\n10.1053/siny.2000.0025\n10.1093/aje/kwm014\n10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00089-0\n10.1111/j.1471-0528.2009.02266.x\n10.1152/ajpregu.00204.2013\n10.1111/j.1471-0528.1989.tb03344.x\n10.1016/S0143-4004(83)80002-2\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2006.01.005\n10.1152/ajpendo.00478.2013\n10.1016/j.placenta.2011.06.022\n10.1152/ajpregu.00505.2006\n10.1016/j.ajog.2011.06.023\n10.1007/s00431-010-1338-9\n10.1016/j.siny.2009.09.003\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62233-7\n10.3109/14767058.2012.705395\n10.1053/plac.1999.0545\n10.1016/S0303-7207(01)00703-1\n10.1530/REP-08-0516\n10.1210/en.2010-1332\n10.1152/ajpregu.00498.2009\n10.1017/S2040174410000681\n10.1016/j.ajog.2014.03.020\n10.1530/REP-09-0092\n10.4172/2165-7904.1000143\n10.1016/j.placenta.2014.03.010\n10.1016/j.placenta.2009.12.021\n10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17987-2\n10.1042/CS20110097\n10.1016/j.semnephrol.2010.10.004\n10.1016/S0070-2153(05)71009-7\n10.1016/j.placenta.2008.11.003\n10.1152/ajpendo.00426.2013\n10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00338-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0064351\n10.1093/humupd/dmn010\n10.1096/fj.05-4401fje\n10.1006/bbrc.2001.5927\n10.1016/S0024-3205(98)00560-8\n10.1002/jcp.1112\n10.1016/j.immuni.2012.04.006\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000130643.41587.DB\n10.1074/jbc.M211298200\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.02.019\n10.1159/000087855\n10.1186/1476-4598-2-29\n10.1165/rcmb.2007-0310OC\n10.1007/s00125-003-1221-6\n10.1371/journal.pone.0052474\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4729\n10.3748/wjg.v19.i27.4309\n10.1038/onc.2010.563\n10.1177/1933719113488448\n10.1074/jbc.273.8.4516\n10.1210/en.2010-0131\n10.1093/cvr/cvp131\n10.1152/ajpheart.01277.2005\n10.1038/onc.2011.563\n10.1038/onc.2010.644\n10.1007/s10555-011-9281-4\n10.3109/10641955.2011.642436\n10.5001/omj.2013.48\n10.1074/jbc.M611527200\n10.1016/j.placenta.2010.02.002\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.02.074\n10.1007/s13105-011-0074-6\n10.1371/journal.pone.0008225\n10.1371/journal.pone.0047055\n10.1093/humupd/dml016\n10.1089/ars.2013.5219\n10.3892/or.2013.2278\n10.1074/jbc.M111.286880\n10.1139/o04-045\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2004.04.003\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.04.111\n10.1002/jcp.21104\n10.1210/en.2013-1350\n10.1002/ijc.20871\n10.1074/jbc.M211999200\n10.1152/ajpcell.00177.2010\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.06.015\n10.1093/cvr/cvu034\n10.1111/jpi.12070\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.11.015\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.01.026\n10.1093/toxsci/kfq028\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.11.147\n10.1002/jcp.22270\n10.1095/biolreprod.113.116186\n10.1016/j.placenta.2007.12.010\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2011.04063.x\n10.1089/ars.2012.4637"}
{"title": "Pancreatic cancer growth using magnetic resonance and bioluminescence imaging.", "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal human cancer and appropriate experimental tumor models are needed for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches. This paper describes an experimental model of human pancreatic cancer and a related non invasive imaging technique suitable for monitoring tumor growth and metastatization. The aim of the work was the implementation of an experimental platform suitable for assessing the efficacy of new therapeutic agents.\nHuman pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1-Luc+) were injected into the pancreas of female athymic CD1 mice. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at 4.7T and Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI) were performed in each mouse at three time points after cell inoculation (1, 2 and 3months). Two groups of mice were studied: the first group of n=13 mice in which 5*10(6) cells were injected and the second group of n=10 mice in which 2*10(6) cells were injected. MRI examination included T2w acquisitions and (at the last time point) Dynamic-contrast-enhanced-MRI (DCE-MRI).\nEach mouse underwent three longitudinal MRI and BLI examinations. BLI was more sensitive than MRI producing higher detection rate at early time points. Moreover in one case of abdominal dissemination of pancreatic tumor cells, small tumoral masses were detected by BLI and not detected by MRI. However BLI appears more prone to experimental error most likely due to photon attenuation. In 4 mice BLI produced false negative results. DCE-MRI experiments providing information on tumor perfusion were conducted successfully in this anatomical district and demonstrated that the tumor tissues from the second experimental group are more vascularized compared to the first group.\nThe present study performed on the experimental model of pancreatic cancer here described shows that MRI and BLI are complementary techniques and that synergistic application of both can overcome the intrinsic limitations of each.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "date": "2015-02-24", "authors": ["RossanaRitelli", "RaphaelNgalani Ngaleu", "PietroBontempi", "MarioDandrea", "ElenaNicolato", "FedericoBoschi", "SilviaFiorini", "LauraCalderan", "AldoScarpa", "PasquinaMarzola"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mri.2015.02.017"}

The reconstruction of both the nasolabial and perinasal regions may be especially complex and challenging for the surgeon. Traditionally, these defects have been reconstructed with local random flaps based on the vascularization provided by the superficial musculoaponeurotic system. In this article, we present our experience in the reconstruction of the aforementioned defects using the propeller facial artery perforator (FAP) flap.\nA propeller FAP flap was performed for reconstruction in 12 patients with nasolabial or perinasal complex defects after tumoral resection between the years 2011 and 2013. The flap was designed parallel to the nasolabial fold in all cases for achieving direct closure and an aesthetically pleasing outcome. In one of the cases, a paramedian forehead flap was performed simultaneously.\nNine patients healed uneventfully, with good functional and esthetic outcomes. One of the flaps developed partial necrosis of the distal end, and another developed temporary postoperative venous congestion, lymphedema, and, finally, trapdoor deformity. The latter complication also occurred in one more flap.\nThe propeller FAP flap is reliable and versatile, with few complications, and it is especially useful when reconstructing complex defects that involve the nasolabial and perinasal regions; therefore, it should be considered as one of the first reconstructive options for the described defects.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2015-02-24", "authors": ["ARuiz-Moya", "ALagares-Borrego", "PInfante-Coss\u00edo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2014.12.003"}

The transverse diameter, thickness, and quantitative parameters of the UM (ie, area under the curve in the wash-in phase, wash-in perfusion index, peak enhancement, and wash-in rate) were calculated by using dedicated software and compared by using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test.\nThe mean tumor thickness on US was significantly less at both 6 (6.6 mm) and 12 months after GKR (5.8 mm) than it was at baseline (8.3 mm; p\u2009<\u20090.05, both comparisons). Compared with baseline data, the median flow quantitative parameters on CEUS were significantly changed as follows: the peak enhancement (in arbitrary units [au]) at baseline was 5 \u00d7 10(6) ; 6 months after GKR, it was 2 \u00d7 10(1) (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and 12 months after GKR, it was 4 \u00d7 10(1) (p < 0.05). The wash-in rate (in au) at baseline was 1 \u00d7 10(6) ; 6 months after GKR, it was 2.1 (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and 12 months after GKR, it was 9.3 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The wash-in perfusion index (in au) at baseline was 2 \u00d7 10(7) ; 6 months after GKR, it was 7 \u00d7 10(1) (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and 12 months after GKR, it was 1 \u00d7 10(2) (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The area under the curve during the wash-in phase (in au) at baseline was 1 \u00d7 10(8) ; 12 months after GKR, it was reduced to 6 \u00d7 10(2) (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nAt 6 months after GKR, a reduction of tumor thickness, as detected on US, occurred in 6 of the 10 patients, whereas a reduction in all the quantitative parameters measured on CEUS occurred in all 10 patients.

Titanium dental implants enhanced with porous tantalum-based trabecular metal material (PTTM) are designed for osseoincorporation, a combination of vascularized bone ingrowth and osseointegration (bone on-growth). Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) contains growth factors with good handling characteristics. However, the combination of these 2 materials in facial alveolar bone regeneration associated with immediate implant therapy has not been reported. A 65-year-old Asian woman presented with a failing central incisor. Most of the buccal alveolar bone plate of the socket was missing. A PTTM enhanced implant was immediately placed with DBM. Cone beam computed tomography scans 12 months after the insertion of the definitive restoration showed regeneration of buccal alveolar bone. A combination of a PTTM enhanced implant, DBM, and a custom healing abutment may have an advantage in retaining biologically active molecules and form a scaffold for neovascularization and osteogenesis.

{"title": "Which Routes for Petroclival Tumors? A Comparison Between the Anterior Expanded Endoscopic Endonasal Approach and Lateral or Posterior Routes.", "abstract": "Petroclival tumors remain a surgical challenge. Classically, the retrosigmoid approach (RSA) has long been used to reach such tumors, whereas the anterior petrosectomy (AP) has been proposed to avoid crossing cranial nerves. More recently, the endoscopic endonasal approach has been \"expanded\" (i.e., EEEA) to the petroclival region. We aimed to compare these 3 approaches to help in the surgical management of petroclival tumors.\nPetroclival approaches were performed on 5 specimens after they were prepared with formaldehyde colored via latex injection.\nThe EEEA provides a simple straightforward route to the clivus, but reaching the petrous apex requires the surgeon to circumvent the internal carotid artery either via a medial transclival, an inferior transpterygoid, or a lateral variant through the Meckel's cave. In contrast, the AP offers a narrow direct superolateral access to the petroclival region crossed by the trigeminal nerve. Finally, the RSA provides a wide simple and quick exposure of the cerebellopontine angle, but access to the petroclival region needs the surgeon to deal with the V(th) to XI(th) cranial nerves.\nThe EEEA should be preferred for extradural midline tumors (chordomas, chondrosarcomas) or for cystic lesions when drainage is essential. The AP could be optimal for the radical removal of intradural vascularized tumors (meningiomas) with intrapetrous or supratentorial extensions. The RSA retains an advantage for small or cystic tumors near the internal acoustic meatus.

{"title": "Role of miR-155 in the pathogenesis of herpetic stromal keratitis.", "abstract": "Ocular infection with herpes simplex virus 1 can result in a chronic immunoinflammatory stromal keratitis (SK) lesion that is a significant cause of human blindness. A key to controlling SK lesion severity is to identify cellular and molecular events responsible for tissue damage and to manipulate them therapeutically. Potential targets for therapy are miRNAs, but these are minimally explored especially in responses to infection. Here, we demonstrated that Mir155 expression was up-regulated after ocular herpes simplex virus 1 infection, with the increased Mir155 expression occurring mainly in macrophages and CD4(+) T cells and to a lesser extent in neutrophils. In vivo studies indicated that Mir155 knockout mice were more resistant to herpes SK with marked suppression of T helper cells type 1 and 17 responses both in the ocular lesions and the lymphoid organs. The reduced SK lesion severity was reflected by increased phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase 1 and interferon-\u03b3 receptor \u03b1-chain levels in activated CD4(+) T cells in the lymph nodes. Finally, in vivo silencing of miR-155 by the provision of antagomir-155 nanoparticles to herpes simplex virus 1-infected mice led to diminished SK lesions and corneal vascularization.

Aggregates of human fibrochondrocytes with cell origin from the inner region or with cell origin from the outer region were generated. From the two groups of either cell origin, aggregates were treated with dynamic hydrostatic pressure (1Hz for 4h; 0.55-5.03MPa, cyclic sinusoidal) from day 1 to day 7. The other aggregates served as unloaded controls. At day 0, 7, 14 and 21 aggregates were harvested for evaluation including histology, immunostaining and ELISA analysis for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen II. Loaded aggregates were found to be macroscopically larger and revealed immunohistochemically enhanced chondrogenesis compared to the corresponding controls. Loaded or non-loaded meniscal cells from the outer zone showed a higher potential and earlier onset of chondrogenesis compared to the cells from the inner part of the meniscus.

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) may improve the effects of ASCs because it owns the property to boost angiogenesis. In the present study, human fat tissues were mixed with ASCs, ASCs plus 100 U bFGF, or medium as the control and then injected subcutaneously into immunologically compromised nude mice for 12 weeks. Our findings demonstrated that mixture with the ASCs significantly increased the weight and volume of the fat grafts compared to control grafts, and histological analysis revealed that both ASCs and ASCs plus bFGF grafts consisted predominantly of adipose tissue and had significantly less fibrosis but greater microvascular density compared with control and also grafts mixed with ASCs had a high expression of angiogenic factors. More importantly, the bFGF treated fat grafts shown elevate in survival, vascularization, and angiogenic factors expression when compared with the grafts that received ASCs alone.

{"title": "Cranial window implantation on mouse cortex to study microvascular change induced by cocaine.", "abstract": "Cocaine-induced stroke is among the most serious medical complications associated with cocaine's abuse. However, the extent to which chronic cocaine may induce silent microischemia predisposing the cerebral tissue to neurotoxicity has not been investigated; in part, because of limitations of current neuroimaging tools, that is, lack of high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity to simultaneously measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vessels of different calibers quantitatively and over a large field of view (FOV). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) technique allows us to image three dimensional (3D) cerebrovascular network (including artery, vein, and capillary), and provides high resolution angiography of the cerebral vasculature and quantitative CBF velocity (CBFv) within the individual vessels in the network. In order to monitor the neurovascular changes from an in vivo brain along with the chronic cocaine exposure, we have developed an approach of implanting a cranial window on mouse brain to achieve long-term cortical imaging. The cranial window was implanted on sensorimotor cortex area in two animal groups, i.e., control group [saline treatment, ~0.1 cc/10 g/day, intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)] and chronic cocaine group (cocaine treatment, 30 mg/kg/day i.p.). After implantation, the cortex of individual animal was periodically imaged by OCT and stereoscope to provide angiography and quantitative CBFv of the cerebral vascular network, as well as the surface imaging of the brain. We have observed vascular hemodynamic changes (i.e., CBFv changes) induced by the cranial preparation in both animal groups, including the inflammatory response of brain shortly after the surgery (i.e., <5 days) followed by wound-healing process (i.e., >5 days) in the brain. Importantly, by comparing with the control animals, the surgical-related vascular physiology changes in the cortex can be calibrated, so that the cocaine-induced hemodynamic changes in the neurovasculature can be determined in the cocaine animals.

Therefore, it is desirable to increase the detection view angle of linear-array-based PACT without sacrificing imaging speed.\nTwo planar acoustic reflectors placed at 120 degrees to each other were added to a linear-array-based PACT system. Each reflector redirects originally undetectable photoacoustic waves back to the transducer array elements, and together they triple the original detection view angle of the PACT system.\nAdding two reflectors increased the detection view angle from 80 to 240 degrees. As a comparison, a single-reflector PACT has a detection view angle of only 160 degrees. A leaf skeleton phantom with a rich vascular network was imaged with the double-reflector PACT, and most of its features were recovered.\nThe two acoustic reflectors triple the detection view angle of a linear-array-based PACT without compromising the original imaging speed.

{"title": "A biological approach to assembling tissue modules through endothelial capillary network formation.", "abstract": "To create functional tissues having complex structures, bottom-up approaches to assembling small tissue modules into larger constructs have been emerging. Most of these approaches are based on chemical reactions or physical interactions at the interface between tissue modules. Here we report a biological assembly approach to integrate small tissue modules through endothelial capillary network formation. When adjacent tissue modules contain appropriate extracellular matrix materials and cell types that support robust endothelial capillary network formation, capillary tubules form and grow across the interface, resulting in assembly of the modules into a single, larger construct. It was shown that capillary networks formed in modules of dense fibrin gels seeded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs); adjacent modules were firmly assembled into an integrated construct having a strain to failure of 117 \u00b1 26%, a tensile strength of 2208 \u00b1 83 Pa and a Young's modulus of 2548 \u00b1 574 Pa. Under the same culture conditions, capillary networks were absent in modules of dense fibrin gels seeded with either HUVECs or MSCs alone; adjacent modules disconnected even when handled gently. This biological assembly approach eliminates the need for chemical reactions or physical interactions and their associated limitations. In addition, the integrated constructs are prevascularized, and therefore this bottom-up assembly approach may also help address the issue of vascularization, another key challenge in tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2015-02-20", "authors": ["Jeremiah JRiesberg", "WeiShen"], "doi": "10.1002/term.2008"}

However, these methods are clinically afflicted with disadvantages. Another heterogeneous bone marrow cell population, the so-called human bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMC), has nevertheless been used clinically and showed improved vascularization in ischemic limbs or in the myocardium. For clinical use, a certified process has been established; thus, BMC were isolated from bone marrow aspirate by density gradient centrifugation, washed, cleaned, and given back to patients within several hours. This investigation tested the ability of human BMC seeded on beta-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) and placed into a large bone defect in rats to improve the bone healing process in vivo.\nHuman EPC were isolated from buffy coat, and MSC or BMC, respectively, were isolated from bone marrow aspirate by density gradient centrifugation. 1.0\u00d710(6) cells were loaded onto 750\u2009\u03bcL \u03b2-TCP (0.7-1.4\u2009mm). Large femoral defects (6\u2009mm) in athymic rats were created surgically and stabilized with an internal fixateur. The remaining defects were filled with \u03b2-TCP granules alone (group 1), \u03b2-TCP+EPC/MSC (group 2), or \u03b2-TCP+BMC (group 3). After 8 weeks, histomorphometric analysis (new bone formation), radiological microcomputer tomography analysis (bony bridging), and biomechanical testing (three-point bending) were achieved. Moreover, a tumorigenicity study was performed to evaluate the safety of BMC implantation after 26 weeks. For statistical analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used.\nEight weeks after implantation of EPC/MSC or BMC, respectively, we detected a more significant new bone formation compared to control. In group 2 and 3, bony bridging of the defect was seen. In the control group, more chondrocytes and osteoid were detected. In the BMC and EPC/MSC group, respectively, less chondrocytes and a significantly more advanced bone formation were observed. The biomechanical stability of the bone regenerate was significantly enhanced if BMC and EPC/MSC, respectively, were implanted compared to control. Moreover, no tumor formation was detected either macroscopically or histologically after 26 weeks of BMC implantation.\nImplanted BMC suggest that a heterogeneous cell population may provide a powerful cellular therapeutic strategy for bone healing in a large bone defect in humans.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Requisite role for Nck adaptors in cardiovascular development, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and directed cell migration.", "abstract": "Development of the cardiovascular system is critically dependent on the ability of endothelial cells (ECs) to reorganize their intracellular actin architecture to facilitate migration, adhesion, and morphogenesis. Nck family cytoskeletal adaptors function as key mediators of actin dynamics in numerous cell types, though their role in EC biology remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an essential requirement for Nck within ECs. Mouse embryos lacking endothelial Nck1/2 expression develop extensive angiogenic defects that result in lethality at about embryonic day 10. Mutant embryos show immature vascular networks, with decreased vessel branching, aberrant perivascular cell recruitment, and reduced cardiac trabeculation. Strikingly, embryos deficient in endothelial Nck also fail to undergo the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EnMT) required for cardiac valve morphogenesis, with loss of Nck disrupting expression of major EnMT markers, as well as suppressing mesenchymal outgrowth. Furthermore, we show that Nck-null ECs are unable to migrate downstream of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1, and they exhibit profound perturbations in cytoskeletal patterning, with disorganized cellular projections, impaired focal adhesion turnover, and disrupted actin-based signaling. Our collective findings thereby reveal a crucial role for Nck as a master regulator within the endothelium to control actin cytoskeleton organization, vascular network remodeling, and EnMT during cardiovascular development.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2015-02-19", "authors": ["Derek LClouthier", "Cameron NHarris", "Richard AHarris", "Claire EMartin", "Mira CPuri", "NinaJones"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.00072-15\n10.1038/nrg1158\n10.1038/74651\n10.1161/01.RES.0000182903.16652.d7\n10.1038/35025190\n10.1038/nrm2183\n10.1038/35067005\n10.1161/01.RES.0000259593.07661.1e\n10.1016/S0092-8674(03)01077-8\n10.1038/nature04662\n10.1073/pnas.0710316105\n10.1038/sj.onc.1204782\n10.1016/S0898-6568(02)00027-X\n10.1016/S1357-2725(02)00002-X\n10.1038/nature00859\n10.1074/jbc.274.46.32531\n10.1074/jbc.M103856200\n10.1006/bbrc.1998.8578\n10.1074/jbc.M009720200\n10.1074/jbc.M603928200\n10.1038/sj.onc.1202115\n10.1093/emboj/20.21.5919\n10.1083/jcb.200506184\n10.1128/MCB.24.18.8134-8144.2004\n10.1038/nature01770\n10.1128/MCB.23.13.4586-4597.2003\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.08.016\n10.1006/dbio.2002.0731\n10.1083/jcb.200212157\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.07.012\n10.3791/2160\n10.1152/ajpendo.00088.2010\n10.1083/jcb.200411155\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.90284.2008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223800\n10.1161/01.RES.0000141146.95728.da\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604662\n10.1242/jcs.039446\n10.1101/gad.8.16.1897\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81813-9\n10.1128/MCB.25.11.4693-4702.2005\n10.1006/mvre.1998.2081\n10.1242/dev.02883\n10.1083/jcb.201105103\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3480\n10.1074/jbc.M800913200\n10.1038/jid.2008.457\n10.1093/jb/mvr121\n10.1016/j.ejcb.2010.10.013\n10.1074/jbc.M702169200\n10.1091/mbc.01-07-0368\n10.1128/MCB.23.4.1316-1333.2003\n10.1074/jbc.M112.343947\n10.1242/jcs.119610\n10.1083/jcb.200302047"}

They regulate hair follicle (HF) development and growth, and represent a reservoir of multipotent stem cells. Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that HF cycling is associated with vascular remodeling.

Furthermore, several human diseases characterized by hair loss, including Androgenetic Alopecia, exhibit alterations of skin vasculature. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HF vascularization remain largely unknown. In vitro coculture approaches can be successfully employed to greatly improve our knowledge and shed more light on this issue. Here we used Transwell-based co-cultures to show that FDPC promote survival, proliferation and tubulogenesis of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) more efficiently than fibroblasts. Accordingly, FDPC enhance the endothelial release of VEGF and IGF-1, two well-known proangiogenic growth factors.

{"title": "Biofunctionalizing devitalized bone allografts through polymer-mediated short and long term growth factor delivery.", "abstract": "According to 5- and 10-year clinical follow-up studies large-scale bone allografts have a high failure rate, largely due to poor allograft incorporation with adjacent bone and subsequent poor remodeling. The goal of this study was to develop a methodology to deliver growth factors from large-scale bone allografts in a temporally controlled manner. Intact long bone allografts were coated with a micron-scale thick layer of degradable polymer that maintained inherent pore structures and acted as a delivery vehicle for bone morphogenetic protein-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor. VEGF was loaded onto the surface of the polymer to produce rapid release, to encourage initial vascularization at the defect site, while BMP-2 was encapsulated within the polymer layer to promote a more sustained release, to encourage bone formation over time. Release kinetics from factor-loaded polymer-coated allografts show an early burst release of VEGF over the first 7 days followed by a more sustained release of BMP-2 over the second and third week. In vitro cell studies using human mesenchymal stem cells confirm the bioactivity of the released BMP-2. In-vivo results show robust bone formation over the first 8 weeks of healing in femoral segmental defects in rats implanted with BMP-2 loaded polymer-coated allografts. A microscale thin coating of degradable polymer on a large-scale bone allograft provides temporal control over the delivery of growth factor loaded onto one allograft, while maintaining its microscale pore structure.

Despite widespread recognition of the significance of vascular dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease aetiology and progression, much uncertainty still surrounds the mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease vascular injury. Studies to date have focused on amyloid-\u03b2-induced damage to capillaries and plaque-associated arterioles, without examining effects across the entire vascular bed. In the present study, we investigated the structural and functional impairment of the feeding arteriolar versus draining venular vessels in a transgenic murine Alzheimer's disease model, with a particular focus on the mural cell populations that dictate these vessels' contractility. Although amyloid-\u03b2 deposition was restricted to arterioles, we found that vascular impairment extended to the venules, which showed significant depletion of their mural cell coverage by the mid-stage of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. These structural abnormalities were accompanied by an abolishment of the normal vascular network flow response to hypercapnia: this functional impairment was so severe as to result in hypercapnia-induced flow decreases in the arterioles. Further pharmacological depletion of mural cells using SU6668, a platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2 antagonist, resulted in profound structural abnormalities of the cortical microvasculature, including vessel coiling and short-range looping, increased tortuosity of the venules but not of the arterioles, increased amyloid-\u03b2 deposition on the arterioles, and further alterations of the microvascular network cerebral blood flow response to hypercapnia. Together, this work shows hitherto unrecognized structural alterations in penetrating venules, demonstrates their functional significance and sheds light on the complexity of the relationship between vascular network structure and function in Alzheimer's disease.", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "date": "2015-02-18", "authors": ["Aaron YLai", "AdrienneDorr", "Lynsie A MThomason", "Margaret MKoletar", "John GSled", "BojanaStefanovic", "JoAnneMcLaurin"], "doi": "10.1093/brain/awv023"}

Cochlear implant infections and extrusion are uncommon but potentially devastating complications. Recent literature suggests conservative management can be employed. Local measures inclusive of aggressive surgical debridement with vascularized flaps and parenteral antibiotics represent a viable option and often permit device salvage. However, explantation should be considered if there is evidence of systemic, intracranial, or intractable infection. Method. A Case report and literature review. Case Report. This case illustrates a complicated local wound infection associated with cochlear implantation due to transcutaneous adherence of a ferrous hair barrette to a cochlear implant magnet. Reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) data with 3D volume rendering significantly improved the value of the images and facilitated patient counseling as well as operative planning. Conclusion. Cochlear implant infections can be associated with foreign bodies.

The predictor variables were age, gender, lesion size, and diagnosis, and the outcome variable was graft success determined by re-establishment of mandibular continuity with sufficient bone for implant placement. The \u03c7(2) test was used for statistical analysis of the categorical data and P values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.\nTwenty patients with benign mandibular tumors were treated with transoral resection and immediate reconstruction with nonvascularized bone grafts. The mean age was 28.3 years (range, 9 to 63 yr) and 55% (11 of 20) were men. The most common lesion type was ameloblastoma (13 of 20) and all patients underwent reconstruction with autogenous anterior iliac crest bone grafting.

{"title": "Cardiac endothelial cells express Wilms' tumor-1: Wt1 expression in the developing, adult and infarcted heart.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death worldwide. Due to their limited regenerative capacity lost cardiomyocytes are replaced by a non-contractile fibrotic scar tissue. The epicardial layer of the heart provides cardiac progenitor cells during development. Because this layer regains embryonic characteristics in the adult heart after cardiac injury, it could serve as a promising source for resident cardiac progenitor cells. Wilms' tumor-1 (Wt1) is associated with the activation and reactivation of the epicardium and therefore potentially important for the differentiation and regenerative capacity of the epicardium. To gain more insight into the regulation of Wt1 we examined the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Wt1 during murine development and after cardiac injury. Interestingly, we found that Wt1 is expressed in the majority of the cardiac endothelial cells within the myocardial ventricular layer of the developing heart from E12.5 onwards. In the adult heart only a subset of coronary endothelial cells remains positive for Wt1. After myocardial infarction Wt1 is temporally upregulated in the endothelial cells of the infarcted area and the border zone of the heart. In vitro experiments show that endothelial Wt1 expression can be induced by hypoxia. We show that Wt1 is associated with endothelial cell proliferation: Wt1 expression is higher in proliferating endothelial cells, Wt1 knockdown inhibits the proliferation of endothelial cells, and Wt1 regulates CyclinD1 expression. Finally, endothelial cells lacking Wt1 are not capable to establish a proper vascular network in vitro. Together, these results suggest a possible role for Wt1 in cardiac vessel formation in development and disease.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2015-02-15", "authors": ["Sjoerd NDuim", "KondababuKurakula", "Marie-Jos\u00e9Goumans", "Boudewijn P TKruithof"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.02.007"}

We demonstrate that hIL-2/Fc therapy tips the immune balance, increasing Treg proliferation and suppressing effector T cells, and permits VCA tolerance as demonstrated by long-term allograft survival and donor-antigen acceptance. Moreover, we observe two distinct types of acute rejection (AR), progressive and reversible, within hIL-2/Fc plus ALS and CsA treated recipients.

Despite modest achievements in survival obtained with such treatments, failure to maintain an enduring survival benefit and more invasive relapsing tumors are evident. Our study suggests a potential mechanism by which anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapies regulate the enhanced invasive phenotype through a pathway that involves TGF\u03b2R and CXCR4. VEGFR signaling inhibitors (Cediranib and Vandetanib) elevated the expression of CXCR4 in VEGFR-expressing GBM cell lines and tumors, and enhanced the in vitro migration of these lines toward CXCL12. The combination of VEGFR inhibitor and CXCR4 antagonist provided a greater survival benefit to tumor-bearing animals. The upregulation of CXCR4 by VEGFR inhibitors was dependent on TGF\u03b2/TGF\u03b2R, but not HGF/MET, signaling activity, suggesting a mechanism of crosstalk among VEGF/VEGFR, TGF\u03b2/TGF\u03b2R, and CXCL12/CXCR4 pathways in the malignant phenotype of recurrent tumors after anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapies.

One microvascular composite flap failed because of radiation injury to the arterial endothelium at the recipient site. After the treatments, all patients had good esthetic and functional outcomes. Preoperative clinical features such as trismus and dysphagia were also markedly improved.

{"title": "Gap junction connexins in female reproductive organs: implications for women's reproductive health.", "abstract": "Connexins comprise a family of ~20 proteins that form intercellular membrane channels (gap junction channels) providing a direct route for metabolites and signalling molecules to pass between cells. This review provides a critical analysis of the evidence for essential roles of individual connexins in female reproductive function, highlighting implications for women's reproductive health.\nNo systematic review has been carried out. Published literature from the past 35 years was surveyed for research related to connexin involvement in development and function of the female reproductive system. Because of the demonstrated utility of genetic manipulation for elucidating connexin functions in various organs, much of the cited information comes from research with genetically modified mice. In some cases, a distinction is drawn between connexin functions clearly related to the formation of gap junction channels and those possibly linked to non-channel roles.\nBased on work with mice, several connexins are known to be required for female reproductive functions. Loss of connexin43 (CX43) causes an oocyte deficiency, and follicles lacking or expressing less CX43 in granulosa cells exhibit reduced growth, impairing fertility. CX43 is also expressed in human cumulus cells and, in the context of IVF, has been correlated with pregnancy outcome, suggesting that this connexin may be a determinant of oocyte and embryo quality in women. Loss of CX37, which exclusively connects oocytes with granulosa cells in the mouse, caused oocytes to cease growing without acquiring meiotic competence. Blocking of CX26 channels in the uterine epithelium disrupted implantation whereas loss or reduction of CX43 expression in the uterine stroma impaired decidualization and vascularization in mouse and human. Several connexins are important in placentation and, in the human, CX43 is a key regulator of the fusogenic pathway from the cytotrophoblast to the syncytiotrophoblast, ensuring placental growth. CX40, which characterizes the extravillous trophoblast (EVT), supports proliferation of the proximal EVTs while preventing them from differentiating into the invasive pathway. Furthermore, women with recurrent early pregnancy loss as well as those with endometriosis exhibit reduced levels of CX43 in their decidua. The antimalaria drug mefloquine, which blocks gap junction function, is responsible for increased risk of early pregnancy loss and stillbirth, probably due to inhibition of intercellular communication in the decidua or between trophoblast layers followed by an impairment of placental growth. Gap junctions also play a critical role in regulating uterine blood flow, contributing to the adaptive response to pregnancy. Given that reproductive impairment can result from connexin mutations in mice, it is advised that women suffering from somatic disease symptoms associated with connexin gene mutations be additionally tested for impacts on reproductive function. Better knowledge of these essential connexin functions in human female reproductive organs is important for safeguarding women's reproductive health.", "journal": "Human reproduction update", "date": "2015-02-11", "authors": ["ElkeWinterhager", "Gerald MKidder"], "doi": "10.1093/humupd/dmv007"}
{"title": "Matrix metalloproteinase-9 is essential for physiological Beta cell function and islet vascularization in adult mice.", "abstract": "The availability of paracrine factors in the islets of Langerhans, and the constitution of the beta cell basement membrane can both be affected by proteolytic enzymes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp-9) on islet function in mice. Islet function of Mmp9-deficient (Mmp9(-/-)) mice and their wild-type littermates was evaluated both in vivo and in vitro. The pancreata of Mmp9(-/-) mice did not differ from wild type in islet mass or distribution. However, Mmp9(-/-) mice had an impaired response to a glucose load in vivo, with lower serum insulin levels. The glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was reduced also in vitro in isolated Mmp9(-/-) islets. The vascular density of Mmp9(-/-) islets was lower, and the capillaries had fewer fenestrations, whereas the islet blood flow was threefold higher. These alterations could partly be explained by compensatory changes in the expression of matrix-related proteins. This in-depth investigation of the effects of the loss of MMP-9 function on pancreatic islets uncovers a deteriorated beta cell function that is primarily due to a shift in the beta cell phenotype, but also due to islet vascular aberrations. This likely reflects the importance of a normal islet matrix turnover exerted by MMP-9, and concomitant release of paracrine factors sequestered on the matrix.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2015-02-11", "authors": ["GustafChristoffersson", "TomasWald\u00e9n", "MonicaSandberg", "GhislainOpdenakker", "Per-OlaCarlsson", "MiaPhillipson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.12.009"}
{"title": "Vascularization of the gray whale palate (Cetacea, Mysticeti, Eschrichtius robustus): soft tissue evidence for an alveolar source of blood to baleen.", "abstract": "The origin of baleen in mysticetes heralded a major transition during cetacean evolution. Extant mysticetes are edentulous in adulthood, but rudimentary teeth develop in utero within open maxillary and mandibular alveolar grooves. The teeth are resorbed prenatally and the alveolar grooves close as baleen germ develops. Arteries supplying blood to highly vascularized epithelial tissue from which baleen develops pass through lateral nutrient foramina in the area of the embryonic alveolar grooves and rudimentary teeth. Those vessels are hypothesized to be branches of the superior alveolar artery, but branches of the greater palatine arteries may play a role in the baleen vascularization. Through a combination of latex injection, CT, and traditional dissection of the palate of a neonatal gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), we confirm that the baleen receives blood from vessels within the superior alveolar canal via the lateral foramina. The greater palatine artery is restricted to its own passage with no connections to the baleen. This study has implications for the presence of baleen in extinct taxa by identifying the vessels and bony canals that supply blood to the epithelium from which baleen develops. The results indicate that the lateral foramina in edentulous mysticete fossils are bony correlates for the presence of baleen, and the results can be used to help identify bony canals and foramina that have been used to reconstruct baleen in extinct mysticetes that retained teeth in adulthood.

{"title": "Polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate structures loaded with adipose stem cells promote skin healing with reduced scarring.", "abstract": "Currently available skin substitutes are still associated with a range of problems including poor engraftment resulting from deficient vascularization, and excessive scar formation, among others. Trying to overcome these issues, this work proposes the combination of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) structures with adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) to offer biomechanical and biochemical signaling cues necessary to improve wound healing in a full-thickness model. PHBV scaffold maintained the wound moisture and demonstrated enough mechanical properties to withstand wound contraction. Also, exudate and inflammatory cell infiltration enhanced the degradation of the structure, and thus healing progression. After 28 days all the wounds were closed and the PHBV scaffold was completely degraded. The transplanted ASCs were detected in the wound area only at day 7, correlating with an up-regulation of VEGF and bFGF at this time point that consequently led to a significant higher vessel density in the group that received the PHBV loaded with ASCs. Subsequently, the dermis formed in the presence of the PHBV loaded with ASCs possesses a more complex collagen structure. Additionally, an anti-scarring effect was observed in the presence of the PHBV scaffold indicated by a down-regulation of TGF-\u03b21 and \u03b1-SMA together with an increase of TGF-\u03b23, when associated with ASCs. These results indicate that although PHBV scaffold was able to guide the wound healing process with reduced scarring, the presence of ASCs was crucial to enhance vascularization and provide a better quality neo-skin. Therefore, we can conclude that PHBV loaded with ASCs possesses the necessary bioactive cues to improve wound healing with reduced scarring.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-02-11", "authors": ["AlessandraZonari", "Tha\u00eds M MMartins", "Ana Cl\u00e1udia CPaula", "Jankerle NBoeloni", "SilvieneNovikoff", "Alexandra PMarques", "Vitor MCorrelo", "Rui LReis", "Alfredo MGoes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.01.043"}
{"title": "Tissue-engineered models of human tumors for cancer research.", "abstract": "Drug toxicity often goes undetected until clinical trials, which are the most costly and dangerous phase of drug development. Both the cultures of human cells and animal studies have limitations that cannot be overcome by incremental improvements in drug-testing protocols. A new generation of bioengineered tumors is now emerging in response to these limitations, with potential to transform drug screening by providing predictive models of tumors within their tissue context, for studies of drug safety and efficacy. An area that could greatly benefit from these models is cancer research.\nIn this review, the authors first describe the engineered tumor systems, using Ewing's sarcoma as an example of human tumor that cannot be predictably studied in cell culture and animal models. Then, they discuss the importance of the tissue context for cancer progression and outline the biomimetic principles for engineering human tumors. Finally, they discuss the utility of bioengineered tumor models for cancer research and address the challenges in modeling human tumors for use in drug discovery and testing.\nWhile tissue models are just emerging as a new tool for cancer drug discovery, they are already demonstrating potential for recapitulating, in vitro, the native behavior of human tumors. Still, numerous challenges need to be addressed before we can have platforms with a predictive power appropriate for the pharmaceutical industry.

{"title": "Versatile fabrication of vascularizable scaffolds for large tissue engineering in bioreactor.", "abstract": "Despite significant progresses were achieved in tissue engineering over the last 20 years, a number of unsolved problems still remain. One of the most relevant issues is the lack of a proper vascularization that is limiting the size of the engineered tissues to smaller than clinically relevant dimensions. Sacrificial molding holds great promise to engineered construct with perfusable vascular architectures, but there is still the need to develop more versatile approaches able to be independent of the nature and dimensions of the construct. In this work we developed a versatile sacrificial molding technique for fabricating bulk, cell-laden and porous scaffolds with embedded vascular fluidic networks. These branched fluidic architectures are created by highly resistant thermoplastic sacrificial templates, made of poly(vinyl alcohol), representing a remarkable progress in manufacturability and scalability. The obtained architecture, when perfused in bioreactor, has shown to prevent the formation of a necrotic core in thick cell-laden constructs and enabled the rapid fabrication of hierarchically branched endothelium. In conclusion we demonstrate a novel strategy towards the engineering of vascularized thick tissues through the integration of the PVA-based microfabrication sacrificial approach and perfusion bioreactors.

{"title": "Application of Modular Therapy for Renoprotection in Experimental Chronic Kidney Disease.", "abstract": "Cell-based regenerative therapies offer a new alternative approach to the treatment of chronic disease. Specifically, studies by our laboratory and others have shown that a subpopulation of cells derived from the bone marrow, known as early outgrowth cells (EOCs), are able to attenuate the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study we examined the efficacy of a tissue engineering system, in which EOCs were embedded into submillimeter-sized collagen cylinders. These small individual units are referred to as modules and together form a functional microtissue. Due to their resemblance to endothelial cells, late outgrowth cells (LOCs) were used to coat the module surface, hypothesizing that as such they would promote vascularization and enhance engraftment of the encapsulated EOCs. These coated modules were transplanted subcutaneously into the subtotally nephrectomized rat model of CKD. While coated module therapy significantly improved both renal structure and function, noncoated modules with embedded EOCs were unable to reproduce these salutary effects on the kidney. Nevertheless, in both treatments, the embedded EOCs quickly degraded the modular environment and were seen to migrate to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow as early as 6 days after transplantation. With the efflux of EOCs, and unexpectedly no evidence of vascularization, we hypothesized that the LOCs did not enhance EOC engraftment, but rather augmented the renoprotection provided by EOCs by secretion of their own soluble and potent antifibrotic factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to document an effective subcutaneous approach for renoprotection.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Regulation of valve endothelial cell vasculogenic network architectures with ROCK and Rac inhibitors.", "abstract": "The age- and disease-dependent presence of microvessels within heart valves is an understudied characteristic of these tissues. Neovascularization involves endothelial cell (EC) migration and cytoskeletal reorientation, which are heavily regulated by the Rho family of GTPases. Given that valve ECs demonstrate unique mesenchymal transdifferentiation and cytoskeletal mechanoresponsiveness, compared to vascular ECs, this study quantified the effect of inhibiting two members of the Rho family on vasculogenic network formation by valve ECs.\nA tubule-like structure vasculogenesis assay (assessing lacunarity, junction density, and vessel density) was performed with porcine aortic valve ECs treated with small molecule inhibitors of Rho-associated serine-threonine protein kinase (ROCK), Y-27632, or the Rac1 inhibitor, NSC-23766. Actin coordination, cell number, and cell migration were assessed through immunocytochemistry, MTT assay, and scratch wound healing assay. ROCK inhibition reduced network lacunarity and interrupted proper cell-cell adhesion and actin coordination. Rac1 inhibition increased lacunarity and delayed actin-mediated network formation. ROCK inhibition alone significantly inhibited migration, whereas both ROCK and Rac1 inhibition significantly reduced cell number over time compared to controls. Compared to a vascular EC line, the valve ECs generated a network with larger total vessel length, but a less smooth appearance.\nBoth ROCK and Rac1 inhibition interfered with key processes in vascular network formation by valve ECs. This is the first report of manipulation of valve EC vasculogenic organization in response to small molecule inhibitors.

We examined the relationship of retinal microvascular signs with both prevalent and incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in a multi-ethnic Asian population.\nA total of 5763 subjects (aged \u2265 40 years) from two prospective population-based studies (the Singapore Malay Eye Study and the Singapore Prospective Study) were included for the current analysis. Retinopathy was graded using the modified Airlie House classification system. Retinal vascular parameters were measured using computer-assisted programs to quantify the retinal vessel widths (arteriolar and venular caliber) and retinal vascular network (fractal dimension). Data on ESRD was obtained by record linkage with the ESRD cases registered by National Registry of Diseases Office, Singapore. Multi-variable adjusted regression analyses were performed to assess the associations of baseline retinal vascular parameters and prevalent and incident ESRD.\nAt baseline, 21(0.36%) persons had prevalent ESRD. During a median follow-up of 4.3 years, 33 (0.57%) subjects developed ESRD.

{"title": "3,5-Diiodo-L-thyronine activates brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in hypothyroid rats.", "abstract": "3,5-Diiodo-l-thyronine (T2), a thyroid hormone derivative, is capable of increasing energy expenditure, as well as preventing high fat diet-induced overweight and related metabolic dysfunction. Most studies to date on T2 have been carried out on liver and skeletal muscle. Considering the role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in energy and metabolic homeostasis, we explored whether T2 could activate BAT thermogenesis. Using euthyroid, hypothyroid, and T2-treated hypothyroid rats (all maintained at thermoneutrality) in morphological and functional studies, we found that hypothyroidism suppresses the maximal oxidative capacity of BAT and thermogenesis, as revealed by reduced mitochondrial content and respiration, enlarged cells and lipid droplets, and increased number of unilocular cells within the tissue. In vivo administration of T2 to hypothyroid rats activated BAT thermogenesis and increased the sympathetic innervation and vascularization of tissue. Likewise, T2 increased BAT oxidative capacity in vitro when added to BAT homogenates from hypothyroid rats. In vivo administration of T2 to hypothyroid rats enhanced mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, UCP1 seems to be a molecular determinant underlying the effect of T2 on mitochondrial thermogenesis. In fact, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by GDP and its reactivation by fatty acids were greater in mitochondria from T2-treated hypothyroid rats than untreated hypothyroid rats. In vivo administration of T2 led to an increase in PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels in nuclei (transient) and mitochondria (longer lasting), suggesting a coordinate effect of T2 in these organelles that ultimately promotes net activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and BAT thermogenesis. The effect of T2 on PGC-1\u03b1 is similar to that elicited by triiodothyronine. As a whole, the data reported here indicate T2 is a thyroid hormone derivative able to activate BAT thermogenesis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-02-07", "authors": ["AssuntaLombardi", "RosalbaSenese", "RitaDe Matteis", "Rosa AnnaBusiello", "FedericaCioffi", "FernandoGoglia", "AntoniaLanni"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0116498\n10.1038/sj.ijo.0802905\n10.2741/3786\n10.1016/j.tibs.2009.11.001\n10.1152/physrev.00015.2003\n10.1038/387090a0\n10.1016/j.cmet.2008.12.014\n10.2174/1389450043490523\n10.1038/nm.2297\n10.1016/j.cmet.2011.02.009\n10.1016/j.numecd.2012.01.013\n10.1007/s00109-012-0858-3\n10.1152/ajpendo.00691.2006\n10.2337/db09-0530\n10.1172/JCI60941\n10.1056/NEJMoa0808718\n10.1056/NEJMoa0808718\n10.1152/physrev.00009.2005\n10.1038/nm.2207\n10.1007/s10541-005-0097-0\n10.1677/joe.0.1360059\n10.1016/j.febslet.2007.11.073\n10.1016/0303-7207(94)90150-3\n10.1152/ajpendo.90642.2008\n10.1152/ajpendo.00037.2012\n10.1096/fj.05-3977fje\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.1997.529bb.x\n10.2337/db11-0207\n10.1096/fj.11-181982\n10.1530/JOE-13-0502\n10.1007/s004240050650\n10.1210/en.143.2.504\n10.1016/0003-2697(72)90094-2\n10.1074/jbc.M203834200\n10.1152/ajpendo.00600.2009\n10.1023/A:1006996922657\n10.1038/nrd2830\n10.1089/thy.2007.0248\n10.1016/S2213-8587(13)70069-X\n10.1016/0014-5793(94)00476-5\n10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2520325.x\n10.1210/edrv-4-4-378\n10.1210/en.137.12.5519\n10.1172/JCI12584\n10.1016/0026-0495(84)90232-4\n10.1074/jbc.275.18.13802\n10.1677/joe.0.1490319\n10.1074/jbc.M109.070169\n10.1074/jbc.M110.211466\n10.1210/en.2013-1030\n10.1530/JME-13-0145\n10.1530/JOE-13-0502\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.01.023\n10.1007/s10863-011-9366-3\n10.1530/JOE-11-0288\n10.1677/jme.0.0190137\n10.1096/fj.10-157115\n10.1038/nm1051\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.106.480277"}

{"title": "Nox4 supports proper capillary growth in exercise and retina neo-vascularization.", "abstract": "We provide evidence for two distinct functions of the NADPH oxidase Nox4 in angiogenesis using Nox4 knockout mice. First, Nox4 maintains vascular endothelial growth factor expression and prevents an increase in angiopoietin\u00a01 expression, thereby contributing to angiogenesis in exercise. Second, deletion of Nox4, via an enhanced angiopoietin\u00a01 expression, contributes to stabilization of new formed vessels and prevents an exacerbated neo-angiogenesis in oxygen-induced retinopathy. By contrast, Nox4 does not influence developmental angiogenesis.\nBy producing H2 O2 , the NADPH oxidase Nox4 is involved in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, as present in vascular remodelling of the hypertrophic heart or blood flow recovery after hind limb ischaemia. In the present study, we hypothesized that Nox4 contributes to proper capillary growth in the retina and in exercised muscles and investigated this in wild-type and Nox4(-/-) mice. Exercise, as induced by voluntary running in a running wheel or forced running on a treadmill, stimulated capillary growth in wild-type but not Nox4(-/-) mice. As an underlying mechanism, we identified both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression to be reduced and angiopoietin\u00a01 (Ang1) expression to be increased in response to Nox4 knockout. To differentiate the two factors, oxygen-induced retinopathy was investigated. In this model, deletion of Nox4 protected from neo-angiogenesis and stabilized the network of regrown vessels, which is a typical feature of Ang1. However the angiogenesis in the developing retina was similar between Nox4(-/-) and wild-type mice. Thus, Nox4 contributes to exercise- and hypoxia-induced angiogenesis through a dual mechanism of maintaining VEGF and preventing Ang-1 expression, whereas the developmental angiogenesis is Nox4 independent.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2015-02-06", "authors": ["JuriVogel", "ChristophKruse", "MinZhang", "KatrinSchr\u00f6der"], "doi": "10.1113/jphysiol.2014.284901"}

In this study, we investigated the impact of targeted disruption of Txnrd2 on tumor growth.\nTumor cells with a Txnrd2 deficiency failed to activate hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (Hif-1\u03b1) signaling; it rather caused PHD2 accumulation, Hif-1\u03b1 degradation and decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, ultimately leading to reduced tumor growth and tumor vascularization. Increased c-Jun NH2-terminal Kinase (JNK) activation proved to be the molecular link between the loss of Txnrd2, an altered mitochondrial redox balance with compensatory upregulation of glutaredoxin-2, and elevated PHD2 expression.\nOur data provide compelling evidence for a yet-unrecognized mitochondrial Txnrd-driven, regulatory mechanism that ultimately prevents cellular Hif-1\u03b1 accumulation. In addition, simultaneous targeting of both the mitochondrial thioredoxin and glutathione systems was used as an efficient therapeutic approach in hindering tumor growth.\nThis work demonstrates an unexpected regulatory link between mitochondrial Txnrd and the JNK-PHD2-Hif-1\u03b1 axis, which highlights how the loss of Txnrd2 and the resulting altered mitochondrial redox balance impairs tumor growth as well as tumor-related angiogenesis.

{"title": "Human pancreatic cancer tumors are nutrient poor and tumor cells actively scavenge extracellular protein.", "abstract": "Glucose and amino acids are key nutrients supporting cell growth. Amino acids are imported as monomers, but an alternative route induced by oncogenic KRAS involves uptake of extracellular proteins via macropinocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation of these proteins as a source of amino acids. In this study, we examined the metabolism of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a poorly vascularized lethal KRAS-driven malignancy. Metabolomic comparisons of human PDAC and benign adjacent tissue revealed that tumor tissue was low in glucose, upper glycolytic intermediates, creatine phosphate, and the amino acids glutamine and serine, two major metabolic substrates. Surprisingly, PDAC accumulated essential amino acids. Such accumulation could arise from extracellular proteins being degraded through macropinocytosis in quantities necessary to meet glutamine requirements, which in turn produces excess of most other amino acids. Consistent with this hypothesis, active macropinocytosis is observed in primary human PDAC specimens. Moreover, in the presence of physiologic albumin, we found that cultured murine PDAC cells grow indefinitely in media lacking single essential amino acids and replicate once in the absence of free amino acids. Growth under these conditions was characterized by simultaneous glutamine depletion and essential amino acid accumulation.

The mean interval between operation and radiation therapy was 28.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3 years, and the mean number of debridement performed was 6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091. NPWT dressings were applied for 8-12 weeks (mean, 9.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092 weeks). The defects ranged in size from 14 \u00d7 8 cm to 18 \u00d7 15 cm. The flap size ranged from 15 \u00d7 10 cm to 18 \u00d7 15 cm. All flaps survived uneventfully except in one patient who experienced chronic seroma and wound dehiscence. There were no recurrences of osteomyelitis during the follow-up periods (mean, 14\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 months). Based on the results obtained from this consecutive series of patients, we suggest that this methodology may provide an alternative approach for the treatment of severe osteoradionecrosis of the gluteal region.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2015-02-03", "authors": ["Sang WhaKim", "Dong GeunYoun", "Kyu TaeHwang", "Jeong TaeKim", "Youn HwanKim"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.22370"}
{"title": "The molecular regulation of arteriovenous specification and maintenance.", "abstract": "The formation of a hierarchical vascular network, composed of arteries, veins, and capillaries, is essential for embryogenesis and is required for the production of new functional vasculature in the adult. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate the differentiation of vascular endothelial cells into arterial and venous cell fates is requisite for regenerative medicine, as the directed formation of perfused vessels is desirable in a myriad of pathological settings, such as in diabetes and following myocardial infarction. Additionally, this knowledge will enhance our understanding and treatment of vascular anomalies, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). From studies in vertebrate model organisms, such as mouse, zebrafish, and chick, a number of key signaling pathways have been elucidated that are required for the establishment and maintenance of arterial and venous fates. These include the Hedgehog, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Transforming Growth Factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways. In addition, a variety of transcription factor families acting downstream of, or in concert with, these signaling networks play vital roles in arteriovenous (AV) specification. These include Notch and Notch-regulated transcription factors (e.g., HEY and HES), SOX factors, Forkhead factors, \u03b2-Catenin, ETS factors, and COUP-TFII. It is becoming apparent that AV specification is a highly coordinated process that involves the intersection and carefully orchestrated activity of multiple signaling cascades and transcriptional networks. This review will summarize the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the acquisition and maintenance of AV fate, and will highlight some of the limitations in our current knowledge of the molecular machinery that directs AV morphogenesis.", "journal": "Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists", "date": "2015-02-03", "authors": ["Jason EFish", "Joshua DWythe"], "doi": "10.1002/dvdy.24252"}
{"title": "Spatiotemporal Analyses of Osteogenesis and Angiogenesis via Intravital Imaging in Cranial Bone Defect Repair.", "abstract": "Osteogenesis and angiogenesis are two integrated components in bone repair and regeneration. A deeper understanding of osteogenesis and angiogenesis has been hampered by technical difficulties of analyzing bone and neovasculature simultaneously in spatiotemporal scales and in 3D formats. To overcome these barriers, a cranial defect window chamber model was established that enabled high-resolution, longitudinal, and real-time tracking of angiogenesis and bone defect healing via multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM). By simultaneously probing new bone matrix via second harmonic generation (SHG), neovascular networks via intravenous perfusion of fluorophore, and osteoblast differentiation via 2.3-kb collagen type I promoter-driven GFP (Col2.3GFP), we examined the morphogenetic sequence of cranial bone defect healing and further established the spatiotemporal analyses of osteogenesis and angiogenesis coupling in repair and regeneration. We showed that bone defect closure was initiated in the residual bone around the edge of the defect. The expansion and migration of osteoprogenitors into the bone defect occurred during the first 3 weeks of healing, coupled with vigorous microvessel angiogenesis at the leading edge of the defect. Subsequent bone repair was marked by matrix deposition and active vascular network remodeling within new bone. Implantation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) isolated from Col2.3GFP mice further showed that donor-dependent bone formation occurred rapidly within the first 3 weeks of implantation, in concert with early angiogenesis. The subsequent bone wound closure was largely host-dependent, associated with localized modest induction of angiogenesis. The establishment of a live imaging platform via cranial window provides a unique tool to understand osteogenesis and angiogenesis in repair and regeneration, enabling further elucidation of the spatiotemporal regulatory mechanisms of osteoprogenitor cell interactions with host bone healing microenvironment.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2015-02-03", "authors": ["ChunlanHuang", "Vincent PNess", "XiaochuanYang", "HongliChen", "JieboLuo", "Edward BBrown", "XinpingZhang"], "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.2460"}
{"title": "Osteoderm histology of Proterochampsia and Doswelliidae (Reptilia: Archosauriformes) and their evolutionary and paleobiological implications.", "abstract": "Postcranial osteoderms are commonly developed in the major lineages of Archosauriformes, including forms such as proterochampsids and doswelliids. Here, we survey the histology of osteoderms of the doswelliids Archeopelta arborensis and Tarjadia ruthae, and the proterochampsids Chanaresuchus bonapartei and Pseudochampsa ischigualastensis to understand better the morphogenesis of these skeletal elements. Whereas, the Doswelliid osteoderms possess a trilaminar organization, in which two cortices (external and basal) can be differentiated from an internal core of cancellous bone, these elements are compact structures in proterochampsids. The osteoderms of P. ischigualastensis are avascular and they consist entirely of parallel-fibered bone. Conversely, the osteoderms of C. bonapartei are well vascularized structures composed of zones of woven-fibered bone and annuli of parallel-fibered bone. The rather simple microstructure observed in P. ischigualastensis osteoderms suggests that these elements grew at a constant, low rate. Compared with proterochampsids, doswelliid osteoderms possess a more complex histology, which appears to be linked to variations in the growth rate during the osteoderm formation and also to the development of the external ornamentation. A comparison of our findings with the results of earlier studies on other archosauriforms (phytosaurs and pseudosuchians) reveals that the general osteoderm histology of doswelliids bears a closer resemblance to that of phytosaurs and pseudosuchians than the proterochampsid osteoderm microstructure. If all archosauriform osteoderms are homologous structures, the closer resemblance of doswellid osteoderm microstructures to that of phytosaurs and pseudosuchians is in agreement with the hypothesis that doswellids are more closely related to archosaurs than proterochampsids.

A primary goal of partial nephrectomy is to preserve as much renal function as possible. New baseline glomerular filtration rate after partial nephrectomy can have prognostic significance with respect to long-term outcomes. Recent studies provide an increased understanding of the factors that determine functional outcomes after partial nephrectomy as well as preventive measures to minimize functional decline. We review these advances, highlight ongoing controversies and stimulate further research.\nA comprehensive literature review consistent with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) criteria was performed from January 2006 to April 2014 using PubMed\u00ae, Cochrane and Ovid Medline. Key words included partial nephrectomy, renal function, warm ischemia, hypothermia, nephron mass, parenchymal volume, surgical approaches to partial nephrectomy, preoperative and intraoperative imaging, enucleation, hemostatic agents and energy based resection. Relevant reviews were also examined as well as their cited references. An additional Google Scholar search was conducted to broaden the scope of the review. Only English language articles were included in the analysis. The primary outcomes of interest were the new baseline level of function after early postoperative recovery, percent decline in function, potential etiologies and preventive measures.\nDecline in function after partial nephrectomy averages approximately 20% in the operated kidney, and can be due to incomplete recovery from the ischemic insult or loss of nephron mass related to parenchymal excision or collateral damage during reconstruction. Compensatory hypertrophy in the contralateral kidney after partial nephrectomy in adults is marginal and decline in global renal function for patients with 2 kidneys averages about 10%, although there is some variance based on tumor size and location. Irreversible ischemic injury can be minimized by pharmacological intervention or surgical approaches such as hypothermia, limited warm ischemia, or zero or segmental ischemia. Excessive loss of nephron mass can be minimized by improved preoperative or intraoperative imaging, use of a bloodless field, enucleation and vascular microdissection. Hemostatic agents or energy based resection that minimizes the need for parenchymal and capsular suturing can also optimize preservation of the vascularized nephron mass.\nOur understanding of the decline in renal function after partial nephrectomy has advanced considerably, including better appreciation of its magnitude and impact in various settings, possible etiologies and potential preventive measures.

In this study, we report a new function of \u03b4-catenin in lymphangiogenesis. Consistent with expression of \u03b4-catenin in vascular endothelial cells, we detected expression of the gene in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Ectopic expression of \u03b4-catenin in LECs increased cell motility and lymphatic vascular network formation in vitro and lymphangiogenesis in vivo in a Matrigel plug assay. Conversely, knockdown of \u03b4-catenin in LECs impaired lymphangiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical analysis shows that \u03b4-catenin regulates activation of Rho family small GTPases, key mediators in cell motility. \u03b4-catenin activates Rac1 and Cdc42 but inhibits RhoA in LECs. Notably, blocking of Rac1 activation impaired \u03b4-catenin mediated lymphangiogenesis in a Matrigel assay. Consistently, loss of \u03b4-catenin in mice inhibited the growth of tumor metastases.

{"title": "Tissue engineering and regeneration using biodegradable scaffolds.", "abstract": "A number of people across the world suffer from various diseases or genetic defects and many of these patients die because of the lack of the availability of ideal tissue substitute and/or treatment. An important aspect of the disease is its association with the loss of tissue function. Many end-stage diseases and/or complete organ failure often require total or partial organ transplantation to restore functionality. However, such transplantation surgeries are not always successful because of the organ/ tissue rejection and also the scarcity of donors. Regenerative medicine and tissue engineering aim to improve or repair the function of a dysfunctional tissue or organ. In spite of the many advances in tissue engineering methods, the field of regenerative medicine still awaits acceptable designs of bioscaffolds that are clinically tenable. Design of scaffolds and the nature of biomaterial used to make the scaffolds dictate cell behavior and function. Several approaches are currently being tried to optimize the design and improve the quality of the biomaterials. Innervation, vascularization and proper cell differentiation that are influenced by the biomaterials, are few challenges that need to be optimized along with the choice of stem cells that can be employed. Extracellular matrix scaffolds have proven to be a better choice for cartilage and bone repair while the fibrin, polyglycolate and polylactate etc are still being developed.

Vascularization is a key hurdle faced in designing tissue constructs larger than the in vivo limit of oxygen diffusion. In this study, we utilized fibrin-based hydrogels to serve as a foundation for vascular formation, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to modify fibrinogen and increase scaffold longevity, and human amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSC) as a source of vascular cell types (AFSC-EC). AFSC hold great potential for use in regenerative medicine strategies, especially those involving autologous congenital applications, and we have shown previously that AFSC-seeded fibrin-PEG hydrogels have the potential to form three-dimensional vascular-like networks in vitro. We hypothesized that subcutaneously injecting these hydrogels in immunodeficient mice would both induce a fibrin-driven angiogenic host response and promote in situ AFSC-derived neovascularization.

Tissue engineering approaches that employ novel synthetic polymeric scaffolds are being considered for rebuilding the gingival lamina propria lost in the atrophic process. Specifically, polyurethane hydrogels (degradable/polar/hydrophobic/ionic polyurethane [D-PHI]) can enhance the proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and collagen production in a perfusion system. However, few studies have assessed the potential of synthetic block copolyurethanes to initiate blood vessel formation in an in vitro bioreactor system. As the gingival lamina propria is highly vascular, a coculture system of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with HGFs was used in perfused D-PHI scaffolds to determine the feasibility of initiating vascularization. Culture conditions were optimized for driving cocultures toward the desired tissue-engineered construct. HUVEC-HGF coculture in perfused D-PHI scaffolds with a cell seeding density of at least 80,000 cells/scaffold in a 50/50 mix of HUVEC and HGF media (by volume) exhibited enhanced cell growth and increased vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 production, as well as reduced myofibroblast differentiation. A greater fibroblast proportion (seeding ratio of 1:2) in the coculture resulted in HUVEC cluster formations and increased transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and FGF-2 production.

In the present study, the new ruthenium(ii) complexes containing 2,6-bis(benzimidazolyl)pyridine have been identified as potent antiangiogenic agents in vitro and in vivo, through activation of distinct antiangiogenic signaling pathways. Specifically, [Ru(bbp)(p-mpip)Cl]ClO4 (complex , bbp = 2,6-bis(benzimidazolyl)pyridine; p-mpip = 2-(4-methylphenyl)imidazo[4,5-f]-1,10-phenanthroline) exhibited the highest antiangiogenic activity, as evidenced by significant suppression of neovessel formation in chick chorioallantoic membranes and blockage of the angiogenesis in a matrigel plugs assay, which are significantly higher than those of the most accepted anti-metastasis ruthenium-based drug NAMI-A. Generally, these kinds of complexes induced the G0/G1cell cycle by inhibiting the formation of a Cyclin D1/CDK4 complex and CDK2 activation, through up regulation of the expression levels of p15(INK4B), p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1). Moreover, the complexes also triggered intracellular DNA damage, and thus activated the phosphorylation of ATM, ATR, CHK1, Histone and p53. The suppression of Akt and ERK1/2 pathways reinforced the cell cycle perturbation effects of the complexes. Interestingly, complex displayed strong inhibition on the activation of VEGF and VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, which blocked the transmission of the mitogenic signal through Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, and thus enhanced cell cycle arrest. In contrast, we found that the most accepted anti-metastasis ruthenium based drug NAMI-A exerted lower antiangiogenic activity via activation of the DNA damage-mediated pathway, but showed no effects on VEGF and VEGFR-2 phosphorylation.

{"title": "The role of notch in the cardiovascular system: potential adverse effects of investigational notch inhibitors.", "abstract": "Targeting the Notch pathway is a new promising therapeutic approach for cancer patients. Inhibition of Notch is effective in the oncology setting because it causes a reduction of highly proliferative tumor cells and it inhibits survival of cancer stem cells, which are considered responsible for tumor recurrence and metastasis. Additionally, since Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4)-activated Notch signaling is a major modulator of angiogenesis, anti-Dll4 agents are being investigated to reduce vascularization of the tumor. Notch plays a major role in the heart during the development and, after birth, in response to cardiac damage. Therefore, agents used to inhibit Notch in the tumors (gamma secretase inhibitors and anti-Dll4 agents) could potentially affect myocardial repair. The past experience with trastuzumab and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors used for cancer therapy demonstrates that the possible cardiotoxicity of agents targeting shared pathways between cancer and heart and the vasculature should be considered. To date, Notch inhibition in cancer patients has resulted only in mild gastrointestinal toxicity. Little is known about the potential long-term cardiotoxicity associated to Notch inhibition in cancer patients. In this review, we will focus on mechanisms through which inhibition of Notch signaling could lead to cardiomyocytes and endothelial dysfunctions.

{"title": "Three-dimensional functional human myocardial tissues fabricated from induced pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "The most radical treatment currently available for severe heart failure is heart transplantation; however, the number of donor hearts is limited. A better approach is to make human cardiac tissues. We developed an original cell sheet-based tissue-engineering technology to fabricate human cardiac tissue by layering myocardial cell sheets. Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were differentiated into cardiomyocytes to fabricate cardiomyocyte sheets. Initially, three-layer human iPS cardiomyocyte (hiPSCM) sheets were transplanted on subcutaneous tissues of nude rats. Next, to fabricate thicker tissue, three-layer sheets were transplanted on one day, then additional three-layer sheets were transplanted onto them the following day, after the first sheets were vascularized. On day 3, the final three-layer sheets were again transplanted, creating a nine-layer graft (multi-step transplantation procedure). In the last step, six-layer sheets were transplanted on fat tissues of the inguinal portion, which were subsequently resected together with the femoral arteries and veins to make transplantable grafts with connectable vessels. They were then transplanted ectopically to the neck portion of other rats by anastomosing vessels with the host's jugular arteries and veins. Transplanted three-layer hiPSCMs were beating and, histologically, showed a cardiac muscle-like structure with vascular systems. Moreover, transplanted hiPSCMs proliferated and matured in vivo. Significantly thicker tissues were fabricated by a multi-step transplantation procedure. The ectopically transplanted graft survived and continued to beat. We succeeded in fabricating functional human cardiac tissue with cell sheet technology. Transplanting this cardiac tissue may become a new treatment option for severe heart failure.

{"title": "Premature thymic involution is independent of structural plasticity of the thymic stroma.", "abstract": "The thymus is the organ devoted to T-cell production. The thymus undergoes multiple rounds of atrophy and redevelopment before degenerating with age in a process known as involution. This process is poorly understood, despite the influence the phenomenon has on peripheral T-cell numbers. Here we have investigated the FVB/N mouse strain, which displays premature thymic involution. We find multiple architectural and cellular features that precede thymic involution, including disruption of the epithelial-endothelial relationship and a progressive loss of pro-T cells. The architectural features, reminiscent of the human thymus, are intrinsic to the nonhematopoietic compartment and are neither necessary nor sufficient for thymic involution. By contrast, the loss of pro-T cells is intrinsic to the hematopoietic compartment, and is sufficient to drive premature involution. These results identify pro-T-cell loss as the main driver of premature thymic involution, and highlight the plasticity of the thymic stroma, capable of maintaining function across diverse interstrain architectures.", "journal": "European journal of immunology", "date": "2015-01-30", "authors": ["DeanFranckaert", "Susan MSchlenner", "NathalieHeirman", "JasonGill", "GabrielSkogberg", "OlovEkwall", "KarenPut", "Michelle ALinterman", "JamesDooley", "AdrianListon"], "doi": "10.1002/eji.201445277"}
{"title": "Intraoperative fluorescence-based enhanced reality laparoscopic real-time imaging to assess bowel perfusion at the anastomotic site in an experimental model.", "abstract": "Fluorescence videography is a promising technique for assessing bowel perfusion. Fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER) is a novel concept, in which a dynamic perfusion cartogram, generated by computer analysis, is superimposed on to real-time laparoscopic images. The aim of this experimental study was to assess the accuracy of FLER in detecting differences in perfusion in a small bowel resection-anastomosis model.\nA small bowel ischaemic segment was created laparoscopically in 13 pigs. Animals were allocated to having anastomoses performed at either low perfusion (25 per cent; n = 7) or high perfusion (75 per cent; n = 6), as determined by FLER analysis. Capillary lactate levels were measured in blood samples obtained by serosal puncturing in the ischaemic area, resection lines and vascularized areas. Pathological inflammation scoring of the anastomosis was carried out.\nLactate levels in the ischaemic area (mean(s.d.) 5\u00b76(2\u00b78) mmol/l) were higher than those in resection lines at 25 per cent perfusion (3\u00b77(1\u00b77) mmol/l; P = 0\u00b7010) and 75 per cent perfusion (2\u00b79(1\u00b73) mmol/l; P < 0\u00b7001), and higher than levels in vascular zones (2\u00b75(1\u00b70) mmol/l; P < 0\u00b7001). Lactate levels in resection lines with 75 per cent perfusion were lower than those in lines with 25 per cent perfusion (P < 0\u00b7001), and similar to those in vascular zones (P = 0\u00b7188). Levels at resection lines with 25 per cent perfusion were higher than those in vascular zones (P = 0\u00b7001). Mean(s.d.) global inflammation scores were higher in the 25 per cent perfusion group compared with the 75 per cent perfusion group for mucosa/submucosa (2\u00b71(0\u00b74) versus 1\u00b72(0\u00b74); P = 0\u00b7003) and serosa (1\u00b78(0\u00b74) versus 0\u00b78(0\u00b78); P = 0\u00b7014). A ratio of preanastomotic lactate levels in the ischaemic area relative to the resection lines of 2 or less was predictive of a more severe inflammation score.\nIn an experimental model, FLER appeared accurate in discriminating bowel perfusion levels. Surgical relevance Clinical assessment has limited accuracy in evaluating bowel perfusion before anastomosis. Fluorescence videography estimates intestinal perfusion based on the fluorescence intensity of injected fluorophores, which is proportional to bowel vascularization. However, evaluation of fluorescence intensity remains a static and subjective measure. Fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER) is a dynamic fluorescence videography technique integrating near-infrared endoscopy and specific software. The software generates a virtual perfusion cartogram based on time to peak fluorescence, which can be superimposed on to real-time laparoscopic images. This experimental study demonstrates the accuracy of FLER in detecting differences in bowel perfusion in a survival model of laparoscopic small bowel resection-anastomosis, based on biochemical and histopathological data. It is concluded that real-time imaging of bowel perfusion is easy to use and accurate, and should be translated into clinical use.", "journal": "The British journal of surgery", "date": "2015-01-30", "authors": ["MDiana", "VAgnus", "PHalvax", "Y-YLiu", "BDallemagne", "A-ISchlagowski", "BGeny", "PDiemunsch", "VLindner", "JMarescaux"], "doi": "10.1002/bjs.9725"}

The authors sought to develop a simple and effective rabbit model for facial nerve repair and evaluated its advantages over conventional nerve grafts.\nRabbits were divided into three groups consisting of six rabbits each. The central auricular nerve and its nutrient vessels were used as a vascularized graft. Rabbits were grafted with a vascularized facial nerve graft (vascularized nerve graft group), with a free nerve graft (free nerve graft group), or with a vascularized nerve graft and a free nerve graft on each side of the face (vascularized nerve graft/free nerve graft group). Four months after surgery, facial performance and electrophysiologic monitoring were evaluated. The rabbits were then killed to prepare the nerve specimens for histologic, immunohistochemical, and transmission electron microscope study.\nAt 4 months after the facial nerve repair, the functional recovery of the facial nerve was observed and analyzed. The side grafted with vascularized nerve graft was superior to the side grafted with free nerve graft. Regenerated nerve fibers were observed in all groups, and rabbits grafted with vascularized nerve grafts had more regenerated axons than those that underwent free nerve grafting, although the regenerated nerves were not as good as the natural nerves.\nThis study demonstrates that it is feasible to establish a vascularized nerve graft model in rabbits.

{"title": "Targeted protection of donor graft vasculature using a phosphodiesterase inhibitor increases survival and predictability of autologous fat grafts.", "abstract": "Fat grafting is limited by unpredictable long-term graft retention. The authors postulate that injury to the donor-derived microvasculature during harvest and subsequent ischemia may account for this clinical variability. They examined the use of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil citrate to protect graft microvasculature and its role in revascularization and survival.\nInguinal fat of donor Tie2/LacZ mice was infiltrated with sildenafil or saline, harvested, and transplanted onto the dorsa of recipient FVB mice. Additional donor mice were perfused with intraarterial trypsin to inactivate the fat graft microvasculature before harvest and transplantation. Differences in graft revascularization, perfusion, volume of retention, and biochemical changes were assessed.\nSurviving fat grafts were characterized by exclusively donor-derived vasculature inosculating with the recipient circulation at the graft periphery. Inactivation of donor-derived microvasculature decreased early graft perfusion and led to nearly total graft loss by 8 weeks. Sildenafil attenuated vascular ischemic injury, consistent with reductions in VCAM-1 and SDF1\u03b1 expression at 48 hours and 4-fold increases in microvasculature survival by 2 weeks over controls. Compared with controls, targeted sildenafil treatment improved early graft perfusion, doubled graft retention at 12 weeks (83 percent versus 39 percent; p < 0.05), ultimately retaining 64 percent of the original graft volume by 24 weeks (compared to 4 percent; p < 0.05) with superior histologic features.\nFat graft vascularization is critically dependent on maintenance of the donor microvasculature. Sildenafil protects the donor microvasculature during transfer and revascularization, increasing long-term volume retention.

The assessment of tumor progression in patients treated with sorafenib is crucial to help identify potentially-resistant patients, avoiding unnecessary toxicities. Traditional methods to assess tumor progression are based on variations in tumor size and provide unreliable results in patients treated with sorafenib. New methods to assess tumor progression such as the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors or European Association for the Study of Liver criteria are based on imaging to measure the vascularization and tumor volume (viable or necrotic). These however fail especially when the tumor response results in irregular development of necrotic tissue. Newer assessment techniques focus on the evaluation of tumor volume, density or perfusion. Perfusion computed tomography and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced-UltraSound can measure the vascularization of HCC lesions and help predict tumor response to anti-angiogenic therapies. Mean Transit Time is a possible predictive biomarker to measure tumor response. Volumetric techniques are reliable, reproducible and time-efficient and can help measure minimal changes in viable tumor or necrotic tissue, allowing the prompt identification of non-responders.

Surgical success depends not only on revascularization and anatomic restoration but also on functional recovery. A functional finger is mobile and sensible. We report two cases of secondary restoration of the finger pulp's sensibility with Littler's heterodigital neurovascular island flap after a ring avulsion injury. Two patients (47-year-old physiotherapist and 21-year-old student) suffered a degloving injury of the 4th finger on the left hand, classified in Urbaniak class III and Kay-Adani class IVd. The emergency treatment consisted in replantation with suture repair of the ulnar proper palmar digital artery; the nerve was not repaired due to its avulsion from the pulp. Four months later, once the vascularization was stable, restoration of the fingertip's sensibility was done using Littler's heterodigital neurovascular island flap. The 3rd finger's ulnar palmar digital pedicle was dissected using a hemi-Bruner incision. The pedicled flap was brought to the host site after being tunneled through the 4th finger's base. A split skin graft was performed at the donor site. After three years of follow-up, two-point discrimination on the 4th finger's radial pulp was 5mm and cortical integration was satisfactory.

We propose an algorithmic approach to simultaneous VLNT with microvascular breast reconstruction (MBR) and provide early results.\nAll patients who underwent simultaneous VLNT with MBR were included. Postoperative evaluation was performed at standardized time points and included qualitative assessment and quantitative volumetric analysis.\nBetween 2011 and 2013, 29 consecutive patients with refractory lymphedema secondary to breast cancer treatment underwent simultaneous VLNT with MBR. Mean follow-up was 11 months. On average, patients had experienced 3.3 years of lymphedema symptoms with 21 % increased volume in the affected arm compared with the unaffected arm. Using our algorithmic approach, all patients underwent successful breast reconstruction. There were no flap losses, and no patients developed donor site lymphedema. Six patients (21 %) experienced donor site wound complications that resolved with conservative measures; 23 patients (79 %) reported sustained symptomatic improvement after reconstruction. The mean volume differential volumes improved to 20, 19, 14, and 10 % at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after reconstruction, respectively.\nOur algorithm provides a reliable approach to optimizing simultaneous abdominal free flap breast reconstruction and VLNT and demonstrates promising results.

Microarray analysis revealed that ANGPTL7 expression was higher in keratocytes than in dermal fibroblasts. In vitro, inhibiting ANGPTL7 expression by using a specific siRNA led to greater tube formation than did the transfection of cells with a control siRNA, and this increase in tube formation was abolished when recombinant ANGPTL7 protein was added to the cultures.

The inefficient vascularization of tumor tissue also limits the penetration of other serum-derived factors, such as lipids and lipoproteins, which can be rate limiting for cell proliferation and survival. Here we have investigated the effect of hypoxia and serum deprivation on sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity and the expression of lipid metabolism genes in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cancer cells. We found that SREBP transcriptional activity was induced by serum depletion both in normoxic and hypoxic cells and that activation of SREBP was required to maintain the expression of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism genes under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, the enzyme required for the generation of mono-unsaturated fatty acids, and fatty acid-binding protein 7, a regulator of glioma stem cell function, was strongly dependent on SREBP function. Inhibition of SREBP function blocked lipid biosynthesis in hypoxic cancer cells and impaired cell survival under hypoxia and in a three-dimensional spheroid model.

{"title": "The P2X7 receptor is a key modulator of the PI3K/GSK3\u03b2/VEGF signaling network: evidence in experimental neuroblastoma.", "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is an aggressive pediatric tumor, responsible for 15% of cancer-related deaths in childhood, lacking an effective treatment in its advanced stages. The P2X7 receptor for extracellular ATP was associated to NB cell proliferation and recently emerged as a promoter of tumor engraftment, growth and vascularization. In an effort to identify new therapeutic options for neuroblastoma, we studied the role of P2X7 receptor in NB biology. We first analyzed the effect of P2X7 activation or down-modulation of the main biochemical ways involved in NB progression: the PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2/MYCN and the HIF1\u03b1/VEGF pathways. In ACN human NB cells, P2X7 stimulation enhanced PI3K/Akt, while decreasing GSK3\u03b2 activity. In the same model, P2X7 silencing or antagonist administration reduced the activity of PI3K/Akt and increased that of GSK3\u03b2, leading to a decrease in cellular glycogen stores. Similarly, P2X7 downmodulation caused a reduction in HIF1\u03b1 levels and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion. Systemic administration of two different P2X7 antagonists (AZ10606120 or A740003) in nude/nude mice reduced ACN-derived tumor growth. An even stronger effect of P2X7 blockade was obtained in a syngeneic immune-competent neuroblastoma model: Neuro2A cells injected in AlbinoJ mice. Together with tumor regression, treatment with P2X7 antagonists caused downmodulation of the Akt/HIF1\u03b1 axis, leading to reduced VEGF content and decreased vessel formation. Interestingly, in both experimental models, P2X7 antagonists strongly reduced the expression of the probably best-accepted oncogene in NB: MYCN. Finally, we associated P2X7 overexpression with poor prognosis in advanced-stage NB patients. Taken together, our data suggest that P2X7 receptor is an upstream regulator of the main signaling pathways involved in NB growth, metabolic activity and angiogenesis, and a promising therapeutic target for neuroblastoma treatment.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2015-01-27", "authors": ["FAmoroso", "MCapece", "ARotondo", "DCangelosi", "MFerracin", "AFranceschini", "LRaffaghello", "VPistoia", "LVaresio", "EAdinolfi"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2014.444"}
{"title": "17\u03b2-estradiol ameliorates oxygen-induced retinopathy in the early hyperoxic phase.", "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major and leading cause of blindness in premature infants. It has been realized that early treatment for ROP is important. However, all the early treatments of ROP are focusing on peripheral retinal ablation which does not surmount the limit of extinguishing retinal neovascularization and protecting the retinas of children with ROP from the injury of ablation. In this study, we investigated the morphological changes of retina and oxidative stress alterations in the early phase of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and tested the effects of 17\u03b2-estradiol (17\u03b2-E2), a nonselective estrogen receptor (ER) agonist, on early phase OIR development. We found that large central capillary-free areas were induced in the retinas of pups exposed to hyperoxia on postnatal day 9 (P9), whereas vascularization was almost complete in the retinas of pups exposed to normoxia at the same age. The concentrations of malondiadehyde (MDA), an end-product of oxidative stress, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, a major enzyme producing free radicals, as well as the activity of NADPH oxidase were significantly elevated in the retinas of pups exposed to hyperoxia on P9 and postnatal day 13 (P13) compared to those in age matched pups exposed to normoxia. Treatment with 17\u03b2-E2 decreased not only the percentage of the central capillary-free area to total retina area but also the concentrations of MDA and NADPH oxidase as well as the activity of NADPH oxidase in a dose-dependent manner in pups exposed to hyperoxia on p9 and P13. The concentration of VEGF was significantly decreased on P9 but increased on P14 in the retinas of pups exposed to hyperoxia, whereas it was significantly elevated on P9 but decreased on P14 in the retinas of pups treated with 17\u03b2-E2. The effect of 17\u03b2-E2 could be reversed by the co-treatment with ICI182780, a high affinity estrogen receptor antagonist, which suggested that 17\u03b2-E2 might exert its effect on early hyperoxic phase of OIR through estrogen receptor. Our results suggest that treatment with antioxidant drugs at early hyperoxic phase of ROP even before the appearance of retinal neovascularization may be more effective than their application to ROP at late phase, which may abolish the deleterious factors that contribute to retinal neovascularization and promote retinal blood vessels to develop healthily.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2015-01-27", "authors": ["HongbingZhang", "XiaodongWang", "KunXu", "YaoWang", "YaniWang", "XianningLiu", "XianjiaoZhang", "LiangWang", "XiaogangLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.01.052"}

Chondrogenic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has been studied using supplemental and cell-secreted morphogenetic factors. The use of bioreactors enabled insights into the effects of physical forces and controlled oxygen tension. In this study, we investigated the interactive effects of controlled variation of oxygen tension and chondrocyte-secreted morphogenetic factors on chondrogenic differentiation of hESCs in the embryoid body format (hESC-EB). Transient hypoxic culture (2\u00a0weeks at 5\u00a0% O2 followed by 1\u00a0week at 21\u00a0% O2) of hESC-EBs in medium conditioned with primary chondrocytes up-regulated the expression of SOX9 and suppressed pluripotent markers OCT4 and NANOG. Pellets derived from these cells showed significant up-regulation of chondrogenic genes (SOX9, COL2A1, ACAN) and enhanced production of cartilaginous matrix (collagen type II and proteoglycan) as compared to the pellets from hESC-EBs cultured under normoxic conditions. Gene expression profiles corresponded to those associated with native cartilage development, with early expression of N-cadherin (indicator of cell condensation) and late expression of aggrecan (ACAN, indicator of proteoglycan production). When implanted into highly vascularized subcutaneous area in immunocompromised mice for 4\u00a0weeks, pellets remained phenotypically stable and consisted of cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM), without evidence of dedifferentiation or teratoma formation.

{"title": "Dual suppression of estrogenic and inflammatory activities for targeting of endometriosis.", "abstract": "Estrogenic and inflammatory components play key roles in a broad range of diseases including endometriosis, a common estrogen-dependent gynecological disorder in which endometrial tissue creates inflammatory lesions at extrauterine sites, causing pelvic pain and reduced fertility. Current medical therapies focus primarily on reducing systemic levels of estrogens, but these are of limited effectiveness and have considerable side effects. We developed estrogen receptor (ER) ligands, chloroindazole (CLI) and oxabicycloheptene sulfonate (OBHS), which showed strong ER-dependent anti-inflammatory activity in a preclinical model of endometriosis that recapitulates the estrogen dependence and inflammatory responses of the disease in immunocompetent mice and in primary human endometriotic stromal cells in culture. Estrogen-dependent phenomena, including cell proliferation, cyst formation, vascularization, and lesion growth, were all arrested by CLI or OBHS, which prevented lesion expansion and also elicited regression of established lesions, suppressed inflammation, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in the lesions, and interrupted crosstalk between lesion cells and infiltrating macrophages. Studies in ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2 knockout mice indicated that ER\u03b1 is the major mediator of OBHS effectiveness and ER\u03b2 is dominant in CLI actions, implying involvement of both ERs in endometriosis. Neither ligand altered estrous cycling or fertility at doses that were effective for suppression of endometriosis. Hence, CLI and OBHS are able to restrain endometriosis by dual suppression of the estrogen-inflammatory axis. Our findings suggest that these compounds have the desired characteristics of preventive and therapeutic agents for clinical endometriosis and possibly other estrogen-driven and inflammation-promoted disorders.", "journal": "Science translational medicine", "date": "2015-01-23", "authors": ["YuechaoZhao", "PingGong", "YiruChen", "Jerome CNwachukwu", "SathishSrinivasan", "CheMyongKo", "Milan KBagchi", "Robert NTaylor", "Kenneth SKorach", "Kendall WNettles", "John AKatzenellenbogen", "Benita SKatzenellenbogen"], "doi": "10.1126/scitranslmed.3010626"}

The extracts were mixed to reach quantifiable amounts of active compounds identified by high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis. The mixture of extracts was incubated with resting cells of the fungus Beauveria bassiana ATCC 7159. The fermentation promoted the fluidization of the starting dense mixture, while HPLC monitoring evidenced the disappearance of glucogallin from E. officinalis extract and the concomitant increase in gallic acid content. Topical exposure of the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) to the nonfermented extract led to the extensive necrosis and destruction of the treated membrane. However, the fermented extract was shown to be free of any toxicity. Furthermore, compared with the untreated CAM, the fermented sample reduced CAM vascularization, suggesting its antiangiogenic potency. The innocuity of the fermented extract was demonstrated using the in vivo LD50 test, the morphological examination of internal organs of treated rats, as well as the evaluation of blood biomarkers of liver damage (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase).

To develop a potential combination therapy strategy that is capable of overcoming the hypoxia\u2011induced insensitivity to chemotherapy, the HCC cell SMMC\u20117721 was employed to investigate the hypoxia\u2011induced chemoresistance to etoposide. Increased levels of hypoxia\u2011inducible factor\u20111\u03b1 (HIF\u20111\u03b1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were observed when SMMC\u20117721 cells were exposed to hypoxia, and exposure of tumor cells to hypoxia impaired etoposide\u2011induced DNA damage, as indicated by the failure of upregulation of \u03b3HA2X. Etoposide\u2011induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of SMMC\u20117721 was also impaired in hypoxia.

Fourteen days after transplantation, graft hemeangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The frequencies of Th1 cells in regional lymphoid tissue and graft-infiltrating immune cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. Long-term allograft survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves.\nVEGF-trap significantly decreased graft hemangiogenesis as compared to the control group and was most effective in reducing the frequency of graft-infiltrating immune cells.

However, the mechanisms by which anti-VEGF therapy increases survival remain unclear. We evaluated dynamic CT-based vascular parameters and plasma cytokines after bevacizumab alone and after bevacizumab plus chemotherapy with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel in advanced NSCLC patients to explore potential biomarkers of treatment response and resistance to this regimen. Thirty-six patients were enrolled in this study. The primary end point was 6-mo progression-free survival rate, which was 74% (95% CI: 57, 97). This regimen has a promising overall response rate of 36% and median time to progression of 8.5 (6.0, 38.7) mo and overall survival of 12.2 (9.6, 44.1) mo. We found that anti-VEGF therapy led to a sustained increase in plasma PlGF, a potential pharmacodynamic marker. We also found that higher levels of soluble VEGFR1 measured before starting bevacizumab with chemotherapy were associated with worse survival, supporting its potential role as biomarker of treatment resistance. Our imaging biomarker studies indicate that bevacizumab-based treatment-while reducing blood flow, volume, and permeability in the overall population-may be associated with improved survival in patients with improved tumor vasculature and blood perfusion after treatment. This hypothesis-generating study supports the notion that excessively decreasing vascular permeability and pruning/rarefaction after bevacizumab therapy may negatively impact the outcome of combination therapy in NSCLC patients.

The complex geometry of facial bone and the lack of suitable donor tissue often hinders successful repair. One strategy to address both of these difficulties is the development of an in vivo bioreactor, where a tissue flap of suitable geometry can be orthotopically grown within the same patient requiring reconstruction. Our group has previously designed such an approach using tissue chambers filled with morcellized bone autograft as a scaffold to autologously generate tissue with a predefined geometry. However, this approach still required donor tissue for filling the tissue chamber. With the recent advances in biodegradable synthetic bone graft materials, it may be possible to minimize this donor tissue by replacing it with synthetic ceramic particles. In addition, these flaps have not previously been transferred to a mandibular defect.

{"title": "Pore Interconnectivity Influences Growth Factor-Mediated Vascularization in Sphere-Templated Hydrogels.", "abstract": "Rapid and controlled vascularization within biomaterials is essential for many applications in regenerative medicine. The extent of vascularization is influenced by a number of factors, including scaffold architecture. While properties such as pore size and total porosity have been studied extensively, the importance of controlling the interconnectivity of pores has received less attention. A sintering method was used to generate hydrogel scaffolds with controlled pore interconnectivity. Poly(methyl methacrylate) microspheres were used as a sacrificial agent to generate porous poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate hydrogels with interconnectivity varying based on microsphere sintering conditions. Interconnectivity levels increased with sintering time and temperature with resultant hydrogel structure showing agreement with template structure. Porous hydrogels with a narrow pore size distribution (130-150\u2009\u03bcm) and varying interconnectivity were investigated for their ability to influence vascularization in response to gradients of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). A rodent subcutaneous model was used to evaluate vascularized tissue formation in the hydrogels in vivo. Vascularized tissue invasion varied with interconnectivity. At week 3, higher interconnectivity hydrogels had completely vascularized with twice as much invasion. Interconnectivity also influenced PDGF-BB transport within the scaffolds. An agent-based model was used to explore the relative roles of steric and transport effects on the observed results. In conclusion, a technique for the preparation of hydrogels with controlled pore interconnectivity has been developed and evaluated.

Herein, we studied the role of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily in EC differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) induced by Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8 signaling. MSCs that had been sorted by flow cytometry as CD31-negative were cultured for 14 days in medium supplemented with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) as the control. The Smad2/3 pathway was activated by TGF-\u03b21 and Smad1/5/8 by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). In the early phase in the Smad2/3-activated group, there were 10% CD31-positive cells, which was significantly higher than in the control group. A low Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation level after BMP4 activation doubled the number of CD31-positive cells, while a higher phosphorylation level after BMP9 activation showed no effect. A Smad2/3 inhibitor initially blocked differentiation but later promoted it, while a Smad1/5/8 inhibitor reversed the induction observed with BMPs. Moreover, the positive effects of R-Smad on differentiation were weakened by the VEGF neutralizing antibody, and a Smad3 inhibitor decreased VEGF expression and blocked differentiation in both the early and late phases. In conclusion, differentiation of ECs from MSCs via Smad2/3 signaling is stage dependent. Activation, particularly by Smad3, significantly promotes differentiation at an early phase but later is suppressive.

In this study, vascularized adipose tissue constructs were generated using uncultured cells from the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue as an alternative cell source to adipose-derived stem cells. SVF cell behavior and tissue formation were compared in a stable fibrin formulation developed by our group and a commercial fibrin sealant (TissuCol; Baxter) upon direct subcutaneous implantation in a nude mouse model. Further, the effect of in vitro adipogenic induction on SVF cell development was investigated by implanting stable fibrin constructs after 1 week of precultivation (adipogenic vs. noninduced control). Constructs were thoroughly analyzed before implantation regarding adipogenic differentiation status, cell viability, and distribution as well as the presence of endothelial cells. Before implantation, in vitro precultivation strongly promoted adipogenesis (under adipogenic conditions) and the formation of CD31(+) prevascular structures by SVF cells (under nonadipogenic conditions). Tissue development in vivo was determined after 4 weeks by histology (hematoxylin and eosin, human vimentin) and quantified histomorphometrically. In stable fibrin gels, adipogenic precultivation was superior to noninduced conditions, resulting in mature adipocytes and the formation of distinct vascular structures of human origin in vivo. Strong neovascularization by the implanted cells predominated in noninduced constructs. Without pretreatment, the SVF in stable fibrin gels displayed only a weak differentiation capability. In contrast, TissuCol gels strongly supported the formation of coherent and well-vascularized adipose tissue of human origin, displaying large unilocular adipocytes. The developed native-like tissue architecture was highlighted by a whole mount staining technique.

{"title": "Matching for Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) in corneal transplantation - to do or not to do.", "abstract": "As many patients with severe corneal disease are not even considered as candidates for a human graft due to their high risk of rejection, it is essential to find ways to reduce the chance of rejection. One of the options is proper matching of the cornea donor and recipient for the Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA), a subject of much debate. Currently, patients receiving their first corneal allograft are hardly ever matched for HLA and even patients undergoing a regraft usually do not receive an HLA-matched graft. While anterior and posterior lamellar grafts are not immune to rejection, they are usually performed in low risk, non-vascularized cases. These are the cases in which the immune privilege due to the avascular status and active immune inhibition is still intact. Once broken due to infection, sensitization or trauma, rejection will occur. There is enough data to show that when proper DNA-based typing techniques are being used, even low risk perforating corneal transplantations benefit from matching for HLA Class I, and high risk cases from HLA Class I and probably Class II matching. Combining HLA class I and class II matching, or using the HLAMatchmaker could further improve the effect of HLA matching. However, new techniques could be applied to reduce the chance of rejection. Options are the local or systemic use of biologics, or gene therapy, aiming at preventing or suppressing immune responses.

Compared to autograft, vascularization and remodeling of the fusion mass are delayed using allograft. Allogenous bone and demineralized bone matrix (DBM) possess limited osteoinductive properties and carry the risk of potential infectious disease transmission. Plasma-rich plasma (PRP) and bone marrow aspirate are commonly used in conjunction with an osteoconductive carrier materials. On-label use of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) is currently restricted to mono- and bisegmental anterior lumbar fusion. The fusion rates obtained with BMPs match those of autologous bone graft. Potential risks of rhBMP in clinical use include soft tissue reactions, radiculitis and potentially increased risk of cancer. Osteoconductive ceramics (HA, CC, CS, \u00df-TCP) are useful graft extenders and carriers for bone growth enhancers and antibiotics.\nOsteoconductive bioceramics with different mechanical and biological properties are available for use as graft extenders. In a defined group of anterior interbody fusion procedures (ACDF, ALIF), satisfactory fusion rates (>\u200990%) may be obtained with exclusive use of graft extenders, whereas their solitary use in posterolateral fusions is not advisable.

Maintaining patency of channels in contact with blood is an important issue in the development of a functional vascular network. Endothelium is the only known completely non-thrombogenic material; however, results from treatments to induce endothelialization are inconclusive. The present study was designed to evaluate the clinical applicability of in situ recruitment of endothelial cells/endothelial progenitor cells (EC/EPC) and pre-endothelization using a recombinant mussel adhesive protein fused with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide (MAP-RGD) coating in a model of vascular graft implantation. Microporous polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds were fabricated with salt leaching methods and their surfaces were modified with collagen and MAP-RGD. We then evaluated their anti-thrombogenicity with an in vitro hemocompatibility assessment and a 4-week implantation in the rabbit carotid artery. We observed that MAP-RGD coating reduced the possibility of early in vivo graft failure and enhanced re-endothelization by in situ recruitment of EC/EPC (patency rate: 2/3), while endothelization prior to implantation aggravated the formation of thrombosis and/or IH (patency rate: 0/3). The results demonstrated that in situ recruitment of EC/EPC by MAP-RGD could be a promising strategy for vascular applications. In addition, it rules out several issues associated with pre-endothelization, such as cell source, purity, functional modulation and contamination.

Development of new biomaterials with suitable biocompatibility and seal has changed the attitudes towards preserving the reversible pulp in cariously exposed teeth. Before exposure and irreversible involvement of the pulp, indirect pulp capping (IPC) is the treatment of choice, but after the spread of inflammation within the pulp chamber and establishment of irreversible pulpitis, removal of inflamed pulp tissue is recommended. In this review, new concepts in preservation of the healthy pulp tissue in deciduous teeth and induction of the reparative dentin formation with new biomaterials instead of devitalization and the consequent destruction of vital tissues are discussed.", "journal": "Iranian endodontic journal", "date": "2015-01-20", "authors": ["ImanParisay", "JamilehGhoddusi", "MaryamForghani"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Activated endothelial cells limit inflammatory response, but increase chemoattractant potential and bacterial clearance by human monocytes.", "abstract": "Inflammation is the normal immune response of vascularized tissues to damage and bacterial products, for which leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM) is critical. The effects of cell-to-cell contact seen in both leukocyte and endothelial cells include cytoskeleton rearrangement, and dynamic expression of adhesion molecules and metalloproteinases. TEM induces expression of anti-apoptotic molecules, costimulatory molecules associated with antigen presentation, and pattern recognition receptors (PRR), such as TLR-4, in monocytes. However, little is known about how TLR-4 increment operates in monocytes during an inflammatory response. To understand it better, we used an in vitro model in which monocytes crossed a layer of IL-1\u03b2 stimulated Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC). After TEM, monocytes were tested for the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, their phenotype (CD14, CD16, TLR-4 expression), and TLR-4 canonical [Nuclear Factor kappa B, (NF-\u03baB) pathway] and non-canonical [p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 pathway] signal transduction induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Phagocytosis and bacterial clearance were also measured. There was diminished secretion of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) and higher secretion of chemokines (CXCL8/IL-8 and CCL2/MCP-1) in supernatant of TEM monocytes. These changes were accompanied by increases in TLR-4, CD14 (surfaces expression), p38, and ERK1/2 phosphorylated cytoplasmic forms, without affecting NF-\u03baB activation. It also increased bacterial clearance after TEM by an O2 -independent mechanism. The data suggest that interaction between endothelial cells and monocytes fine-tunes the inflammatory response and promotes bacterial elimination.", "journal": "Cell biology international", "date": "2015-01-20", "authors": ["IsmaelMancilla-Herrera", "Jos\u00e9 AntonioAlvarado-Moreno", "ArturoC\u00e9rbulo-V\u00e1zquez", "Jessica LPrieto-Ch\u00e1vez", "EduardoFerat-Osorio", "ConstantinoL\u00f3pez-Mac\u00edas", "SergioEstrada-Parra", "ArmandoIsibasi", "LourdesArriaga-Pizano"], "doi": "10.1002/cbin.10440"}

During embryonic development, Apelin (APLN) is robustly expressed in vascular ECs. In adult mice, however, APLN expression in the vasculature is significantly reduced. Here we show that APLN expression is reactivated in adult ECs after ischaemia insults. In models of both injury ischaemia and tumor angiogenesis, we find that Apln-CreER genetically labels sprouting but not quiescent vasculature. By leveraging this specific activity, we demonstrate that abolishment of the VEGF-VEGFR2 signalling pathway as well as ablation of sprouting ECs diminished tumour vascularization and growth without compromising vascular homeostasis in other organs. Collectively, we show that Apln-CreER distinguishes sprouting vessels from stabilized vessels in multiple pathological settings.

In order to avoid this, we modified the classical surgical technique: (1) through the preservation of the vascular pedicles during muscle recession and (2) if necessary, through a plication (instead of a resection) of the ipsilateral antagonist muscle. The objective to be achieved is thus the resolution of the diplopia without ischemic complications.\nWe report a prospective series of 10 patients with dysthyroid ophthalmopathy, causing strabismic diplopia, all operated on by the same surgeon (BR) after at least 12 months of euthyroidism. Data collection included: history of previous decompressive surgery, surgical procedure, and oculomotor status before and after surgery.\nTen patients (8 females), aged 51 to 74 years (mean age, 58.00 \u00b1 7.62 years), were collected between 2008 and 2012. All patients had one or more vascular risk factors (diabetes, smoking, obesity, high blood pressure). With a follow-up from 16 to 67 months (mean \u00b1 SD 27.7 months \u00b1 14.87), surgical outcomes were excellent: diplopia was cured in all cases, with recovery of stereoscopic vision. We had no operative or postoperative complications.\nThe technique of preservation of the anterior ciliary vascularization, which is particularly justified for these fragile patients, is compatible with moderate muscle recessions. For larger deviations, in which a larger recession might increase the proptosis, it is possible to add a plication of the ipsilateral antagonist.

If circulating cells are involved in tumor aggressiveness and metastasis, then cell levels should decline upon tumor removal in localized cancer patients, but remain high in metastatic patients. Accordingly, proposed biomarkers CD117/c-kit, CD133, CXCR4/CD184, and CD34-positive cell percentages in the blood of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for localized cancer were assessed by flow cytometry prior to intervention and 1-3 months postoperatively.

Notably, postoperative CD117\u207a levels did not decrease in patients experiencing biochemical recurrence. In a xenograft model, CD117-enriched tumors were more vascularized and aggressive.

{"title": "Effect of living cellular sheets on the angiogenic potential of human microvascular endothelial cells.", "abstract": "A fundamental issue limiting the efficacy of surgical approaches designed to correct periodontal mucogingival defects is that new tissues rely on limited sources of blood supply from the adjacent recipient bed. Accordingly, therapies based on tissue engineering that leverage local self-healing potential may represent promising alternatives for the treatment of mucogingival defects by inducing local vascularization. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of commercially available living cellular sheets (LCS) on the angiogenic potential of neonatal dermal human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-dNeo).\nThe effect of LCS on HMVEC-dNeo proliferation, migration, capillary tube formation, gene expression, and production of angiogenic factors was evaluated over time.\nLCS positively influenced HMVEC-dNeo proliferation and migration. Moreover, HMVEC-dNeo incubated with LCS showed transcriptional profiles different from those of untreated cells. Whereas increased expression of angiogenic genes predominated early on in response to LCS, late-phase responses were characterized by up- and downregulation of angiostatic and angiogenic genes. However, this trend was not confirmed at the protein level, as LCS induced increased production of most of the angiogenic factors tested (i.e., epidermal growth factor [EGF], heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, interleukin 6, angiopoietin, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, placental growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor) throughout the investigational period. Finally, although LCS induced HMVEC-dNeo proliferation, migration, and expression of angiogenic factors, additional factors and environmental pressures are likely to be required to promote the development of complex, mesh-like vascular structures.\nLCS favor initial mechanisms that govern angiogenesis but failed to enhance or accelerate HMVEC-dNeo morphologic transition to complex vascular structures.", "journal": "Journal of periodontology", "date": "2015-01-17", "authors": ["Cristina CVillar", "Xiang RZhao", "Carolina BLivi", "David LCochran"], "doi": "10.1902/jop.2015.140362"}

In order to evaluate the diagnostic significance of intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound in assessing the resection degree of brain glioma by transmission electron microscopic (TEM) examination, it is important to have specific knowledge about contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Methods : Ultrasound contrast was applied in operations of 120 cases of brain glioma, to evaluate the degree of tumor resection. Biopsy tissues were obtained the suspicious residual tumors surrounding the tumor cavity. The sensitivity and specificity of the residual tumors were determined by the intraoperative ultrasound contrast according to TEM examination results.\nThere were 44 cases of low-grade gliomas and 76 cases of high-grade gliomas. Three hundred and sixty biopsy tissues were obtained. The sensitivity of intraoperative ultrasound contrast in diagnosing the residual tumor was 62.2%, while the specificity degree of it was 92.8%. The consistency coefficient of the ultrasound contrast diagnosis and TEM examination results was 0.584 (Kappa = 0.584), which was between 0.4 and 0.6, therefore it was of medium consistency. Conclusions : Intraoperative ultrasound contrast was of a high sensitivity and specificity in evaluating the excision degree of tumor. The consistency of the residual tumor rate detected, respectively, by ultrasound contrast and TEM examination was of medium consistency.

Herein, we review the various vascular clamping techniques employed during minimally invasive partial nephrectomy, describe the evolution of our partial nephrectomy technique and provide an update on contemporary thinking about the impact of ischemia on renal function.\nRecently, partial nephrectomy surgical technique has shifted away from main artery clamping and towards minimizing/eliminating global renal ischemia during partial nephrectomy. Supported by high-fidelity three-dimensional imaging, novel anatomic-based partial nephrectomy techniques have recently been developed, wherein partial nephrectomy can now be performed with segmental, minimal or zero global ischemia to the renal remnant. Sequential innovations have included early unclamping, segmental clamping, super-selective clamping and now culminating in anatomic zero-ischemia surgery. By eliminating 'under-the-gun' time pressure of ischemia for the surgeon, these techniques allow an unhurried, tightly contoured tumour excision with point-specific sutured haemostasis. Recent data indicate that zero-ischemia partial nephrectomy may provide better functional outcomes by minimizing/eliminating global ischemia and preserving greater vascularized kidney volume.\nContemporary partial nephrectomy includes a spectrum of surgical techniques ranging from conventional-clamped to novel zero-ischemia approaches.

The samples were classified into five grades based on immunostaining: no staining, no significant staining, mild, moderate or marked staining.\nExpression of MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-3 was mostly low in both functioning and non-functioning blebs. However, immunostaining of MMP-9 was marked in samples taken from functioning GDIs and correlated with the presence of vascular profiles in the luminal bleb. CD31 immunoreactivity was more intense in the outer layers of the bleb than in the inner layers. In non-functioning blebs, immunoreactivity for TIMP-3 was significant through the whole bleb wall, but only mild in the inner zone of functioning blebs.

In avascular bleb wall, increased expression of TIMP-3 suggests its potential role in the inhibition of angiogenesis as reported previously in vivo.

Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) have been implicated in tumor recurrence and confer resistance to anti-cancer therapy treatment. In this study, we have characterized genes that are modulated in HNSCC-CSCs and can be targeted in future as potential therapeutics. CSCs were isolated from HNSCC cells (oralspheres) and examined for tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice. We observed aggressive tumor growth with oralspheres as compared to parental cells. The CSC-derived tumors were grossly extremely vascularized and expressed VEGFR1. We next analyzed the molecular determinant of oralspheres. In addition to CD133 and Nanog, we observed significant higher expression of Notch1 protein in the oralspheres. There was differential expression of angiogenesis and invasive marker genes such as angiopoietin1, integrin \u03b23, MMP9 and THBS1.

Such strategies mimic cartilage template formation or vascularization that occur during endochondral ossification during early fetal development. However, although both chondrogenesis and vascularization are crucial precursors for bone formation by endochondral ossification, no in vitro bone tissue regeneration strategy has sought to incorporate both events simultaneously. The objective of this study is to develop an in vitro bone regeneration strategy that mimics critical aspects of the endochondral ossification process, specifically (1) the formation of a cartilage template and (2) subsequent vascularization of this template. We initially prime the MSCs with chondrogenic growth factors, to ensure the production of a cartilage template, and subsequently implement a coculture strategy involving MSC and HUVECs. Three experimental groups were compared; (1) CP for 21 days with no addition of cells; (2) CP for 21 days followed by coculture of HUVECs (250,000 cells); (3) CP for 21 days followed by coculture of HUVECs and MSCs (250,000 cells) at a ratio of 1:1. Each group was cultured for a further 21 days in osteogenic media after the initial CP period. Biochemical (DNA, Alkaline Phosphatase Activity, Calcium, and Vessel Endothelial Growth Factor) and histological analyses (Alcian blue, alizarin red, CD31(+), and collagen type X) were performed 1, 2, and 3 weeks after the media switch. The results of this study show that CP provides a cartilage-like template that provides a suitable platform for HUVEC and MSC cells to attach, proliferate, and infiltrate for up to 3 weeks. More importantly we show that the use of the coculture methodology, rudimentary vessels are formed within this cartilage template and enhanced the mineralization potential of MSCs.

Our previous studies revealed that FMOD deficiency led to marked alterations in adult wound healing characterized by delayed dermal cell migration, postponed wound closure, and increased scar formation, all accompanied by impeded angiogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to reveal the effect of FMOD on angiogenesis during the wound-healing process.\nIn vivo angiogenic effects of FMOD were assessed by a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay, a Matrigel (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) plug implant assay, and rodent primary closure wound models. In vitro angiogenic effects of FMOD were recorded by cell invasion and dimensional and topological parameters of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.\nWe provided evidence that FMOD significantly enhanced vascularization: first, FMOD boosted blood vessel formation on the chorioallantoic membrane; second, FMOD markedly stimulated capillary infiltration into Matrigel plugs subcutaneously implanted in adult mice; and finally, FMOD robustly promoted angiogenesis in multiple adult rodent cutaneous wound models. Furthermore, FMOD administration restored the vascularity of fmod (-/-) mouse wounds. In support of this, FMOD endorsed an angiogenesis-favored microenvironment in adult rodent wounds not only by upregulating angiogenic genes but also by downregulating angiostatic genes. In addition, FMOD significantly enhanced human umbilical vein endothelial cell invasion and tube-like structure formation in vitro.\nAltogether, we demonstrated that in addition to reducing scar formation, FMOD also promotes angiogenesis.

This review focuses on the effects of insulin therapy on fetoplacental vasculature in gestational diabetes mellitus and the potentiating effects of adenosine on this therapy. What advances does it highlight? This review highlights recent studies exploring a potential functional link between insulin receptors and their dependence on adenosine receptor activation (insulin-adenosine axis) to restore placental endothelial function in gestational diabetes mellitus. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a disease that occurs during pregnancy and is associated with maternal and fetal hyperglycaemia. Women with GDM are treated via diet to control their glycaemia; however, a proportion of these patients do not achieve the recommended values of glycaemia and are subjected to insulin therapy until delivery. Even if a diet-treated GDM pregnancy leads to normal maternal and newborn glucose levels, fetoplacental vascular dysfunction remains evident. Thus, control of glycaemia via diet does not prevent GDM-associated fetoplacental vascular and metabolic alterations. We review the available information regarding insulin therapy in the context of its potential consequences for fetoplacental vascular function in GDM. We propose the possibility that insulin therapy to produce normoglycaemia in the mother and newborn may require additional therapeutic measures to restore the normal metabolic condition of the vascular network in GDM. A role for A1 and A2A adenosine receptors and insulin receptors A and B as well as a potential functional link in the cell signalling associated with the activation of these receptors is proposed. This possibility could be helpful for the planning of strategies, including adenosine receptor-improved insulin therapy, for the treatment of GDM patients, thereby promoting the wellbeing of the growing fetus, newborn and mother.", "journal": "Experimental physiology", "date": "2015-01-13", "authors": ["LuisSobrevia", "Roc\u00edoSalsoso", "TamaraS\u00e1ez", "CarlosSanhueza", "Fabi\u00e1nPardo", "AndreaLeiva"], "doi": "10.1113/expphysiol.2014.082743"}

Based on the Alnot classification, there were 16 stage IIA non-unions (12 in zone 3 and 4 in zone 2 according to the Schernberg classification) and 22 stage IIB non-unions (9 in zone 3 and 13 in zone 2). The time elapsed between the initial trauma and the surgical treatment was 10 months on average. Percutaneous retrograde fixation was performed with a cannulated 2.7mm compression screw. At 25 months follow-up, 31 of the non-union cases had healed (81.6%), of which 14 were stage IIA (87.5%) and 17 were stage IIB (77.3%), after an average 6.3 months. Average pain was 1.6. The average Quick DASH was 17.3/100. Compared to the opposite side, the average range of motion was 84.8% in flexion, 84.7% in extension, 98.9% in pronation, 96.5% in supination, 96.8% in ulnar deviation and 86.4% in radial deviation. The grip strength was 80.4% of the contralateral side. Seven patients did not heal after screw fixation; four of them healed after additional electromagnetic stimulation and three after addition of a vascularized bone graft. Based on this study's results, stage IIA non-unions can heal with simple retrograde percutaneous screw fixation. The same procedure could be enough for stage IIB non-union cases, however we recommend adding a cancellous bone graft by arthroscopy.

Several etiology-related hypotheses have been made to explain these ruptures. The one most commonly accepted is necrosis at the musculotendinous junction of the EPL, which is compressed between the extensor retinaculum and dorsal aspect of the radius. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed an anatomical study to show the close relationship between the extensor retinaculum and the musculotendinous junction of the EPL muscle. We calculated the distance between the musculotendinous junction of the various finger extensor muscles and the proximal edge of the extensor retinaculum. We were able to show that this junction is located under the extensor retinaculum for the extensor indicis (EI) and EPL muscles, but the latter is in the third extensor compartment, which is a tight, confined space. Any pressure increase in this space following trauma, for example, can bring about compartment syndrome at this musculotendinous junction, which some authors have found to be poorly vascularized.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2015-01-13", "authors": ["DLepage", "LTatu", "FLoisel", "FVuillier", "BParratte"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-015-1417-8"}

Even though the central part of the articular disc is avascular, potential regeneration of lesions could be detected. The Palmer and Atzei classifications of TFCC lesions are complementary. TFCC innervation is based on different nerves. There is a high variability. A diligent clinical examination facilitates specific tests which help to allocate symptoms to the pathology. Therefore, a thorough clinical examination is not dispensable. Wrist arthroscopy remains the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing TFCC pathologies despite technical progress in imaging modalities.

The purposes of this study were (1) to develop a model to study nonvascularized and vascularized calvarial grafts as well as (2) to compare effects of bone graft vascularity on calvarial healing. Bilateral calvarial defects were created in 26 Wistar rats. The defects were left empty within 1 parietal region. On the contralateral side, the defects were partially closed with native parietal bone (control group, n = 6), nonvascularized (N-V, n = 10), or vascularized bone grafts (VAS, n = 10). The vascularized grafts were supplied by perforating dural arterioles. Bone mineralization and healing patterns from serial microcomputed tomographic scans were compared within and across the groups using parametric and nonparametric tests. Differences in bone mineral content across sides were significant between the groups at weeks 6 (P = 0.016) and 12 (P = 0.025). Bone formation was greater within both the control and VAS groups versus the N-V group at weeks 6 and 12 (P < 0.05). Healing patterns differed between the groups (P < 0.05), progressing through islands of new bone formation within the control and VAS groups while limited to defect margins on the N-V graft side. In conclusion, a bilateral calvarial defect model was established to study bone graft vascularity.

As a negative regulator, Sox9 is essentially downregulated in terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes. However, the underlying mechanism of Sox9 silencing is undefined. Here we show that the zinc finger protein Zbtb20 regulates the terminal differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes by repressing Sox9. In the developing skeleton of the mouse, Zbtb20 protein is highly expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes from late embryonic stages. To determine its physiological role in endochondral ossification, we have generated chondrocyte-specific Zbtb20 knockout mice and demonstrate that disruption of Zbtb20 in chondrocytes results in delayed endochondral ossification and postnatal growth retardation. Zbtb20 deficiency caused a delay in cartilage vascularization and an expansion of the hypertrophic zone owing to reduced expression of Vegfa in the hypertrophic zone. Interestingly, Sox9, a direct suppressor of Vegfa expression, was ectopically upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in the late Zbtb20-deficient hypertrophic zone. Furthermore, knockdown of Sox9 greatly increased Vegfa expression in Zbtb20-deficient hypertrophic chondrocytes.

Human fetal liver cells were cultured in bioreactors configured to provide either perfusion or diffusion conditions. Metabolic activities of the cultures were monitored daily by measuring glucose consumption and lactate production. Cell viability during culture was analyzed by lactate dehydrogenase activity. Hepatic functionality was determined by the release of albumin and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in culture medium samples. After 4 days of culture, cells were analyzed for the expression of a variety of endothelial, hepatic, and hematopoietic genes, as well as the surface marker expression of CD31 and CD34 in flow cytometry. We found that medium perfusion increased the gene expression of endothelial markers such as CD31, von Willebrand factor (vWF), CD140b, CD309, and CD144 while decreasing the gene expression of the erythrocyte-surface marker CD235a. Hepatic differentiation was promoted under perfusion conditions as demonstrated by lower AFP and higher albumin secretion compared with cultures not exposed to medium perfusion. Additionally, cultures exposed to medium perfusion gave higher rates of glucose consumption and lactate production, indicating increased metabolic activity.

One approach to mitigate the undesired FBR is to develop an implant capable of releasing anti-inflammatory molecules in a sustained manner over a long time period. Implants causing inflammation are also more susceptible to infection. In this article, the in vivo biocompatibility of a novel, biodegradable salicylic acid releasing polyester (SAP) has been investigated by subcutaneous implantation in a mouse model. The tissue response to SAP was compared with that of a widely used biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), as a control over three time points: 2, 4, and 16 weeks postimplantation. A long-term in vitro study illustrates a continuous, linear (zero order) release of salicylic acid with a cumulative mass percent release rate of 7.34 \u00d7 10(-4) h(-1) over \u223c1.5-17 months. On the basis of physicochemical analysis, surface erosion for SAP and bulk erosion for PLGA have been confirmed as their dominant degradation modes in vivo. On the basis of the histomorphometrical analysis of inflammatory cell densities and collagen distribution as well as quantification of proinflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2), a reduced foreign body response toward SAP with respect to that generated by PLGA has been unambiguously established. The favorable in vivo tissue response to SAP, as manifest from the uniform and well-vascularized encapsulation around the implant, is consistent with the decrease in inflammatory cell density and increase in angiogenesis with time.

{"title": "Mouse model of CADASIL reveals novel insights into Notch3 function in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.", "abstract": "Could impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis be a relevant mechanism underlying CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)? Memory symptoms in CADASIL, the most common hereditary form of vascular dementia, are usually thought to be primarily due to vascular degeneration and white matter lacunes. Since adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a process essential for the integration of new spatial memory occurs in a highly vascularized niche, we considered dysregulation of adult neurogenesis as a potential mechanism for the manifestation of dementia in CADASIL. Analysis in aged mice overexpressing Notch3 with a CADASIL mutation, revealed vascular deficits in arteries of the hippocampal fissure but not in the niche of the dentate gyrus. At 12 months of age, cell proliferation and survival of newborn neurons were reduced not only in CADASIL mice but also in transgenic controls overexpressing wild type Notch3. At 6 months, hippocampal neurogenesis was altered in CADASIL mice independent of overt vascular abnormalities in the fissure. Further, we identified Notch3 expression in hippocampal precursor cells and maturing neurons in vivo as well as in cultured hippocampal precursor cells. Overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that Notch3 signaling negatively regulated precursor cell proliferation. Notch3 overexpression also led to deficits in KCl-induced precursor cell activation. This suggests a cell-autonomous effect of Notch3 signaling in the regulation of precursor proliferation and activation and a loss-of-function effect in CADASIL. Consequently, besides vascular damage, aberrant precursor cell proliferation and differentiation due to Notch3 dysfunction might be an additional independent mechanism for the development of hippocampal dysfunction in CADASIL.", "journal": "Neurobiology of disease", "date": "2015-01-04", "authors": ["FannyEhret", "SteffenVogler", "SherinPojar", "David AElliott", "FrankBradke", "BarbaraSteiner", "GerdKempermann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nbd.2014.12.018"}
{"title": "Increased glucocerebrosidase expression and activity in preeclamptic placenta.", "abstract": "Lysosomal glucosidase beta acid (GBA) deficiency is inherent to Gaucher disease, Parkinsonism and Lewy-body dementia. Increased GBA expression has never been associated with human disease. We describe increased GBA expression and activity in placenta from preeclamptic pregnancies.\n112 placenta biopsies were available for qPCR, analysis of GBA gene expression and activity. Microanalysis was performed on 20 placenta samples. Alternatively spliced placental GBA transcripts were cloned, expressed in HEK293 cells and analyzed by Western blot and activity assay.\nGBA is expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer of human placenta already at 5 weeks of gestation. We identified five novel GBA transcripts in placenta that enzymatically inactive when expressed in HEK293 cells. Both GBA RNA expression and enzymatic activity are upregulated in preeclamptic placenta. Microarray analysis of 20 placenta tissues identified 158 genes co-regulating with GBA expression and gene enrichment analysis highlights lysosomal function. In our micro-array data GBA expression does not correlate with FLT1 expression, currently the most powerful marker for preeclampsia. There are 89 transcripts that are negatively correlated with GBA expression of which BMP4 and TFEB are interesting as they are essential to early placenta function.\nAlthough very speculative, we hypothesize that increased GBA expression might relate to placentation through decreased BMP4 signaling or vascularization through downregulation of TFEB. Ceramide, the product of hydrolysis of glucosylceramide by GBA and involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, survival and apoptosis, is another putative candidate linking increased GBA activity to preeclampsia.

{"title": "The Potential Role of Lysosomal Sequestration in Sunitinib Resistance of Renal Cell Cancer.", "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a highly vascularized tumor type, which is often associated with inactivated mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau gene that drives proangiogenic signaling pathways. As such, new therapies for the treatment of RCC have largely been focused on blocking angiogenesis. Sunitinib, an antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the most frequently used first-line drug for the treatment of RCC. Although treatment with sunitinib improves patient outcome considerably, acquired resistance will emerge in all cases. The molecular mechanisms of resistance to sunitinib are poorly understood, but in the past decade, several of these have been proposed. Lysosomal sequestration of sunitinib was reported as a potential resistance mechanism to sunitinib. In this review, the underlying molecular mechanisms of lysosomal sunitinib sequestration and the potential strategies to overcome this resistance are discussed to be able to further improve the treatment of RCC.", "journal": "Journal of kidney cancer and VHL", "date": "2015-01-01", "authors": ["KaamarAzijli", "Kristy JGotink", "Henk M WVerheul"], "doi": "10.15586/jkcvhl.2015.44\n10.1016/j.eururo.2014.10.002\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2005.07.009\n10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70240\u20132\n10.1038/onc.2015.343\n10.1038/ng0594-85\n10.1634/theoncologist.2012-0044\n10.1038/nbt1068\n10.1038/nbt1358\n10.1200/JCO.2005.02.2574\n10.1016/j.bbcan.2014.11.002\n10.1124/dmd.112.050054\n10.1007/s13402-015-0218-8\n10.1371/journal.pone.0114787\n10.1038/emboj.2012.32\n10.1002/1097\u20134652(200008)184:2<263::AID-JCP15>3.0.CO;2-F\n10.1158/1535\u20137163.MCT-13\u20130084\n10.1002/cncr.26429\n10.1038/cddis.2015.4"}

Cardiac tissue engineering aims to replace the infarcted tissues with functional engineered heart muscles or revitalize the infarcted heart by delivering cells, bioactive factors, and/or biomaterials. One major challenge of cardiac tissue engineering and regeneration is the establishment of functional perfusion and structure to achieve timely angiogenesis and effective vascularization, which are essential to the survival of thick implants and the integration of repaired tissue with host heart. In this paper, we review four major approaches to promoting angiogenesis and vascularization in cardiac tissue engineering and regeneration: delivery of pro-angiogenic factors/molecules, direct cell implantation/cell sheet grafting, fabrication of prevascularized cardiac constructs, and the use of bioreactors to promote angiogenesis and vascularization. We further provide a detailed review and discussion on the early perfusion design in nature-derived biomaterials, synthetic biodegradable polymers, tissue-derived acellular scaffolds/whole hearts, and hydrogel derived from extracellular matrix.

{"title": "Blood Vessel Maturation in Health and Disease and its Implications for Vascularization of Engineered Tissues.", "abstract": "Engineered blood vessels have often been found to be immature and unstable. Similarly, numerous pathologies such as diabetic retinopathy and cancer are characterized by highly abnormal, defective, hypervascular networks, consisting of immature, leaky, and irregular vessels with a marked loss of perivascular cell coverage. An emerging therapeutic concept in treatment of such vascular diseases and their management is the potential to normalize blood vessels by strengthening the cellular components that form the vascular network. Vessel normalization is characterized by the reduction in the number and size of immature vessels, a decrease in interstitial fluid pressure, and increase in perivascular cell coverage. Understanding the molecular and cellular defects associated with abnormal blood vessels will allow us to find appropriate treatment options that can promote normal blood vessel development. These, in turn, can be applied to improve vessel maturation in engineered tissues. In this review, we describe the major perivascular abnormalities associated with various human diseases and engineered vasculatures and the major advances in obtaining mature vasculatures for translational applications.", "journal": "Critical reviews in biomedical engineering", "date": "2015-01-01", "authors": ["XuetaoSun", "SevanEvren", "Sara SNunes"], "doi": "10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.2016016063"}

A strip representing approximately a quarter of the cortical tissue was removed from the right ovary of the donor sister, cleaned, cut into small fragments and sent to adjacent room, where the receptor sister was concomitantly being prepared to receive the tissue graft. The ovarian fragments were placed under the cortical tissue onto a vascularized bed of the right ovary of the receptor sister. From 90 days postoperatively, the menstrual cycles of the receptor patient became regular with increased flow and longer periods, demonstrating normal hormonal activity and improved endometrial development.

The main question was the viability of the graft. The radiological study has shown the non-wear of the graft and a certain degree of ossification. The MRI confirmed a very small degree of osseous metaplasia but its viability. The biopsies showed a neo-vascularization of the cartilage.\nDespite the strong mechanical strain in the hand and wrist, the chondrocostal graft is a biological arthroplasty, trustworthy and secure at long time even if it can cause infrequent complications inherent to this type of surgery.

Conservative treatments, including pharmacological management and biophysical modalities, are not supported by any evidence and require further investigation. The appropriate therapeutic approach has not been identified. The choice of surgical procedures is based on patient clinical conditions and anatomopathological features; preservation of the femoral head by core decompression may be attempted in younger patients without head collapse. Biological factors, such as bone morphogenetic proteins and bone marrow stem cells, would improve the outcome of core decompression. Another surgical procedure proposed for the treatment of avascular necrosis consists of large vascularized cortical bone grafts, but its use is not yet common due to surgical technical issues.

{"title": "Noncoronary Collateral Myocardial Blood Flow: The Human Heart's Forgotten Blood Supply.", "abstract": "The \"noncoronary collateral circulation\" (NCCC) or \"noncoronary collateral myocardial blood flow\" (NCCMBF), reaches the heart through a micro-vascular network arising from the bronchial, esophageal, pericardial, diaphragmatic, and aortic arteries. The left and right internal thoracic arteries (ITAs) along with their collateral branches also serve as a source of NCCMBF-a feature seen in other mammals. Under certain circumstances the ITAs have a high potential for developing collateral branches. In the case of severe Leriche syndrome or with chronic obstruction of the abdominal aorta, the ITAs can serve as the main or even sole source of blood supply to the lower limbs. It is also possible for the ITAs to develop angiographically visible branches that directly connect with the coronary arteries.

To determine the ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) in normal and systemic hypertensive patients.\nOne hundred and twenty-one patients were enrolled in this prospective and comparative study and underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination including slit lamp examination, Goldmann applanation tonometry, stereoscopic fundus examination, and pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) measurements. The OPP was calculated as being the medium systemic arterial pressure (MAP) less the IOP. Only right eye values were considered for calculations using Student's t-test.\nThe mean age of the patients was 57.5 years (36-78), and 68.5% were women. There was a statistically significant difference in the OPP of the normal and systemic hypertensive patients (p < 0.05). The difference in the OPP between these groups varied between 8.84 and 17.9 mm Hg.\nThe results of this study suggest that although the systemic hypertensive patients have a higher OPP in comparison to normal patients, this increase does not mean that they also have a higher OBF (as measured by POBF tonograph). This may be caused by chronic changes in the vascular network and in the blood hemodynamics in patients with systemic hypertension.

{"title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Human Tissue-Engineered Adipose Substitutes.", "abstract": "Adipose tissue (AT) substitutes are being developed to answer the strong demand in reconstructive surgery. To facilitate the validation of their functional performance in vivo, and to avoid resorting to excessive number of animals, it is crucial at this stage to develop biomedical imaging methodologies, enabling the follow-up of reconstructed AT substitutes. Until now, biomedical imaging of AT substitutes has scarcely been reported in the literature. Therefore, the optimal parameters enabling good resolution, appropriate contrast, and graft delineation, as well as blood perfusion validation, must be studied and reported. In this study, human adipose substitutes produced from adipose-derived stem/stromal cells using the self-assembly approach of tissue engineering were implanted into athymic mice. The fate of the reconstructed AT substitutes implanted in vivo was successfully followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is the imaging modality of choice for visualizing soft ATs. T1-weighted images allowed clear delineation of the grafts, followed by volume integration. The magnetic resonance (MR) signal of reconstructed AT was studied in vitro by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR). This confirmed the presence of a strong triglyceride peak of short longitudinal proton relaxation time (T1) values (200 \u00b1 53 ms) in reconstructed AT substitutes (total T1=813 \u00b1 76 ms), which establishes a clear signal difference between adjacent muscle, connective tissue, and native fat (total T1 ~300 ms). Graft volume retention was followed up to 6 weeks after implantation, revealing a gradual resorption rate averaging at 44% of initial substitute's volume. In addition, vascular perfusion measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI confirmed the graft's vascularization postimplantation (14 and 21 days after grafting). Histological analysis of the grafted tissues revealed the persistence of numerous adipocytes without evidence of cysts or tissue necrosis. This study describes the in vivo grafting of human adipose substitutes devoid of exogenous matrix components, and for the first time, the optimal parameters necessary to achieve efficient MRI visualization of grafted tissue-engineered adipose substitutes.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Porcine Dermis-Derived Collagen Membranes Induce Implantation Bed Vascularization Via Multinucleated Giant Cells: A Physiological Reaction?", "abstract": "In this study, the tissue reactions to 2 new porcine dermis-derived collagen membranes of different thickness were analyzed. The thicker material (Mucoderm) contained sporadically preexisting vessel skeletons and fatty islands. The thinner membrane (Collprotect) had a bilayered structure (porous and occlusive side) without any preexisting structures. These materials were implanted subcutaneously in mice to analyze the tissue reactions and potential transmembranous vascularization. Histological and histomorphometrical methodologies were performed at 4 time points (3, 10, 15, and 30 days). Both materials permitted stepwise connective tissue ingrowth into their central regions. In the Mucoderm matrix, newly built microvessels were found within the preexisting vessel and fatty island skeletons after 30 days. This vascularization was independent of the inflammation-related vascularization on both material surfaces. The Collprotect membrane underwent material disintegration by connective tissue strands in combination with vessels and multinucleated giant cells. The histomorphometric analyses revealed that the thickness of Mucoderm did not decrease significantly, while an initial significant decrease of membrane thickness in the case of Collprotect was found at day 15. The present results demonstrate that the 2 analyzed collagen membranes underwent a multinucleated giant cell-associated vascularization. Neither of the materials underwent transmembraneous vascularization. The microvessels were found within the preexisting vessel and fatty island skeletons. Additional long-term studies and clinical studies are necessary to determine how the observed foreign body giant cells affect tissue regeneration.", "journal": "The Journal of oral implantology", "date": "2014-12-30", "authors": ["MikeBarbeck", "JonasLorenz", "AlicaKubesch", "NicoleB\u00f6hm", "PatrickBooms", "JosephChoukroun", "RobertSader", "Charles JamesKirkpatrick", "ShahramGhanaati"], "doi": "10.1563/aaid-joi-D-14-00274"}

We present a patient with a giant benign IFP of the esophagus that originated from the upper esophagus.\nThe patient is a 59-year-old male who presented with dysphagia. Upper endoscopy and esophagram revealed a giant intraluminal esophageal mass with a pedicle in the upper esophagus. Resection of this mass was performed through a left cervical esophagotomy. Pathology confirmed IFP, On 2 year follow up, there was no recurrence of the mass.\nA giant IFP is defined as an IFP greater than 4cm, commonly present in the distal esophagus. Pathology usually reveals vascularized fibrous stroma with elements of inflammatory infiltrate. This mass is slow-growing and asymptomatic until it grows to a large size. Common diagnostic studies include barium esophagram, upper endoscopy, and CT imaging. A key pre-operative work-up is to identify the location of the pedicle to plan out surgical approach and to avoid injuring the rich blood supply thus preventing a life threatening hemorrhage during the operation.\nGiant IFPs are infrequent in clinical practice.

In experiment 1, buffaloes underwent synchronization of estrus and fixed-time artificial insemination (n\u00a0=\u00a023). Features of the CL were measured from Days 5 to 10 after fixed-time artificial insemination, and pregnancy was confirmed on Day 70. Buffaloes that established a pregnancy (n\u00a0=\u00a014) had a larger CL area (1.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 vs. 1.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0cm(2); P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and greater progesterone (P4) concentrations (1.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 vs. 1.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0ng/mL; P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) during Days 5 to 10 compared with nonpregnant buffaloes. In the same period, blood flow measured as time average medium velocity tended to be greater (P\u00a0=\u00a00.059) in buffaloes that were subsequently pregnant versus nonpregnant buffaloes (10.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 vs. 8.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9).

Blood flow was greater in HVCLs than in LVCLs. Highly vascularized CLs showed intense staining for factor VIII and had many small, irregular-shaped blood vessels, whereas LVCLs had low factor VIII staining and relatively few large, regular-shaped vessels. Luteal cell expression of vascular EGF was greater for HVCLs compared with LVCLs. The study has shown that greater development and function of the CL from as early as Day 5 is related to an increased likelihood of pregnancy in the buffalo.

We investigated the effect of the IGF-1R blocking antibody IMC-A12 on glioblastoma growth in different in vivo models.\nU87 cells were chosen to establish rapidly growing, angiogenesis-dependent tumors in the brains of nude mice, and the GS-12 cell line was used to generate highly invasive tumors. IMC-A12 was administered using convection-enhanced local delivery. Tumor parameters were quantified histologically, and the functional relevance of IGF-1R activation was analyzed in vitro.\nIMC-A12 treatment inhibited the growth of U87 and GS-12 tumors by 75% and 50%, respectively. In GS-12 tumors, the invasive tumor extension and proliferation rate were significantly reduced by IMC-A12 treatment, while apoptosis was increased. In IMC-A12-treated U87 tumors, intratumoral vascularization was markedly decreased, and tumor cell proliferation was moderately reduced. Flow cytometry showed that <2% of U87 cells but >85% of GS-12 cells expressed IGF-1R. Activation of IGF-1R by IGF-1 and IGF-2 in GS-12 cells was blocked by IMC-A12. Both ligands stimulated GS-12 cell proliferation, and IGF-2 also stimulated migration. IMC-A12 inhibited these stimulatory effects and increased apoptosis. In U87 cells, stimulation with either ligand had no functional effect.\nIGF-1R blockade can inhibit glioblastoma growth by different mechanisms, including direct effects on the tumor cells as well as indirect anti-angiogenic effects.

{"title": "Increased expression of PHD3 represses the HIF-1 signaling pathway and contributes to poor neovascularization in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.", "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is known as one of the most malignant potential diseases with poor neovascularization. By comparing PDAC to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is well vascularized, we investigated the mechanisms and tumor biological significance of the poor neovascularization in PDAC.\nSurgical specimens from primary PDAC and HCC patients were immunohistologically stained to detect the expressions of CD105, CD44, HIF-1\u03b1, PHD3, and Siah2. We also used two PDAC and two HCC cell lines to compare the expressions of HIF-1\u03b1, PHD3, and CD44, as well as the production of VEGF in hypoxic condition. The role of PHD3 in regulating HIF-1\u03b1 expression was further confirmed by siRNA knockdown in a PDAC cell line that highly expressed PHD3.\nThere were significantly fewer microvessels but more cancer stem cells in PDAC specimens compared to HCC specimens. The expression of CD105 was reversely related to the expression of CD44 in PDAC and HCC specimens. PDAC specimens also showed higher expressions of PHD3 but lower expressions of HIF-1\u03b1.

Estrogen signaling is a potent regulator of lipid handling, inflammation, fibrosis, and adipocyte progenitor recruitment in adipose tissues. To date, no studies have investigated the effect of circulating estrogens on fat graft outcomes.\nImmunosuppressed (Nu/Nu) mice underwent ovariectomy or sham surgery. Forty-five days later, half the mice (donors) were killed, and adipose tissue was taken and transplanted into the remaining cohort (recipients). Forty-five days after transplantation, grafts were dissected, weighed, and assessed for expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, estrogen receptor-\u03b1, and vascular density.\nGrafts harvested from and transplanted into sham environments are smaller but more highly vascularized compared with ovariectomy environments. The estrogenic effects on grafts are more critical at the site of the donor tissue than the recipient. Finally, expression of estrogen receptor-\u03b1 in the grafted tissue correlates with the observed graft characteristics, which is altered by both the donor and recipient environments.\nCirculating estrogens have significant effects on fat graft outcomes, primarily at the site of the donor tissue. As there are well-established depot-specific estrogenic responses, the choice of adipose depot used as a donor for fat grafting may affect outcomes. In addition, outcomes may be confounded by the patient's hormonal status.

Using pulldown experiments and nanoflow-HPLC mass spectrometry, vimentin was identified to bind to the 3'-UTR of ALP mRNA. Validation was performed by Western blotting. Functional experiments inhibiting intermediate filaments with iminodipropionitrile and specific inhibition of vimentin by siRNA transfection showed reduced levels of ALP mRNA and protein.

{"title": "Construction of three-dimensional vascularized cardiac tissue with cell sheet engineering.", "abstract": "Construction of three-dimensional (3D) tissues with pre-isolated cells is a promising achievement for novel medicine and drug-discovery research. Our laboratory constructs 3D tissues with an innovative and unique method for layering multiple cell sheets. Cell sheets maintain a high-efficiently regenerating function, because of the higher cell density and higher transplantation efficiency, compared to other cell-delivery methods. Cell sheets have already been applied in clinical applications for regenerative medicine in treating patients with various diseases. Therefore, in our search to develop a more efficient treatment with cell sheets, we are constructing 3D tissues by layering cell sheets. Native animal tissues and organs have an abundance of capillaries to supply oxygen and nutrients, and to remove waste molecules. In our investigation of vascularized cardiac cell sheets, we have found that endothelial cells within cell sheets spontaneously form blood vessel networks as in vivo capillaries. To construct even thicker 3D tissues by layering multiple cell sheets, it is critical to have a medium or blood flow within the vascular networks of the cell sheets. Therefore, to perfuse medium or blood in the cell sheet vascular network to maintain the viability of all cells, we developed two types of vascular beds; (1) a femoral muscle-based vascular bed, and (2) a synthetic collagen gel-based vascular bed. Both vascular beds successfully provide the critical flow of culture medium, which allows 12-layer cell sheets to survive. Such bioreactor systems, when combined with cell sheet engineering techniques, have produced functional vascularized 3D tissues. Here we explain and discuss the various processes to obtain vascular networks by properly connecting cell sheets and the engineering of 3D tissues.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2014-12-20", "authors": ["KatsuhisaSakaguchi", "TatsuyaShimizu", "TeruoOkano"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.12.016"}

The efficacy of propranolol was related to the \u03b22-AR blockade and the consequent inhibition of the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting the hypothesis that propranolol could also be effective in treating retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a retinal pathology characterized by VEGF-induced neoangiogenesis. Consequent to the encouraging animal studies, a pilot clinical trial showed that oral propranolol protects newborns from ROP progression, even though this treatment is not sufficiently safe. Further, animal studies clarified the role of \u03b23-ARs in the development of ROP and, together with several preclinical studies demonstrating the key role of the \u03b2-adrenergic system in tumor progression, vascularization, and metastasis, prompted us to also investigate the participation of \u03b23-ARs in tumor growth. The aim of this review is to gather the recent findings on the role of the \u03b2-adrenergic system in IHs, ROP, and cancer, highlighting the fact that these different pathologies, triggered by different pathogenic noxae, share common pathogenic mechanisms characterized by the presence of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, which may be contrasted by targeting the \u03b2-adrenergic system. The mechanisms characterizing the pathogenesis of IHs, ROP, and cancer may also be active during the fetal-neonatal development, and a great contribution to the knowledge on the role of \u03b2-ARs in diseases characterized by chronic hypoxia may come from research focusing on the fetal and neonatal period.", "journal": "Medicinal research reviews", "date": "2014-12-20", "authors": ["LucaFilippi", "MassimoDal Monte", "GiovanniCasini", "MartaDaniotti", "FedericaSereni", "PaolaBagnoli"], "doi": "10.1002/med.21336"}
{"title": "Trg-deficient Salmonella colonize quiescent tumor regions by exclusively penetrating or proliferating.", "abstract": "Chemotherapeutics fail to effectively treat tumors because they cannot reach quiescent regions far from blood vessels. Motile Salmonella are an attractive delivery system that could break this therapeutic barrier. However, little is known about the dissemination and tissue penetration of individual bacteria in tumors after intravenous administration. We hypothesized that eliminating the Trg receptor would improve accumulation in tumor quiescence. To test this hypothesis, we deleted the trg gene from nonpathogenic Salmonella. To quantify individual bacterial behavior, we measured tissue penetration in a tumor-on-a-chip device and measured colony localization in mouse tumors using immunofluorescence. In tumors in vitro and in mice, trg(-) Salmonella penetrated farther into tissue than control bacteria. This difference in localization was caused by the inability to sense sugars in well perfused tissue. Three distinct bacterial phenotypes were observed: proliferating, penetrating, and inactive. Large proliferating colonies, containing more than 40% of individual bacteria, only formed less than 60\u03bcm from blood vessels. Small colonies, in comparison, were present both near (inactive) and far (penetrating) from vessels. The farthest was 361.2\u03bcm from a vessel, demonstrating the ability to target avascular regions. In addition, colonization was most pronounced in poorly vascularized tumor regions. We show that deletion of trg amplifies Salmonella accumulation in quiescent tumor regions, and, for the first time, identify biological processes that control bacterial distribution in tumors. Understanding how Salmonella penetrate tissue, target quiescence and specifically replicate in tumors are essential steps toward creating a tightly controlled, tunable bacterial therapy.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2014-12-20", "authors": ["MiaominZhang", "Neil SForbes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.12.014"}

To take full advantage of the innate cancer-specific killing potency of oncolytic Ads but also exploit the subtleties of the tumor microenvironment, we have generated a pH-sensitive and bio-reducible polymer (PPCBA)-coated oncolytic Ad. Ad-PPCBA complexes showed higher cellular uptake at pH 6.0 than pH 7.4 in both high and low coxsackie and adenovirus receptor-(CAR)-expressing cells, thereby demonstrating Ad-PPCBA's ability to target the low pH hypoxic tumor microenvironment and overcome CAR dependence for target cell uptake. Endocytic mechanism studies indicated that Ad-PPCBA internalization is mediated by macropinocytosis instead of the CAR-dependent endocytic pathway that internalizes naked Ad. VEGF-specific shRNA-expressing oncolytic Ad complexed with PPCBA (RdB/shVEGF-PPCBA) elicited much more potent suppression of U87 human brain cancer cell VEGF gene expression in vitro, and human breast cancer MCF7 cell/Matrigel plug vascularization in a mouse model, when cancer cells had been previously infected at pH 6.0 versus pH 7.4. Moreover, intratumorally and intravenously injected RdB/shVEGF-PPCBA nanocomplexes elicited significantly higher therapeutic efficacy than naked virus in U87-tumor mouse xenograft models, reducing IL-6, ALT, and AST serum levels. These data demonstrated PPCBA's biocompatibility and capability to shield the Ad surface to prevent innate immune response against Ad after both intratumoral and systemic administration. Taken together, these results demonstrate that smart, tumor-specific, oncolytic Ad-PPCBA complexes can be exploited to treat both primary and metastatic tumors.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2014-12-20", "authors": ["Chang YoonMoon", "Joung-WooChoi", "DayanandaKasala", "Soo-JungJung", "Sung WanKim", "Chae-OkYun"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.11.021"}

We show how the organization of the xylem network changes dynamically throughout the plant, and reveal how the elementary units of this transport system are organized to ensure both long-distance axial water transport and local lateral water transport. Xylem vessels form distinct clusters that operate as functional units, and the activity of these units, which determines water flow pathways, is modulated not only by varying the number and size of xylem vessels, but also by altering their interconnectivity and spatial arrangement.

Successful vascularization requires a reliable method to generate vascular cells and a scaffold capable of supporting vessel formation. The broad potential for differentiation, high proliferation rates, and autologous availability for neonatal surgeries make amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSC) well suited for regenerative medicine strategies. AFSC-derived endothelial cells (AFSC-EC) express key proteins and functional phenotypes associated with endothelial cells. Fibrin-based hydrogels were shown to stimulate AFSC-derived network formation in vitro but were limited by rapid degradation. Incorporation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) provided mechanical stability (65%\u00b19% weight retention vs. 0% for fibrin-only at day 14) while retaining key benefits of fibrin-based scaffolds-quick formation (10\u00b13\u2009s), biocompatibility (88%\u00b15% viability), and vasculogenic stimulation. To determine the feasibility of AFSC-derived microvasculature, we compared AFSC-EC as a vascular cell source and AFSC as a perivascular cell source to established sources of these cell types-human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), respectively. Cocultures were seeded at a 4:1 endothelial-to-perivascular cell ratio, and gels were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 weeks. Mechanical testing was performed using a stress-controlled rheometer (G'=95\u00b110\u2009Pa), and cell-seeded hydrogels were assessed based on morphology. Network formation was analyzed based on key parameters such as vessel thickness, length, and area, as well as the degree of branching. There was no statistical difference between individual cultures of AFSC-EC and HUVEC in regard to these parameters, suggesting the vasculogenic potential of AFSC-EC; however, the development of robust vessels required the presence of both an endothelial and a perivascular cell source and was seen in AFSC cocultures (70%\u00b120% vessel length, 90%\u00b110% vessel area, and 105%\u00b110% vessel thickness compared to HUVEC/MSC). At a fixed seeding density, the coculture of AFSC with AFSC-EC resulted in a synergistic effect on network parameters similar to MSC (150% vessel length, 147% vessel area, 150% vessel thickness, and 155% branching).

A validated lymphedema-specific questionnaire-lymphoedema quality-of-life study-was utilized to assess specific quality-of-life parameters at multiple time points during the 12-month perioperative period. For a comparison with HRQoL metrics, limb circumference measurements were obtained to assess circumference differentiation.\nTwenty-five patients met the study criteria. Limb circumference analysis revealed significant early improvements following VLN transfer, with continued improvement during the study period (upper-limb lymphedema: 24.4 %; lower-limb lymphedema: 35.2 %). These improvements were mirrored by improvements in all HRQoL domains and overall quality of life (p < 0.01). The function, body appearance, symptom, and mood domains were all found to be significantly improved during the postoperative evaluation, with continued improvement being reported throughout the study period (p < 0.01 within each domain).\nMicrosurgical treatment of lymphedema with VLN transfer procedures effectively decrease limb circumference.

{"title": "RSUME inhibits VHL and regulates its tumor suppressor function.", "abstract": "Somatic mutations or loss of von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) happen in the majority of VHL disease tumors, which present a constitutively active Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF), essential for tumor growth. Recently described mechanisms for pVHL modulation shed light on the open question of the HIF/pVHL pathway regulation. The aim of the present study was to determine the molecular mechanism by which RSUME stabilizes HIFs, by studying RSUME effect on pVHL function and to determine the role of RSUME on pVHL-related tumor progression. We determined that RSUME sumoylates and physically interacts with pVHL and negatively regulates the assembly of the complex between pVHL, Elongins and Cullins (ECV), inhibiting HIF-1 and 2\u03b1 ubiquitination and degradation. We found that RSUME is expressed in human VHL tumors (renal clear-cell carcinoma (RCC), pheochromocytoma and hemangioblastoma) and by overexpressing or silencing RSUME in a pVHL-HIF-oxygen-dependent degradation stability reporter assay, we determined that RSUME is necessary for the loss of function of type 2 pVHL mutants. The functional RSUME/pVHL interaction in VHL-related tumor progression was further confirmed using a xenograft assay in nude mice. RCC clones, in which RSUME was knocked down and express either pVHL wt or type 2 mutation, have an impaired tumor growth, as well as HIF-2\u03b1, vascular endothelial growth factor A and tumor vascularization diminution.

The present work used a long-term bovine GC culture, in chemically defined medium without gonadotropins, to study the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and endothelin-1 (EDN1) on the steroidogenesis and cellular proliferation. Small follicles (3-5mm in diameter) from ovaries obtained in the slaughterhouse were selected according to their vascularization and follicular fluid color in order to isolate GC. Granulosa cells were plated at a density of 5\u00d710(4)cells/well in supplemented alpha-MEM containing 3 levels (0, 10(-8)M and 10(-7)M) of Ang II, ANP, and EDN1 for up to 96h. Proliferation was evaluated by tritiated thymidine incorporation. The results showed that Ang II, ANP, and EDN1 modulate the steroidogenic output and proliferation index of GCs depending on the dose and time of culture. The selected vasoactive peptides increased androstenedione (A4) consumption in parallel with increased estradiol (E2). Although the peptides also promoted a significant increase in pregnenolone (P5) and progesterone (P4) production, the E2:P4 ratio was maintained at a high at most of the tested doses.

During the dry season they aestivate on land, with the collapse of secondary lamellae of their gills and the establishment of an exclusive aerial ventilation through the vascularization and expansion of their lungs. To date, the mechanisms underlining the respiratory organ remodeling in aestivating lungfishes are unknown. This study aimed to identify key switch components of the stress-induced signal transduction networks implicated in both rapid and medium-long term remodeling of the gills and lungs of the African lungfish Protopterus annectens during aestivation. Through immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting, the localization and the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), Akt, Hsp-90 and HIF-1\u03b1 were evaluated in both gills and lungs exposed to three experimental conditions: freshwater (FW), 6 months of experimentally induced aestivation (6mAe), and 6 days after arousal from 6 months of aestivation (6mAe6d). After 6mAe, the expression of NOS (p-eNOS antibody), Akt (p-Akt antibody), and Hsp-90 decreased in the gills, while NOS and Hsp-90 expression increased with Akt remained unchanged in the lungs. Upon 6mAe6d, NOS, Akt and Hsp-90 expression in the gills returned to the respective FW values. In the lungs of the aroused fish, NOS and Akt decreased to their respective FW levels, while Hsp-90 expression was enhanced with respect to aestivation. In both respiratory organs, the qualitative and quantitative patterns of HIF-1\u03b1 expression correlated inversely to those of NOS.

We hypothesized that curcumin and its analogues EF31 and UBS109 would disrupt angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer (PC) through modulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB. Conditioned medium from MIA PaCa-2 or PANC-1 cells exposed to curcumin and its analogues in vitro significantly impaired angiogenesis in an egg CAM assay and blocked HUVEC tube assembly in comparison to untreated cell medium. In vivo, EF31 and UBS109 blocked the vascularization of subcutaneous matrigel plugs developed by MIA PaCa-2 in mice. Significant inhibition of VEGF, angiopoietin 1, angiopoietin 2, platelet derived growth factor, COX-2, and TGF\u03b2 secretion was observed in PC cell lines treated with UBS109, EF31 or curcumin. Treatment with UBS109, EF31 or curcumin inhibited HSP90, NF-\u03baB, and HIF-1\u03b1 transcription in PC cell lines.

{"title": "Endothelial progenitor cells from peripheral blood support bone regeneration by provoking an angiogenic response.", "abstract": "Neovascularization is crucial for fracture healing and plays an important role in long-time graft survival in tissue engineering applications. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can be isolated from peripheral blood avoiding donor site morbidity, which makes them attractive for autologous cell-based engineering of neovessels. However, contradictory results are published concerning the vasculogenic potential of this cell type. We could previously show that implanted human endothelial vein cells (HUVECs) gave rise to the formation of a complex functional human neovasculature in a heterotopic (subcutaneous) as well as in an orthotopic (calvarial defect) model of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, where vessel formation could even be increased by coimplanting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) functioning as perivascular cells. In this study, we investigated whether coimplantation of MSCs which have been predifferentiated in vitro into SMCs (SMC-MSCs) may enable pbEPCs to form blood vessels upon implantation and, if this would be the case, whether the resulting enhanced vascularization may support bone regeneration. For this purpose, pbEPCs and SMC-MSCs were mono- or cocultured in collagen matrices and seeded into scaffolds consisting of decalcified processed bovine cancellous bone (PBCB, Tutobone). Neovascularization and osteogenesis were evaluated using a calvarial bone defect-model in SCID mice. Our experiments could show that the missing vasculogenic potential of pbEPCs is not rescued by coimplantation of SMCs derived from MSCs predifferentiated along the vascular smooth muscle lineage.

The following were evaluated: the cellular inflammatory pattern, the induction of multinucleated giant cells, vascularization, the relative amounts of newly formed bone, connective tissue, and the remaining bone substitute material. NB granules were well integrated in the peri-implant tissue and were surrounded by newly formed bone tissue. Multinucleated giant cells were visible on the surfaces of the remaining granules. BO granules were integrated into the newly formed bone tissue, which originated from active osteoblasts on their surface.

{"title": "A multilevel modeling framework to study hepatic perfusion characteristics in case of liver cirrhosis.", "abstract": "Liver cirrhosis represents the end-stage of different liver disorders, progressively affecting hepatic architecture, hemodynamics, and function. Morphologically, cirrhosis is characterized by diffuse fibrosis, the conversion of normal liver architecture into structurally abnormal regenerative nodules and the formation of an abundant vascular network. To date, the vascular remodeling and altered hemodynamics due to cirrhosis are still poorly understood, even though they seem to play a pivotal role in cirrhogenesis. This study aims to determine the perfusion characteristics of the cirrhotic circulation using a multilevel modeling approach including computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Vascular corrosion casting and multilevel micro-CT imaging of a single human cirrhotic liver generated detailed datasets of the hepatic circulation, including typical pathological characteristics of cirrhosis such as shunt vessels and dilated sinusoids. Image processing resulted in anatomically correct 3D reconstructions of the microvasculature up to a diameter of about 500\u2009\u03bcm. Subsequently, two cubic samples (150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u00d7\u2009150\u2009\u03bcm\u00b3) were virtually dissected from vascularized zones in between regenerative nodules and applied for CFD simulations to study the altered cirrhotic microperfusion and permeability. Additionally, a conceptual 3D model of the cirrhotic macrocirculation was developed to reveal the hemodynamic impact of regenerative nodules. Our results illustrate that the cirrhotic microcirculation is characterized by an anisotropic permeability showing the highest value in the direction parallel to the central vein (kd,zz\u2009=\u20091.68\u2009\u00d7\u200910-13 m\u00b2 and kd,zz\u2009=\u20097.79\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u207b\u00b9\u00b3 m\u00b2 for sample 1 and 2, respectively) and lower values in the circumferential (kd,\u03d1\u03d1\u2009=\u20095.78\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u207b\u00b9\u2074 m\u00b2 and kd,\u03d1\u03d1\u2009=\u20095.65\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u207b\u00b9\u00b3 m\u00b2 for sample 1 and 2, respectively) and radial (kd,rr\u2009=\u20099.87\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u207b\u00b9\u2074 m\u00b2 and kd,rr\u2009=\u20095.13\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u207b\u00b9\u00b3 m\u00b2 for sample 1 and 2, respectively) direction. Overall, the observed permeabilities are markedly higher compared to a normal liver, implying a locally decreased intrahepatic vascular resistance (IVR) probably due to local compensation mechanisms (dilated sinusoids and shunt vessels). These counteract the IVR increase caused by the presence of regenerative nodules and dynamic contraction mechanisms (e.g., stellate cells, NO-concentration, etc.). Our conceptual 3D model of the cirrhotic macrocirculation indicates that regenerative nodules severely increase the IVR beyond about 65 vol. % of regenerative nodules. Numerical modeling allows quantifying perfusion characteristics of the cirrhotic macro- and microcirculation, i.e., the effect of regenerative nodules and compensation mechanisms such as dilated sinusoids and shunt vessels. Future research will focus on the development of models to study time-dependent degenerative adaptation of the cirrhotic macro- and microcirculation.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanical engineering", "date": "2014-12-05", "authors": ["GeertPeeters", "CharlotteDebbaut", "PieterCornillie", "ThomasDe Schryver", "DiethardMonbaliu", "WimLaleman", "PatrickSegers"], "doi": "10.1115/1.4029280"}

It is known that implantation of differentiated endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from cord blood (cbEPCs) gives rise to the formation of a complex functional neovasculature, whereas EPCs isolated from peripheral blood (pbEPCs) have a limited capability to form blood vessels upon implantation. MicroRNA-126 (miR-126) has been shown to have pro-angiogenic effects in vivo. In this study, we investigated whether modulation of miR-126 expression in pbEPCs may alter their angiogenic properties. Gain of function and loss of function experiments revealed that miR-126 has anti-angiogenic effects in pbEPCs. Overexpression of miR-126 resulted in decreased proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation, while inhibition of miR-126 induced the opposite effects. However, modulation of miR-126 expression did not influence apoptotic susceptibility of pbEPCs. This study provides evidence that inhibition of miR-126 improves angiogenesis-related growth parameters in pbEPCs and may represent a therapeutic option to ameliorate the angiogenic and vasculogenic properties of pbEPCs.", "journal": "Biological chemistry", "date": "2014-12-05", "authors": ["Sebastian MGoerke", "Lena SKiefer", "G Bj\u00f6rnStark", "FilipSimunovic", "G\u00fcnterFinkenzeller"], "doi": "10.1515/hsz-2014-0259"}

Here we examine the development and consequences of vascularization of the tuberculous granuloma in the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection model, which is characterized by organized granulomas with necrotic cores that bear striking resemblance to those of human tuberculosis. Using intravital microscopy in the transparent larval zebrafish, we show that granuloma formation is intimately associated with angiogenesis. The initiation of angiogenesis in turn coincides with the generation of local hypoxia and transcriptional induction of the canonical pro-angiogenic molecule Vegfaa. Pharmacological inhibition of the Vegf pathway suppresses granuloma-associated angiogenesis, reduces infection burden and limits dissemination. Moreover, anti-angiogenic therapies synergize with the first-line anti-tubercular antibiotic rifampicin, as well as with the antibiotic metronidazole, which targets hypoxic bacterial populations. Our data indicate that mycobacteria induce granuloma-associated angiogenesis, which promotes mycobacterial growth and increases spread of infection to new tissue sites.

The Integra Dermal Regeneration Template (IDRT) is the leading synthetic skin substitute because it allows for wound bed regeneration and wound healing. However, all substitutes suffer from slow blood vessel ingrowth and would benefit considerably from enhanced vascularization to nurture tissue repair. It is shown here that by incorporating the human elastic protein tropoelastin into a dermal regeneration template (TDRT) we can promote angiogenesis in wound healing. In small and large animal models comprising mice and pigs, the hybrid TDRT biomaterial and IDRT show similar contraction to autografts and decrease wound contraction compared to open wounds. In mice, TDRT accelerates early stage angiogenesis by 2 weeks, as evidenced by increased angiogenesis fluorescent radiant efficiency in live animal imaging and the expression of endothelial cell adhesion marker CD146. In the pig, a full thickness wound repair model confirms increased numbers of blood vessels in the regenerating areas of the dermis closest to the hypodermis and immediately below the epidermis at 2 weeks post-surgery.

{"title": "Nephron reconstitution from pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "It has been a challenge in developmental biology and regenerative medicine to generate nephron progenitors that reconstitute the three-dimensional (3D) nephron structure in vitro. Many studies have tried to induce nephron progenitors from pluripotent stem cells by mimicking the developmental processes in vivo. However, the current developmental model does not precisely address the spatiotemporal origin of nephron progenitors, hampering our understanding of cell fate decisions in the kidney. Here, we present a revised model of early-stage kidney specification, suggesting distinct origins of the two major kidney components: the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme. This model enables the induction of metanephric nephron progenitors from both mouse and human pluripotent stem cells. The induced cells self-organize in the presence of Wnt signaling and reconstitute 3D nephron structures including both nephric tubules with a clear lumina and glomeruli with podocytes. The engrafted kidney tissue develops vascularized glomeruli and nephric tubules, but it does not produce urine, suggesting the requirement for further maturation. Nevertheless, the generation of nephron components from human-induced pluripotent stem cells will be useful for future application in regenerative therapy and modeling of congenital kidney diseases in vitro.

All flap reconstructions were successful with the only perfusion-related complication being a case of delayed partial skin flap loss.\nIntraoperative fluorescence angiography is a useful adjunctive tool that can aid in flap design through angiosome mapping and can also assess flap perfusion, vascular pedicle flow, tissue perfusion before flap harvest, and flap perfusion after flap inset.

A better understanding of the anatomy of the lymphatic system in the inguinal region is essential to preserving lymph drainage in the leg and avoiding iatrogenic lymphedema.\nFive human cadaver hind-quarter specimens were used for this study. First, the specimens were scanned with indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography to map the lymphatic vessels. A dual injection technique using different radiocontrast media was then applied to delineate arteries and lymphatic vessels on radiographs. Finally, radiological analysis and meticulous dissection were used to investigate relationships between the arteries and lymphatic vessels.\nBy chasing the lymphatic vessels retrogradely from their corresponding lymph nodes, we were able to divide the superficial inguinal lymph nodes into three subgroups: the abdominal, medial thigh, and lateral thigh nodes. We found no connections between the superficial and deep lymphatic system in the inguinal region. The dominant lymph nodes draining the leg were in the lower part of the inguinal triangle, and their efferent lymphatic vessels ran medial to the common femoral artery.\nPreserving the sentinel nodes of the lower leg in the medial thigh and their efferent lymphatic vessels is crucial to avoid iatrogenic lymphedema in limbs with donor sites for VLNT.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2014-12-04", "authors": ["Mario FScaglioni", "HirooSuami"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2014.10.047"}

This may hinder the use of MSCs for articular cartilage regeneration, but opens the possibility of using engineered cartilaginous tissues for large bone defect repair. Hydrogels may be an attractive tool in the scaling-up of such tissue engineered grafts for endochondral bone regeneration. In this study, we compared the capacity of different naturally derived hydrogels (alginate, chitosan and fibrin) to support chondrogenesis and hypertrophy of MSCs in vitro and endochondral ossification in vivo. In vitro, alginate and chitosan constructs accumulated the highest levels of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG), with chitosan constructs synthesizing the highest levels of collagen. Alginate and fibrin constructs supported the greatest degree of calcium accumulation, though only fibrin constructs calcified homogeneously. In vivo, chitosan constructs facilitated neither vascularization nor endochondral ossification, and also retained the greatest amount of sGAG, suggesting it to be a more suitable material for the engineering of articular cartilage. Both alginate and fibrin constructs facilitated vascularization and endochondral bone formation as well as the development of a bone marrow environment. Alginate constructs accumulated significantly more mineral and supported greater bone formation in central regions of the engineered tissue.

The morphology and structure of the bilayer scaffolds were examined by high-magnification scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. The bilayer scaffolds demonstrated a gradual variation in through-thickness porosity and fiber alignment and an average porosity much higher than that of conventionally electrospun scaffolds (controls) with randomly distributed fibers. The biocompatibility and biological performance of the bilayer fibrous scaffolds were evaluated by in vivo experiments involving subcutaneous scaffold implantation in Sprague-Dawley rats, followed by histology and immunohistochemistry studies. The results illustrate the potential of the bilayer scaffolds to overcome major limitations of conventionally electrospun scaffolds associated with intrinsically small pores, low porosity and, consequently, poor cell infiltration. The significantly higher porosity and larger pore size of RFL enhances cell motility through the scaffold thickness, whereas the relatively dense structure of AFL provides the scaffold with the necessary mechanical strength. The bilayer scaffolds show more than two times higher cell infiltration than controls during implantation in vivo. The unique structure of the bilayer scaffolds promotes collagen fiber deposition, cell proliferation, and ingrowth of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in vivo.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of in vitro chondrogenic priming time for the creation of cartilage template on the in vivo endochondral bone formation both qualitatively and quantitatively. To this end, rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were seeded onto two scaffolds with distinguished features: a fibrous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) electrospun scaffold (PLGA/PCL) and a porous hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate composite (HA/TCP). The constructs were then chondrogenically differentiated for 2, 3 and 4 weeks in vitro, followed by subcutaneous implantation in vivo for up to 8 weeks. A longer chondrogenic priming time resulted in a significantly increased amount and homogeneous deposition of the cartilage matrix on both the PLGA/PCL and HA/TCP scaffolds in vitro. In vivo, all implanted constructs gave rise to endochondral bone formation, whereas the bone volume was not affected by the length of priming time. An unpolarized woven bone-like structure, with significant amounts of cartilage remaining, was generated in fibrous PLGA/PCL scaffolds, while porous HA/TCP scaffolds supported progressive lamellar-like bone formation with mature bone marrow development. These data suggest that, by utilizing a chondrogenically differentiated MSC-scaffold construct as cartilage template, 2 weeks of in vitro priming time is sufficient to generate a substantial amount of vascularized endochondral bone in vivo.

{"title": "Injectable gelatin derivative hydrogels with sustained vascular endothelial growth factor release for induced angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Injectable biomaterials are attractive for soft tissue regeneration because they are handled in a minimally invasive manner and can easily adapt to complex defects. However, inadequate vascularization of the injectable constructs has long been a barrier, leading to necrosis or volume reduction after implantation. In this work, we developed a three-step process to synthesize injectable gelatin-derived hydrogels that are capable of controlling growth factor delivery to induce angiogenesis. In our approach, tyramine was first introduced into gelatin chains to provide enzymatic crosslinking points for gel formation after injection. Next, heparin, a polysaccharide with binding domains to many growth factors, was covalently linked to the tyramine-modified gelatin. Finally, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was incorporated into the gelatin derivative by binding with the heparin in the gelatin derivative, and an injectable gel with controlled VEGF release was formed by an enzymatic catalytic reaction with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The gelation time, mechanical properties and degradation of the gel was readily tailored by the gelatin concentration and the ratio of H2O2/HRP. Binding VEGF to heparin stabilizes this growth factor, protects it from denaturation and proteolytic degradation and subsequently prolongs the sustained release. An in vitro release study and bioactivity assay indicated that the VEGF was released in a sustained manner with high bioactivity for over 3 weeks. Furthermore, a chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and animal experiments were performed to evaluate in vivo bioactivity of the VEGF released from the hydrogels. After 5 days of incubation on CAM, the number of blood vessels surrounding the heparin-modified hydrogels was increased by 2.4-fold compared with that of the control group. Deeper and denser cell infiltration and angiogenesis in the heparin-modified gelatin/VEGF gels were observed compared to the controls after being subcutaneously injected in the dorsal side of the mice for 2 weeks. Interestingly, even without the incorporation of VEGF, the heparin-modified gelatin derivative still had the capability to induce angiogenesis to a certain degree.

The maxillary artery is located deep within the tissue and considered the main artery of the maxilla; however, the facial artery is easy to access. The objective of this study was to examine the territories of the maxillary and facial arteries within the maxilla.\nWe excised and examined 22 maxillae. Of these, 18 were injected with latex and four with India ink.\nWe observed that the ascending palatine artery, which was collateral with the facial artery, vascularized the maxilla through its dorsal part. The facial artery vascularized the maxilla through its ventral part with the philtral and columellar branches of the superior labial artery. Therefore, the facial artery formed, through the nasal and palatine mucosa, an arterial circle with a dorsal and ventral pole. Angiosomes formed by both the facial and maxillary arteries were also observed. The India ink injected into the facial and maxillary arteries delineated specific territories for each artery.\nThis study allowed us to determine the anatomical structures that provide vascularization to the maxilla and describe their different forms. The whole of the maxilla was vascularized by the facial artery, despite the caution imposed by several studies on the removal of the facial artery alone. Indeed, the removal technique was found to be safer when it preserved the anastomoses between the facial and maxillary arteries.

{"title": "Sequential delivery of immunomodulatory cytokines to facilitate the M1-to-M2 transition of macrophages and enhance vascularization of bone scaffolds.", "abstract": "In normal tissue repair, macrophages exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) at early stages and a pro-healing phenotype (M2) at later stages. We have previously shown that M1 macrophages initiate angiogenesis while M2 macrophages promote vessel maturation. Therefore, we reasoned that scaffolds that promote sequential M1 and M2 polarization of infiltrating macrophages should result in enhanced angiogenesis and healing. To this end, we first analyzed the in vitro kinetics of macrophage phenotype switch using flow cytometry, gene expression, and cytokine secretion analysis. Then, we designed scaffolds for bone regeneration based on modifications of decellularized bone for a short release of interferon-gamma (IFNg) to promote the M1 phenotype, followed by a more sustained release of interleukin-4 (IL4) to promote the M2 phenotype. To achieve this sequential release profile, IFNg was physically adsorbed onto the scaffolds, while IL4 was attached via biotin-streptavidin binding. Interestingly, despite the strong interactions between biotin and streptavidin, release studies showed that biotinylated IL4 was released over 6 days. These scaffolds promoted sequential M1 and M2 polarization of primary human macrophages as measured by gene expression of ten M1 and M2 markers and secretion of four cytokines, although the overlapping phases of IFNg and IL4 release tempered polarization to some extent. Murine subcutaneous implantation model showed increased vascularization in scaffolds releasing IFNg compared to controls.

{"title": "Oxygen as a critical determinant of bone fracture healing-a multiscale model.", "abstract": "A timely restoration of the ruptured blood vessel network in order to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fracture zone is crucial for successful bone healing. Indeed, oxygen plays a key role in the aerobic metabolism of cells, in the activity of a myriad of enzymes as well as in the regulation of several (angiogenic) genes. In this paper, a previously developed model of bone fracture healing is further improved with a detailed description of the influence of oxygen on various cellular processes that occur during bone fracture healing. Oxygen ranges of the cell-specific oxygen-dependent processes were established based on the state-of-the art experimental knowledge through a rigorous literature study. The newly developed oxygen model is compared with previously published experimental and in silico results. An extensive sensitivity analysis was also performed on the newly introduced oxygen thresholds, indicating the robustness of the oxygen model. Finally, the oxygen model was applied to the challenging clinical case of a critical sized defect (3mm) where it predicted the formation of a fracture non-union. Further model analyses showed that the harsh hypoxic conditions in the central region of the callus resulted in cell death and disrupted bone healing thereby indicating the importance of a timely vascularization for the successful healing of a large bone defect. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the oxygen model is a powerful tool to further unravel the complex spatiotemporal interplay of oxygen delivery, diffusion and consumption with the several healing steps, each occurring at distinct, optimal oxygen tensions during the bone repair process.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["Aur\u00e9lieCarlier", "LiesbetGeris", "Nickvan Gastel", "GeertCarmeliet", "HansVan Oosterwyck"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.10.012"}

Toxicities of the chemicals were examined using HUVECs viability. Their effects on angiogenesis and vessel formation were furthered studied in HUVECs in vitro and Tg(fli-1:EGFP) zebrafish in vivo. The gene and protein expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot.\nVRI strongly inhibited physiological functions of both VEGF receptors and suppressed endothelial cell survival. This resulted in blood vessel loss in zebrafish embryos. Interestingly, calycosin co-treatment impeded VRI-induced blood vessel loss. Docking and kinase inhibition assay revealed that calycosin competed with VRI for the tyrosine kinase domain of Flt1 without affecting ATP binding. On the contrary, calycosin did not affect the interaction between VRI and Kdr-TK. Consistent with these results, calycosin counteracted the inhibition of Flt1-TK and PI3K phosphorylation induced by VRI in HUVECs. Further studies in vitro and in vivo showed that the minimizing effect of calycosin on VRI-mediated endothelial cytotoxicity was blocked by wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor).

{"title": "May the remodeling of the Ca\u00b2\u207a toolkit in endothelial progenitor cells derived from cancer patients suggest alternative targets for anti-angiogenic treatment?", "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may be recruited from bone marrow to sustain the metastatic switch in a number of solid cancers, including breast cancer (BC) and renal cellular carcinoma (RCC). Preventing EPC mobilization causes tumor shrinkage. Novel anti-angiogenic treatments have been introduced in therapy to inhibit VEGFR-2 signaling; unfortunately, these drugs blocked tumor angiogenesis in pre-clinical murine models, but resulted far less effective in human patients. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving EPC proliferation and tubulogenesis in cancer patients could outline novel targets for alternative anti-angiogenic treatments. Store-operated Ca\u00b2\u207a entry (SOCE) regulates the growth of human EPCs, and it is mediated by the interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2\u207a-sensor, Stim1, and the plasmalemmal Ca\u00b2\u207a channels, Orai1 and TRPC1. EPCs do not belong to the neoplastic clone: thus, unlike tumor endothelium and neoplastic cells, they should not remodel their Ca\u00b2\u207a toolkit in response to tumor microenvironment. However, our recent work demonstrated that EPCs isolated from na\u00efve RCC patients (RCC-EPCs) undergo a dramatic remodeling of their Ca\u00b2\u207a toolkit by displaying a remarkable drop in the endoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2\u207a content, by down-regulating the expression of inositol-1,4,5-receptors (InsP3Rs), and by up-regulating Stim1, Orai1 and TRPC1. Moreover, EPCs are dramatically less sensitive to VEGF stimulation both in terms of Ca\u00b2\u207a signaling and of gene expression when isolated from tumor patients. Conversely, the pharmacological abolition of SOCE suppresses proliferation in these cells. These results question the suitability of VEGFR-2 as a therapeutically relevant target for anti-angiogenic treatments and hint at Orai1 and TRPC1 as more promising alternatives.

An attractive cellular approach is based on coimplantation of endothelial cells to create a vascular network. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a promising cell population, since they can be easily isolated from autologous human peripheral blood and thus represent a clinically feasible option. We have previously shown in in vitro and semi-in vivo studies that ASCs exert beneficial effects on EPCs in terms of enhanced tube formation and formation of blood vessels, respectively. In this study, we investigated the in vivo effects of coimplantation on endothelial cell-mediated neovascularization and ASC-mediated adipose tissue formation. For this purpose, human ASCs and human EPCs (or HUVECs as direct comparison to EPCs) were suspended alone or in coculture in fibrin and subcutaneously injected into the back of athymic nude mice and explanted after 1, 3 or 6months. Our results show that monocultures of EPCs or HUVECs were not able to perform vasculogenesis and constructs exhibited complete resorption already after 1month. However, a remarkable difference between EPCs and HUVECs was detected when coimplanted with ASCs. While coimplanted HUVECs gave rise to a stable neovasculature which was characterized by perfusion with erythrocytes, coimplanted EPCs showed no ability to form vascular structures. In the case of HUVEC-derived neovasculature, coimplanted ASCs displayed perivascular properties by stabilizing these neovessels. However, formation of human adipose tissue was independent of coimplanted endothelial cells. Our results indicate that HUVECs are superior to EPCs in terms of promoting in vivo neovascularization and recruiting perivascular cells for vessel stabilization when coimplanted with ASCs.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["ValentinHaug", "NestorTorio-Padron", "G BjoernStark", "GuenterFinkenzeller", "SandraStrassburg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2014.10.005"}

To understand the functions of HtrA1 in placentation and in the etiology of preeclampsia, we established HtrA1(-/-) mice. HtrA1(-/-) mice show intrauterine growth retardation, and their placentas are small due to a reduced size of the junctional zone and aberrant vascularization in the labyrinth at the mid-gestation stage. HtrA1 is expressed by Tpbpa-positive trophoblast precursors in the outer ectoplacental cone and junctional zone from embryonic day 7.5 to 10.5. In the HtrA1(-/-) placenta, Tpbpa-positive cell precursors are decreased in the early stage. Spongiotrophoblasts and glycogen trophoblast cells, both of which differentiate from Tpbpa-positive precursors, are consequently decreased in the junctional zone. Fewer spiral artery-associated trophoblast giant cells, another cell type derived from Tpbpa-positive precursors, invade the decidua and associate with maternal arteries in the HtrA1(-/-) placenta than in the wild type placenta. Maternal arteries in the HtrA1(-/-) decidua have narrower lumens, thicker arterial walls, and more vascular smooth muscle cells remaining in the walls than those in the wild type decidua, indicating impaired remodeling of maternal arteries. These results indicate that HtrA1 plays important roles in the differentiation of trophoblasts from Tpbpa-positive precursors in the ectoplacental cone.

Alternative cell sources such as mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stromal cells have also been tested in pre-clinical animal models and in clinical trials due to their relative ease of harvest, rapid expansion in vitro, minimal immunogenicity, and capacity to integrate and survive within host tissues, thereby overcoming many of the challenges faced by culturing of human Schwann cells and nerve allografting. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived Schwann cells are of particular interest since they can provide abundant, patient-specific autologous Schwann cells. The majority of experimental evidence on cell-based therapies, however, has been generated using stem cell-seeded nerve guides that were developed to enhance nerve regeneration across \"gaps\" in neural repair. Although primary end-to-end repair is the preferred method of neurorrhaphy in reconstructive transplantation, mechanistic studies elucidating the principles of cell-based therapies from nerve guidance conduits will form the foundation of further research employing stem cells in end-to-end repair of donor and recipient nerves. This review presents key components of nerve regeneration in reconstructive transplantation and highlights the pre-clinical studies that utilize stem cells to enhance nerve regeneration.", "journal": "Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis", "date": "2014-11-28", "authors": ["SaamiKhalifian", "Karim ASarhane", "MarkusTammia", "ZuhaibIbrahim", "Hai-QuanMao", "Damon SCooney", "Jaimie TShores", "W P AndrewLee", "GeraldBrandacher"], "doi": "10.1007/s00005-014-0323-9"}
{"title": "Circulating endothelial progenitor cell: a promising biomarker in clinical oncology.", "abstract": "Human cancers are endowed with sustained vascularization capability, and their growth, invasion, and metastasis are vascularization dependent. Recently, accumulated body of evidence suggests that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can support vasculogenesis and induce angiogenesis through paracrine mechanisms. In addition, numerous clinical studies have revealed the increase in the number of EPCs in the peripheral blood of cancer patients and demonstrated the correlation of circulating EPCs (CEPCs) with the clinical outcomes. This review highlights current enrichment procedures and methods for the detection of CEPCs and different biomarkers to identify CEPCs as well as the functions of EPCs in tumor vascularization. Furthermore, we systematically review available studies on the clinical relevance of CEPCs in cancer patients to explore the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of CEPCs. Although several contrasting results exist, CEPCs can conceivably serve as a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and treatment response indication in the future. Additionally, further well-designed clinical studies with larger sample size and unique, specific enumeration procedures are warranted to achieve further insight into the clinical implications of CEPCs.", "journal": "Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)", "date": "2014-11-28", "authors": ["Yu-ZhengGe", "RanWu", "Tian-ZeLu", "HuiXin", "PengYu", "YanZhao", "HaoLiu", "ZhengXu", "Lu-WeiXu", "Jiang-WeiShen", "XiaoXu", "Liu-HuaZhou", "Wen-ChengLi", "Jia-GengZhu", "Rui-PengJia"], "doi": "10.1007/s12032-014-0332-x"}

Parasitic liver lesions were examined regarding number, size, morphology, vascularization and metabolic activity.\n36 patients with medically-treated HAE were included in this prospective clinical study. Abdominal ultrasound and CEUS were carried out using ultrasound contrast amplifier SonoVue\u00ae. As part of monitoring, patients were examined by 18F-FDG-PET-CT. Quantitative analysis of CEUS was performed using the Software VueBox\u2122 Quantification Toolbox. Maximum contrast enhancement in lesions peak enhancement (PE) was used as parameter. For quantification of 18F-FDG PET-CT, maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) of lesions was specified and statistically compared with PE.\n18F-FDG uptake in parasitic liver lesions was diagnosed by 18F-FDG PET-CT in 32 of 36 patients. Vascularization of liver lesions was detected by CEUS in 22 of 32 FDG-positive patients with sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 100%. Mean maximum diameter of lesions was 69.5mm in CEUS and 63.7mm in B-scan ultrasound (p < 0.0001). No significant correlation was found between SUVmax and PE (p = 0.8879).\nIn comparison to FDG PET-CT, the gold standard for detecting viable lesions by depicting metabolism, CEUS detects viable lesions with high specificity and moderate sensitivity by showing vascularization. CEUS must be regarded as an important tool in monitoring HAE. Dimensions of parasitic lesions are displayed more precisely through CEUS than in B-scan.

We hypothesized that cell-sheet transplantation covered with an omentum-flap would effectively establish mature blood vessels and improve coronary microcirculation physiology, enhancing the therapeutic effects of cell-sheet therapy. Rats were divided into four groups after coronary ligation; skeletal myoblast cell-sheet plus omentum-flap (combined), cell-sheet only, omentum-flap only, and sham operation. At 4 weeks after the treatment, the combined group showed attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and a greater amount of functionally (CD31(+)/lectin(+)) and structurally (CD31(+)/\u03b1-SMA(+)) mature blood vessels, along with myocardial upregulation of relevant genes. Synchrotron-based microangiography revealed that the combined procedure increased vascularization in resistance arterial vessels with better dilatory responses to endothelium-dependent agents. Serial (13)N-ammonia PET showed better global coronary flow reserve in the combined group, mainly attributed to improvement in the basal left ventricle.

Vascularization is often identified as a main technological barrier for building 3D organs. As such, the fabrication of 3D biological vascular trees is of great importance for the overall feasibility of the envisioned organ printing approach. In this study, vascular-like cellular structures are fabricated using a liquid support-based inkjet printing approach, which utilizes a calcium chloride solution as both a cross-linking agent and support material. This solution enables the freeform printing of spanning and overhang features by providing a buoyant force. A heuristic approach is implemented to compensate for the axially-varying deformation of horizontal tubular structures to achieve a uniform diameter along their axial directions. Vascular-like structures with both horizontal and vertical bifurcations have been successfully printed from sodium alginate only as well as mouse fibroblast-based alginate bioinks.

In particular, recent evidence-based algorithms for skull base reconstruction suggest that use of pedicled flaps for clival defects and high-flow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks may reduce the incidence of postoperative CSF leaks. The primary workhorse continues to be the nasoseptal flap (NSF); however, other options exist in cases wherein this flap is unavailable because of prior sacrifice or unable to reach the area of interest (e.g., defects adjacent to the frontal recess).\nAdoption of vascularized pedicled flaps over the last decade, particularly the recently popularized NSF, has greatly reduced complications associated with endoscopic skull base surgery. The need for vascularized flap reconstruction is governed primarily by defect size and location, and by the presence of a high-flow CSF leak. Additional vascularized flaps can be used in conjunction with the NSF, or as an alternative when the NSF is unfavorable or unavailable.", "journal": "Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery", "date": "2014-11-22", "authors": ["Matthew JClavenna", "Justin HTurner", "Rakesh KChandra"], "doi": "10.1097/MOO.0000000000000115"}

A mandibular osteotomy was performed, and an external fixator device was installed. From postoperative days 4 through 12, rats underwent a gradual 5.1-mm distraction followed by a 28-day consolidation period.

For deciding the most appropriate surgical strategy, surgeons need detailed preoperative neuroimaging. The vicinity of the tumor with the vital and highly functional neurovascular structures, tumor extensions into the basal cisterns and skull base structures, and the arterial vascularization and venous drainage pathways, as they shape operative strategy, are important preoperative data to take into account. Thin section CT scan with bone windows, 3D spiral CT reconstruction, MRI, MR angiography, and DSA performed with selective arteriography including late venous phases give those required detailed informations about the tumor and its relation with neurovascular and bony structures. The type of craniotomy and complementary osteotomy and the usefulness of an extradural anterior clinoidectomy with unroofing the optic canal can be decided from preoperative neuroimaging. Data collected also help in determining whether extensive exposure of the middle cranial fossa is necessary to ensure substantial devascularization of the tumor and whether proximal control of the internal carotid artery (ICA) at its intrapetrosal portion might be useful. Study of the capacity of blood supply of the Willis circle is wise for deciding the need and way of performing an extra-intracranial bypass together with tumor removal. Currently the concept of operating only the tumors with extracavernous extensions and to limit resection to only their extracavernous portions is the most accepted way of treating these tumors.

A vascular etiology has been proposed, but there is controversy regarding the existence of a hypovascular region that may render the tendon vulnerable. The purpose of this study was to provide a description of the arterial anatomy supplying the tibialis posterior tendon.\nSixty adult cadaveric lower extremities were obtained from a university-affiliated body donation program. Thirty specimens obtained within 72 hours of death were used for microscopic analysis. Thirty specimens were previously frozen and used for macroscopic analysis. The tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneal arteries were injected with India Ink and Ward's Blue Latex. The specimens used for macroscopic analysis were debrided with sodium hypochlorite to expose the extratendinous anatomy. For the microscopic analysis, the tendon was cleared using a modified Sp\u00e4lteholz technique to expose the intratendinous vascular anatomy.\nMacroscopically, an average of 2.5 \u00b1 0.7 vessels entered the tendon proximal to the navicular insertion. In all, 28/30 (93.3%) specimens had a vessel entering 4.1 \u00b1 0.6 cm proximal to the medial malleolus and 24/30 (80.0%) specimens had a vessel entering 1.7 \u00b1 0.9 cm distal to the medial malleolus.

Traditional histological as well as immunohistochemical methods have been used.\nThe study reveals that the occurrence of blood capillaries in surface squamous epithelium is an ordinary event, both in healthy persons and in peritumoral regions of the patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Glandular epithelial coverings, as well as transitional epithelium, do not contain blood vessels. In squamous epithelium, only basal cells are in contact with the membrane and underlying stroma, the cells of the upper layer receiving nutrients through diffusion. Thus, the cells of squamous epithelium are more vulnerable to blood deficiency, since for instance in the pseudo-multilayered respiratory epithelium each cell is attached directly to the basal membrane and has more ample access to the blood supply. Metaplastic squamous epithelium has a markedly reduced vascularization and seems to be more sensitive to carcinogenic stimuli. High-grade dysplastic squamous epithelium and carcinoma in situ do not contain blood vessels.\nThe process of redistribution of vascular network occurring at the interface of epithelial-stromal frontier plays an important role in maintaining the adequate metabolism of cells including those of epithelial covering.

Porcine skin shares many physical properties with human skin, but is susceptible to hyperacute rejection due to preformed antibodies to \u03b1-1,3-galactose (Gal), a carbohydrate on all porcine cells. Our preliminary studies have suggested that skin grafts from \u03b1-1,3-galactosyltransferase knock out (GalT-KO) miniature swine might provide temporary wound coverage comparable to allografts, since GalT-KO swine lack this carbohydrate. To further evaluate this possibility, eight non-human primates received primary autologous, allogeneic, GalT-KO, and GalT+xenogeneic skin grafts. Additionally, secondary grafts were placed to assess whether sensitization would affect the rejection time course of identical-type grafts. We demonstrate that both GalT-KO xenografts and allografts provide temporary coverage of partial- and full-thickness wounds for up to 11 days. In contrast, GalT+xenografts displayed hyperacute rejection, with no signs of vascularization and rapid avulsion from wounds. Furthermore, secondary GalT-KO transplants failed to vascularize, demonstrating that primary graft rejection sensitizes the recipient. We conclude that GalT-KO xenografts may provide temporary coverage of wounds for a duration equivalent to allografts, and thus, could serve as a readily available alternative treatment of severe burns.", "journal": "Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries", "date": "2014-11-20", "authors": ["Angelo ALeto Barone", "MelissaMastroianni", "Evan AFarkash", "ChristopherMallard", "AlexanderAlbritton", "RadbehTorabi", "David ALeonard", "Josef MKurtz", "David HSachs", "Curtis LCetrulo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.burns.2014.09.003"}

Surprisingly, only BM-derived MSCs spontaneously formed a BM cavity through a vascularized cartilage intermediate in vivo that was progressively replaced by hematopoietic tissue and bone. Only BM-derived MSCs exhibited a chondrogenic transcriptional program with hypomethylation and increased expression of RUNX3, RUNX2, BGLAP, MMP13, and ITGA10 consistent with a latent and primed skeletal developmental potential.

{"title": "An epiallele at cly1 affects the expression of floret closing (cleistogamy) in barley.", "abstract": "The swelling of the lodicule is responsible for floret opening in many grass species, allowing for pollen dispersal and cross-pollination. In barley, the closed floret habit (cleistogamy) is under the control of cly1, a gene that operates by inhibiting the development of the lodicule. In non-cleistogamous cultivars, cly1 mRNA is degraded by miR172-directed cleavage, allowing the lodicules to swell; however, in cultivars carrying the recessive allele cly1.b, a single-nucleotide substitution destroys the miR172 target site preventing mRNA cleavage. Barley cv. SV235 is cleistogamous; its cly1 coding sequence is identical to that of cly1.b, but its lodicules do develop, although insufficiently to produce a non-cleistogamous flower.

Eighty kV DE as well as reconstructed 120\u2009kV equivalent DE datasets were evaluated in comparison to correlating digital subtraction angiography (DSA) datasets. Two radiologists evaluated in consensus the delineation of liver arteries and extrahepatic non-target vessels utilizing a 4-point scale (4\u2009=\u2009excellent delineation; 1\u2009=\u2009non-diagnostic). In addition, the arterial vascularization of liver segment IV was evaluated and classified: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR; liver arteries to adjacent liver tissue) were obtained via ROI analysis.\nBoth imaging techniques (DECT, DSA) enabled high-quality assessment of all analyzed liver arteries. Out of the two CT datasets, 80\u2009kVp-DE datasets offered superior delineation of the right gastric artery (3.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 vs. 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5), the vascularization of segment IV (3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 vs. 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5) as well as potential extrahepatic non-target vessels (3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 vs. 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5). In accordance to the results of the qualitative analysis, 80\u2009kVp-DE datasets also yielded higher SNR (34.84 vs. 29.31) and CNR (28.29 vs. 21.8) values in comparison to the 120\u2009kVp datasets.\nEighty kVp DECT enables a significantly better assessment of the arteries of the upper abdomen for therapy planning in comparison to correlating 120\u2009kVp datasets.

However the correct dosage of adipose SVF cells required to achieve a functional vasculature has not been established. Accordingly, in vitro and in vivo dose response assays were performed evaluating the SVF cell vasculogenic potential. Serial dilutions of freshly isolated rat adipose SVF cells were plated on growth factor reduced Matrigel and vasculogenesis, assessed as cellular tube-like network assembly, was quantified after 3 days of culture. This in vitro vasculogenesis assay indicated that rat SVF cells reached maximum network length at a concentration of 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910(5) cells/ml and network maintained at the higher concentrations tested. The same concentrations of rat and human SVF cells were used to evaluate vasculogenesis in vivo. SVF cells were incorporated into collagen gels and subcutaneously implanted into Rag1 immunodeficient mice. The 3D confocal images of harvested constructs were evaluated to quantify dose dependency of SVF cell vasculogenesis potential.

However, the contribution of these non-glycolytic functions in tumor progression remains poorly defined. Here, we show that elevated expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), but not of other glycolytic enzymes tested, increased aggressiveness and vascularization of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Elevated GAPDH expression was found to promote nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation via binding to tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2), enhancing the transcription and the activity of hypoxia-inducing factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). Consistent with this, inactive mutants of GAPDH failed to bind TRAF2, enhance HIF-1 activity or promote lymphomagenesis. Furthermore, elevated expression of gapdh mRNA in biopsies from diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients correlated with high levels of hif-1\u03b1, vegf-a, nfkbia mRNA and CD31 staining.

The potential of AR navigation as a tool to improve safety of the surgical dissection is outlined for robotic hepatectomy.\nThree patients underwent a fully robotic and AR-assisted hepatic segmentectomy. The 3D virtual anatomical model was obtained using a thoracoabdominal CT scan with a customary software (VR-RENDER\u00ae, IRCAD). The model was then processed using a VR-RENDER\u00ae plug-in application, the Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP\u00ae, IRCAD), to delineate surgical resection planes including the elective ligature of vascular structures. Deformations associated with pneumoperitoneum were also simulated. The virtual model was superimposed to the operative field.

{"title": "Patterning vascular networks in vivo for tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "The ultimate design of functionally therapeutic engineered tissues and organs will rely on our ability to engineer vasculature that can meet tissue-specific metabolic needs. We recently introduced an approach for patterning the formation of functional spatially organized vascular architectures within engineered tissues in vivo. Here, we now explore the design parameters of this approach and how they impact the vascularization of an engineered tissue construct after implantation. We used micropatterning techniques to organize endothelial cells (ECs) into geometrically defined \"cords,\" which in turn acted as a template after implantation for the guided formation of patterned capillaries integrated with the host tissue. We demonstrated that the diameter of the cords before implantation impacts the location and density of the resultant capillary network. Inclusion of mural cells to the vascularization response appears primarily to impact the dynamics of vascularization. We established that clinically relevant endothelial sources such as induced pluripotent stem cell-derived ECs and human microvascular endothelial cells can drive vascularization within this system. Finally, we demonstrated the ability to control the juxtaposition of parenchyma with perfused vasculature by implanting cords containing a mixture of both a parenchymal cell type (hepatocytes) and ECs.

Previous studies reported reconstruction with flaps including \"vascularized\" nerves; however, few have evaluated blood supply to these nerves. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess blood perfusion to nerves included in anterolateral thigh (ALT) flaps by indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography.\nParticipants comprised eight patients who underwent reconstructive surgery with nerve defects using free ALT flaps, including the vastus lateralis motor nerve and/or femoral cutaneous nerve. Intraoperative ICG fluorescent angiography was performed. Time after the drug injection and the intensity of fluorescence in these nerves were analyzed as time-intensity curves. Maximum intensity (Imax), time to Imax (Tmax), and time at the beginning of intensity elevation (Te) were measured at three points: Point C, the central portion of the flap-attached region of the nerve; Point P, 2 cm from the proximal flap-attached edge; and Point D, 2 cm from the distal edge.\nImax and Te at point C and Imax/Tmax-Te at point P were significantly different between these two nerves (p\u2009=\u20090.03125, p\u2009=\u20090.02895, p\u2009=\u20090.03125, respectively). Fluorescence in the vastus lateralis motor nerve was slightly quicker and stronger than that in the femoral cutaneous nerve, and also exhibited an axial pattern of fluorescence.\nIntraoperative ICG fluorescent angiography can be used to determine which nerve is better for nerve reconstruction.

{"title": "Adenosine stimulates angiogenesis by up-regulating production of thrombospondin-1 by macrophages.", "abstract": "Increase of blood capillary density at the interface between normal and ischemic tissue after acute MI reduces infarct size and improves cardiac function. Cardiac injury triggers the production of the matricellular component TSP-1, but its role in angiogenesis is not clear, as both anti- and proangiogenic properties have been reported. It is unknown whether TSP-1 is modulated by other factors released during cardiac injury. Among these, Ado is a well-known promoter of angiogenesis. This study determined whether Ado modulates TSP-1 expression and the implication on angiogenesis. Ado dose dependently increased the production of TSP-1 by human macrophages. With the use of agonists and antagonists of AdoRs, coupled to RNA interference, we observed that this effect is mediated via A2AR and A2BR. The Ado effect was reproduced by cholera toxin (Gs protein activator) and forskolin (adenylate cyclase activator) and blocked by the PKA inhibitor H89. Conditioned medium from Ado-treated macrophages stimulated microvessel outgrowth from aortic ring explants by 400%, and induced vessel formation in matrigel plugs. Microvessel outgrowth and vessel formation were blocked completely by addition of anti-TSP-1 antibodies to conditioned medium. Chronic administration of Ado to rats after MI maintained long-term expression of TSP-1 in the infarct border zone, and this was associated with enhanced border-zone vascularization. Ado up-regulates TSP-1 production by macrophages, resulting in stimulation of angiogenesis. The mechanism involves A2AR and A2BR and is mediated through the cAMP/PKA pathway. This information may be important when designing Ado-based therapies of angiogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of leukocyte biology", "date": "2014-11-13", "authors": ["IsabelleErnens", "M\u00e9lanieBousquenaud", "B\u00e9n\u00e9dicteLenoir", "YvanDevaux", "Daniel RWagner"], "doi": "10.1189/jlb.3HI0514-249RR"}

Histologic, histochemical, immunhistologic, and histomorphometric analysis methodologies were applied. The dermis-derived material underwent an early degradation while inducing mononuclear cells together with some multinucleated giant cells and mild vascularization. The pericardium-derived membrane induced 2 different cellular tissue reactions. The compact surface induced mononuclear cells and multinucleated giant cells, and underwent a complete degradation until day 30. The spongy surface of the membrane induced mainly mononuclear cells, and served as a stable barrier membrane for up to 60 days. No transmembranous vascularization was observed within the spongy material surface layer. The present data demonstrate the diversity of the cellular tissue reaction toward collagen-based materials from different tissues.

Sub-millimeter collagen modules containing adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (adMSC) and enveloped by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were subcutaneously implanted in severe-combined immunodeficient mice with a beige-mutation (SCID-bg) mice. Implant volume and cell density was varied relative to a base case, defined as a 0.01\u2009mL implant containing 1.5\u00d710(7) adMSC/mL and 3.9\u00d710(6) HUVEC/mL. At 7 and 14 days post-transplantation, the constructs were harvested for immunohistochemical analysis of total (CD31(+)) and graft-derived (UEA1(+)) vessel formation, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1\u03b1) expression, infiltration of host-derived leukocytes (CD45), and macrophages (F4/80). Implant volume and cell density affected the relative contributions of host- versus graft-derived vascularization, highlighting that different mechanisms underlie the two processes. Graft-derived vessel formation was most rapid and robust in implants with high HIF1\u03b1 expression, namely large volume implants and implants with high adMSC and HUVEC density (p<0.01 compared to base case at day 7). Many HIF1\u03b1(+) cells were vessel-lining HUVEC, suggesting that HIF1 activation may be key to vessel assembly in the graft. Host vessel ingrowth, however, dominated the vascularization of small volume implants (of high and low adMSC density alike), which showed low HIF1\u03b1 expression at day 7. Host vessels were sustained to day 14 when adMSC density alone was increased, presumably due to increased paracrine secretions. This study points to a potential role of HIF1 activation in the vascularization of tissue constructs, which may be harnessed to engineer robust vessels for therapeutic applications.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

In this study, we demonstrate that adipose PHD2 inhibition plays a key role in the suppression of adipocyte lipolysis. Adipose Phd2 gene ablation in mice enhanced adiposity, with a parallel increase in adipose vascularization associated with reduced circulating nonesterified fatty acid levels and normal glucose homeostasis. Phd2 gene-depleted adipocytes exhibited lower basal lipolysis in normoxia and reduced \u03b2-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis in both normoxia and hypoxia. A selective PHD inhibitor suppressed lipolysis in murine and human adipocytes in vitro and in vivo in mice. PHD2 genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition attenuated protein levels of the key lipolytic effectors hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), suggesting a link between adipocyte oxygen sensing and fatty acid release. PHD2 mRNA levels correlated positively with mRNA levels of AB-hydrolase domain containing-5, an activator of ATGL, and negatively with mRNA levels of lipid droplet proteins, perilipin, and TIP47 in human subcutaneous adipose tissue.

Knowledge of blood flow from the main tributaries of the portal vein (PV) is necessary to explain the preferential sites of secondary lesions within the liver based on the site of the initial malignant lesion. How these flows come together was established in an earlier ex vivo study. Here, we highlight in vivo the blood flows from the main PV tributaries and their distribution in the liver of normal dogs. Portographs of the main PV tributaries were obtained in seven dogs after injection of an angiographic contrast medium. After euthanasia, the livers and their portal vascularization (PV and tributaries) were extracted for a comparative corrosion cast study. Flows were demonstrated in the cranial mesenteric vein, caudal mesenteric vein and splenic vein. However, no proper flow could be distinguished for the gastroduodenal and ileocolic veins. All these tributaries primarily supply the lateral liver lobes (right or left). Most of our observations indicate that the cranial mesenteric, caudal mesenteric and splenic veins primarily supply the right lateral lobe and the caudate process of the caudate lobe and secondarily the left lateral lobe, left medial lobe and the quadrate lobe.

In the present study, hBMSCs and hPCs were co-cultured from the same donors, as the cellular source. In monolayer cultivation, co-culturing hBMSCs and hPCs demonstrated more robust mineralized nodule formation and stronger alkaline phosphatase (ALP) positive staining than hBMSCs or hPCs. Three-dimensional (3-D) culturing on porous \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) scaffolds and co-culturing of hBMSCs and hPCs significantly promoted the osteogenic specific mRNA expression of COL1\u03b11, BMP-2, osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OC).

{"title": "Incorporation of a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor into scaffolds: a strategy for stimulating vascularization.", "abstract": "Clinical applications of tissue engineering are constrained by the ability of the implanted construct to invoke vascularization in adequate extent and velocity. To overcome the current limitations presented by local delivery of single angiogenic factors, we explored the incorporation of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (PHIs) into scaffolds as an alternative vascularization strategy. PHIs are small molecule drugs that can stabilize the alpha subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a key transcription factor that regulates a variety of angiogenic mechanisms. In this study, we conjugated the PHI pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (PDCA) through amide bonds to a gelatin sponge (Gelfoam(\u00ae)). Fibroblasts cultured on PDCA-Gelfoam were able to infiltrate and proliferate in these scaffolds while secreting significantly more vascular endothelial growth factor than cells grown on Gelfoam without PDCA. Reporter cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged HIF-1\u03b1 exhibited dose-dependent stabilization of this angiogenic transcription factor when growing within PDCA-Gelfoam constructs. Subsequently, we implanted PDCA-Gelfoam scaffolds into the perirenal fat tissue of Sprague Dawley rats for 8 days. Immunostaining of explants revealed that the PDCA-Gelfoam scaffolds were amply infiltrated by cells and promoted vascular ingrowth in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the incorporation of PHIs into scaffolds appears to be a feasible strategy for improving vascularization in regenerative medicine applications.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Recently, we synthesized an aliphatic polyurethane (PU) scaffold via a foaming method using non-toxic components. Through this procedure a uniform interconnected porous structure was created. Furthermore, hydroxyapatite (HA) particles were introduced into this process to increase the bioactivity of the PU matrix. To evaluate the biological performances of these PU-based scaffolds, their influence on in vitro cellular behavior and in vivo bone forming capacity of the engineered cell-scaffold constructs was investigated in this study. A simulated body fluid test demonstrated that the incorporation of 40 wt % HA particles significantly promoted the biomineralization ability of the PU scaffolds. Enhanced in vitro proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of the seeded mesenchymal stem cells were also observed on the PU/HA composite. Next, the cell-scaffold constructs were implanted subcutaneously in a nude mice model. After 8 weeks, a considerable amount of vascularized bone tissue with initial marrow stroma development was generated in both PU and PU/HA40 scaffold.

In this article, we identified potassium antimonyl tartrate (PAT), an antiparasitic drug, as a novel agent to block angiogenesis by screening US Food and Drug Administration-approved chemical drugs. By comparing the cytotoxicity of PAT in various nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with that observed in primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we found that HUVECs were much more sensitive to the PAT treatment. In in vivo tumor xenograft mouse models established either by PAT-resistant A549 cells or by patient primary tumors, PAT significantly decreased the tumor volume and tumor weight of NSCLC xenografts at dosage of 40 mg/kg (i.p., daily) and, more importantly, augmented the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin chemotherapy. Remarkable loss of vascularization in the treated xenografts indicated the in vivo antiangiogenesis property of PAT, which was well correlated with its tumor growth inhibition in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, in the in vitro angiogenic assays, PAT exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation in response to different stimuli. Consistently, PAT also abolished the vascular endothelial cell growth factor-induced angiogenesis in the Matrigel plugs assay. Mechanistically, we found that PAT inhibited the activities of several receptor tyrosine kinases and specifically blocked the activation of downstream Src and focal adhesion kinases in HUVECs. Taken together, our results characterized the novel antiangiogenic and antitumor function of PAT in NSCLC cells. Further study of PAT in anticancer clinical trials may be warranted.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2014-10-30", "authors": ["BeibeiWang", "WeiweiYu", "JiaweiGuo", "XingwuJiang", "WeiqiangLu", "MingyaoLiu", "XiufengPang"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.114.218644"}

{"title": "Evaluation of microvasculature at the auditory midbrain--the benefits of sectioning at a tangential angle.", "abstract": "Vascular remodeling in the brain occurs as a plastic change following neural over-activity. The auditory midbrain (or inferior colliculus, IC) is an ideal place to study sound-induced vascular changes because it is the brain's most vascularized structure and it is tonotopically organized. However, its micro-vascular pattern remains poorly understood. Since the IC is a sphere-like structure, the histological assessment of vasculature could depend on the angle of sectioning. Here, we studied the effects of cutting the IC at different angles on microvascular assessment, specifically: micro-vascular density and the shape of microvascular lumen. Photomicrographs were taken from 5 \u00b5m toluidine blue-stained histological sections obtained at two angles of sectioning: (a) the conventional coronal sectioning, and (b) a novel \"tangential\" sectioning (tangential to the dorso-medial surface of the IC). Results showed that the tangential sections, in comparison with the coronal sections, yielded (a) a higher count of micro-vascular density and (b) a higher proportion of round-shaped micro-vascular lumens. This discrepancy in results between two cut angles is likely related to the spatial pattern of blood vessels supplying the IC. We propose that the tangential sectioning should be adopted as standard for the accurate study of microvasculature in the IC.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2014-10-29", "authors": ["Edmund CheungSo", "Hui-PinLu", "Chung HsiHsing", "Sheng NanWu", "Yu-KaiChang", "Paul W FPoon"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.22450"}
{"title": "Biological strategies for improved osseointegration and osteoinduction of porous metal orthopedic implants.", "abstract": "The biological interface between an orthopedic implant and the surrounding host tissue may have a dramatic effect upon clinical outcome. Desired effects include bony ingrowth (osseointegration), stimulation of osteogenesis (osteoinduction), increased vascularization, and improved mechanical stability. Implant loosening, fibrous encapsulation, corrosion, infection, and inflammation, as well as physical mismatch may have deleterious clinical effects. This is particularly true of implants used in the reconstruction of load-bearing synovial joints such as the knee, hip, and the shoulder. The surfaces of orthopedic implants have evolved from solid-smooth to roughened-coarse and most recently, to porous in an effort to create a three-dimensional architecture for bone apposition and osseointegration. Total joint surgeries are increasingly performed in younger individuals with a longer life expectancy, and therefore, the postimplantation lifespan of devices must increase commensurately. This review discusses advancements in biomaterials science and cell-based therapies that may further improve orthopedic success rates. We focus on material and biological properties of orthopedic implants fabricated from porous metal and highlight some relevant developments in stem-cell research. We posit that the ideal primary and revision orthopedic load-bearing metal implants are highly porous and may be chemically modified to induce stem cell growth and osteogenic differentiation, while minimizing inflammation and infection. We conclude that integration of new biological, chemical, and mechanical methods is likely to yield more effective strategies to control and modify the implant-bone interface and thereby improve long-term clinical outcomes.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "ER\u03b2 decreases breast cancer cell survival by regulating the IRE1/XBP-1 pathway.", "abstract": "Unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive reaction that allows cancer cells to survive endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress that is often induced in the tumor microenvironment because of inadequate vascularization. Previous studies report an association between activation of the UPR and reduced sensitivity to antiestrogens and chemotherapeutics in estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1)-positive and triple-negative breast cancers, respectively. ER\u03b1 has been shown to regulate the expression of a key mediator of the EnR stress response, the X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1). Although network prediction models have associated ER\u03b2 with the EnR stress response, its role as regulator of the UPR has not been experimentally tested. Here, upregulation of wild-type ER\u03b2 (ER\u03b21) or treatment with ER\u03b2 agonists enhanced apoptosis in breast cancer cells in the presence of pharmacological inducers of EnR stress. Targeting the BCL-2 to the EnR of the ER\u03b21-expressing cells prevented the apoptosis induced by EnR stress but not by non-EnR stress apoptotic stimuli indicating that ER\u03b21 promotes EnR stress-regulated apoptosis. Downregulation of inositol-requiring kinase 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) and decreased splicing of XBP-1 were associated with the decreased survival of the EnR-stressed ER\u03b21-expressing cells. ER\u03b21 was found to repress the IRE1 pathway of the UPR by inducing degradation of IRE1\u03b1. These results suggest that the ability of ER\u03b21 to target the UPR may offer alternative treatment strategies for breast cancer.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2014-10-28", "authors": ["GRajapaksa", "FNikolos", "IBado", "RClarke", "J-\u00c5Gustafsson", "CThomas"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2014.343"}

We report a case of a vascularized sural nerve graft based on a peroneal artery perforator for immediate reconstruction after the removal of intraosseous neuroma originating in the inferior alveolar nerve. The patient had a neuroma caused by iatrogenic injury to the inferior alveolar nerve. A 4-cm long neuroma existed in the inferior alveolar nerve and was resected. A peroneal perforator was chosen as the pedicle of the vascularized sural nerve graft for the nerve gap. The graft including the skin paddle for monitoring the perfusion supplied by this perforator was transferred to the lesion. The nerve gap between the two stumps of the inferior alveolar nerve was repaired using the 6-cm long vascularized sural nerve. The perforator of the peroneal artery was anastomosed to the branch of the facial artery in a perforator-to-perforator fashion. There was no need to sacrifice any main arteries. The skin paddle with 1 cm \u00d7 3 cm in size was inset into the incised medial neck. Perceptual function tests with a Semmes-Weinstein pressure esthesiometer and two-point discrimination in the lower lip and chin at 10 months after surgery showed recovery almost to the level of the normal side.

{"title": "Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 Adsorption onto Poly-\u025b-caprolactone Better Preserves Bioactivity In Vitro and Produces More Bone In Vivo than Conjugation Under Clinically Relevant Loading Scenarios.", "abstract": "One strategy to reconstruct large bone defects is to prefabricate a vascularized flap by implanting a biomaterial scaffold with associated biologics into the latissimus dorsi and then transplanting this construct to the defect site after a maturation period. This strategy, similar to all clinically and regulatory feasible biologic approaches to surgical reconstruction, requires the ability to quickly (<1 h within an operating room) and efficiently bind biologics to scaffolds. It also requires the ability to localize biologic delivery. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of binding bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) to poly-\u025b-caprolactone (PCL) using adsorption and conjugation as a function of time.\nBMP2 was adsorbed (Ads) or conjugated (Conj) to PCL scaffolds with the same three-dimensional printed architecture while altering exposure time (0.5, 1, 5, and 16 h), temperature (4\u00b0C, 23\u00b0C), and BMP2 concentration (1.4, 5, 20, and 65 \u03bcg/mL). The in vitro release was quantified, and C2C12 cell alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression was used to confirm bioactivity. Scaffolds with either 65 or 20 \u03bcg/mL Ads or Conj BMP2 for 1\u2009h at 23\u00b0C were implanted subcutaneously in mice to evaluate in vivo bone regeneration. Micro-computed tomography, compression testing, and histology were performed to characterize bone regeneration.\nAfter 1 h exposure to 65\u2009\u03bcg/mL BMP2 at 23\u00b0C, Conj and Ads resulted in 12.83 \u00b1 1.78 and 10.78 \u00b1 1.49\u2009\u03bcg BMP2 attached, respectively. Adsorption resulted in a positive ALP response and had a small burst release; whereas conjugation provided a sustained release with negligible ALP production, indicating that the conjugated BMP2 may not be bioavailable. Adsorbed 65\u2009\u03bcg/mL BMP2 solution resulted in the greatest regenerated bone volume (15.0 \u00b1 3.0\u2009mm\u00b3), elastic modulus (20.1 \u00b1 3.0\u2009MPa), and %bone ingrowth in the scaffold interior (17.2% \u00b1 5.4%) when compared with conjugation.\nAdsorption may be optimal for the clinical application of prefabricating bone flaps due to BMP2 binding in a short exposure time, retained BMP2 bioactivity, and bone growth adhering to scaffold geometry and into pores with healthy marrow development.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

We herein report our investigation of the long-term efficacy of implantation of A-PBMNC produced by selective filtration to treat patients with CLI, for which surgical bypass and/or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty are not possible.\nThis is a prospective, and not a randomized, study based on a treated group who did not respond to conventional therapy (n=43) when implanted with A-PBMNC cells versus a historically matched control group. Patients of both groups were suffering from CLI Fontaine scale IV with chronic ulcers and various accompanying conditions (diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure, etc.). Treated patients were implanted with 12\u2009mL of A-PBMNC, 0.2-0.3\u2009mL for each bolus, collected by selective filtration from 120\u2009mL of peripheral blood in the ischemic area of the limbs.

The A-PBMNC group also showed reduction in pain at rest, increased maximum walking distance, and healing of the wound, which led to an overall improvement in the quality of life. Post-treatment radiological studies showed an improvement of vascularization with the formation of new collateral and by histological findings.

{"title": "Fibroblast-endothelial partners for vascularization strategies in tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Cell-based approaches have emerged as a promising therapy to achieve successful vascularization in tissue engineering. Since fibroblasts activation and migration is required for physiological events relying on angiogenesis, we hypothesize herein that different fibroblasts exhibit distinct capacity to promote capillary-like structures assembly, by mature and progenitor endothelial cells (ECs). Outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) were isolated from human umbilical cord blood samples and characterized by immunofluorescence and imaging flow cytometry for endothelial markers. Coculture systems were established using either human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) or OECs with fibroblasts, being evaluated at 7, 14, and 21 days of culture. Two types of human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were used, namely neonatal human foreskin fibroblasts-1 (HFF-1) and juvenile HDF. OECs expressed EC markers and formed capillary-like structures. HFF-1 exhibited higher expression of transglutaminase-2, while HDF exhibited a higher expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and podoplanin, which were not observed for HFF-1. Formation of capillary-like structures was only observed in cocultures with HDF and not with HFF-1. No significant differences were found between HDF and OECs or HUVECs cocultures. These findings suggest that HDF is a preferential cell source for promoting vascularization, either using mature or progenitor ECs, probably due to their higher expression of \u03b1-SMA and podoplanin, and increased synthesis of extracellular matrix.

{"title": "Injury risk to extraosseous knee vasculature during osteotomies: a cadaveric study with CT and dissection analysis.", "abstract": "Realignment osteotomies about the knee may be performed as distal femoral or proximal tibial osteotomies; both may be performed either on the medial or lateral sides of the knee, in closing- or opening-wedge fashion. Although rare, injury to neurovascular structures may occur, and the proximity of the vascular structures to the osteotomy saw cuts has been incompletely characterized.\nWe performed a cadaver study to assess the risk of vascular injury in patients undergoing realignment osteotomies by (1) quantifying the distances between osteotomy saw cuts and blood vessels using three-dimensional CT reconstruction after distal femoral and proximal tibial osteotomies; and (2) qualitatively describing the small- and medium-sized vasculature around the knee, to provide the link between the CT analysis and wedge incision measures, and better show the potential extraosseous supply to the regions investigated.\nTwelve human cadaveric knees were injected with a latex and barium sulfate suspension into the superficial femoral artery. Each specimen underwent CT to evaluate vascular perfusion and was randomized to either a lateral opening-wedge distal femoral osteotomy and medial opening-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy group, or a medial closing-wedge distal femoral osteotomy and lateral closing-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy group. Postoperatively, knees underwent CT in extension to measure the shortest distance between the osteotomies and the popliteal artery, anterior and posterior tibial arteries, and genicular arteries. Vessels between 5 mm and 10 mm from the osteotomy cut were considered in a zone of moderate risk for damage, while vessels less than 5 mm from the cut were considered in a zone of high risk for damage. Vessels more than 10 mm from the cut were not considered to be at risk. Subsequently, knees underwent dissection and chemical d\u00e9bridement to qualitatively describe the smaller vessels. This part of the study added visual information and gave a comprehensive overview of the vessels at risk.\nAll variations of the osteotomies put at least one artery at risk. The popliteal artery was found in a risk zone for injury in two specimens during closing-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (median distance, 11.6 mm; range, 5.2-14.6 mm). The superior lateral genicular artery was in a risk zone in all the specimens during opening-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (median distance, 3.0 mm; range, 0.7-6.5 mm), and in five specimens during closing-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (median distance, 4.5 mm; range, 1.3-11.2 mm). A concomitant risk for superior medial genicular artery injury was observed in five specimens during opening-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (median distance, 8.7 mm; range, 0.8-13.9 mm) and in four specimens during closing-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (median distance, 4.1; range, 0.5-41.7 mm). The popliteal artery was in a risk zone in four specimens during opening-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy (median distance, 9.6 mm; range, 6.6-12.9 mm), and in three specimens during closing wedge proximal tibial osteotomy (median distance, 9.6 mm; range, 4.4-11 mm). The inferior medial genicular artery could be classified at risk in five specimens during opening-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy (median distance, 2.1 mm; range, 0.3-32 mm) and in five specimens during closing-wedge proximal tibial osteotomy (median distance, 5.8 mm; range, 1.4-13 mm). Furthermore, the inferior lateral genicular artery was found in a risk zone in two specimens of closing-wedge proximal tibial osteotomies (median distance, 17.4 mm; range, 8-23.3 mm). There were no differences between opening-wedge and closing-wedge distal femoral osteotomies and proximal tibial osteotomies in the vessels at risk during the procedure. After chemical d\u00e9bridement, knees showed abundant vascularization of the distal femur and lateral tibia, whereas the medial tibia contained few arteries.\nWith the numbers available, we found that none of the osteotomy techniques performed was safer than any other in terms of the proximity of the major arterial structures and some vessels appear to be at relatively high risk during these procedures.\nThis study clarifies that the genicular arteries on the opposite side of the surgical field, which cannot be seen and protected during the procedure, can be at risk of injury, particularly when the cortical hinge is compromised.

We examined the vascularization process of lung metastasis in six different preclinical models and found that the tumours incorporated the pre-existing alveolar capillaries (ie vessel co-option). During the initial phase of vessel co-option, the incorporated capillaries were still sheathed by pneumocytes, but these incorporated vessels subsequently underwent different fates dependent on the model. In five of the models examined (B16, HT1080, HT25, C26, and MAT B-III), the tumour cells gradually stripped the pneumocytes from the vessels. These dissected pneumocytes underwent fragmentation, but the incorporated microvessels survived. In the sixth model (C38), the tumour cells failed to invade the alveolar walls. Instead, they induced the development of vascularized desmoplastic tissue columns. Finally, we examined the process of arterialization in lung metastases and found that they became arterialized when their diameter grew to exceed 5\u2009mm.

{"title": "Hand-Dorsa Vein Recognition by Matching Local Features of Multisource Keypoints.", "abstract": "As an emerging biometric for people identification, the dorsal hand vein has received increasing attention in recent years due to the properties of being universal, unique, permanent, and contactless, and especially its simplicity of liveness detection and difficulty of forging. However, the dorsal hand vein is usually captured by near-infrared (NIR) sensors and the resulting image is of low contrast and shows a very sparse subcutaneous vascular network. Therefore, it does not offer sufficient distinctiveness in recognition particularly in the presence of large population. This paper proposes a novel approach to hand-dorsa vein recognition through matching local features of multiple sources. In contrast to current studies only concentrating on the hand vein network, we also make use of person dependent optical characteristics of the skin and subcutaneous tissue revealed by NIR hand-dorsa images and encode geometrical attributes of their landscapes, e.g., ridges, valleys, etc., through different quantities, such as cornerness and blobness, closely related to differential geometry. Specifically, the proposed method adopts an effective keypoint detection strategy to localize features on dorsal hand images, where the speciality of absorption and scattering of the entire dorsal hand is modeled as a combination of multiple (first-, second-, and third-) order gradients. These features comprehensively describe the discriminative clues of each dorsal hand. This method further robustly associates the corresponding keypoints between gallery and probe samples, and finally predicts the identity. Evaluated by extensive experiments, the proposed method achieves the best performance so far known on the North China University of Technology (NCUT) Part A dataset, showing its effectiveness.

This option, unfortunately, has the drawback of a lag time with blood glucose values. A good strategy to circumvent this is to enhance tissue integration and enrich the peri-implant vasculature. Implants of different optically transparent biomaterials (poly(methyl-methacrylate) [PMMA] and poly(dimethylsiloxane) [PDMS]) - enabling glucose monitoring in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum - were surface-treated and subsequently implanted in goats at various implantation sites for up to 3 months. The overall in\u00a0vivo biocompatibility, tissue integration, and vascularization at close proximity of the surfaces of these materials were assessed. Histological screening showed similar tissue reactions independent of the implantation site. No significant inflammation reaction was observed. Tissue integration and vascularization correlated, to some extent, with the biomaterial composition. A modification strategy, in which a vascular endothelial-cadherin antibody was coupled to the biomaterials surface through a dopamine layer, showed significantly enhanced vascularization 3 months after subcutaneous implantation. Our results suggest that the developed strategy enables the creation of tissue interactive NIR transparent packaging materials, opening the possibility of continuous glucose monitoring.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2014-10-12", "authors": ["KarolienGellynck", "Val\u00e9rieKodeck", "ElkeVan De Walle", "KenKersemans", "FilipDe Vos", "HeidiDeclercq", "PeterDubruel", "LievenVlaminck", "MariaCornelissen"], "doi": "10.1177/1535370214554878"}
{"title": "Regulation of endothelial permeability in the primate corpora lutea: implications for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.", "abstract": "In a developing human corpus luteum, a closely regulated cellular communication system exists between the luteal steroidogenic cells and endothelial cells. This system guaranties the vascularization process during luteal formation. The process is combined with rapid release of large amounts of progesterone into the bloodstream. The regulation of endothelial proliferation and permeability by LH and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is integral to this process. On the cellular level, endothelial permeability is regulated by intercellular junctions, such as adherens junctions (AJ) and tight junctions (TJ), which act as zipper-like structures between interacting endothelial cells. Several cell junctional proteins are localized to the corpus luteum, including Occludin, Nectin 2, Claudin 1, and Claudin 5, as well as, vascular endothelial (VE)-Cadherin. It has been assumed that regulation of AJ- and TJ-proteins is of particular importance for permeability, and accordingly, for the functionality of the corpus luteum in early pregnancy, because treatment with hCG induces downregulation of juntional proteins in the luteal vessels. The effect of hCG on the adhesive molecules is mediated by VE growth factor (VEGF). On a functional level, the hCG-dependent and VEGF-mediated decrease in junctional proteins causes a decrease in the density of cell-cell closure and, accordingly, an increase in endothelial permeability. In doing so, the different junctional proteins are not only directly influenced by VEGF but also interact among themselves and influence each other reciprocally. Disturbances in this strictly, regulated interactions may explain the development of pathologies with increased vascular permeability, such as the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.", "journal": "Reproduction (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2014-10-11", "authors": ["DanielHerr", "IngaBekes", "ChristineWulff"], "doi": "10.1530/REP-13-0296"}

Typically, the co-implantation of MSCs with vascular endothelial cells (ECs) is effective for the induction of functional vascularization in vivo, indicating its potential applications in regenerative medicine. The effects of MSCs-ECs-induced vascularization can be modeled in vitro, providing simplified models for understanding their underlying communication. In this article, a contact coculture model in vitro and an RNA-seq approach were employed to reveal the active crosstalk between MSCs and ECs within a short time period at both morphological and transcriptional levels. The RNA-seq results suggested that angiogenic genes were significantly induced upon coculture, and this prevascularization commitment might require the NF-\u03baB signaling. NF-\u03baB blocking and interleukin (IL) neutralization experiments demonstrated that MSCs potentially secreted IL factors including IL1\u03b2 and IL6 to modulate NF-\u03baB signaling and downstream chemokines during coculture. Conversely, RNA-seq results indicated that the MSCs were regulated by the coculture environment to a smooth muscle commitment within this short period, which largely induced myocardin, the myogenic co-transcriptional factor.

A promising approach is to prevascularize bone grafts in vitro using endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) derived from peripheral blood. Typically, EPC are added together with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that differentiate into osteoblasts. One problem with this approach is how to promote traditional tissue engineering bone survival with a minimally invasive method. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of administering to stimulate the release of peripheral blood stem cells and their co-culturing system for generating prevascularized engineered bone. Cells were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and identified as EPC and MSC based on morphology, surface markers, and functional analysis. EPC and MSC were cocultured in several different ratios, and cell morphology and tube formation were assessed by microscopy. Expression of osteogenesis and vascularization markers was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction, and histochemical and immunofluorescence staining. Increasing the proportion of EPC in the coculture system led to greater tube formation and greater expression of the endothelial cell marker CD31. An EPC:MSC ratio of 75:25 gave the highest expression of osteogenesis and angiogenesis markers. Cocultures adhered to a three-dimensional scaffold of strontium-doped calcium polyphosphate and proliferated well.

The study included 108 patients with Thy3 nodules awaiting for surgery, which were evaluated by US (considering hypoecogenicity, irregular margins, microcalcifications, halo sign, and intranodular vascularization) and RTE. Nodules were classified at RTE using a four-class color scale. At histologic examination, 75 nodules were benign and 33 malignant. As expected, none of the ultrasound parameters alone was adequate in predicting malignancy or benignity of the nodules; in the presence of at least two US risk factors, we obtained 61 % sensitivity, 83 % specificity, and 77 % accuracy with 6.8 OR (95 % CI 2.4-20.4). RTE scores 3 and 4 showed 76 % sensitivity, 88 % specificity, 74 % PPV, and 89 % NPV with diagnostic accuracy of 84 %; the data are statistically significant (p < 0.0001) with a OR of 21.9 (95 % CI 7.1-76). By combining RTE with US parameters, the presence of at least 2 characters of suspicion had 88 % sensitivity and 94 % NPV with 23.8 OR (95 % CI 7-106.3). The use of combined RTE and US leads to the identification of two patients subpopulations which have a significantly different malignancy risk (6 vs. 63 %); further studies are needed to verify if it is possible to send only the first group to thyroidectomy and the other to follow-up.", "journal": "Endocrine", "date": "2014-10-03", "authors": ["FrancescaGarino", "MaurilioDeandrea", "ManuelaMotta", "AlbertoMormile", "FedericoRagazzoni", "NicolaPalestini", "MilenaFreddi", "GuidoGasparri", "EnricoSgotto", "DonatellaPacchioni", "Paolo PieroLimone"], "doi": "10.1007/s12020-014-0438-0"}

All women were evaluated by transvaginal/transrectal ultrasound according to a predetermined three-step protocol, with transabdominal ultrasound being performed in some cases. First, morphological evaluation of the mass was performed using gray-scale 'pattern recognition' (first step). Lesions diagnosed as having a benign pattern were considered as being at low risk of malignancy whereas tumors with solid components, ascites and/or signs of carcinomatosis were considered as being at high risk of malignancy. In both cases no further test was performed and a decision regarding clinical management, either for follow-up or surgery, was taken. Tumors with solid components but without signs of ascites or carcinomatosis were considered as being at intermediate risk of malignancy. These lesions were assessed by two-dimensional (2D) PDA to evaluate tumor vascularity (color score) (second step). Solid tumors with a color score of 1 or 2 were considered as benign and no further test was performed, while tumors with a color score of 2, 3 or 4 within solid components or a color score of 3 or 4 in the case of a solid tumor were considered as malignant.

Current models do not allow easy analysis of vascularization of implants in vivo, leaving it a highly desirable goal. A tool that allows monitoring of perfusion capacity of such biomaterials noninvasively in a cheap, efficient, and reliable in vivo model would hence add great benefit to research in this field. We established, for the first time, an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method to quantify the perfusion capacity of a model biomaterial, DegraPol(\u00ae) foam scaffold, placed on the embryonic avian chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in ovo. Perfusion capacity was assessed through changes in the longitudinal relaxation rate before and after injection of a paramagnetic MRI contrast agent, Gd-DOTA (Dotarem(\u00ae); Guerbet S.A.). Relaxation rate changes were compared in three different regions of the scaffold, that is, at the interface to the CAM, in the middle and on the surface of the scaffold (p<0.05). The highest relaxation rate changes, and hence perfusion capacities, were measured in the interface region where the scaffold was attached to the CAM, whereas the surface of the scaffold showed the lowest relaxation rate changes. A strong positive correlation was obtained between relaxation rate changes and histologically determined vessel density (R(2) = 0.983), which corroborates our MRI findings. As a proof-of-principle, we measured the perfusion capacity in different scaffold materials, silk fibroin either with or without human dental pulp stem cells. For these, three to four times larger perfusion capacities were obtained compared to DegraPol; demonstrating that our method is sensitive to reveal such differences.

Here we demonstrate an electrochemical approach, named the cell electrochemical detachment (CED) technique, to form an integral endothelium and use it to prevascularize a collagen-\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) graft. The CED technique electrochemically detached an integral endothelium from a gold-coated glass rod to a collagen-infiltrated, channeled, macroporous \u03b2-TCP scaffold, forming an endothelium-lined microchannel containing graft upon removal of the rod. The in vitro results from static and perfusion culture showed that the endothelium robustly emanated microvascular sprouting and prevascularized the entire collagen/\u03b2-TCP integrated graft. The in vivo subcutaneous implantation studies showed that the prevascularized collagen/\u03b2-TCP grafts established blood flow originating from the endothelium-lined microchannel within a week, and the blood flow covered more areas in the graft over time. In addition, many blood vessels invaded the prevascularized collagen/\u03b2-TCP graft and the in vitro preformed microvascular networks anastomosed with the host vasculature, while collagen alone without the support of rigid ceramic scaffold showed less blood vessel invasion and anastomosis.

Additionally, no data are available about the prognostic value of the PGI2 pathway in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) therapy. We evaluated the expression of the PGI2 pathway in HNSCC patients. PGI2 production and PGI synthase (PGIS) expression, in terms of mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein (immunoblotting), were lower in tumour samples than in non-tumoural mucosa, whereas, as expected, COX-2 expression was increased in HNSCC tumour samples. Using local control of the tumour after radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy as a dependent variable, patients were classified into two categories of PGIS transcript levels. The high-PGIS group had a significantly lower frequency of local and distant failure than the low-PGIS group, and the 5-year cancer-specific survival was higher [90.2% (95% CI 81.0-99.4%) versus 60.5% (95% CI 44.4-76.6%)]. None of the four HNSCC cell lines analysed expressed PGIS and therefore they did not produce PGI2 . However, HNSCC-conditioned media enhanced PGI2 production in endothelial cells (ECs). The stable analogue of PGI2 , carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2 ), exerted little effect on HNSCC cell line migration, and no effect on cell cycle distribution or proliferation rate after radiation injury was observed. Nevertheless, cPGI2 promoted EP-4-dependent in vitro angiogenesis. Von Willebrand factor expression (EC marker) and capillary density were significantly higher in the group of patients with high expression of PGIS. Our results indicate that PGIS expression was associated with radiotherapy efficiency. Although we do not provide direct evidence of a relationship between tumour vascularization and radiotherapy efficiency, our results suggest that the effect of PGI2 is related to its ability to promote vascularization.

The correlation between facial allografts and sentinel flaps in cases of rejection is presented.\nThe authors analyzed the experience of the Boston team's use of four sentinel flaps. Rejection was evaluated and results were compared for each time point. Sentinel flaps were used as functional flaps whenever possible.\nResults showed a reliable correlation between biopsy specimens taken from the facial allograft and sentinel flaps. During severe rejection episodes in 100 percent of biopsy pairs, both sites displayed a similar grade of rejection.

Advantages of using these flaps include the avoidance of further surgical procedures to the primary vascularized composite allotransplant, additional use of the sentinel flap to repair damaged nonfacial sites, and its utility as both a clinical and histopathologic barometer of rejection and predictor of the potential existence of facial dermatitis unrelated to rejection.\nTherapeutic, IV.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2014-09-26", "authors": ["MaximilianKueckelhaus", "SebastianFischer", "Christine GLian", "Ericka MBueno", "Francisco MMarty", "Stefan GTullius", "Julian JPribaz", "George JMurphy", "BohdanPomahac"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0000000000000797"}

A major reason for this progress has been the development of novel in vitro systems to investigate these processes in 3D extracellular matrices. In this chapter, we present models of human endothelial cell (EC) tube formation and EC-pericyte tube co-assembly using serum-free defined conditions in 3D collagen matrices. We utilize both human venous and arterial ECs and show that both cell types readily form tubes and induce pericyte recruitment and both ECs and pericytes work together to remodel the extracellular matrix environment by assembling the vascular basement membrane, a key step in capillary tube network maturation and stabilization. Importantly, we have shown that these events occur under serum-free defined conditions using the hematopoietic stem cell cytokines, SCF, IL-3, and SDF-1\u03b1 and also including FGF-2. In contrast, the combination of VEGF and FGF-2 fails to support vascular tube morphogenesis or pericyte-induced tube maturation under the same serum-free defined conditions. Furthermore, we present novel assays whereby we have developed both human ECs and pericytes to induce specific genes using a doxycycline-regulated lentiviral system. In this manner, we can upregulate the expression of wild-type or mutant gene products at any stage of vascular morphogenesis or maturation in 3D matrices. These in vitro experimental approaches will continue to identify key molecular requirements and signaling pathways that control fundamental events in tissue vascularization under normal or pathologic conditions.

After additional puncturing of the dyes into the stroma, the flap was closed and sutured (\"large flap technique\"). In fragile corneas where convenient preparation of a large flap was not possible, a central small flap was prepared, and the \"pupil\" was tattooed in analogy (\"small flap technique\"). Afterward, the corneal periphery corresponding to the \"iris\" was tattooed, either by puncturing or injecting the dye into peripheral intrastromal tunnels (\"tunnel technique\").\nTwo eyes were tattooed using a large flap, and 4 eyes were tattooed using a small flap.

{"title": "Dual-phase osteogenic and vasculogenic engineered tissue for bone formation.", "abstract": "Minimally invasive, injectable bone tissue engineering therapies offer the potential to facilitate orthopedic repair procedures, including in indications where enhanced bone regeneration is needed for complete healing. In this study, we developed a dual-phase tissue construct consisting of osteogenic (Osteo) and vasculogenic (Vasculo) components. A modular tissue engineering approach was used to create collagen/fibrin/hydroxyapatite (COL/FIB/HA) hydrogel microbeads containing embedded human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (bmMSC). These microbeads were predifferentiated toward the osteogenic lineage in vitro for 14 days, and they were then embedded within a COL/FIB vasculogenic phase containing a coculture of undifferentiated bmMSC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In vitro studies demonstrated homogenous dispersion of microbeads within the outer phase, with endothelial network formation around the microbeads over 14 days in the coculture conditions. Subcutaneous injection into immunodeficient mice was used to investigate the ability of dual-phase (Osteo+Vasculo) and control (Osteo, Vasculo, Blank) constructs to form neovasculature and ectopic bone. Laser Doppler imaging demonstrated blood perfusion through all constructs at 1, 4, and 8 weeks postimplantation. Histological quantification of total vessel density showed no significant differences between the conditions. Microcomputed tomography indicated significantly higher ectopic bone volume (BV) in the Osteo condition at 4 weeks. At 8 weeks both the Osteo and Blank groups exhibited higher BV compared to the Vasculo and dual Osteo+Vasculo groups. These data not only show that osteogenic microbeads can be used to induce ectopic bone formation, but also suggest an inhibitory effect on BV when undifferentiated bmMSC and HUVEC were included in dual-phase constructs. This work may lead to improved methods for engineering vascularized bone tissue, and to injectable therapies for the treatment of orthopedic pathologies in which bone regeneration is delayed or prevented.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Transplantation of NSCs and EPCs has been promising for the repair of brain injury. We explored using co-transplanted hydrogel scaffold to improve the survival of the transplanted cells and recovery of neurological function. Adult Wistar rats were transplanted with EPC-hydrogel, NSC-hydrogel, NSC-EPC-hydrogel, EPC only, or NSC only 7 days after cortical contusion injury. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate neurological function before, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after transplantation. Size of injury, extent of vascularization, as well as the survival and differentiation of the transplanted EPCs and NSCs, were evaluated at week 5. All transplantation groups displayed significantly better neurological function compared with the control groups. Improved neurological function correlated with significantly smaller injury volumes than that of the saline group. Using immunostaining, we have shown that while transplanted NSCs differentiated into both neurons and astrocytes, the EPCs were incorporated into vessel epithelia. The extent of reactive gliosis (based on glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining) was significantly reduced in all treatment groups (NSC-EPC-hydrogel, NSC-hydrogel, and EPC-hydrogel) when compared with the saline group, with the highest reduction in the NSC-EPC-hydrogel transplantation group. Thus, co-transplantation of hydrogel scaffold provides a more conducive environment for the survival and differentiation of NSCs and EPCs at the site of brain injury, leading to improved vascularization and better recovery of neurological function.", "journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "date": "2014-09-17", "authors": ["ShaXue", "GangWu", "Hong-tianZhang", "Yan-wuGuo", "Yu-xiZou", "Zhen-junZhou", "Xiao-danJiang", "Yi-quanKe", "Ru-xiangXu"], "doi": "10.1089/neu.2014.3480"}
{"title": "Prophylactic administration of Amifostine protects vessel thickness in the setting of irradiated bone.", "abstract": "Although often beneficial in the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC), radiation therapy (XRT) leads to the depletion of vascular supply and eventually decreased perfusion of the tissue. Specifically, previous studies have demonstrated the depletion of vessel volume fraction (VVF) and vessel thickness (VT) associated with XRT. Amifostine (AMF) provides protection from the detrimental effects of radiation damage, allowing for reliable post-irradiation fracture healing in the murine mandible. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prophylactic ability of AMF to protect the vascular network in an irradiated field. Sprague-Dawley rats (n\u00a0=\u00a017) were divided into 3 groups: control (C, n\u00a0=\u00a05), radiated (XRT, n\u00a0=\u00a07), and radiated mandibles treated with Amifostine (AMF XRT, n\u00a0=\u00a05). Both groups receiving radiation underwent a previously established, human equivalent dose of XRT totaling 35\u00a0Gy, equally fractionated over 5 days. The AMF XRT group received a weight dependent (0.5\u00a0mg AMF/5\u00a0g body weight) subcutaneous injection of AMF 45\u00a0min prior to XRT. Following a 56-day recovery period, mandibles were perfused, dissected, and imaged with \u03bcCT. ANOVA was used for comparisons between groups and p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant. Stereologic analysis demonstrated a significant and quantifiable restoration of VT in AMF treated mandibles as compared to those treated with radiation alone (0.061\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.011\u00a0mm versus 0.042\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004\u00a0mm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027). Interestingly, further analysis demonstrated no significant difference in VT between control mandibles and those treated with AMF (0.067\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.016\u00a0mm versus 0.061\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.011\u00a0mm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.633). AMF treatment also showed an increase in VVF, however those results were not statistically significant from VVF values demonstrated by the XRT group. Our data support the contention that AMF therapy acts prophylactically to protect vessel thickness.

{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy improves nerve regeneration in a model of obstetric brachial plexus palsy.", "abstract": "The treatment of obstetric brachial plexus palsy has been limited to conservative therapies and surgical reconstruction of peripheral nerves. In addition to the damage of the brachial plexus itself, it also leads to a loss of the corresponding motoneurons in the spinal cord, which raises the need for supportive strategies that take the participation of the central nervous system into account. Based on the protective and regenerative effects of VEGF on neural tissue, our aim was to analyse the effect on nerve regeneration by adenoviral gene transfer of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in postpartum nerve injury of the brachial plexus in rats. In the present study, we induced a selective crush injury to the left spinal roots C5 and C6 in 18 rats within 24 hours after birth and examined the effect of VEGF-gene therapy on nerve regeneration. For gene transduction an adenoviral vector encoding for VEGF165 (AdCMV.VEGF165) was used. In a period of 11 weeks, starting 3 weeks post-operatively, functional regeneration was assessed weekly by behavioural analysis and force measurement of the upper limb. Morphometric evaluation was carried out 8 months post-operatively and consisted of a histological examination of the deltoid muscle and the brachial plexus according to defined criteria of degeneration. In addition, atrophy of the deltoid muscle was evaluated by weight determination comparing the left with the right side. VEGF expression in the brachial plexus was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore the motoneurons of the spinal cord segment C5 were counted comparing the left with the right side. On the functional level, VEGF-treated animals showed faster nerve regeneration. It was found less degeneration and smaller mass reduction of the deltoid muscle in VEGF-treated animals. We observed significantly less degeneration of the brachial plexus and a greater number of surviving motoneurons (P < 0\u00b705) in the VEGF group. The results of this study confirmed the positive effect of VEGF-gene therapy on regeneration and survival of nerve cells. We could demonstrate a significant improvement on the motor-functional as well as on the histomorphological level. However, increased vascularization of the nerve tissue caused by VEGF does not seem to be the major reason for these effects.

We have previously described the coculture of primary human osteoblasts (hOBs) and human endothelial cells (HUVECs), designed to investigate the interactions between these cells. In this system, we showed that cocultivation of these two cell types leads to a downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1 (PDGFR-\u03b1) in hOBs, which was a consequence of reduced mRNA stability. In the current study we investigated the possible involvement of microRNAs in this process. Firstly, we performed a microarray analysis of osteoblastic miRNAs following cocultivation with HUVECs, revealing an upregulation of miR-126. This result was confirmed by RT-qPCR, and we observed that the increase is dependent on direct cell-to-cell contacts. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments showed that miR-126 is a negative regulator of PDGFR-\u03b1 mRNA. Additionally, migration of hOBs was inhibited by miR-126 overexpression and stimulated by miR-126 inhibition. Addition of PDGFR-\u03b1 blocking antibody to hOB culture also inhibited hOB migration. There was no effect of miR-126 modulation on osteoblast proliferation, apoptosis rate or differentiation.

This study investigates the possible use of a collagen-chitosan sponge scaffold encapsulated with thymosin beta 4 (CCSS-eT\u03b24), an angiogenic factor, to accelerate cutaneous wound healing in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats with hindlimb ischemia. CCSSs-eT\u03b24 was fabricated using a freeze-drying method. The scaffolds were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, swelling and degradation assays, mechanical properties, and scaffolds of 50:50 collagen-chitosan were selected and applied. The controlled release of T\u03b24 from the scaffolds elicited localized and prolonged effects over 12 days, as shown by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vivo, CCSSs-eT\u03b24 improved diabetic cutaneous wound healing, with faster wound reepithelialization, better dermal reorganization, and higher wound vascularization. Furthermore, CCSSs-eT\u03b24 downregulated inflammatory genes and upregulated angiogenic genes in the wound tissue. Significant increases in CD31-positive endothelial cells and new vessel density were also observed. In vitro, T\u03b24 increased the migratory and proliferative activity of high glucose (HG)-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

Interactions between endothelial and progenitor/stem cells are important for vascularization of regenerating tissue. Recently, self-assembling peptide nanofibers were described as a promising environment for pulp regeneration due to their synthetic nature and controlled physicochemical properties. In this study, the peptide hydrogel PuraMatrix\u2122 was used as a scaffold system to investigate the role of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in triggering angiogenesis and the potential for regenerating vascularized pulp in vivo. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), DPSCs, or cocultures of both cell types were encapsulated in three-dimensional PuraMatrix. The peptide nanofiber microenvironment supported cell survival, cell migration, and capillary network formation in the absence of exogenous growth factors. DPSCs increased early vascular network formation by facilitating the migration of HUVECs and by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Both the DPSC-monoculture and coculture groups exhibited vascularized pulp-like tissue with patches of osteodentin after transplantation in mice. The cocultured groups exhibited more extracellular matrix, vascularization, and mineralization than the DPSC-monocultures in vivo. The DPSCs play a critical role in initial angiogenesis, whereas coordinated efforts by the HUVECs and DPSCs are required to achieve a balance between extracellular matrix deposition and mineralization.

For a scaffold to perform optimally, several design considerations must be addressed, with an eye toward the eventual form, function, and tissue site. The chemical and mechanical properties of the scaffold must be tuned to optimize the interaction with cells and surrounding tissues. For complex tissue engineering, mass transport limitations, vascularization, and host tissue integration are important considerations. As the tissue architecture to be replaced becomes more complex and hierarchical, scaffold design must also match this complexity to recapitulate a functioning tissue. We outline these design constraints and highlight creative and emerging strategies to overcome limitations and modulate scaffold properties for optimal regeneration.

The positive rates of CXCR4 and G-CSFR in MDPSCs were similar to MADSCs and were significantly higher than those in MBMSCs. Trophic effects of MDPSCs on angiogenesis, neurite extension, migration, and antiapoptosis were higher than those of MBMSCs and MADSCs. Pulp-like loose connective tissues were regenerated in all three MSC transplantations. Significantly higher volume of regenerated pulp and higher density of vascularization and innervation were observed in response to MDPSCs compared to MBMSC and MADSC transplantation. Collagenous matrix containing dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP)-positive odontoblast-like cells was the highest in MBMSCs and significantly higher in MADSCs compared to MDPSCs.

Compared to tumors in monotransgenic WAP-T mice, tumors in bitransgenic WAP-T x WAP-mutp53 mice showed higher tumor grading, enhanced vascularization, and significantly increased metastasis. Bitransgenic tumors revealed a gene signature associated with the oncogenic epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway (EMT gene signature). In cultures of WAP-T tumor-derived G-2 cancer cells, which are comprised of subpopulations displaying \"mesenchymal\" and \"epithelial\" phenotypes, this EMT gene signature was associated with the \"mesenchymal\" compartment. Furthermore, ectopic expression of mutp53 in G-2 cells sufficed to induce a strong EMT phenotype. In contrast to these in vitro effects, monotransgenic and bitransgenic tumors were phenotypically similar suggesting that in vivo the tumor cell phenotype might be under control of the tumor microenvironment. In support, orthotopic transplantation of G-2 cells as well as of G-2 cells expressing ectopic mutp53 into syngeneic mice resulted in tumors with a predominantly epithelial phenotype, closely similar to that of endogenous primary tumors. We conclude that induction of an EMT gene signature by mutp53 in bitransgenic tumors primarily promotes tumor cell plasticity, that is, the probability of tumor cells to undergo EMT processes under appropriate stimuli, thereby possibly increasing their potential to disseminate and metastasize.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2014-09-10", "authors": ["EvaLenfert", "ClaudiaMaenz", "ChristinaHeinlein", "KatharinaJannasch", "UdoSchumacher", "KlausPantel", "Genrich VTolstonog", "WolfgangDeppert", "FlorianWegwitz"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.29186"}

Mice were followed by serial photography until being killed at days 5 and 14. Wounds were assessed for burn depth and healing by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry. All treated groups showed improved healing over controls defined by decreased wound depth, area, and apoptotic activity. After 5 days, mice receiving ASCs or mixed adipose displayed a non-significant improvement in vascularization. No significant changes in proliferation were noted at 5 days. Adipose isografts improve some early markers of healing postburn injury. The authors demonstrate that addition of these grafts improves specific structural markers of healing.

The levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and phosphorous were measured on 0, 3, 7, 21, 56 and 84 days after surgery. PTH level was expressed as median (interquartile range) and histological and immunohistochemical examinations were performed. PTH levels were significantly decreased to \"not detectable level\" from day 3 in PTX group. PTH was not detected in both PT and PT + SIS groups on the 21st day. On the 56th day, PTH levels were increased in both groups: 3 out of 8 rats (37.5%) in the PT group, 6 out of 9 rats (66.7%) in the PT + SIS group. The PTH level was fully recovered to its preoperative range on the day 84 as 6 of 8 rats (75%) of the PT group and 7 of 9 rats (77.8%) of the PT + SIS group were recovered; the PTH levels were 117.84 and 178.36 pg/ml, respectively. The neo-vascularization was well observed around the parathyroid tissue, and the number of new vessels formed was higher in the PT + SIS group (15 vessels/high power field) as compared to the PT group (10 vessels/high power field).

We assessed postnatal vessel and alveolar formation in transgenic mice, expressing a stable, constitutive-active, HIF1\u03b1-subunit (HIF-1\u03b1\u0394ODD) in the distal lung epithelium. In addition, we compared lung function, histology, and morphometry of neonatal transgenic and wild-type mice subjected to hyperoxia. We found that postnatal lungs of HIF-1\u03b1\u0394ODD mice had a greater peripheral vessel density and displayed advanced alveolarization compared with control lungs. Stable HIF-1\u03b1 expression was associated with increased postnatal expression of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietins 1 and 2, Tie2, and Ephrin B2 and B4. Hyperoxia-exposed neonatal HIF-1\u03b1\u0394ODD mice exhibited worse lung function but had similar histological and surfactant abnormalities compared with hyperoxia-exposed wild-type controls. In conclusion, expression of constitutive-active HIF-1\u03b1 in the lung epithelium was associated with increased postnatal vessel growth via up-regulation of angiogenic factors.

{"title": "Myeloid regulatory cells in tumor spreading and metastasis.", "abstract": "Development of metastasis is determined by both the accretion of essential changes in cancerous cells and by their communications with different stromal elements in the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, inflammatory response and emergence of immune regulatory cells, such and myeloid regulatory cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells) and lymphoid regulatory cells (regulatory T, B and NK cells) to the tumor site have been reported to support tumor growth in addition to spreading and metastasis. Every phase of tumor progression, from its initiation through metastatic expansion, is endorsed by interaction between malignant and immune cells mediated by a number of growth factors, cytokines, proteases and other molecules that modify the tumor microenvironment. Invasion and metastasis depend on intratumoral vascularization, alterations of the basement membrane and degradation of the extracellular matrix for tumor cell spreading, invasion and extravasation into the blood and lymphatic vessels. The consequent dissemination of cancerous cells to distant tissues and organs necessitates a trafficking through the vasculature, which is promoted by further interactions with cells of the immune system, including myeloid regulatory cells. Moreover, the formation of the pre-metastatic niche and specific metastasis organ tropism is also regulated and controlled by bone marrow-derived hematopoietic immune progenitor cells, immature myeloid cells and certain cytokines, chemokines and growth factors derived from tumor and immune cells, which amend the local microenvironment of the organ or tissue to promote adhesion and survival of circulating cancerous cells. Although the potential role for myeloid regulatory cells in tumor spreading and development of pre-metastatic niche has been suggested, the concept still requires further supportive experimental and clinical data, as well as data related to specific factors and mechanisms responsible for myeloid regulatory cell functioning at malignant sites.", "journal": "Immunobiology", "date": "2014-09-03", "authors": ["Anton AKeskinov", "Michael RShurin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.imbio.2014.07.017"}

{"title": "Lack of arterial hypervascularity at contrast-enhanced ultrasound should not define the priority for diagnostic work-up of nodules <2 cm.", "abstract": "Current guidelines recommend diagnostic work-up for nodules >1cm detected during screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This implies that patients with benign conditions may undergo unnecessary evaluation and those with small nodules may be intervened too early, leading to overdiagnosis. Since increased arterial vascularization is the hallmark of malignancy, its detection by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) could become the signal to proceed with diagnosis confirmation. The aim was to assess if HCCs <2 cm without arterial hyperenhancement by baseline CEUS have a benign evolutionary profile, suggesting that diagnosis and invasive treatment could be delayed until detection of an overt malignant profile, associated with increased vascularization.\nWe prospectively included 168 cirrhotic patients with a newly detected solitary nodule of 5-20mm by screening ultrasonography. MRI, CEUS and fine needle biopsy (FNB) were performed and if no confident diagnosis was obtained, patients were closely followed to rule out HCC. Final diagnosis was: HCC (n = 119), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 3), neuroendocrine tumour (n = 1) and benign lesions (n = 45).\nCEUS did not detect contrast hyperenhancement in the arterial phase in 55 cases (34%). Eighteen out of these 55 nodules were diagnosed as HCC. Non-CEUS hyperenhanced HCCs were more frequently well-differentiated than CEUS-hyperenhanced HCCs (p < 0.004). Fourteen patients were treated with ablation and 4 with resection. Ten (55.6%) patients experienced tumour recurrence after treatment, mostly distant, confirming their overt malignant profile.\nAbsence of contrast hyperenhancement on CEUS during the arterial phase in nodules <2 cm in a cirrhotic liver does not predict a less malignant profile.

We evaluated changes in bladder function and morphology, including vascularization, in apoE(-/-)LDLR(-/-) double knockout mice with systemic atherosclerosis but without central nervous system involvement.\nCystometry was performed in awake, freely moving 60-week-old apoE(-/-)LDLR(-/-) mice and C57BL/6N controls.

{"title": "Role of synovial fibroblasts in rheumatoid arthritis.", "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common autoimmune articular disorder. It is characterized by chronic inflammation and progressive joint destruction. As research traditionally focused on immune cells and cytokines, the role of stromal cells was addressed only to a limited extent. However, cell-cell interactions within the rheumatoid synovium alter the phenotype of synovial fibroblasts (SFs), which are nowadays considered as active and aggressive drivers in the destructive process of RA. SFs actively attach to and invade articular cartilage, thereby expressing increased amounts of adhesion molecules and proinflammatory and matrix-degrading mediators. Furthermore, RASFs stimulate synovial vascularization through the release of proangiogenic factors. As a result, angiogenesis supports the influx of immune cells into affected joints, thereby perpetuating inflammatory processes, and facilitates access of RASFs to the bloodstream, thus boosting dissemination of RA. Despite intensive research, early pathophysiological processes still remain largely unknown. In this respect, a prearthritic phase of RA is discussed. Early and intensive therapy is considered to be very effective and beneficial for long-term outcome. However, although innovative therapy and improved treatment strategies are applied to achieve clinical remission, failure of or only partial response to therapy remains common. Given that none of the currently approved therapies target RASFs, intensive research into new strategies is warranted.

Therefore, we investigated whether ASCs would augment a clinically relevant bioprosthetic mesh-non-cross-linked porcine acellular dermal matrix (ncl-PADM)-used for ventral hernia repairs in a syngeneic animal model. ASCs were isolated from the subcutaneous adipose tissue of Brown Norway rats, expanded, and labeled with green fluorescent protein. ASCs were seeded (2.5\u00d710(4) cells/cm(2)) onto ncl-PADM for 24\u2009h before surgery. In vitro ASC adhesion to ncl-PADM was assessed at 0.5, 1, and 2\u2009h after seeding, and cell morphology on ncl-PADM was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Ventral hernia defects (2\u00d74\u2009cm) were created and repaired with ASC-seeded (n=31) and control (n=32) ncl-PADM. Explants were harvested at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after surgery. Explant remodeling outcomes were evaluated using gross evaluation (bowel adhesions, surface area, and grade), histological analysis (hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining), immunohistochemical analysis (von Willebrand factor VIII), fluorescent microscopy, and mechanical strength measurement at the tissue-bioprosthetic mesh interface. Stem cell markers CD29, CD90, CD44, and P4HB were highly expressed in cultured ASCs, whereas endothelial and hematopoietic cell markers, such as CD31, CD90, and CD45 had low expression. Approximately 85% of seeded ASCs adhered to ncl-PADM within 2\u2009h after seeding, which was further confirmed by scanning electron microcopy examination. Gross evaluation of the hernia repairs revealed weak omental adhesion in all groups. Ultimate tensile strength was not significantly different in control and treatment groups. Conversely, elastic modulus was significantly greater at 4 weeks postsurgery in the ASC-seeded group (p<0.001). Cellular infiltration was significantly higher in the ASC-seeded group at all time points (p<0.05). Vascular infiltration was significantly greater at 4 weeks postsurgery in the ASC-seeded group (p<0.001). The presence of ASCs improved remodeling outcomes by yielding an increase in cellular infiltration and vascularization of ncl-PADM and enhanced the elastic modulus at the ncl-PADM-tissue interface.

Novel targets for therapy such as tumor vascularization are highly warranted since little progress has been achieved in the last 30\u00a0years. However, proof of relevance for vascularization as a major prognostic parameter has been hampered by tumor heterogeneity, difficulty in detecting microvessels by immunohistochemistry, and small study cohorts. Most recently, we demonstrated that highly standardized whole-slide imaging could overcome these limitations (Kunz et al., PloS One 9(3):e90727, 2014). In this study, we applied this method to a multicenter cohort of 131 osteosarcoma patients to test osteosarcoma vascularization as a prognostic determinant.\nComputer-assisted whole-slide analysis, together with enzymatic epitope retrieval, was used for CD31-based microvessel quantification in 131 pretreatment formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded biopsies from three bone tumor centers. Kaplan-Meier-estimated survival and chemoresponse were determined and multivariate analysis was performed. Conventional hot-spot-based microvessel density (MVD) determination was compared with whole-slide imaging.\nWe detected high estimated overall (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.008) and relapse-free (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.004) survival in 25\u00a0% of osteosarcoma patients with low osteosarcoma vascularization in contrast to other patient groups. Furthermore, all patients with low osteosarcoma vascularization showed a good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Comparison of conventional MVD determination with whole-slide imaging suggests false high quantification or even exclusion of samples with low osteosarcoma vascularization due to difficult CD31 detection in previous studies.\nLow intratumoral vascularization at the time of diagnosis is a strong predictor for prolonged survival and good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma.", "journal": "Annals of surgical oncology", "date": "2014-08-27", "authors": ["PierreKunz", "JoergFellenberg", "LindaMoskovszky", "ZoltanS\u00e1pi", "TiborKrenacs", "IsidroMachado", "JohannesPoeschl", "BurkhardLehner", "MiklosSzendr\u00f5i", "PeterRuef", "MichaelBohlmann", "Antonio LlombartBosch", "VolkerEwerbeck", "RalfKinscherf", "BenediktFritzsching"], "doi": "10.1245/s10434-014-4001-2"}

While histopathologic study is the cornerstone of diagnosis of these lesions, newer radiological modalities such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and perfusion MRI have shown promise, particularly in screening patients at risk for developing these lesions. Because their detection is problematic, it is imperative that clinicians thoroughly examine tissue samples of resected meningiomas, as this may alter the patient's treatment plan and prognosis.

The proximal intestine displayed a normal structure for teleosts, whereas the distal intestine was wide, translucent, thin-walled, richly vascularized and constantly filled with air, suggesting an important respiratory role. Goblet cells were common throughout the entire intestine and displayed a variable, but mainly faint metachromatic colour after toluidine blue. They were moderately coloured by alcian blue at both pH 2.5 and 0.2 and displayed no colour after periodic acid followed by Schiff's solution (PAS), but a distinct purple-brown colour after high iron diamine followed by alcian blue (pH 2.5). Together, these results suggest that the mucin in the intestine goblet cells consists mainly of sulphated proteoglycans. Further, the results from the present lectin and neuraminidase tests suggest that these mucins contain much N-acetylglucoseamines and some N-acetylgalactosamines and sialic acid, but seem to lack glucose and mannose. They also contain some galactose-N-acetylgalactosamines sequences, normally hidden by sialic acid. The distinct brush border and mucus layer on the epithelial cells in the respiratory intestine may indicate some digestive roles, such as absorption of water, ions and simple carbohydrates. As sulphated proteoglycans are tough and attract much water, this mucus may play important roles in the protection against mechanical and chemical damages and in the defence against micro-organisms throughout the entire intestine, but in the respiratory intestine it may impede significantly the oxygen uptake. However, as this part of the intestine usually contains no digesta, but is completely filled with air, frequently renewed by dry air from the atmosphere, and the main function of the mucus may be to protect the respiratory epithelium against a destroying and dangerous desiccation.", "journal": "Anatomia, histologia, embryologia", "date": "2014-08-22", "authors": ["I LLeknes"], "doi": "10.1111/ahe.12140"}

We have previously shown that the oncolytic adenovirus dl922-947 induces extensive DNA damage, therefore we hypothesized a synergistic antitumoral effect of the PARP inhibitor olaparib in association with dl922-947. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma was chosen as model since it is a particularly aggressive tumor and, because of its localized growth, it is suitable for intratumoral treatment with oncolytic viruses. Here, we show that dl922-947 infection induces PARP activation, and we confirm in vitro and in vivo that PARP inhibition increases dl922-947 replication and oncolytic activity. In vitro, the combination with olaparib exacerbates the appearance of cell death markers, such as Annexin V positivity, caspase 3 cleavage, cytochrome C release and propidium iodide permeability. In vivo, we also observed a better viral distribution upon PARP inhibition. Changes in CD31 levels suggest a direct effect of olaparib on tumor vascularization and on the viral distribution within the tumor mass. The observation that PARP inhibition enhances the effects of dl922-947 is highly promising not only for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma but, in general, for the treatment of other tumors that could benefit from the use of oncolytic viruses.", "journal": "Molecular oncology", "date": "2014-08-21", "authors": ["CarmelaPassaro", "MassimilianoVolpe", "GinevraBotta", "EloiseScamardella", "GiuseppePerruolo", "DavidGillespie", "SilvanaLibertini", "GiuseppePortella"], "doi": "10.1016/j.molonc.2014.07.022"}

Subsequent patterning of nerves and blood vessels is critical for normal digestive function. A hierarchical branching vascular network allows for efficient nutrient absorption, while the complex enteric nervous system regulates intestinal motility as well as secretion, absorption, and blood flow. Despite the well-recognized significance of these systems, the precise mechanisms by which they develop have not been clearly established in mammals.\nUsing a novel whole-mount immunohistochemical protocol, we visualize the pattern of intestinal neurovascular development in mice between embryonic day 10.5 and birth. In particular, we focus on the development and remodeling of the enteric vascular plexus, the migration and organization of enteric neural crest-derived cells, and the integration of peripheral sympathetic nerves with the enteric nervous system. These correlative data lead us to hypothesize a functional interaction between migrating neural crest-derived cells and endothelial cells of the primary capillary plexus, as well as a subsequent interaction between developing peripheral autonomic nerves and differentiated neural crest-derived cells.\nThese studies provide useful anatomical data for continuing investigations on the functional mechanisms underlying intestinal organogenesis.", "journal": "Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists", "date": "2014-08-21", "authors": ["JohnHatch", "Yoh-SukeMukouyama"], "doi": "10.1002/dvdy.24178"}

Intrinsic lymphovenous connections have been previously shown to exist in the transferred flap. But, the long-term interaction of the VLN flap and surrounding lymphedematous extremity has not been previously investigated.\nA retrospective review of a prospective maintained database of patients who underwent VLN transfer was evaluated. Patients who underwent distal VLN transfer and had more than 1-year follow-up were identified. Lymphodynamic evaluation was performed using 0.3 to 0.6 mL indocyanine green (ICG) injection at 5 cm proximal to the flap edge on identified patients. Migration direction of dye and latency period was evaluated.\nIn total, 20 patients were identified who met inclusion criteria. Average long-term follow-up was 27.3 months. The average circumference reduction of the affected extremity was 40.5%. ICG appearance within the VLN flap was found in all patients occurring on average in 178.3 seconds. In all cases, flow occurred in the distal direction (toward the flap) with proximal placement of dye. Latency period was found to inversely correlate with circumference reduction (p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nDistal, nonanatomic placement of VLN flaps provide sustained limb circumference reduction in extremity lymphedema patients following a minimum of 1-year postoperatively.

One hundred forty-three consecutive female patients were examined by using an image-processing technique. Three-dimensional FMBV fractional moving blood volume was measured on the vasculature from the uteroplacental interface to a depth 5 mm into the placenta by using a normalization volume 10 mm outside the uteroplacental interface and compared against the Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis ( VOCAL Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis ; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis) vascularization flow index ( VFI vascularization flow index ).

Immunofluorescence techniques were used to investigate dual-labeling of the specimens for CD68, CD163 and Ki67, respectively.\nWith immunofluorescence staining, scattered cells in all specimens were dual-labeled for CD68-Ki67 and CD163-Ki67. All lesions were composed of mixed infiltrates of M1 (CD68+CD163-) and M2 (CD68+CD163+) macrophages. The center of epithelioid-cell granulomas and foreign body giant cells was exclusively composed of M1 macrophages.\nThis study shows that CD68+ and CD163+ cells express Ki67, a marker for proliferative activity at the site of inflammation. Until recently, macrophages were regarded as end-differentiated cells without mitotic activity. Since self-renewal of M1 and M2 macrophages has been described in the literature, staining of macrophages with Ki67 may indicate proliferative activity or at least an activation state. The distribution of macrophages in classic granulomatous lesions with only M1 macrophages in the avascular center represents an immune response to foreign body material, whereas the proangiogenic M2 macrophages are located mostly in the surrounding inflammatory tissue and seem to be mandatory for the vascularization of the inflammatory tissue.", "journal": "Current eye research", "date": "2014-08-12", "authors": ["Martina CHerwig", "Frank GHolz", "Karin ULoeffler"], "doi": "10.3109/02713683.2014.943909"}

VEGF has become the main target of anti-angiogenic therapy. However, most patients relapse after an initial response or present a resistance to the treatment. Identification of new pro-angiogenic factors may help to improve anti-angiogenic therapy. In this study, we demonstrated that the pro-hormone progastrin (PG), over-expressed in CRC, recognized as a growth factor, is a potent pro-angiogenic factor. In transgenic mice and human colorectal HPs producing high levels of PG, we correlated PG overexpression with an increased vascularization. In vitro, exogenous PG and conditioned media (CM) from CRC cells producing PG increased endothelial cell proliferation and migration. We also showed that treatment with exogenous PG can increase the ability of endothelial cells to form capillary-like structures. Moreover, we demonstrated that PG enhanced endothelial permeability. The finding that PG stimulated the phosphorylation of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, p125-FAK, paxillin and induced actin remodelling was consistent with a role of these components in PG-stimulated endothelial cell migration and permeability. The pro-angiogenic effects observed with CM were significantly inhibited when CRC cells expressed a PG shRNA. In vivo, we found an important decrease in tumor growth and neovascularization when the CRC cells expressing the PG shRNA were xenografted in mice or in the chick chorioallantoic membrane model. We also observed an increase in the coverage of blood vessels by pericytes and a decrease in endothelial permeability when PG expression was blocked.

During commercial slaughter, the testicles and epididymides were collected and their following morphometric parameters were immediately measured: length, width, thickness, circumference, volume, weight of the parenchyma and the tunica albuginea, also aspects such as shape, cavity implantation, relationship with other organs and vascularization. The testicles presented cylindrical shape, with a thin, dense and transparent tunica albuginea, and the vascularization was accomplished by the testicular artery that ramifies from the cranial rectal artery. In the samples from December 2006 and May 2007, the media from the macroscopic measures of the right testicles were volume 58.7 and 14.7 ml, length 9.87 and 3.5 cm, width 2.4 and 0.6 cm, thickness 2.4 and 0.5 cm, circumference 8.0 and 2.3 cm, parenchyma weight 27.6 and 6.1 g and tunica albuginea weight 1.0 and 0.3 g, P < 0.05, respectively.

It is now generally accepted that its origin is likely from undifferentiated mesenchymal tissue with variable epithelial differentiation and a highly specific chromosomal translocation in more than 95% of cases. The lesion typically presents as a slow-growing soft tissue mass, with MR imaging demonstrating a heterogeneous mass with variable amounts of low-, intermediate- and high-signal intensity on fluid-sensitive images and prominent heterogeneous enhancement, reflecting its vascularity. The relative hypervascularity of synovial sarcoma has been well established and is reflected in its enhancement on MR imaging studies. Contrast enhancement on MR imaging has been long used as a marker for tissue vascularization and perfusion, with malignant lesions generally being more vascular and enhancing more rapidly. We recently encountered a patient with a high-grade synovial sarcoma with no discernable necrosis and no vascularity on contrast-enhanced MR images with the subtraction technique, despite enhancement in adjacent regional metastatic lymph nodes. The pathologic basis for this unusual imaging appearance was a paucity of small-caliber vessels within the sarcoma due to extensive hyalinization of the mass.", "journal": "Skeletal radiology", "date": "2014-08-02", "authors": ["Ann EMcCullough", "Adam JSchwartz", "Veronica LTaylor", "Mark JKransdorf"], "doi": "10.1007/s00256-014-1964-9"}
{"title": "Self-assembly of prevascular tissues from endothelial and fibroblast cells under scaffold-free, nonadherent conditions.", "abstract": "To advance the emerging field of bioengineered prevascularized tissues, we investigated factors that control primary vascular network formation in scaffold-free, high-density cell suspension-derived tissues. Fabricating primary vascular networks in a scaffold-free system requires endothelial cells (ECs) and extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing cells that act together to elaborate a permissive matrix. We report findings on the effects to vascular patterning induced by altering the ratio of human endothelial to human fibroblast cells. Analysis revealed that a 1:4 ratio of ECs to fibroblasts resulted in the synthesis of an ECM permissive for organization of primary vascular networks that recapitulated the pattern of primary vascular networks observed in vivo. Importantly this work highlighted the significance of tension in the organization of vascular networks in prevascularized tissues. To our knowledge our in vitro studies are the first to demonstrate the formation of two distinct vascular patterns in an initially homogenous culture system. Specifically, we demonstrate that within our constructs, vascular networks formed with distinct directional orientations that reflect self-assembly-mediated tension. Further, our studies demonstrate that treatment of prevascularized tissues with matrix-promoting factors such as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) increases tissue strength without altering vascular network patterning. Together, the ability to generate prevascularized tissues from human cells in scaffold-free systems and the ability to enhance the strength of the constructs with matrix-promoting factors represent advances to the potential translational utility of prevascularized tissues both as subcutaneous implants and in surgical scenarios requiring the application of tension to the tissue construct.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

EIT imaging of pulsating latex membranes submerged in saline baths provided initial validation of its use for tracking temporally varying conductivities. Nineteen women (10 with cancer, nine without) were imaged with EIT over the course of several heartbeats in synchrony with pulse-oximetry acquisition.

A 34-year-old man suffered a microlight accident with bilateral open legs fractures. A large skin defect of the left leg exposed the ankle, the calcaneus and a non-vascularized part of the tibial nerve (10 cm). The patient came to the OR for surgical debridement and had massive bone resection of the left calcaneus. The right leg showed limited skin defect at the lower part, exposing the medial side of the ankle and a tibial bone defect, measuring 10 cm. Salvage the left leg was impossible due to complex nerve, bones and skin associated injuries, so this leg was sacrificed and used as a donor limb, to harvest a free fibula flap for contralateral tibial reconstruction. At 18 months of follow-up, the patient was very satisfied, the clinical result was very good on both lower limbs and X-rays showed excellent integration of the free fibula flap. The patient had normal dailies occupations, can run and have bicycle sport practice with a functional left leg fit prosthesis.

{"title": "Cyr61 silencing reduces vascularization and dissemination of osteosarcoma tumors.", "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the most prevalent primary pediatric cancer-related bone disease. These tumors frequently develop resistance to chemotherapy and are highly metastatic, leading to poor outcome. Thus, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies that can prevent cell dissemination. We previously showed that CYR61/CCN1 expression in osteosarcoma cells is correlated to aggressiveness both in vitro and in vivo in mouse models, as well as in patients. In this study, we found that CYR61 is a critical contributor to the vascularization of primary tumor. We demonstrate that silencing CYR61, using lentiviral transduction, leads to a significant reduction in expression level of pro-angiogenic markers such as VEGF, FGF2, PECAM and angiopoietins concomitantly to an increased expression of major anti-angiogenic markers such as thrombospondin-1 and SPARC. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 family member expression, a key pathway in osteosarcoma metastatic capacity was also downregulated when CYR61 was downregulated in osteosarcoma cells. Using a metastatic murine model, we show that CYR61 silencing in osteosarcoma cells results in reduced tumor vasculature and slows tumor growth compared with control. We also find that microvessel density correlates with lung metastasis occurrence and that CYR61 silencing in osteosarcoma cells limits the number of metastases. Taken together, our data indicate that CYR61 silencing can blunt the malignant behavior of osteosarcoma tumor cells by limiting primary tumor growth and dissemination process.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["NHabel", "MVilalta", "OBawa", "POpolon", "JBlanco", "OFromigu\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2014.232"}

A Fourier transform NIR spectroscopy instrument equipped with a fiber-optic probe was used to mimic in situ clinical measurements. A total of 186 spectra were collected and then underwent the preprocessing of standard normalize variate (SNV) for removing unwanted background variances. All the specimen and spots used for spectral collection were confirmed staining and examination by an experienced pathologist so as to ensure the representative of the pathology. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to uncover the possible clustering. Several methods including random forest (RF), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLSDA), K-nearest neighbor and classification and regression tree (CART) were used to extract spectral features and to construct the diagnostic models. By comparison, it reveals that, even if no obvious difference of misclassified ratio (MCR) was observed between these models, RF is preferable since it is quicker, more convenient and insensitive to over-fitting.

The study concluded with a canine in vivo evaluation of a CTAP exposed to tattoo ink for 1 minute. After a two-week recovery period, vocal folds were harvested and evaluated histologically.\nTattoo ink proved to be a safe and effective histologic marker in vivo, where the histologic margins of the implanted CTAP were clearly demarcated by a thin band of tattoo ink, soft tissue reactions were minimal, and interference with standard, special, or immunohistochemical stain assessments did not occur.\nTattoo ink provides a reliable means of demarcating a CTAP within a vocal fold and demonstrated that CTAPs survive transplantation.

To fill this gap, imaging of the male genital tract (MGT) has progressively expanded, providing useful information in the assessment of MGT abnormalities.\nA critical, systematic review of the available literature was performed using Medline, with no restrictions regarding date of publication (i.e. from inception date until March 2014), along with analysis of previous reports in color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) atlas textbooks. Normal anatomy and sonographic characteristics of the MGT have also been summarized.\nTesticular volume (TV) is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. Ultrasound (US) offers a greater accuracy in TV measurement than Prader orchidometer (PO). However US- and PO-derived TV are closely related, making PO-derived TV informative enough in the work-up of the infertile man in everyday clinical practice. US-derived TV might play an independent role in specific clinical conditions (i.e. large hydrocele, inguinal testis, enlarged epididymis). Scrotal US may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis, often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of malignancy, or testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testis vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions (i.e. lymphoma, leukemia). The impact of varicocele detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters/fatherhood is debated. At present, the clinical management of varicocele is mainly based on physical examination. However, CDUS is useful in assessing venous reflux, when palpation is unreliable and/or in detecting recurrence/persistence after surgery. Epididymis head and/or tail dilation is suggestive of MGT obstruction or inflammation and both are related, along with echo-texture abnormalities, to impaired sperm parameters. Scrotal and transrectal US (TRUS) are useful in detecting congenital uni- or bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with epididymis, seminal vesicles (SV) or kidney abnormalities/agenesis. TRUS plays a key role in assessing obstructive azoospermia and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to ejaculatory ducts obstruction, such as ejaculatory duct abnormalities, prostate median cysts or SV enlargement/emptying impairment. TRUS findings lead to operational decision-making, such as testicular sperm extraction in the case of CBAVD, cyst aspiration in the case of a large prostatic median cyst, and surgical treatment if ejaculatory duct abnormalities are observed. TRUS may reveal prostate volume reduction (suggestive of hypogonadism) or enlargement, which can be related to aging or even metabolic abnormalities. Finally, TRUS may reveal prostate and SV echo-texture abnormalities suggestive of inflammation or SV stasis.\nMGT-CDUS is a useful tool in detecting abnormalities related to impaired male reproductive health.

{"title": "Activated Notch1 expression is associated with angiogenesis in cutaneous melanoma.", "abstract": "An early event in melanocytic tumor growth is the upregulation of Notch signaling. When an active form of Notch1 is overexpressed in primary human melanocytes, it increases cell growth, survival and invasive properties, promoting melanoma progression. Recent evidence suggested that tumor initiation and growth are driven by a subset of tumor-initiating cells termed cancer stem cells. Notch1 plays a predominant role in the maintenance of melanoblasts, including melanocyte stem cells, by preventing initiation of apoptosis. Moreover, the importance of Notch1 in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis is supported by growing evidence in various cancers. Nestin has been widely used as a marker for melanocyte stem cells as well as an angiogenic marker to evaluate neovascularity of endothelial cells in tumors. To gain an insight into the impact of Notch1 activation on the maintenance of melanocyte stem cells and angiogenesis in melanoma, the expression levels of activated Notch1 and nestin were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 114 primary cutaneous melanomas and 35 lymph node metastases. Activated Notch1 and nestin expression was also evaluated in four dysplastic melanocytic nevi. This study provides evidence that activated Notch1 is overexpressed in cutaneous melanoma, in tumor cells as well as in microvessel endothelium, and that it can promote tumor angiogenesis. Indeed, the overexpression of activated Notch1 in both tumor and vascular endothelial cells was significantly associated with microvascular density in melanoma samples.

Here, we report robust cytoplasmic expression of CAII by immunohistochemistry in the tumor cells of different native neuroendocrine tumor (NET) types, including typical and atypical carcinoids and small-cell lung carcinomas, and in NET and non-NET tumor cell lines. Because, in both pulmonary neuroendocrine cell and related NETs, the hypercapnia-induced secretion of bioactive serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is mediated by CAII, we investigated the role of CAII in the biological behavior of carcinoid cell line H727 and the type II cell-derived A549 using both in vitro clonogenicity and in vivo xenograft model. We show that short hairpin RNA-mediated down-regulation of CAII resulted in significant reduction in clonogenicity of H727 and A549 cells in vitro, and marked suppression of tumor growth in vivo. CAII-short hairpin RNA cell-derived xenografts showed significantly reduced mitosis (phosphohistone H3 marker) and proliferation associated antigen Ki-67 (Ki67 marker), and significantly increased apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. Using an apoptosis gene array, we found no association with caspases 3 and 8, but with a novel association of CAII-mediated apoptosis with specific mitochondrial apoptosis-associated proteins. Furthermore, these xenografts showed a significantly reduced vascularization (CD31 marker). Thus, CAII may play a critical role in NET lung tumor growth, angiogenesis, and survival, possibly via 5-hydroxytryptamine, known to drive autocrine tumor growth.

The following results were compared: flap viability, hospital stay, complications, frequency of dressing change, reoperation rate, and remaining scars.\nNo flap necrosis was observed in patients who received the supercharging procedure. By contrast, of the 8 patients who were not treated with supercharging technique, various degrees of flap necrosis occurred in 3 patients, 2 of whom received secondary operations. The frequency of dressing changes, the hospital stay, and hospital cost were reduced.

{"title": "Recapitulating endochondral ossification: a promising route to in vivo bone regeneration.", "abstract": "Despite its natural healing potential, bone is unable to regenerate sufficient tissue within critical-sized defects, resulting in a non-union of bone ends. As a consequence, interventions are required to replace missing, damaged or diseased bone. Bone grafts have been widely employed for the repair of such critical-sized defects. However, the well-documented drawbacks associated with autografts, allografts and xenografts have motivated the development of alternative treatment options. Traditional tissue engineering strategies have typically attempted to direct in vitro bone-like matrix formation within scaffolds prior to implantation into bone defects, mimicking the embryological process of intramembranous ossification (IMO). Tissue-engineered constructs developed using this approach often fail once implanted, due to poor perfusion, leading to avascular necrosis and core degradation. As a result of such drawbacks, an alternative tissue engineering strategy, based on endochondral ossification (ECO), has begun to emerge, involving the use of in vitro tissue-engineered cartilage as a transient biomimetic template to facilitate bone formation within large defects. This is driven by the hypothesis that hypertrophic chondrocytes can secrete angiogenic and osteogenic factors, which play pivotal roles in both the vascularization of constructs in vivo and the deposition of a mineralized extracellular matrix, with resulting bone deposition. In this context, this review focuses on current strategies taken to recapitulate ECO, using a range of distinct cells, biomaterials and biochemical stimuli, in order to facilitate in vivo bone formation.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2014-06-12", "authors": ["Emmet MThompson", "AmosMatsiko", "EricFarrell", "Daniel JKelly", "Fergal JO'Brien"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1918"}

Graft retraction occurred in 6 of the 9 eyes in this study, including in all 5 eyes of patients with Stevens Johnsons syndrome (SJS).\nFree grafting and simple advancement flaps do not appear to be effective for rehabilitation in these eyes. However, even vascularized pedicle and bucket handle flaps retracted 50% of the time. Individuals with SJS were more likely to both require conjunctival rehabilitation after keratoprosthesis surgery and develop graft retraction in the course of management.", "journal": "Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2014-06-10", "authors": ["Dan BRootman", "Michelle JKim", "Anthony JAldave", "RaymondDouglas", "CatherineHwang", "RobertGoldberg"], "doi": "10.1097/IOP.0000000000000172"}
{"title": "A functional transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel is expressed in human endothelial progenitor cells.", "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are mobilized into circulation to replace damaged endothelial cells and recapitulate the vascular network of injured tissues. Intracellular Ca(2+) signals are key to EPC activation, but it is yet to be elucidated whether they are endowed with the same blend of Ca(2+) -permeable channels expressed by mature endothelial cells. For instance, endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs), the only EPC subset truly committed to acquire a mature endothelial phenotype, lack canonical transient receptor potential channels 3, 5 and 6 (TRPC3, 5 and 6), which are widely distributed in vascular endothelium; on the other hand, they express a functional store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). The present study was undertaken to assess whether human circulating EPCs possess TRP vanilloid channel 4 (TRPV4), which plays a master signalling role in mature endothelium, by controlling both vascular remodelling and arterial pressure. We found that EPCs express both TRPV4 mRNA and protein. Moreover, both GSK1016790A (GSK) and phorbol myristate acetate and, two widely employed TRPV4 agonists, induced intracellular Ca(2+) signals uniquely in presence of extracellular Ca(2+). GSK- and PMA-induced Ca(2+) elevations were inhibited by RN-1734 and ruthenium red, which selectively target TRPV4 in mature endothelium. However, TRPV4 stimulation with GSK did not cause EPC proliferation, while the pharmacological blockade of TRPV4 only modestly affected EPC growth in the presence of a growth factor-enriched culture medium. Conversely, SOCE inhibition with BTP-2, La(3+) and Gd(3+) dramatically decreased cell proliferation. These data indicate that human circulating EPCs possess a functional TRPV4 protein before their engraftment into nascent vessels.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2014-06-10", "authors": ["SilviaDragoni", "GermanoGuerra", "AlessandraFiorio Pla", "GiuseppeBertoni", "AlessandraRappa", "ValentinaPoletto", "CinziaBottino", "AdeleAronica", "FrancescoLodola", "Maria PiaCinelli", "UmbertoLaforenza", "VittorioRosti", "FrancoTanzi", "LucaMunaron", "FrancescoMoccia"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.24686"}
{"title": "Notch1 stimulation induces a vascularization switch with pericyte-like cell differentiation of glioblastoma stem cells.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforms (GBMs) are highly vascularized brain tumors containing a subpopulation of multipotent cancer stem cells. These cells closely interact with endothelial cells in neurovascular niches. In this study, we have uncovered a close link between the Notch1 pathway and the tumoral vascularization process of GBM stem cells. We observed that although the Notch1 receptor was activated, the typical target proteins (HES5, HEY1, and HEY2) were not or barely expressed in two explored GBM stem cell cultures. Notch1 signaling activation by expression of the intracellular form (NICD) in these cells was found to reduce their growth rate and migration, which was accompanied by the sharp reduction in neural stem cell transcription factor expression (ASCL1, OLIG2, and SOX2), while HEY1/2, KLF9, and SNAI2 transcription factors were upregulated. Expression of OLIG2 and growth were restored after termination of Notch1 stimulation. Remarkably, NICD expression induced the expression of pericyte cell markers (NG2, PDGFR\u03b2, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin [\u03b1SMA]) in GBM stem cells. This was paralleled with the induction of several angiogenesis-related factors most notably cytokines (heparin binding epidermal growth factor [HB-EGF], IL8, and PLGF), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP9), and adhesion proteins (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 [VCAM1], intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM1], and integrin alpha 9 [ITGA9]). In xenotransplantation experiments, contrasting with the infiltrative and poorly vascularized tumors obtained with control GBM stem cells, Notch1 stimulation resulted in poorly disseminating but highly vascularized grafts containing large vessels with lumen. Notch1-stimulated GBM cells expressed pericyte cell markers and closely associated with endothelial cells.

{"title": "Investigating muscle regeneration with a dermis/small intestinal submucosa scaffold in a rat full-thickness abdominal wall defect model.", "abstract": "Repair of large complex ventral wall hernias is challenging and outcomes are often poor due to hernia recurrence and compromised abdominal wall function. Currently, biological grafts are used to assist in repairing these complex hernias. Dermis grafts are often chosen because of their mechanical characteristics; however, dermis does not have the ability to promote the muscle regeneration needed to regain abdominal wall function. In contrast, small intestinal submucosa (SIS) grafts have been shown to promote muscle generation in volumetric muscle loss (VML) models. Hence, the objective of this study is to investigate the extent to which SIS grafts can be used together with dermis grafts to repair and promote muscle regeneration in a full-thickness abdominal wall defect in a rat model. The dermis layer is intended to mechanically bridge the defect and support constructive tissue remodeling while the SIS is intended to degrade and promote neo-muscle formation. After 16 weeks of implantation, we found only a small amount of vascularized muscle (<10% of the defect area) in the repaired defects. No significant difference in defect muscle area was found between the groups receiving the dermis\u2009+\u2009SIS scaffolds and the control (dermis alone) group. Our findings indicate that the SIS constructions investigated could not promote appreciable muscle regeneration in this rigorous animal model of VML and incomplete abdominal closure.

There is no general consensus about when to use these alternatives, but when it is possible to save the native joints after the resection of a long bone tumor, intercalary allografts offer some advantages despite complications, such as fracture. The management and outcomes of this complication deserve more study.\nThe purposes of this study were to (1) analyze the fracture frequency in a group of patients treated with massive intercalary bone allografts of the femur and tibia; (2) compare the results of allografts treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with those treated with resection and repeat allograft reconstruction; and (3) determine the likelihood that treatment of a fracture resulted in a healed intercalary reconstruction.\nWe reviewed patients treated with intercalary bone allografts between 1991 and 2011. During this period, patients were generally treated with intercalary allografts when after tumor resection at least 1 cm of residual epiphysis remained to allow fixation of the osteotomy junction. To obtain a homogeneous group of patients, we excluded allograft-prosthesis composites and osteoarticular and hemicylindrical intercalary allografts from this study. We analyzed the fracture rate of 135 patients reconstructed with segmental intercalary bone allografts of the lower extremities (98 femurs and 37 tibias). In patients whose grafts fractured were treated either by internal fixation or a second allograft, ORIF generally was attempted but after early failures in femur fractures, these fractures were treated with a second allograft. Using a chart review, we ascertained the frequency of osseous union, complications, and reoperations after the treatment of fractured intercalary allografts. Followup was at a mean of 101 months (range, 24-260 months); of the original 135 patients, no patient was lost to followup.\nAt latest followup, 19 patients (14%) had an allograft fracture (16 femurs [16%] and three tibias [8%]). Six patients were treated with internal fixation and addition of autologous graft (three femurs and three tibias) and 13 patients were treated with a second intercalary allograft (13 femurs). The three patients with femoral allograft fractures treated with internal fixation and autologous grafts failed and were treated with a second allograft, whereas those patients with tibia allograft fractures treated by the same procedure healed without secondary complications. When we analyzed the 16 patients with a second intercalary allograft (13 as primary treatment of the fracture and three as secondary treatment of the fracture), five failed (31%) and were treated with resection of the allograft and reconstructed with an endoprosthesis (four patients) or an osteoarticular allograft (one patient).\nFractures of intercalary allografts of the tibia could successfully be treated with internal fixation and autologous iliac crest bone graft; however, this treatment failed when used for femur allograft fractures. Femoral fractures could be treated with resection and repeat allograft reconstruction, however, with a higher refracture frequency. The addition of a vascularized fibular graft in the second attempt should be considered.\nLevel IV, therapeutic study.

Several promising techniques have focused on biological vascularized matrices (BioVaM) with preserved vascular pedicles in the porcine model. However, the handling of this model is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, our aim was to establish a BioVaM in the rat.\nSmall bowel segments of Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated and perfused via cannulation of the superior mesenteric artery and the portal vein. All cellular matrix components were removed by sequential treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium deoxycholate, and DNase. Quality of decellularization was investigated by histology and potential residual DNA by spectrophotometry. Primary endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from the major vessels of Sprague-Dawley rats. Cells were labeled with fluorescent cell tracker and injected into the vascular pedicles of the matrix. Attachment of ECs was assessed using fluorescence microscopy of the whole mount.\nDecellularized matrix demonstrated the absence of cellular components but conserved matrix architecture as determined by immune fluorescent, pentachrome, and hematoxylin and eosin stains. DNA content was reduced by more than 99%. ECs were characterized by specific staining against endothelial nitric oxide synthase and von Willebrand factor; when injected, ECs attached along the vessel walls including the capillaries of the intestinal wall.\nRat small bowel segments harvested with intact vascular pedicles and associated vascular network can be successfully decellularized and re-endothelialized ex vivo.

The spectacle was hardly visible at baseline, but became obvious at day one, while the subspectacular space became larger and the superficial cornea presented a hyperechoic band. At day two, eye surface became translucent, and at the same time, vascularization of the spectacle was visible using SLO. At day 3, the vascularization was no longer visible, while the subspectacular space increased and the eye surface remained translucent. At day 4, the eye surface was transparent and the superficial hyperechoic band started to become less bright. At day 5, the old spectacle was shed and all the parameters returned to baseline.\nWe hypothesize that the echogenicity modifications of the anterior cornea correspond to major metabolic activity associated with new spectacle formation.

We investigated the chemotherapeutic effects of the hormone progesterone (P4) on the growth of human GBM in four genetically different cell lines (U87MG, U87dEGFR, U118MG, LN-229) in vitro and in a U87MG subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. At high concentrations (20, 40, and 80 \u03bcM), P4 significantly (P<0.05) decreased tumor cell viability in all cell lines except LN-229. This effect was not blocked by the P4 receptor antagonist RU468. Conversely, at low physiological concentrations (0.1, 1, and 5 \u03bcM) P4 showed a proliferative effect in all cell lines which was blocked by RU486. In nude mice, P4 (100 and 200 mg/kg) inhibited tumor growth significantly (P<0.05) over 5 weeks of treatment and extended survival time of tumor-bearing mice by 60% without signs of systemic toxicity. P4 suppressed tumor vascularization as indicated by the expression of CD31, vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Apoptosis in tumor tissue was detected by the expression of cleaved caspase-3, BCl-2, BAD and p53 proteins and confirmed by TUNEL assay. P4 treatment also suppressed PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, which regulates tumor growth, as demonstrated by the suppression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Our data can be interpreted to suggest that P4 suppresses the growth of human GBM cells both in vitro and in vivo and enhances survival time in mice without any demonstrable side effects.

Cross-linking of IgE bound to surface high affinity receptors for IgE (Fc\u025bRI) by a specific antigen (Ag) triggers signaling events leading to degranulation. We and others have reported the concomitant production and export of an influential multifaceted sphingolipid mediator, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) transported outside of MC by ATP-binding cassettes (ABC) transporters, i.e., independently of degranulation. Indeed, the MC horizon expanded by the discovery of their unique ability to selectively release mediators depending upon the stimulus and receptors involved. Aside from degranulation and transporter usage, MC are also endowed with piecemeal degranulation, a slower process during which mediator release occurs with minor morphological changes. The broad spectrum of pro- and anti-inflammatory bioactive substances MC produce and release, their amounts and delivery pace render these cells bona fide fine-tuners of the immune response.

However, little information exists relative to the activity level or ability to participate in sports after tumor reconstructions.\nThe aims of the study were to answer the following questions: (1) Which sports activity levels and what types of sports can be expected in the long term after tumor reconstruction? (2) Which frequency durations are patients with Ewing's sarcoma able to perform in long-term followup after local control? (3) Do surgical complications affect sports activity level?\nThirty patients (13 females, 17 males; mean age, 18 \u00b1 8 years; range, 2-36 years at diagnosis; mean followup 16 \u00b1 6 years [minimum, 5 years]) were included.

Surgical procedures included surgical resections alone (n = 8), surgical resection with biological reconstruction (n = 9), or endoprosthetic reconstruction (n = 13). We assessed UCLA sports activity levels, kinds of sports as well as the frequency per week and the duration of each training unit at long term (minimum followup, 5 years).\nIn long-term followup 83% patients (25 of 30) were performing athletic activity regularly. The hours/week of sports depended on type of surgery and were highest after resections in the pelvis and femur (5.8) and were lowest after megaprosthetic reconstruction of the pelvis (1.0). Patients undergoing biologic reconstructions were able to perform high-impact sports. UCLA sports activity levels were high after joint-preserving vascularized fibula for tibia reconstruction (7.4) and after megaprosthetic reconstruction of the lower extremity (6.3-6.4) and were low after tumors located in the fibula (4.2). Complications during followup did not significantly influence sports activity in long-term survivors.\nLong-term survivors can achieve high levels of sports activity in many instances.

{"title": "Neurovascular regulation in the ischemic brain.", "abstract": "The brain has high energetic requirements and is therefore highly dependent on adequate cerebral blood supply. To compensate for dangerous fluctuations in cerebral perfusion, the circulation of the brain has evolved intrinsic safeguarding measures.\nThe vascular network of the brain incorporates a high degree of redundancy, allowing the redirection and redistribution of blood flow in the event of vascular occlusion. Furthermore, active responses such as cerebral autoregulation, which acts to maintain constant cerebral blood flow in response to changing blood pressure, and functional hyperemia, which couples blood supply with synaptic activity, allow the brain to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion in the face of varying supply or demand. In the presence of stroke risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, these protective processes are impaired and the susceptibility of the brain to ischemic injury is increased. One potential mechanism for the increased injury is that collateral flow arising from the normally perfused brain and supplying blood flow to the ischemic region is suppressed, resulting in more severe ischemia.\nApproaches to support collateral flow may ameliorate the outcome of focal cerebral ischemia by rescuing cerebral perfusion in potentially viable regions of the ischemic territory.", "journal": "Antioxidants & redox signaling", "date": "2013-12-18", "authors": ["KatherineJackman", "CostantinoIadecola"], "doi": "10.1089/ars.2013.5669"}

The third approach employed contrast-enhanced ultrasound to measure the perfusion volumes of implants in individual animals over time. Human endothelial-lined tubular structures were detected in vivo on days 1 and 2 after implantation, with perfused human vessels detected on days 3 and 4.

After such extensive resections, which can involve long operative times and significant blood loss, there are often substantial bony and soft tissue deficits. However, it is unclear whether the benefits of reconstruction in these cases outweigh the risks involved. In the largest series to date of internal hemipelvectomy patients, we evaluate the effect of reconstruction on surgical complications, postoperative function, and survival. A retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent internal hemipelvectomy between 1998 and 2011. Outcomes for patients who underwent reconstruction were compared to outcomes for those who did not. A total of 111 patients underwent internal hemipelvectomy, of which 51 (45.9%) received reconstruction and 60 (54.1%) did not. In cases of reconstruction, 30 (58.8%) involved placement of mesh for abdominal wall and pelvic floor reconstruction, 27 (52.9%) involved a soft tissue flap, and 15 (29.4%) involved a vascularized bone flap to restore pelvic ring continuity. Two concurrent reconstructive procedures were performed in 22 (43.1%) patients. The overall rate of early complications was 19.8%, which occurred in 15.7% of patients who received reconstruction compared to 23.3% in patients who did not (P = 0.35).

To achieve tension-free wound closure at the grafted site and thus avoid dehiscence and exposure or total loss of the bone graft, extensive soft tissue mobilization is required. In vitro studies have shown the potential of self-filling osmotic tissue expanders to optimize the amount of resulting soft tissue and vascularization of the recipient site.\nThe purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the application and complication rate of osmotic hydrogel expanders inserted subperiosteally prior to bone grafting.\nIn this prospective observational study, eight patients were implanted with 11 intraoral osmotic hydrogel expanders prior to bone augmentation procedures. All expanders were placed in subperiosteal positions using the tunnel technique. The occurrence of soft tissue-related complications such as necrosis, perforation, infection, or wound dehiscence leading to expander loss was defined as the primary parameter for analysis and evaluation. Further clinical parameters were soft tissue quality and quantity as well as expansion duration.\nThe expansion time depended upon defect size and expander dimensions. Complications, that is, perforation of the expanders through the oral mucosa, occurred in two patients (3 expanders) who suffered from extreme preoperative scarring in the treated areas owing to prior trauma in one patient and cleft surgery in the other. Patients were grafted with autologous (n\u2009=\u20097) or synthetic (n\u2009=\u20091) block grafts. The expanders were removed during bone grafting surgery. No further dehiscence occurred during the observation period, and all patients were treated successfully with dental implants and subsequent prosthetic reconstruction.\nWithin the limits of this observational clinical study, hydrogel expanders may help to generate additional soft tissue, and they might contribute to the overall improvement of the bone augmentation process by reducing the risk of complications related to the lack of soft tissue.

After 3 weeks, donor ECs developed into blood vessel-like structures that also contained erythrocytes. However, no donor CMs were found within the implant sites, presumably because host cells including macrophages and T cells infiltrated extensively into the injection sites. To lessen the host response, Matrigel was omitted from the matrix and the modules were rinsed with serum-free medium prior to implantation. Host cell infiltration was attenuated, resulting in a higher degree of vascularization with CM/EC modules than with CM modules without ECs.

{"title": "Human endothelial colony-forming cells expanded with an improved protocol are a useful endothelial cell source for scaffold-based tissue engineering.", "abstract": "One of the major challenges in tissue engineering is to supply larger three-dimensional (3D) bioengineered tissue transplants with sufficient amounts of nutrients and oxygen and to allow metabolite removal. Consequently, artificial vascularization strategies of such transplants are desired. One strategy focuses on endothelial cells capable of initiating new vessel formation, which are settled on scaffolds commonly used in tissue engineering. A bottleneck in this strategy is to obtain sufficient amounts of endothelial cells, as they can be harvested only in small quantities directly from human tissues. Thus, protocols are required to expand appropriate cells in sufficient amounts without interfering with their capability to settle on scaffold materials and to initiate vessel formation. Here, we analysed whether umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) fulfil these requirements. In a first set of experiments, we showed that marginally expanded ECFCs settle and survive on different scaffold biomaterials. Next, we improved ECFC culture conditions and developed a protocol for ECFC expansion compatible with 'Good Manufacturing Practice' (GMP) standards. We replaced animal sera with human platelet lysates and used a novel type of tissue-culture ware. ECFCs cultured under the new conditions revealed significantly lower apoptosis and increased proliferation rates. Simultaneously, their viability was increased. Since extensively expanded ECFCs could still settle on scaffold biomaterials and were able to form tubular structures in Matrigel assays, we conclude that these ex vivo-expanded ECFCs are a novel, very potent cell source for scaffold-based tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2013-02-26", "authors": ["BerndDenecke", "Liska DHorsch", "StefanRadtke", "Johannes CFischer", "Peter AHorn", "BerndGiebel"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1673"}

Skeletal myoblasts were isolated and expanded from newborn male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The cells were transfected with human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF-165) or human stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 transfection reagent, prior to seeding onto calf collagen scaffolds. Gene and protein overexpression was verified by ELISA, RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Cell-seeded scaffolds were transplanted into back muscle defects in female SD rats. At weeks 2, 4 and 8 after transplantation, Y chromosome detection was used to observe the survival of growth factor-producing cells within the scaffolds in vivo. Capillary density was investigated using microvessel density detection, haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical staining. We found that vascularization was enhanced by transfected myoblasts compared with non-transfected myoblasts.

Many efforts to achieve this goal have used proangiogenic proteins-such as vascular endothelial growth factors-to induce the formation of new microvessels. These proteins have demonstrated promise in improving vascularization, but it is also clear that the spatial and temporal presentation of these signals is important for achieving proper vascular function. Delivery systems that present proteins in a localized and sustained manner, can promote the formation and stabilization of microvascular networks by precisely presenting proangiogenic proteins at desired locations, and for specified durations. Further, these systems allow for some control over the sequence of release of multiple proteins, and it has become clear that such coordination is critical for the development of fully functional and mature vascular structures.

The mean age of our patients was 39.7 years, with an equal distribution of men and women. The mean follow-up was 16.4 months. Neoplastic causes accounted for the majority of skull base lesions (11/18 cases), followed by traumatic lesions (5/18 cases).

{"title": "Design and characterization of a tissue-engineered bilayer scaffold for osteochondral tissue repair.", "abstract": "Treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects relies on osteochondral bilayer grafts, which mimic the microenvironment and structure of the two affected tissues: articular cartilage and subchondral bone. However, the integrity and stability of the grafts are hampered by the presence of a weak interphase, generated by the layering processes of scaffold manufacturing. We describe here the design and development of a bilayer monolithic osteochondral graft, avoiding delamination of the two distinct layers but preserving the cues for selective generation of cartilage and bone. A highly porous polycaprolactone-based graft was obtained by combining solvent casting/particulate leaching techniques. Pore structure and interconnections were designed to favour in vivo vascularization only at the bony layer. Hydroxyapatite granules were added as bioactive signals at the site of bone regeneration. Unconfined compressive tests displayed optimal elastic properties and low residual deformation of the graft after unloading (< 3%). The structural integrity of the graft was successfully validated by tension fracture tests, revealing high resistance to delamination, since fractures were never displayed at the interface of the layers (n\u2009=\u20098). Ectopic implantation of grafts in nude mice, after seeding with bovine trabecular bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells and bovine articular chondrocytes, resulted in thick areas of mature bone surrounding ceramic granules within the bony layer, and a cartilaginous alcianophilic matrix in the chondral layer. Vascularization was mostly observed in the bony layer, with a statistically significant higher blood vessel density and mean area. Thus, the easily generated osteochondral scaffolds, since they are mechanically and biologically functional, are suitable for tissue-engineering applications for cartilage repair.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-11-23", "authors": ["PaoloGiannoni", "EricaLazzarini", "LucaCeseracciu", "Alberto CBarone", "RodolfoQuarto", "SilviaScaglione"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1651"}

Thick BTE grafts often exhibit poor cellular viability particularly at the core, leading to graft failure and lack of integration with host tissues. Various BTE approaches have been explored for improving vascularisation in tissue-engineered constructs and are briefly discussed in this review. Recent investigations relating to co-culture systems of endothelial and osteoblast-like cells have shown evidence of BTE efficacy in increasing vascularization in thick constructs. This review provides an overview of key concepts related to bone formation and then focuses on the current state of engineered vascularized co-culture systems using bone repair as a model. It will also address key questions regarding the generation of clinically relevant vascularized bone constructs as well as potential directions and considerations for research with the objective of pursuing engineered co-culture systems in other disciplines of vascularized regenerative medicine. The final objective is to generate serious and functional long-lasting vessels for sustainable angiogenesis that will enable enhanced cellular survival within thick voluminous bone grafts, thereby aiding in bone formation and remodelling in the long term.

Osteo-inductive substances could represent a useful therapeutic approach during the fracture repair process. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of vitamin MK-7, alone or in association with vitamin D3, in differentiating human MSCs (hMSCs) in vitro along the osteoblastic lineage. In particular, primary endpoints of the study include gene and protein markers of osteoblast differentiation. Considering genes involved in bone formation and mineralization, our data show that vitamin MK-7 enhances vitamin D3 gene induction of osteocalcin (OC). Among genes related to cell growth and differentiation, a specific effect of vitamin MK-7 was observed for growth differentiation factor-10 (GDF10) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), the latter being also involved in the induction of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFA). Accordingly, vitamin co-supplementation greatly affected VEGFA and its receptor fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1), a key factor in both angiogenic and osteogenic processes. These results stress the relevance of MK-7 and D3 co-supplementation in the bone-healing process as able to modulate the expression of genes involved in both mineralization and angiogenesis. Moreover, at the protein level co-association of vitamins might provide an optimal balance between induction and carboxylation of osteocalcin, essential for its functionality in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Our results may provide hints for therapeutic application of hMSCs in bone disease, clarifying mechanisms involved in stem cell-mediated bone development, and they also highlight the relevance of co-supplementation strategies, since single supplementations might result in a suboptimal effect.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2012-10-31", "authors": ["AGigante", "FBrug\u00e8", "SCecconi", "SManzotti", "G PLittarru", "LTiano"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1627"}

To reconstruct functional liver tissue in vitro, formation of the HSC-incorporated sinusoidal structure is essential. We previously demonstrated capillary formation of endothelial cells (ECs) in tri-culture, where a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microporous membrane was intercalated between the ECs and hepatic organoids composed of small hepatocytes (SHs), i.e. hepatic progenitor cells, and HSCs. However, the high thickness and low porosity of the membranes limited heterotypic cell-cell interactions, which are essential to form HSC-EC hybrid structures. Here, we focused on the effective use of the thin and highly porous poly( d, l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microporous membranes in SH-HSC-EC tri-culture to reconstruct the HSC-incorporated liver capillary structures in vitro. First, the formation of EC capillary-like structures was induced on Matrigel-coated PLGA microporous membranes. Next, the membranes were stacked on hepatic organoids composed of small SHs and HSCs. When the pore size and porosity of the membranes were optimized, HSCs selectively migrated to the EC capillary-like structures. This process was mediated in part by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signalling. In addition, the HSCs were located along the outer surface of the EC capillary-like structures with their long cytoplasmic processes. In the HSC-incorporated capillary tissues, SHs acquired high levels of differentiated functions, compared to those without ECs.
