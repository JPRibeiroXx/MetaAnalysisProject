These perturbations may alter the trajectory of spiral wave drift in the heart muscle. We investigate the effect of spatially extended inhomogeneity of transverse cell coupling on the spiral wave trajectory using a simple active media model. The spiral wave was either attracted or repelled from the center of inhomogeneity as a function of cell excitability and gradient of the cell coupling. High levels of excitability resulted in an attraction of the wave to the center of inhomogeneity, whereas low levels resulted in an escape and termination of the spiral wave. The spiral wave drift velocity was related to the gradient of the coupling and the initial position of the wave. In a diseased heart, a region of altered transverse coupling corresponds with local gap junction remodeling that may be responsible for stabilization-destabilization of spiral waves and hence reflect potentially important targets in the treatment of heart arrhythmias.", "journal": "Journal of biological physics", "date": "2013-07-19", "authors": ["PawelKuklik", "PrashanthanSanders", "LukaszSzumowski", "Jan J\u017bebrowski"], "doi": "10.1007/s10867-012-9286-4\n10.1063/1.166374\n10.1161/01.RES.74.6.1065\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.3.915\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01443-7\n10.1161/01.CIR.87.5.1742\n10.1103/PhysRevE.72.046204\n10.1063/1.165844\n10.1046/j.1540.8167.90318.x\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2010.02.001\n10.1016/0167-2789(95)00256-1\n10.1063/1.1947427\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.058101\n10.1103/PhysRevE.79.026220\n10.1063/1.166286\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2010.07.005\n10.1103/PhysRevE.75.016107\n10.1103/PhysRevE.75.011929\n10.1103/PhysRevE.61.4943\n10.1016/0167-2789(94)90054-X\n10.2174/1568006033337276\n10.1038/355349a0\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1994.tb01290.x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.598631\n10.1016/0167-2789(95)00059-D\n10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76821-4\n10.1371/journal.pone.0018052\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.481\n10.1016/j.physleta.2004.03.080\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2006.00382.x\n10.1002/(SICI)1522-2594(199908)42:2<393::AID-MRM22>3.0.CO;2-F\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00226-2\n10.1016/S0006-3495(61)86902-6\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1781\n10.1161/01.RES.44.5.701\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.3854\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.168303\n10.1063/1.3263167\n10.1098/rsta.2010.0038\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.11.015"}

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mebudipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.\nMale Wistar rats (250-300 g) were randomly divided to Control-ischemic, mebudipine-ischemic and vehicle (ethanol-ischemic) groups. The hearts of anaesthetized rats were removed and mounted on Langendorff apparatus and perfused by Krebs-Henseleit solution under constant pressure of 75 mmHg at 37\u00b0C. Ischemic groups were received 30 min global ischemia and 120 min reperfusion and the mebudipine and vehicle groups received mebudipine (0.1 nM) or ethanol (0.01%)-enriched solution 25 min before global ischemia. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase levels of heart tissue samples were determined by commercial specific Kits.\nMebudipine significantly reduced the MDA level (2.3 \u00b1 0.07 nmol/mg protein) as the biochemical indicator of oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation product as compared with those of vehicle (4.6 \u00b1 0.01 nmol/mg protein) and control groups (4.8 \u00b1 0.09 nmol/mg protein).

Hydrophilic pH-sensitive nanofiber hydrogel coassembled with hyaluronic acid performed best with both NRCs and hESC-CMs. Hydrophilic non-pH-sensitive nanofiber hydrogels supported the growth of NRCs; however, their ability to promote attachment and growth of hESC-CMs was limited. NRCs also grew on hydrophobic nanofiber hydrogels; however, the cell-supporting capacity of these hydrogels was inferior to that of the hydrophilic hydrogel materials.

Our results indicate that exercised heart ventricles are 33% larger, yet exhibit no significant changes in cardiac physiological function as evaluated by the heart rate and the percent shortening fraction. We found 8% more CM nuclei per cross-sectional area within exercised ventricular tissue, indicating that cardiomegaly was not due to individual cell hypertrophy, but due to hyperplasia.

{"title": "Complement anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a induce a failing regenerative program in cardiac resident cells. Evidence of a role for cardiac resident stem cells other than cardiomyocyte renewal.", "abstract": "Cardiac healing, which follows myocardial infarction, is a complex process guided by intricate interactions among different components. Some resident cell populations with a potential role in cardiac healing have already been described in cardiac tissues. These non-cardiomyocyte cell subsets, globally described as cardiac pluripotent/progenitor cells (CPCs), are able to differentiate into all three major cardiac cell lineages (endothelial, smooth muscle and cardiomyocyte cells) in experimental settings. Nevertheless, physiological cardiac healing results in a fibrous scar, which remains to be fully modelled experimentally. Since a role for complement anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) has been described in several regeneration/repair processes, we examined the effects that C3a and C5a exert on a defined population of CPCs. We found that C3a and C5a are able to enhance CPC migration and proliferation. In vitro studies showed that this effect is linked to activation of telomerase mRNA and partial preservation of telomere length, in an NF\u03baB-dependent manner. In addition, anaphylatoxin signalling modulates the CPC phenotype, increasing myofibroblast differentiation and reducing endothelial and cardiac gene expression. These findings may denote that C3a and C5a are able to maintain/increase the cardiac stem cell pool within the heart, whilst simultaneously facilitating and modulating resident cell differentiation. We found that this modulation was directed towards scar forming cells, which increased fibroblast/myofibroblast generation and suggests that both these anaphylatoxins could play a relevant role in the damage-coupled activation of resident cells, and regulation of the cardiac healing process after injury.", "journal": "SpringerPlus", "date": "2013-03-15", "authors": ["DavidLara-Astiaso", "AlbertoIzarra", "Juan CamiloEstrada", "CarmenAlbo", "IsabelMoscoso", "EnriqueSamper", "JavierMoncayo", "AbelardoSolano", "AntonioBernad", "AntonioD\u00edez-Juan"], "doi": "10.1186/2193-1801-1-63\n10.1038/nrcardio.2011.38\n10.1007/978-1-59745-190-1_25\n10.1016/j.pcad.2007.03.005\n10.1038/nature05221\n10.1126/science.1164680\n10.1126/science.7878466\n10.1182/blood-2007-08-019729\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.10.012\n10.1253/circj.CJ-11-1479\n10.1161/01.RES.0000059306.71961.ED\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243162\n10.1038/353451a0\n10.1002/hep.24217\n10.1084/jem.133.4.885\n10.1093/cvr/cvq050\n10.1016/j.ceb.2005.08.001\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.849588\n10.1093/cvr/cvp297\n10.1161/01.CIR.57.1.56\n10.1016/S0161-5890(01)00041-4\n10.1002/jcp.22322\n10.1038/nature10147\n10.1038/nrc3025\n10.1093/bioinformatics/18.2.333\n10.1161/01.RES.0000147315.71699.51\n10.1161/01.RES.0000232544.90675.42\n10.1096/fj.02-0737com\n10.1016/S0167-4781(98)00198-5\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0705819\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601004\n10.1182/blood-2003-06-2099\n10.1093/embo-reports/kve174\n10.4049/jimmunol.0803055\n10.1002/stem.225\n10.1038/nbt0602-592\n10.1038/ncb985\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2008.02.010\n10.1073/pnas.071483998\n10.1084/jem.20030374\n10.1007/s00395-002-0365-8\n10.1038/nature08039\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.12.062\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.22.2259\n10.1006/exnr.1999.7273\n10.1186/1471-2261-10-45\n10.1056/NEJM200104123441506\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.10.028\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030329\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.03.152\n10.1016/0361-9230(95)00040-2"}

{"title": "Induced spiral motion in cardiac tissue due to alternans.", "abstract": "Spiral wave meander is a typical feature observed in cardiac tissue and in excitable media in general. Here, we show for a simple model of excitable cardiac tissue that a transition to alternans--a beat-to-beat temporal alternation in the duration of cardiac excitation--can also induce a transition in the spiral core motion that is related to the presence of synchronization defect lines (SDLs) or nodal lines. While this is similar to what has been predicted and indeed observed for complex-oscillatory media close to onset, we find important qualitative differences. For example, single straight SDLs rotate and induce an additional nonresonant frequency characterizing the core motion of the attached spiral. We analyze this behavior quantitatively as a function of the steepness of the restitution curve and show that the velocity and the directionality of the core motion vary monotonically with the control parameter. Our findings agree with recent observations in rat heart tissue cultures indicating that the described behavior is of rather general nature. In particular, it could play an important role in the context of potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias such as fibrillation for which alternans and spiral waves are known precursors.", "journal": "Physical review.

{"title": "Characterization of fractionated electrograms using a novel time-frequency based algorithm.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) arises from complex spatiotemporal atrial activation. Current treatment for patients with AF when antiarrhythmic drugs have failed is catheter ablation which uses Radiofrequency (RF) energy to destroy heart tissues that drive AF. Therefore, AF can be terminated once the AF source is localized and eliminated by RF ablation. There is considerable interest in defining whether complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) indicate AF-perpetuation sites. This work proposes a novel time-frequency (TF) based algorithm to characterize CFAE electrograms (EGMs). The proposed technique obtains an automated classifier that is trained based on the differences evidenced between the TF structures of CFAE and non-CFAE EGMs. These characteristics are quantified using 5 TF features which are extracted using a TF matrix decomposition method performed on the EGM. The results from 5 patients with AF show that the proposed method is successful in identifying CFAE vs. non-CFAE EGMs, and might open new perspectives for a novel and reliable mapping technique to accurately characterize and understand AF mechanism.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Tissue and cellular therapies based on the use of stem cells may be useful alternatives to limit the size of myocardial infarction. In this paper, the preliminary results from an experimental campaign for on-line monitoring of myocardium scar infarction are presented. This study has been carried out under a research project that has as main objective the development and application of a bioactive patch implant for regeneration of myocardial infarction. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) has been chosen as a tissue state monitoring technique. What is presented in this communication is the first results of an implantable EIS measurement system which has been implanted in a subset of the animals corresponding to the control group, along one month. In all the animals, the myocardial infarction was induced by the ligation of the first circumflex marginal artery. In the animal group presented, the bioactive patch scaffold and the electrodes were implanted without the stem cells load. The scaffold is a piece of decellularized human pericardium, lyophilized and rehydrated with hydrogel RAD16-I. Nanogold particles were also placed near the electrodes to improve the electrode area conductivity. The results presented correspond to the subset of animals (n = 5), which had implanted the bioimpedance system monitoring the electrical impedance spectrum in vivo during 1 month. Two electrodes were connected to the bioactive patch implant. A total of 14 logarithmically spaced frequencies were measured every 5 minutes, from 100 Hz to 200 kHz. Results show a convergence of low-frequency and high frequency impedance magnitudes along the measurement period, which is coherent with the scar formation.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

We hypothesize that the direction of wave propagation on the epicardial surface is not aligned with the epicardial fiber orientation, due to intramural fiber rotation.

We used a three dimensional computer model of varying thickness with a 120 degree fiber rotation through the thickness. The angle difference between the direction of propagation and fiber orientation was most pronounced for thin tissue, and decreased with increasing tissue thickness.

This study addressed the hypothesis that aging negatively impairs expression of gelsolin, and axerts the regulatory effects on the water channel protein aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) and endotoxin-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). We explored whether the age-related gene changes are associated with the cardiac dysfunction induced by endotoxic stress exposure.

At the end of treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and cardiac tissues were collected for assessing expression of gelsolin, AQP-1, iNOS, and transcription-3 (STAT3). LPS administration led to a decreased contractility while increasing cardiac dimensions in both young and old mice. LPS also markedly induced expression of gelsolin in both animal groups. However, compared to young mice, old mice showed compromised induction of gelsolin and cardiac performance in response to endotoxin. Meanwhile, the LPS-exposed old animals exhibited higher levels of AQP-1, iNOS, and phosphorylated STAT3. Gelsolin-null mice had increased expression of glycosylated AQP-1 and STAT3 phosphorylation as well as cardiac dysfunction. Thus, endotoxin administration induces expression of gelsolin, AQP-1 and pro-inflammatory genes, such as iNOS.

We previously developed cardiac cell sheets using mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell-derived cardiomyocytes, a system to generate an appropriate number of cardiomyocytes derived from ES cells and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, we established a cultivation system with suitable conditions for expansion and cardiac differentiation of mES cells by embryoid body formation using a three-dimensional bioreactor. Daily conventional medium exchanges failed to prevent lactate accumulation and pH decreases in the medium, which led to insufficient cell expansion and cardiac differentiation. Conversely, a continuous perfusion system maintained the lactate concentration and pH stability as well as increased the cell number by up to 300-fold of the seeding cell number and promoted cardiac differentiation after 10 days of differentiation. After a further 8 days of cultivation together with a purification step, around 1 \u00d7 10(8) cardiomyocytes were collected in a 1-L bioreactor culture, and additional treatment with noggin and granulocyte colony stimulating factor increased the number of cardiomyocytes to around 5.5 \u00d7 10(8). Co-culture of mES cell-derived cardiomyocytes with an appropriate number of primary cultured fibroblasts on temperature-responsive culture dishes enabled the formation of cardiac cell sheets and created layered-dense cardiac tissue.

Its effects on cardiac kinetics are modified by phosphorylation. Three phosphorylation sites (Ser275, Ser284, and Ser304) have been identified in vivo, all located in the cardiac-specific M-domain of cMyBP-C. However, recent work has shown that up to 4 phosphate groups are present in human cMyBP-C.\nTo identify and characterize additional phosphorylation sites in human cMyBP-C.\nCardiac MyBP-C was semipurified from human heart tissue. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified a novel phosphorylation site on serine 133 in the proline-alanine-rich linker sequence between the C0 and C1 domains of cMyBP-C. Unlike the known sites, Ser133 was not a target of protein kinase A. In silico kinase prediction revealed glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) as the most likely kinase to phosphorylate Ser133. In vitro incubation of the C0C2 fragment of cMyBP-C with GSK3\u03b2 showed phosphorylation on Ser133. In addition, GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylated Ser304, although the degree of phosphorylation was less compared with protein kinase A-induced phosphorylation at Ser304. GSK3\u03b2 treatment of single membrane-permeabilized human cardiomyocytes significantly enhanced the maximal rate of tension redevelopment.\nGSK3\u03b2 phosphorylates cMyBP-C on a novel site, which is positioned in the proline-alanine-rich region and increases kinetics of force development, suggesting a noncanonical role for GSK3\u03b2 at the sarcomere level.

{"title": "Minimally invasive cell-seeded biomaterial systems for injectable/epicardial implantation in ischemic heart disease.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is characterized by heart-wall thinning, myocyte slippage, and ventricular dilation. The injury to the heart-wall muscle after MI is permanent, as after an abundant cell loss the myocardial tissue lacks the intrinsic capability to regenerate. New therapeutics are required for functional improvement and regeneration of the infarcted myocardium, to overcome harmful diagnosis of patients with heart failure, and to overcome the shortage of heart donors. In the past few years, myocardial tissue engineering has emerged as a new and ambitious approach for treating MI. Several left ventricular assist devices and epicardial patches have been developed for MI. These devices and acellular/cellular cardiac patches are employed surgically and sutured to the epicardial surface of the heart, limiting the region of therapeutic benefit. An injectable system offers the potential benefit of minimally invasive release into the myocardium either to restore the injured extracellular matrix or to act as a scaffold for cell delivery. Furthermore, intramyocardial injection of biomaterials and cells has opened new opportunities to explore and also to augment the potentials of this technique to ease morbidity and mortality rates owing to heart failure. This review summarizes the growing body of literature in the field of myocardial tissue engineering, where biomaterial injection, with or without simultaneous cellular delivery, has been pursued to enhance functional and structural outcomes following MI. Additionally, this review also provides a complete outlook on the tissue-engineering therapies presently being used for myocardial regeneration, as well as some perceptivity into the possible issues that may hinder its progress in the future.", "journal": "International journal of nanomedicine", "date": "2012-12-29", "authors": ["RajeswariRavichandran", "Jayarama ReddyVenugopal", "SubramanianSundarrajan", "ShayantiMukherjee", "SeeramRamakrishna"], "doi": "10.2147/IJN.S37575"}

Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from cardiac tissues of neonatal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by the trypsin digestion and differential adhesion method. The cells were treated with 5 ng/mL TGF-\u03b21 alone or pretreated with TSN II A at different concentrations (10(-5) mol/L, 10(-4) mol/L). Immunocytochemistry was used for cell identification, RT-PCR for detection of the mRNA expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and collagen type I (COL I), Western blotting for detection of the protein expression of Smad7 and Smad3, and immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining for detection of the protein expression of phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3), CTGF and COLI. The results showed that TGF-\u03b21 induced the expression of CTGF, COL I, p-Smad3 and Smad7 in a time-dependent manner. The mRNA expression of CTGF and COL I was significantly increased 24 h after TGF-\u03b21 stimulation (P<0.01 for all). The protein expression of p-Smad3 and Smad7 reached a peak 1 h after TGF-\u03b21 stimulation, much higher than the baseline level (P<0.01 for all). Pretreatment with high concentration of TSN A resulted in a decrease in the expression of p-Smad3, CTGF and COL I (P<0.01). The protein expression of Smad7 was substantially upregulated after pretreatment with two concentrations of TSN II A as compared with that at 2 h post TGF-\u03b21 stimulation (P<0.05 for low concentration of TSN I IA; P<0.01 for high concentration of TSN II A). It was concluded that TSN II A may exert an inhibitory effect on cardiac fibrosis by upregulating the expression of Smad7, suppressing the TGF-\u03b21-induced phosphorylation of Smad3 and partially blocking the TGF-\u03b21-Smads signaling pathway.", "journal": "Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

In this study, we sought to determine, via an animal model, whether the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) and the amino peptide neuropeptide Y (NPY) play a role in the pathogenesis of this cardiac entity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats in the experimental group were subjected to immobilization in a plexy glass box for 1 h, which was followed by low voltage electric foot shock for about 1 h at 10 s intervals in a cage fitted with metallic rods. After 25 days the rats were sacrificed and sections of their hearts were processed. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of cardiac tissues revealed the characteristic cardiac lesions of stress cardiomyopathy such as contraction band necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis for PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression showed significant overexpression of PGC1-\u03b1 in the stress-subjected rats (P<0.05). Fluorescence immunohistochemistry revealed a higher production of NPY in the stress-subjected rats as compared to the control rats (P=0.0027). Thus, we are led to conclude that following periods of intense stress, an increased expression of PGC1-\u03b1 in the heart and an overflow of NPY may lead to stress cardiomyopathy and even death in susceptible victims. Moreover, these markers can be used to identify stress cardiomyopathy as the cause of sudden death in specific cases.", "journal": "Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Our aim was to describe the expression of LXRs in the murine heart, and to determine effects of cardiac LXR activation on target gene expression, lipid homeostasis and ischemia. Both LXR\u03b1 and -\u03b2 were expressed in heart tissues, HL-1 cells and isolated cardiomyocytes as determined by qRT-PCR. Elevated cardiac expression of LXR target genes and LXR\u03b2 was observed 24\u00a0h after in vivo permanent coronary artery ligation. The synthetic LXR agonist GW3965 induced mRNA expression of the LXR target genes in HL-1 cells and isolated cardiomyocytes. This was associated with a buildup of intracellular triglycerides and expanding lipid droplets as quantified by confocal microscopy. Mice injected with GW3965 had cardiac LXR activation as judged by increased target gene expression and lipid droplet accumulation. GW3965 in vivo and in vitro increased expression of genes inducing triglyceride synthesis, and altered expression of lipid droplet-binding protein genes. GW3965 protected HL-1 cells against hypoxia-reoxygenation induced apoptosis. LXR activation by GW3965 in vivo prior to heart isolation and perfusion with induced global ischemia and reperfusion improved left ventricular contractile function and decreased infarct size. In conclusion, LXRs are expressed in the murine heart in the basal state, and are activated by myocardial infarction.

In the first family, two brothers presented with vascular strokes, lactic acidosis, cardiomyopathy and cataracts, abnormal muscle cell histopathology and mitochondrial function. One proband had very abnormal mitochondria with citrate synthase crystals visible in electron micrographs, associated with markedly high citrate synthase activity. Exome sequencing was used to identify mutations in the AGK gene in the index patient. Targeted sequencing confirmed the same homozygous mutation (c.3G>A, p.M1I) in the brother. The second family had four affected members, of which we examined two. They also presented with similar clinical symptoms, but no strokes. Postmortem heart and skeletal muscle tissues showed low complex I, III and IV activities in the heart, but normal in the muscle. Skin fibroblasts showed elevated lactate/pyruvate ratios and low complex I+III activity. Targeted sequencing led to identification of a homozygous c.979A>T, p.K327* mutation. AGK is located in the mitochondria and phosphorylates monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol to lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid. Disruption of these signaling molecules affects the mitochondria's response to superoxide radicals, resulting in oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA, lipids and proteins, and stimulation of cellular detoxification pathways. High levels of manganese superoxide dismutase protein were detected in all four affected individuals, consistent with increased free radical damage. Phosphatidic acid is also involved in the synthesis of phospholipids and its loss will result in changes to the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane. These effects manifest as cataract formation in the eye, respiratory chain dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy in heart tissue. These two pedigrees confirm that mutation of AGK is responsible for the severe neonatal presentation of Sengers syndrome. The identification of citrate synthase precipitates by electron microscopy and the presence of vascular strokes in two siblings may expand the cellular and clinical phenotype of this disease.", "journal": "Molecular genetics and metabolism", "date": "2012-12-26", "authors": ["KomudiSiriwardena", "NevenaMackay", "ValeriyLevandovskiy", "SusanBlaser", "JulianRaiman", "Paul FKantor", "CameronAckerley", "Brian HRobinson", "AndreasSchulze", "Jessie MCameron"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.11.282"}

We performed immunohistochemical measurements of translocated eNOS activation as well as eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177, Thr495, Ser 635, Ser114, and of the protein kinase B (Akt) in isolated right atrial trabeculae of patients undergoing cardiac bypass or valve surgery with (n = 12, 68.1 \u00b1 2.5 yr) and without T2D (n = 12, 64.7 \u00b1 2.7 yr). In addition, we investigated oxidative (8-isoprostane) and nitrosative stress markers (nitrotyrosine) as well as the effect of pharmacological stimulation of angiotensin (AT)-receptors on eNOS-phosphorylation. Translocation-dependent eNOS activation was similar in both groups. The same holds true for eNOS phosphorylation at Ser114. eNOS phosphorylation at Ser635 was significantly increased, whereas eNOS phosphorylation of Ser1177 was significantly decreased in the diabetic group paralleled by a decrease in phosphorylation of Akt and Thr495. These alterations were accompanied by a significant decrease in nitrotyrosine. After application of angiotensin II (10 \u03bcM, 2 min) for investigation of the AT-receptor-dependent eNOS stimulation, we did not find differences between the increases in eNOS Ser1177-phosphorylation in the nondiabetic (+39.7 \u00b1 23.5%) and in the diabetic group (32.22 \u00b1 11.45%). A simultaneous increase in Akt phosphorylation could not be observed. The present study indicates that T2D goes along with a decrease in eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 under basal conditions in cardiac tissue.

{"title": "FoxO1 is crucial for sustaining cardiomyocyte metabolism and cell survival.", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a term used to describe cardiac muscle damage-induced heart failure. Multiple structural and biochemical reasons have been suggested to induce this disorder. The most prominent feature of the diabetic myocardium is attenuated insulin signalling that reduces survival kinases (Akt), potentially switching on protein targets like FoxOs, initiators of cell death. FoxO1, a prominent member of the forkhead box family and subfamily O of transcription factors and produced from the FKHR gene, is involved in regulating metabolism, cell proliferation, oxidative stress response, immune homeostasis, pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, and cell death. In this review we describe distinctive functions of FoxOs, specifically FoxO1 under conditions of nutrient excess, insulin resistance and diabetes, and its manipulation to restore metabolic equilibrium to limit cardiac damage due to cell death. Because FoxO1 helps cardiac tissue to combat a variety of stress stimuli, it could be a major determinant in regulating diabetic cardiomyopathy. In this regard, we highlight studies from our group and others who illustrate how cardiac tissue-specific FoxO1 deletion protects the heart against cardiomyopathy and how its down-regulation in endothelial tissue could prevent against atherosclerotic plaques. In addition, we also describe studies that show FoxO1's beneficial qualities by highlighting their role in inducing anti-oxidant, autophagic, and anti-apoptotic genes under stress conditions of ischaemia-reperfusion and myocardial infarction. Thus, the aforementioned FoxO1 traits could be useful in curbing cardiac tissue-specific impairment of function following diabetes.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2012-12-25", "authors": ["PrasanthPuthanveetil", "AndreaWan", "BrianRodrigues"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvs426"}

Local damage induced by the parasite and the immune response causes chronic heart and digestive lesions. Efforts to develop a therapeutic vaccine that boosts the immune response to completely clear the parasite are needed because there is no effective treatment for chronically infected patients. In an attempt to modify the host-parasite equilibrium to increase parasite destruction, we analyzed cardiopathy and the immune response in chronically infected mice that were challenged with live homologous parasites. Challenge with a single dose of parasite increased CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell populations, gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) production, and serum-specific IgG levels. However, subpatent parasitemias and cardiac tissue were not affected. Because of the short duration of the immune boost after a single challenge, we next evaluated the impact of four parasite doses, administered 3 weeks apart. At 1 to 2 months after the last dose, the numbers of CD4(+) T cells and IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4(+) memory cells and the CD4(+) T cell proliferative response to T. cruzi antigen were increased in the spleen. The frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8(+) memory cells in the blood was also increased. However, the sustained challenge did not favor TH1 development; rather, it induced an increase in serum-specific IgG1 levels and mixed TH1/TH2 cytokine production.

Mutations of KCNQ1 genes that result in reduction or loss of channel activity cause prolongation of repolarization during action potential, thereby causing long QT syndrome (LQTs). Small molecule activators of KCNQ1/KCNE1 are useful both for understanding the mechanism of the complex activity and for developing therapeutics for LQTs. In this study we report that hexachlorophene (HCP), the active component of the topical anti-infective prescription drug pHisoHex, is a KCNQ1/KCNE1 activator. HCP potently increases the current amplitude of KCNQ1/KCNE1 expressed by stabilizing the channel in an open state with an EC(50) of 4.61 \u00b1 1.29 \u03bcM. Further studies in cardiomyocytes showed that HCP significantly shortens the action potential duration at 1 \u03bcM.

In this study, we found that SSH1L promoted morphology changes of microfilaments during differentiation but was inhibited by the inhibitors of actin polymerization such as cytochalasin D. Overexpression of SSH1L could promote cardiac-specific protein and genes expression. 5-Aza can induce the differentiation of hMSCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro.

We treated male wistar rats with CCl(4) and either OGE (0.02\u2009g/kg B.W. or 0.04\u2009g/kg B.W.) or silymarin (0.2\u2009g/kg B.W.). Cardiac eccentric hypertrophy was induced by CCl(4) along with cirrhosis and increased expression of cardiac hypertrophy related genes NFAT, TAGA4, and NBP, and the interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathway related genes MEK5, ERK5, JAK, and STAT3. OGE or silymarin co-treatment attenuated CCl(4)-induced cardiac abnormalities, and lowered expression of genes which were elevated by this hepatotoxin. Our results suggest that the IL-6 signaling pathway may be related to CCl(4)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. OGE and silymarin were able to lower liver fibrosis, which reduces the chance of cardiac hypertrophy perhaps by lowering the expressions of IL-6 signaling pathway related genes.

{"title": "Procedure for decellularization of porcine heart by retrograde coronary perfusion.", "abstract": "Perfusion-based whole organ decellularization has recently gained interest in the field of tissue engineering as a means to create site-specific extracellular matrix scaffolds, while largely preserving the native architecture of the scaffold. To date, this approach has been utilized in a variety of organ systems, including the heart, lung, and liver (1-5). Previous decellularization methods for tissues without an easily accessible vascular network have relied upon prolonged exposure of tissue to solutions of detergents, acids, or enzymatic treatments as a means to remove the cellular and nuclear components from the surrounding extracellular environment(6-8). However, the effectiveness of these methods hinged upon the ability of the solutions to permeate the tissue via diffusion. In contrast, perfusion of organs through the natural vascular system effectively reduced the diffusion distance and facilitated transport of decellularization agents into the tissue and cellular components out of the tissue. Herein, we describe a method to fully decellularize an intact porcine heart through coronary retrograde perfusion. The protocol yielded a fully decellularized cardiac extracellular matrix (c-ECM) scaffold with the three-dimensional structure of the heart intact. Our method used a series of enzymes, detergents, and acids coupled with hypertonic and hypotonic rinses to aid in the lysis and removal of cells. The protocol used a Trypsin solution to detach cells from the matrix followed by Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate solutions to aid in removal of cellular material. The described protocol also uses perfusion speeds of greater than 2 L/min for extended periods of time. The high flow rate, coupled with solution changes allowed transport of agents to the tissue without contamination of cellular debris and ensured effective rinsing of the tissue. The described method removed all nuclear material from native porcine cardiac tissue, creating a site-specific cardiac ECM scaffold that can be used for a variety of applications.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-12-18", "authors": ["Nathaniel TRemlinger", "Peter DWearden", "Thomas WGilbert"], "doi": "10.3791/50059"}
{"title": "Pressure overload differentially affects respiratory capacity in interfibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria.", "abstract": "Years ago a debate arose as to whether two functionally different mitochondrial subpopulations, subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) and interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM), exist in heart muscle. Nowadays potential differences are often ignored. Presumably, SSM are providing ATP for basic cell function, whereas IFM provide energy for the contractile apparatus. We speculated that two distinguishable subpopulations exist that are differentially affected by pressure overload. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transverse aortic constriction for 20 wk or sham operation. Contractile function was assessed by echocardiography. Heart tissue was analyzed by electron microscopy. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation, and respiratory capacity was analyzed using a Clark electrode. Pressure overload induced left ventricular hypertrophy with increased posterior wall diameter and impaired contractile function. Mitochondrial state 3 respiration in control was 50% higher in IFM than in SSM. Pressure overload significantly impaired respiratory rates in both IFM and SSM, but in SSM to a lower extent. As a result, there were no differences between SSM and IFM after 20 wk of pressure overload. Pressure overload reduced total citrate synthase activity, suggesting reduced total mitochondrial content. Electron microscopy revealed normal morphology of mitochondria but reduced total mitochondrial volume density. In conclusion, IFM show greater respiratory capacity in the healthy rat heart and a greater depression of respiratory capacity by pressure overload than SSM. The differences in respiratory capacity of cardiac IFM and SSM in healthy hearts are eliminated with pressure overload-induced heart failure. The strong effect of pressure overload on IFM together with the simultaneous appearance of mitochondrial and contractile dysfunction may support the notion of IFM primarily producing ATP for contractile function.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We aimed to distinguish the influence of cell-cell coupling between myocytes and MSCs from that of MSC-derived paracrine factors on the spontaneous activity and conduction velocity (\u03b8) of multicellular cardiomyocyte preparations. HL-1 cells were plated on microelectrode arrays and their spontaneous activity and \u03b8 was determined from field potential recordings. In heterocellular cultures of MSCs and HL-1 cells the beating frequency was attenuated (t(0h): 2.26 \u00b1 0.18 Hz; t(4h): 1.98 \u00b1 0.26 Hz; P < 0.01) concomitant to the intercellular coupling between MSCs and cardiomyocytes. In HL-1 monolayers supplemented with MSC conditioned media (ConM) or tyrode (ConT) \u03b8 significantly increased in a time-dependent manner (ConT: t(0h): 2.4 cm/s \u00b1 0.2; t(4h): 3.1 \u00b1 0.4 cm/s), whereas the beating frequency remained constant. Connexin (Cx)43 mRNA and protein expression levels also increased after ConM or ConT treatment over the same time period. Enhanced low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) phosphorylation after ConT treatment implicates the Wnt signaling pathway. Suppression of Wnt secretion from MSCs (IWP-2; 5 \u03bcmol/l) reduced the efficacy of ConT to induce phospho-LRP6 and to increase \u03b8. Inhibition of \u03b2-catenin (cardamonin; 10 \u03bcmol/l) or GSK3-\u03b1/\u03b2 (LiCl; 5 mmol/l) also suppressed changes in \u03b8, further supporting the hypothesis that MSC-mediated Cx43 upregulation occurs in part through secreted Wnt ligands and activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Bilateral uterine vessel ligation to induce growth restriction (Restricted) or sham surgery was performed at pregnancy day 18. In male and female Controls, expression of most cardiac genes decreased during postnatal life, including genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis regulation such as PGC-1\u03b1, NRF-2, and mtTFA and the glucose transporter GLUT-1 (P < 0.05). However, the pattern of gene expression during cardiac development differed in male and female Restricted rats compared with their respective Controls. These effects of restriction were observed at postnatal day 1, with female Restricted rats having delayed reductions in PGC-1\u03b1 and GLUT-1, whereas males had exacerbated reductions in PGC-1\u03b1 and mtTFA (P < 0.05). By day 35, cardiac gene expression in Restricted hearts was similar to Controls, except for expression of the antioxidant enzyme MnSOD, which was significantly lower in both sexes. In summary, during postnatal life male and female Control rats have similar patterns of expression for genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose transport.

The present study investigated the cardiotoxicity of prolonged intake of MCP. Wistar rats were administered 1/50th of LD50 dosage of MCP (0.36mg/kg body weight) orally via gavage daily for three weeks. MCP administered animals exhibited mild-hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in blood. Cardiac oxidative stress was conferred by accumulation of protein carbonyls, lipid peroxidation and glutathione production. The cardiac markers (cTn-I, CK-MB and LDH) were showed elevated expression in blood plasma, which signals the cardiac tissue damage. The histopathology of the heart tissue authenticated the MCP induced tissue damage by showing signs of nonspecific inflammatory changes and oedema between muscle fibres. Thus the findings of this preliminary study illustrate the cardiotoxic effect of prolonged MCP intake in rats and suggest that MCP can be a possible independent and potent environmental cardiovascular risk factor.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["GVelmurugan", "D DVenkatesh Babu", "SubbiahRamasamy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tox.2012.11.022"}
{"title": "Simulations of complex and microscopic models of cardiac electrophysiology powered by multi-GPU platforms.", "abstract": "Key aspects of cardiac electrophysiology, such as slow conduction, conduction block, and saltatory effects have been the research topic of many studies since they are strongly related to cardiac arrhythmia, reentry, fibrillation, or defibrillation. However, to reproduce these phenomena the numerical models need to use subcellular discretization for the solution of the PDEs and nonuniform, heterogeneous tissue electric conductivity. Due to the high computational costs of simulations that reproduce the fine microstructure of cardiac tissue, previous studies have considered tissue experiments of small or moderate sizes and used simple cardiac cell models. In this paper, we develop a cardiac electrophysiology model that captures the microstructure of cardiac tissue by using a very fine spatial discretization (8\u2009\u03bcm) and uses a very modern and complex cell model based on Markov chains for the characterization of ion channel's structure and dynamics. To cope with the computational challenges, the model was parallelized using a hybrid approach: cluster computing and GPGPUs (general-purpose computing on graphics processing units). Our parallel implementation of this model using a multi-GPU platform was able to reduce the execution times of the simulations from more than 6 days (on a single processor) to 21 minutes (on a small 8-node cluster equipped with 16 GPUs, i.e., 2 GPUs per node).", "journal": "Computational and mathematical methods in medicine", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["BrunoGouv\u00eaa de Barros", "RafaelSachetto Oliveira", "WagnerMeira", "MarceloLobosco", "RodrigoWeber dos Santos"], "doi": "10.1155/2012/824569"}

By injecting anti-sense morpholino oligonucleotides to knock down Rap1a and Rap1b in zebrafish embryos, and in combination with time-lapsed imaging, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscope techniques, we seek to understand the role of Rap1 in cardiac development and functions. At an optimized low dose of mixed rap1a and rap1b morpholino oligonucleotides, the heart developed essentially normally until cardiac contraction occurred. Morphant hearts showed the myocardium defect phenotypes, most likely due to disrupted myofibril assembly and alignment. In vivo heart electrocardiography revealed prolonged P-R interval and QRS duration, consistent with an adherens junction defect and reduced Connexons in cardiac myocytes of morphants.

{"title": "Functional feeds reduce heart inflammation and pathology in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar L.) following experimental challenge with Atlantic salmon reovirus (ASRV).", "abstract": "Heart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation (HSMI), recently associated with a novel Atlantic salmon reovirus (ASRV), is currently one of the most prevalent inflammatory diseases in commercial Atlantic salmon farms in Norway. Mortality varies from low to 20%, but morbidity can be very high, reducing growth performance and causing considerable financial impact. Clinical symptoms, including myocarditis, myocardial and red skeletal muscle necrosis, correlate with the intensity of the inflammatory response. In the present study, the effects of two functional feeds (FF1 and FF2) were compared to a standard commercial reference feed (ST) in Atlantic salmon subjected to an ASRV challenge. The functional feeds had reduced levels of total lipid and digestible energy, and different levels and proportions of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). The objective was to determine whether these feeds could provide effective protection by decreasing the inflammatory response associated with HSMI. Histopathology, viral load, fatty acid composition and gene expression of heart tissue were assessed over a period of 16 weeks post-infection with ASRV. The viral load and histopathology scores in heart tissue in response to ASRV infection were reduced in fish fed both functional feeds, with FF1 showing the greatest effect. Microarray hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the functional feeds greatly affected expression of inflammation/immune related genes over the course of the ASRV infection. Viral load correlated with up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes at the early-mid stages of infection in fish fed the ST diet. Expression of inflammatory genes 16-weeks after ASRV challenge reflected the difference in efficacy between the functional feeds, with fish fed FF1 showing lower expression. Thus, severity of the lesions in heart tissue correlated with the intensity of the innate immune response and was associated with tissue fatty acid compositions. The present study demonstrated that dietary modulation through clinical nutrition had major influences on the development and severity of the response to ASRV infection in salmon. Thus, HSMI was reduced in fish fed the functional feeds, particularly FF1. The modulation of gene expression between fish fed the different feeds provided further insight into the molecular mechanisms and progression of the inflammatory and immune responses to ASRV infection in salmon.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["LauraMartinez-Rubio", "SofiaMorais", "\u00d8ysteinEvensen", "SimonWadsworth", "KariRuohonen", "Jose L GVecino", "J GordonBell", "Douglas RTocher"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0040266\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011487\n10.1016/j.fsi.2011.02.023"}

While the bona fide stem cells express telomerase, their progenies are no longer able to preserve telomeric DNA; hence the balance between their proliferation and differentiation has to be tightly controlled in order to prevent cellular senescence and apoptosis of CPCs before their maturation can be accomplished. We have examined at cellular and molecular level the proliferation, apoptosis and commitment of CPCs isolated from normal (CPC-N) and age-matched pathological adult human hearts (CPC-P) with ischemic heart disease. In the CPC-P, genes related to early stages of developmental processes, nervous system development and neurogenesis, skeletal development, bone and cartilage development were downregulated, while those involved in mesenchymal cell differentiation and heart development were upregulated, together with the transcriptional activation of TGF\u03b2/BMP signaling pathway. In the pathological heart, asymmetric division was the prevalent type of cardiac stem cell division. The population of CPC-P consisted mainly of progenitors of cardiac cell lineages and less precursors; these cells proliferated more, but were also more susceptible to apoptosis with respect to CPC-N. These results indicate that CPCs fail to reach terminal differentiation and functional competence in pathological conditions.

The present study investigated whether through the above two mechanisms MG-132 could provide a therapeutic effect on diabetic cardiomyopathy in the OVE26 type 1 diabetic mouse model. OVE26 mice develop hyperglycemia at 2-3 wk after birth and exhibit albuminuria and cardiac dysfunction at 3 mo of age. Therefore, 3-mo-old OVE26 diabetic and age-matched control mice were intraperitoneally treated with MG-132 at 10 \u03bcg/kg daily for 3 mo. Before and after MG-132 treatment, cardiac function was measured by echocardiography, and cardiac tissues were then subjected to pathological and biochemical examination. Diabetic mice showed significant cardiac dysfunction, including increased left ventricular systolic diameter and wall thickness and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction with an increase of the heart weight-to-tibia length ratio. Diabetic hearts exhibited structural derangement and remodeling (fibrosis and hypertrophy). In diabetic mice, there was also increased systemic and cardiac oxidative damage and inflammation. All of these pathogenic changes were reversed by MG-132 treatment. MG-132 treatment significantly increased the cardiac expression of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant genes with a significant increase of total antioxidant capacity and also significantly decreased the expression of I\u03baB and the nuclear accumulation and DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB in the heart.

Thus, the chiral carbon atom of doxazosin does not affect its activity at the therapeutic target of \u03b1(1A)-adrenoceptors in the prostate, but significantly changes its blocking activity against \u03b1(1D)-adrenoceptors in the aorta, and produces opposite inotropic effects in the atria via an \u03b1(1)-adrenoceptor-independent mechanism.", "journal": "Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology", "date": "2012-12-06", "authors": ["DingZhao", "Li-HuaDuan", "Feng-YuWang", "MiaoWang", "Hai-GangLu", "Zhi-GangWu", "XueWang", "Lei-MingRen"], "doi": "10.1139/y2012-129"}
{"title": "Electrical field stimulation induces cardiac fibroblast proliferation through the calcineurin-NFAT pathway.", "abstract": "Most cardiac diseases are associated with fibrosis. Calcineurin (CaN) is regulated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM). The CaN-NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cell) pathway is involved in the process of cardiac diseases, such as cardiac hypertrophy, but its effect on myocardial fibrosis remains unclear. The present study investigates whether the CaN-NFAT pathway is involved in cardiac fibroblast (CF) proliferation induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS), which recently became a popular treatment for heart failure and cardiac tissue engineering. CF proliferation was evaluated by a cell survival assay (MTT) and cell counts. Myocardial fibrosis was assessed by collagen I and collagen III protein expression. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged NFAT was used to detect NFAT nuclear translocation. CF proliferation, myocardial fibrosis, CaN activity, and NFAT nuclear translocation were enhanced by EFS. More importantly, these effects were abolished by CaN inhibitors, dominant negative CaN (DN-CaN), and CaN gene silenced with siRNA. Furthermore, buffering intracellular Ca(2+) with BAPTA-AM and blocking Ca(2+) influx with nifedipine suppressed EFS-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+) and CF proliferation. These results suggested that the CaN-NFAT pathway mediates CF proliferation, and that the CaN-NFAT pathway might be a possible therapeutic target for EFS-induced myocardial fibrosis and cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology", "date": "2012-12-06", "authors": ["Qing-QingChen", "WeiZhang", "Xiang-FanChen", "Yun-JianBao", "JingWang", "Wei-ZhongZhu"], "doi": "10.1139/y2012-133"}

The nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-containing pyrin receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been linked to inflammation and NLRP3 is especially important for increased inflammation in atherosclerosis, which may lead to myocardial infarction. Here we investigated how inflammasome molecules are affected in human ischemic heart tissue. Surprisingly the important member of the inflammasome complex, NLRP3, displayed markedly decreased levels in human ischemic heart tissue compared with non ischemic control heart tissue. However, subsequent gene analysis revealed mutations in NLRP3 in human ischemic heart tissues but not in non-ischemic control tissue. Gene polymorphisms in the NLRP3 inflammasome have been shown to be associated with increased IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 production and severe inflammation. The autoinflammatory disorder familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is associated with decreased expression of the Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV) and increased inflammation. We also observed reduced expression of MEFV in ischemic versus non-ischemic heart tissue. Further analyses showed a mutation in MEFV in human ischemic heart tissue but not in non-ischemic control tissue.

{"title": "High dietary fat selectively increases catalase expression within cardiac mitochondria.", "abstract": "Obesity is a predictor of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. One consequence of obesity is dyslipidemia characterized by high blood triglycerides. It has been proposed that oxidative stress, driven by utilization of lipids for energy, contributes to these diseases. The effects of oxidative stress are mitigated by an endogenous antioxidant enzyme network, but little is known about its response to high fat utilization. Our experiments used a multiplexed quantitative proteomics method to measure antioxidant enzyme expression in heart tissue in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. This experiment showed a rapid and specific up-regulation of catalase protein, with subsequent assays showing increases in activity and mRNA. Catalase, traditionally considered a peroxisomal protein, was found to be present in cardiac mitochondria and significantly increased in content and activity during high fat feeding. These data, coupled with the fact that fatty acid oxidation enhances mitochondrial H(2)O(2) production, suggest that a localized catalase increase is needed to consume excessive mitochondrial H(2)O(2) produced by increased fat metabolism. To determine whether the catalase-specific response is a common feature of physiological conditions that increase blood triglycerides and fatty acid oxidation, we measured changes in antioxidant expression in fasted versus fed mice. Indeed, a similar specific catalase increase was observed in mice fasted for 24 h. Our findings suggest a fundamental metabolic process in which catalase expression is regulated to prevent damage while preserving an H(2)O(2)-mediated sensing of diet composition that appropriately adjusts insulin sensitivity in the short term as needed to prioritize lipid metabolism for complete utilization.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2012-12-04", "authors": ["Paul MRindler", "Scott MPlafker", "Luke ISzweda", "MichaelKinter"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M112.412890\n10.1074/mcp.M111.013987"}

RIPC was induced by four 5-min cycles of transient upper limb ischemia/reperfusion using a blood-pressure cuff. Right atrial tissue and serum were obtained from patients receiving RIPC (N = 32) and control patients (N = 29) before and after CPB.

Morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular complications, due to increased oxidative stress and inflammatory signals, are the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes. The precise molecular mechanism of contractile dysfunction and disease progression remains to be clarified. Therefore, we have investigated molecular and metabolic targets in male ZDF (30--34 weeks old) rat heart compared to age matched Zucker lean (ZL) controls. Hyperglycemia was confirmed by a 4-fold elevation in non-fasting blood glucose (478.43 \u00b1 29.22 mg/dL in ZDF vs. 108.22 \u00b1 2.52 mg/dL in ZL rats). An increase in reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation and oxidative protein carbonylation was observed in ZDF rats. A significant increase in CYP4502E1 activity accompanied by increased protein expression was also observed in diabetic rat heart. Increased expression of other oxidative stress marker proteins, HO-1 and iNOS was also observed. GSH concentration and activities of GSH-dependent enzymes, glutathione S-transferase and GSH reductase, were, however, significantly increased in ZDF heart tissue suggesting a compensatory defense mechanism. The activities of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, Complex I and Complex IV were significantly reduced in the heart ventricle of ZDF rats in comparison to ZL rats.

{"title": "Concise review: bone marrow mononuclear cells for the treatment of ischemic syndromes: medicinal product or cell transplantation?", "abstract": "In November of 2011, the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published two scientific recommendations regarding the classification of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and autologous bone marrow-derived CD133+ cells as advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), specifically tissue-engineered products, when intended for regeneration in ischemic heart tissue on the basis that they are not used for the same essential function (hematological restoration) that they fulfill in the donor. In vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrates that bone marrow cells are physiologically involved in adult neovascularization and tissue repair, making their therapeutic use for these purposes a simple exploitation of their own essential functions. Therefore, from a scientific/legal point of view, nonsubstantially manipulated BM-MNCs and CD133+ cells are not an ATMP, because they have a physiological role in the processes of postnatal neovascularization and, when used therapeutically for vascular restoration in ischemic tissues, they are carrying out one of their essential physiological functions (the legal definition recognizes that cells can have several essential functions). The consequences of classifying BM-MNCs and CD133+ cells as medicinal products instead of cellular transplantation, like bone marrow transplantation, in terms of costs and time for these products to be introduced into clinical practice, make this an issue of crucial importance.

The aim of the model is to reproduce action potencial morphologies and restitution curves obtained, either from experimental data, or from more complex electrophysiological models. The model divides all ion currents into four groups according to their function, thus resulting into fast-slow and inward-outward currents. We show that this simplified model is flexible enough as to accurately capture the electrical properties of cardiac myocytes, having the advantage of being less computational demanding than detailed electrophysiological models. Under some conditions, it has been shown to be amenable to mathematical analysis. The model reproduces the action potential (AP) change with stimulation rate observed both experimentally and in realistic models of healthy human and guinea pig myocytes (TNNP and LRd models, respectively). When simulated in a cable it also gives the right dependence of the conduction velocity (CV) with stimulation rate. Besides reproducing correctly these restitution properties, it also gives a good fit for the morphology of the AP, including the notch typical of phase 1. Finally, we perform simulations in a realistic geometric model of the rabbit's ventricles, finding a good qualitative agreement in AP propagation and the ECG.

{"title": "Polymorphisms in genes encoding nonsarcomeric proteins and their role in the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), clinically characterized by contractile dysfunction and ventricular chamber enlargement, is a heterogeneous heart disease leading to progressive systolic heart failure and sudden cardiac death. The etiology of the disease is multifactorial and involves genetic factors, viral infections, autoimmune phenomena, and toxic agents. Within the last two decades, a growing body of evidence has suggested that single-gene mutations play a pivotal role in the development of familial forms of dilated cardiomyopathies. Numerous genes encoding cytoskeletal, sarcomeric, and nuclear proteins have been linked to the pathogenesis of DCM, and most of the respective mutants disrupt the structural integrity of sarcomeres in cardiac myocytes. Frequently, point mutations in cytoskeletal proteins critically diminish force generation and interfere with mechanical transduction within the contractile apparatus of the myocardium, thereby ultimately leading to impaired systolic function. However, hitherto reported sarcomeric gene defects explain the etiology of the disease only in some families, leaving other forms of DCM subentities unresolved. Since one of the major factors in DCM pathogenesis involves autoimmune-mediated damage to cardiac tissue, candidate genes that are involved in controlling immune reactions have currently come into focus in genetic research. We and others have shown that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) is associated with the diagnosis of DCM. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 is an inhibitory receptor molecule expressed on activated T lymphocytes, where it functions as an important negative regulator of T-cell activation by competing with the costimulatory CD28 receptor to bind to B7 receptors localized on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The observed association between CTLA4 genotypes and DCM suggests that genetic factors contribute to both unbalanced immune responses in the myocardium and the development of left ventricular dysfunction.

{"title": "Effects of chronic caloric restriction on kidney and heart redox status and antioxidant enzyme activities in Wistar rats.", "abstract": "Caloric restriction (CR) has been associated with health benefits and these effects have been attributed, in part, to modulation of oxidative status by CR; however, data are still controversial. Here, we investigate the effects of seventeen weeks of chronic CR on parameters of oxidative damage/ modification of proteins and on antioxidant enzyme activities in cardiac and kidney tissues. Our results demonstrate that CR induced an increase in protein carbonylation in the heart without changing the content of sulfhydryl groups or the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase (CAT).

In vivo, angiogenesis involves endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting followed by connection of extended cellular processes and subsequent lumen propagation through vacuole fusion. We mimicked this process in engineering an organized capillary network anchored by an artery and a vein. The network was generated by inducing directed capillary sprouting from vascular explants on micropatterned substrates containing thymosin \u03b24-hydrogel. The capillary outgrowths connected between the parent explants by day 21, a process that was accelerated to 14 d by application of soluble VEGF and hepatocyte growth factor. Confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy indicated the presence of tubules with lumens formed by endothelial cells expressing CD31, VE-cadherin, and von Willebrand factor.

{"title": "A bio-inspired platform to modulate myogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells through focal adhesion regulation.", "abstract": "The use of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in cardiac-tissue engineering has gained widespread attention and many reports have shown that matrix compliance, micro/nano-patterns could be some of the important biophysical cues that drive hMSCs differentiation. Regardless of the type of biophysical induction cues, cells mainly explore their environment via focal adhesion (FA) and FA plays an important role in many cellular behaviours. Therefore, it is hypothesized that FA modulation through materials manipulation could be an important cue for modulation that would result in the stem cell lineage commitment. In this work, the FA of hMSCs is modulated by a novel microcontact printing method using polyvinyl alcohol as a trans-print media which can successfully print proteins on soft polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The FA is successfully modified into dense FA and elongated FA by micropatterning square and rectangular patterns on 12.6 kPa PDMS respectively. Additionally, the combined effects of stiffness of PDMS substrates (hard (308 kPa), intermediate (12.6 kPa)) and FA patterning on hMSCs differentiation are studied. The results indicate that dense FA does not induce myogenesis while elongated FA can promote cytoskeleton alignment and further myogenesis on PDMS with intermediate stiffness of 12.6 kPa. However, on stiff substrate (308 kPa), with or without patterns, the cytoskeleton alignment and myogenesis are not obvious. This demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to induce the differentiation of hMSCs by regulating the FA using a materials platform even in the absence of any biochemical factors. It also shows that there is a synergistic effect between FA regulation and matrix stiffness that results in a more specific and higher up-regulated myogenesis. This platform presents a new chemical/biological-free method to engineer the myogenic differentiation of hMSCs.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2012-11-28", "authors": ["HaiyangYu", "Chor YongTay", "MintuPal", "Wen ShingLeong", "HuaqiongLi", "HaiLi", "FengWen", "David TaiLeong", "Lay PohTan"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201200142"}
{"title": "Antibodies to cardiac receptors.", "abstract": "Inflammation of cardiac tissue is generally associated with an activation of the host's immune system. On the one hand, this activation is mandatory to protect the heart by fighting the invading microbial agents or toxins and by engaging myocardial reparation and healing processes. On the other hand, uncontrolled activation of the immune defense has the risk of an arousal of auto- or cross-reactive immune cells, which in some cases bring more harm than good. Dependent on the individual genetic predisposition, such heart-directed autoimmune reactions most likely occur as a result of myocyte apoptosis or necrosis and subsequent liberation of self-antigens previously hidden to the immune system. During the past two decades, evidence for a pathogenic relevance of autoimmunity in human heart disease has substantially increased. Conformational cardiac (auto)antibodies affecting cardiac function and, in particular, (auto)antibodies that target G protein-coupled cardiac membrane receptors are thought to play a key role in the development of heart failure. Clinical pilot studies even suggest that such antibodies negatively affect survival in heart failure patients. However, the true prevalence and clinical impact of many cardiac (auto)antibodies in human heart diseases are still unclear, as are the events triggering their formation, their titer course, and their patterns of clearance and/or persistence.

{"title": "Mechanisms of greater cardiomyocyte functions on conductive nanoengineered composites for cardiovascular application.", "abstract": "Recent advances in nanotechnology (materials with at least one dimension between 1 nm and 100 nm) have led to the use of nanomaterials in numerous medical device applications. Recently, nanomaterials have been used to create innovative biomaterials for cardiovascular applications. Specifically, carbon nanofibers (CNF) embedded in poly(lactic-co-glycolic-acid) (PLGA) have been shown to promote cardiomyocyte growth compared with conventional polymer substrates, but the mechanisms involved in such events remain unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the basic mechanism of cell growth on these novel nanocomposites.\nCNF were added to biodegradable PLGA (50:50 PGA:PLA weight ratio) to increase the conductivity, mechanical and cytocompatibility properties of pure PLGA. For this reason, different PLGA to CNF ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100 wt%) with different PLGA densities (0.1, 0.05, 0.025, and 0.0125 g/mL) were used, and their compatibility with cardiomyocytes was assessed.\nThroughout all the cytocompatibility experiments, cardiomyocytes were viable and expressed important biomarkers, including cardiac troponin T, connexin-43, and alpha-sarcomeric actin (\u03b1-SCA). Adhesion and proliferation experiments indicated that a PLGA density of 0.025 g/mL with a PLGA to CNF ratio of 75:25 and 50:50 (wt%) promoted the best overall cell growth, ie, a 55% increase in cardiomyocyte density after 120 hours compared with pure PLGA and a 75% increase compared with the control at the same time point for 50:50 (wt%). The PLGA:CNF materials were conductive, and their conductivity increased as greater amounts of CNF were added to pure PLGA, from 0 S \u00b7 m(-1) for pure PLGA (100:0 wt%) to 5.5 \u00d7 10(-3) S \u00b7 m(-1) for pure CNF (0:100 wt%), as compared with natural heart tissue (ranging from 0.16 S \u00b7 m(-1) longitudinally to 0.005 S \u00b7 m(-1) transversely). Tensile tests showed that the addition of CNF increased the tensile strength to mimic that of natural heart tissue, ie, 0.15 MPa for 100% PLGA to 5.41 MPa for the 50:50 (PLGA to CNF [wt%:wt%]) ratio at 0.025 g/mL. Atomic force microscopy indicated that the addition of CNF to PLGA increased the material surface area from 10% (100:0 [PLGA to carbon nanofiber (wt%:wt%)]) to over 60% (50:50 [PLGA to carbon nanofibers (wt%:wt%)]). Lastly, the adsorption of specific proteins (fibronectin and vitronectin) showed significantly more adsorption for the 50:50 PLGA to CNF (wt%:wt%) ratio at 0.025 g/mL PLGA compared with pure PLGA, which may be why cardiomyocyte function increased on CNF-enriched composites.\nThis study demonstrates that cardiomyocyte function was enhanced on 50:50 PLGA to CNF (wt%:wt%) composite ratios at 0.025 g/mL PLGA densities because they mimicked native heart tissue tensile strength/conductivity and increased the adsorption of proteins known to promote cardiomyocyte function.", "journal": "International journal of nanomedicine", "date": "2012-11-28", "authors": ["David AStout", "JennieYoo", "Adriana NoemiSantiago-Miranda", "Thomas JWebster"], "doi": "10.2147/IJN.S34574"}

Active interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) is a key product of the inflammasome, being cleaved by active caspase-1. The aim of this study was to dissect the role of IL-1\u03b2 from that of the inflammasome by using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against IL-1\u03b2 and measuring the intensity of the inflammatory response, the activity of caspase-1 in the inflammasome, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac remodelling in a mouse model of non-reperfused AMI. A mouse monoclonal IgG2a antibody directed against IL-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2-AB; 10 mg kg(-1)) was given i.p. immediately after surgery and repeated 1 week later. Cardiac tissue was analysed at 72 h after surgery in a subgroup of mice for inflammasome aggregates and caspase-1 activity (inflammasome) and for DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activity (apoptosis). All sham-operated mice were alive at 10 weeks, whereas 40% of the control-antibody-treated mice and 30% of the IL-1\u03b2-AB-treated mice died during the 4 weeks after surgery. When compared with vehicle, treatment with the IL-1\u03b2-AB did not affect inflammasome formation or caspase-1 activation in the heart tissue at 72 h after AMI nor circulating plasma IL-6 levels, but did inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis, limit left ventricular enlargement by 40% (P < 0.01) and improve systolic dysfunction by 17% (P < 0.01) after AMI.

{"title": "Cardiac-specific overexpression of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase induces cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in mice.", "abstract": "Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) is a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. In our previous study, we found that inhibition of FPPS attenuates cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and prevents angiotensin (Ang) II-induced hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes. Here, we further investigate the role of FPPS in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF) using a transgenic (Tg) model, and its mechanisms.\nTg mice with cardiac-specific expression of FPPS were studied as an experimental model. The results showed that Tg mice with overexpression of FPPS exhibited cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and HF, as well as increased synthesis of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate in heart tissue. These pathological changes were associated with the activation of RhoA and other known kinases in the hypertrophic signalling pathway, such as extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 and p38. Adenoviral infection of FPPS in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes induced a hypertrophic response characterized by an increased cell size and an increased extent of sarcomeric organization, as well as an increased activation profile of small GTPases and downstream protein kinases concordant with those seen in vivo. Further investigation showed a marked increase of FPPS protein levels in hypertrophic ventricles of patients with valvular heart disease.\nTaken together, these results suggest that FPPS may function as a potent regulator in myocardial remodelling.

Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia can cause cardiac tissue excitability and conduction. Global ventricular mechanical function is directly related to the contractile properties of cardiac myocytes, which are largely dependent on the flow of ions such as potassium and magnesium. Here, we show that increased levels of potassium, in addition to magnesium, in a patient with Gitelman's syndrome significantly impacts the timing of ventricular wall motion and the pattern of ventricular strain and torsion. Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography was used for evaluation of the hypokalemic-hypomagnesemic period (first day) and third day after potassium chloride and magnesium replacement therapy. The transthoracic echocardiography showed that the percent ejection fraction was similar in hypokalemic-hypomagnesemic (63%) and normokalemic-normomagnesemic (after potassium and magnesium therapy, 67%) hearts.

However, the lack of a cell line and the relative inaccessibility of C. elegans somatic cells in vivo have limited the biochemical approaches available in this model. Here we report that C. elegans primary embryonic cells in culture incorporate azido-sugar analogs of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and that the labeled glycoproteins can be analyzed by mass spectrometry. By using this metabolic labeling approach, we have identified a set of novel C. elegans glycoprotein candidates, which include several mitochondrially-annotated proteins. This observation was unexpected given that mitochondrial glycoproteins have only rarely been reported, and it suggests that glycosylation of mitochondrially-annotated proteins might occur more frequently than previously thought. Using independent experimental strategies, we validated a subset of our glycoprotein candidates. These include a mitochondrial, atypical glycoprotein (ATP synthase \u03b1-subunit), a predicted glycoprotein (aspartyl protease, ASP-4), and a protein family with established glycosylation in other species (actin). Additionally, we observed a glycosylated isoform of ATP synthase \u03b1-subunit in bovine heart tissue and a primate cell line (COS-7). Overall, our finding that C. elegans primary embryonic cells are amenable to metabolic labeling demonstrates that biochemical studies in C. elegans are feasible, which opens the door to labeling C. elegans cells with other radioactive or azido-substrates and should enable the identification of additional post-translationally modified targets and analysis of the genes required for their modification using C. elegans mutant libraries.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-11-16", "authors": ["Amanda RBurnham-Marusich", "Casey JSnodgrass", "Anna MJohnson", "Conrad MKiyoshi", "Sarah EBuzby", "Matt RGruner", "Patricia MBerninsone"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0049020"}

The development of an in vitro-based cardiac tissue could be of paramount importance for many aspects of the cardiology research. In this context, we developed an in vitro assay based on human cardiomyocytes (hCMs) and ad hoc micro-technologies, suitable for several applications: from pharmacological analysis to physio-phatological studies on transplantable hCMs. We focused on the development of an assay able to analyze not only hCMs viability, but also their functionality.\nhCMs were cultured onto a poly-acrylamide hydrogel with tunable tissue-like mechanical properties and organized through micropatterning in a 20\u00d720 array. Arrayed hCMs were characterized by immunofluorescence, GAP-FRAP analyses and live and dead assay. Their functionality was evaluated monitoring the excitation-contraction coupling.\nMicropatterned hCMs maintained the expression of the major cardiac markers (cTnT, cTnI, Cx43, Nkx2.5, \u03b1-actinin) and functional properties. The spontaneous contraction frequency was (0.83\u00b10.2) Hz, while exogenous electrical stimulation lead to an increase up to 2 Hz. As proof of concept that our device can be used for screening the effects of pathological conditions, hCMs were exposed to increasing levels of H(2)O(2). Remarkably, hCMs viability was not compromised with exposure to 0.1 mM H(2)O(2), but hCMs contractility was dramatically suppressed. As proof of concept, we also developed a microfluidic platform to selectively treat areas of the cell array, in the perspective of performing multi-parametric assay.\nSuch system could be a useful tool for testing the effects of multiple conditions on an in vitro cell model representative of human heart physiology, thus potentially helping the processes of therapy and drug development.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-11-16", "authors": ["ElenaSerena", "ElisaCimetta", "SusiZatti", "TaniaZaglia", "MonicaZagallo", "GordonKeller", "NicolaElvassore"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0048483\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.08.008\n10.1002/jcb.22164\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2006.11.025\n10.1016/j.addr.2010.03.001\n10.1016/j.drudis.2010.02.010\n10.1371/journal.pone.0009275\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211458\n10.1038/nmat2316\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.08.031\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.1073/pnas.0905729106\n10.1039/c1lc20098d\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.10.018\n10.1161/01.RES.0000257776.05673.ff\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237206\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026397\n10.1016/j.drudis.2008.10.001\n10.1038/415198a\n10.1038/nature06894\n10.1039/b921401a\n10.1007/s10544-008-9245-9\n10.1021/la204776e\n10.1038/nprot.2008.183\n10.1179/174313208X281109\n10.1063/1.4723853\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1006/jmcc.1997.0497\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.03.009\n10.1016/j.scr.2009.11.004\n10.1016/j.scr.2010.02.001\n10.1038/nature09228\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0223\n10.1152/ajpheart.00171.2003\n10.1634/stemcells.2005\u20130036\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.06.001\n10.1039/b810034a\n10.1113/jphysiol.2010.199059\n10.1016/j.ceca.2010.10.007"}

Although myocardial damage/loss remains an insurmountable problem for adult mammals, the same is not true for adult zebrafish, which are able to completely regenerate their heart after extensive injury. Myocardial regeneration in zebrafish involves the dedifferentiation and proliferation of cardiomyocytes to replace the damaged/missing tissue; at present, however, little is known about what factors regulate this process.\nWe surmised that ventricular amputation would lead to hypoxia induction in the myocardium of zebrafish and that this may play a role in regulating the regeneration of the missing cardiac tissue. Using a combination of O(2) perturbation, conditional transgenics, in vitro cell culture, and microarray analysis, we found that hypoxia induces cardiomyocytes to dedifferentiate and proliferate during heart regeneration in zebrafish and have identified a number of genes that could play a role in this process.\nThese results indicate that hypoxia plays a positive role during heart regeneration, which should be taken into account in future strategies aimed at inducing heart regeneration in humans.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2012-11-16", "authors": ["ChrisJopling", "GuillermoSu\u00f1\u00e9", "Ad\u00e8leFaucherre", "CarmeFabregat", "Juan CarlosIzpisua Belmonte"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.107888"}

Phosphorylation of the PKA sites (Ser(23)/Ser(24)) of cardiac troponin (cTn)I results in a decrease in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity and an increase in the rate of relaxation. However, the relation between the level of phosphorylation of the sites and the functional effects in the human myocardium is unknown. Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was used to study the effects of phosphorylation at Ser(23) and Ser(24) of cTnI on myofilament function in human cardiac tissue. Serines were replaced by aspartic acid (D) or alanine (A) to mimic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. cTnI-DD mimics both sites phosphorylated, cTnI-AD mimics Ser(23) unphosphorylated and Ser(24) phosphorylated, cTnI-DA mimics Ser(23) phosphorylated and Ser(24) unphosphorylated, and cTnI-AA mimics both sites unphosphorylated. Force development was measured at various Ca(2+) concentrations in permeabilized cardiomyocytes in which the endogenous troponin complex was exchanged with these recombinant human troponin complexes. In donor cardiomyocytes, myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity (pCa(50)) was significantly lower in cTnI-DD (pCa(50): 5.39 \u00b1 0.01) compared with cTnI-AA (pCa(50): 5.50 \u00b1 0.01), cTnI-AD (pCa(50): 5.48 \u00b1 0.01), and cTnI-DA (pCa(50): 5.51 \u00b1 0.01) at ~70% cTn exchange. No effects were observed on the rate of tension redevelopment. In cardiomyocytes from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathic tissue, a linear decline in pCa(50) with cTnI-DD content was observed, saturating at ~55% bisphosphorylation. Our data suggest that in the human myocardium, phosphorylation of both PKA sites on cTnI is required to reduce myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity, which is maximal at ~55% bisphosphorylated cTnI.

By varying degrees of derivatization, concentrations and composition of blends in a modular system, mechanophysical properties of the resulting hydrogels are easily adjustable. The hydrogel allowed for the generation of contractile bioartificial cardiac tissue from CM-enriched neonatal rat heart cells, which resembles native myocardium. A combination of HyA and highly purified human collagen I led to significantly increased active contraction force compared to collagen, only.

After induction, rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (35 mg kg(-1)) to record electrocardiogram, then sacrificed and biochemical assays of the heart tissues were performed.\nInduction of rats with isoproterenol resulted in a marked (P<0.001) elevation in ST-segment, infarct size, level of serum marker enzymes (CK-MB, LDH, AST and ALT), cTnI, TBARS, protein expression of Bax and Caspase-3 and a significant decrease in the activities of endogenous antioxidants (SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, and GST) and protein expression of Bcl-2. Pretreatment with paeonol and danshensu combination showed a significant (P<0.001) decrease in ST-segment elevation, infarct size, cTnI, TBARS, protein expression of Bax and Caspase-3 and a significant increase in the activities of endogenous antioxidants and protein expression of Bcl-2 and Nrf2 when compared with individual treated groups.\nThis study demonstrates the cardioprotective effect of paeonol and danshensu combination on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.

In addition, Dox enhanced aconitine-induced cardiotoxicity by a significant decrease in the aconitine dose producing ventricular tachycardia (VT). Administration of Pro significantly suppressed Dox-induced ECG changes and normalized the aconitine dose producing VT. The toxicity of Dox was also confirmed biochemically by significant elevation of serum CK-MB and LDH activities as well as myocardial MDA and GSH contents and decrease in serum catalase and myocardial SOD activities.

Analogous to phosphorylation, the modification is reversible and dynamic, changing in response to stress, nutrients, hormones, and exercise. Aims of this study were to examine differences in O-GlcNAc protein modification in the cardiac tissue of rats artificially selected for low (LCR) or high (HCR) running capacity. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in conscious animals assessed insulin sensitivity while 2-[(14)C] deoxyglucose tracked both whole body and tissue-specific glucose disposal. Immunoblots of cardiac muscle examined global O-GlcNAc modification, enzymes that control its regulation (OGT, OGA), and specific proteins involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. LCR rats were insulin resistant disposing of 65% less glucose than HCR. Global tissue O-GlcNAc, OGT, OGA, and citrate synthase were similar between groups.

The PCL core provides surgical handling, suturability and high initial tensile strength, while the gelatin-chitosan scaffold allows for cell attachment, with pore size and mechanical properties conducive to cardiomyocyte migration and function. The ultimate tensile stress of the PCL core, made from blends of 10, 46 and 80kDa (Mn) PCL, was controllable in the range of 2-4MPa, with lower average molecular weight PCL blends correlating with lower tensile stress. Blends with lower molecular weight PCL also had faster degradation (controllable from 0% to 7% weight loss in saline over 30 days) and larger pores. PCL scaffolds supporting a gelatin-chitosan emulsion gel showed no significant alteration in tensile stress, strain or tensile modulus. However, the compressive modulus of the composite tissue was similar to that of native tissue (\u223c15kPa for 50% gelatin and 50% chitosan). Electron microscopy revealed that the gelatin-chitosan gel had a three-dimensional porous structure, with a mean pore diameter of \u223c80\u03bcm, showed migration of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM), maintained NRVM viability for over 7 days, and resulted in spontaneously beating scaffolds.

The results showed that pretreatment with Rh2 significantly increased the viability of DOX-injured H9C2 cells.

Specifically, multiple variations were detected in mitochondrial genes coding for subunits of proteins essential for electron transport, in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, and within the D-loop region. To evaluate the effects of these mtDNA variations in the absence of the corresponding nuclear genomic factors as confounding variables, novel reciprocal strains of S and SHR were constructed and characterized. When compared with that of the S rat, the heart tissue from the S.SHR(mt) conplastic strain wherein the mtDNA of the S rat was substituted with that of the SHR had a significant increase in mtDNA copy number and decrease in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. A corresponding increase in aerobic treadmill running capacity and a significant increase in survival that was not related to changes in blood pressure were observed in the S.SHR(mt) rats compared with the S rat. The reciprocal SHR.S(mt) rats did not differ from the SHR in any phenotype tested, suggesting lower penetrance of the S mtDNA on the nuclear genomic background of the SHR.

In this study, we tested whether the NADH-mitochondria ROS pathway was involved in the reduction of I(Na) in a nonischemic cardiomyopathic model and correlated the findings with myopathic human hearts. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy was induced in C57BL/6 mice by hypertension after unilateral nephrectomy, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) pellet implantation, and salt water substitution. Sham operated mice were used as controls. After six weeks, heart tissue and ventricular myocytes isolated from mice were utilized for whole cell patch clamp recording, NADH/NAD(+) level measurements, and mitochondrial ROS monitoring with confocal microscopy. Human explanted hearts were studied using optical mapping. Compared to the sham mice, the arterial blood pressure was higher, the left ventricular volume was significantly enlarged (104.7\u00b13.9 vs. 87.9\u00b16.1 \u03bcL, P<0.05), and the ejection fraction was reduced (37.1\u00b11.8% vs. 49.4\u00b13.7%, P<0.05) in DOCA mice. Both the whole cell and cytosolic NADH level were increased (279\u00b170% and 123\u00b12% of sham, respectively, P<0.01), I(Na) was decreased (60\u00b110% of sham, P<0.01), and mitochondrial ROS overproduction was observed (2.9\u00b10.3-fold of sham, P<0.01) in heart tissue and myocytes of myopathic mice vs. sham.

Injection of NAD(+) (100mg/kg) or mitoTEMPO (0.7 mg/kg) twice (at 24h and 1h before myocyte isolation) to animals also restored I(Na). All treatments simultaneously reduced mitochondrial ROS levels to that of controls. CD38 was found to transduce the extracellular NAD(+) signal. Correlating with the mouse model, failing human hearts showed a reduction in conduction velocity that improved with NAD(+). Nonischemic cardiomyopathy was associated with elevated NADH level, PKC activation, mitochondrial ROS overproduction, and a concomitant decrease in I(Na).

Using all 5 different anti-CSE antibodies, we could not detect CSE proteins in mouse or rat cardiac tissues or in cultured rat cardiomyocytes. On the other hand, CSE protein was detectable in liver tissues from WT mice with the expected molecular mass of 43.6 kDa. H(2)S production rate of heart tissues in CSE KO mice was significantly decreased compared with that in WT mice. In the presence of an CSE inhibitor, D,L-propargylglycine, H(2)S production rate of heart tissues from WT mice was inhibited by approximately 80%.

Organ and visceral fat pad weights and histopathological studies were also carried out.\nOral feeding of HFD (20 g/day) for a period of 28 days resulted in a significant increase in body mass index, organ weights, visceral fat pad weight, cardiac caspase-3, cardiac DNA laddering (indicating apoptotic inter-nucleosomal DNA fragment), and lipid peroxide levels of cardiac tissues of rats. Further, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, serum leptin, insulin, LDH, LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein-B levels were enhanced significantly, whereas serum HDL-C, apoliporotein-A1 levels, and cardiac Na(+) K(+) ATPase, antioxidant enzymes levels were significantly decreased. Furthermore, treatment with standardized ethanolic GSE (200 m/kg/p.o.) for a period of 28 days resulted in significant reversal of above mentioned changes in the obese Wistar rats.\nThe present study has demonstrated the significant antiobesity potential of GSE in murine model of obesity.", "journal": "Indian journal of pharmacology", "date": "2012-11-01", "authors": ["VinayKumar", "UmaBhandari", "Chakra DharTripathi", "GeetikaKhanna"], "doi": "10.4103/0253-7613.100387"}

Heart and Stroke Facts. Dallas, TX: American Heart Association; 2002) Thus, electrophysiological remodelling associated with heart failure is a leading cause of disease mortality and has been a major investigational focus examined using many animal models of heart failure. While these studies have provided an important foundation for understanding the arrhythmogenic pathophysiology of heart failure, the need for corroborating studies conducted on human heart tissue has been increasingly recognized. Many human heart studies of conduction and repolarization remodelling have now been published and shed some light on important, potentially arrhythmogenic, changes in human heart failure. These studies are being conducted at multiple experimental scales from isolated cells to whole-tissue preparations and have provided insight into regulatory mechanisms such as decreased protein expression, alternative mRNA splicing of ion channel genes, and defective cellular trafficking.

Addition of genetically engineered excitable human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293 cells) ('Ex-293' cells stably expressing Kir2.1, Na(v)1.5, and Cx43 channels) increased both cardiac conduction velocity by 370% and twitch force amplitude by 64%. Furthermore, we stably expressed mutant Na(v)1.5 [A1924T (fast sodium channel mutant (substitution of alanine by threonine at amino acid 1924)] channels with hyperpolarized steady-state activation and showed that, despite a 71.6% reduction in peak I(Na), these cells propagated APs at the same velocity as the wild-type Na(v)1.5-expressing Ex-293 cells. Stable expression of Ca(v)3.3 (T-type voltage-gated calcium) channels in Ex-293 cells (to generate an 'ExCa-293' line) significantly increased their AP duration and reduced repolarization gradients in cocultures of these cells and NRVMs. Additional expression of an optogenetic construct [ChIEF (light-gated Channelrhodopsin mutant)]enabled light-based control of AP firing in ExCa-293 cells.\nWe show that, despite being non-contractile, genetically engineered excitable cells can significantly improve both electrical and mechanical function of engineered cardiac tissues in vitro.

Regions of source-load mismatch were added to the models by increasing the gap junction and interstitial resistivity in one-half of the tissue. Heterogeneity in cell shape and cell arrangement along the boundary between well-coupled and poorly coupled tissue increased variability in longitudinal conduction delays to as much as 10 ms before the onset of conduction block, resulting in wavefront breakthroughs with pronounced curvature at distinct points along the boundary. Increasing the effective interstitial resistivity reduced source-load mismatch at the transition boundary, which caused a decrease in longitudinal conduction delay and an increase in the number of wavefront breakthroughs.\nMicrostructural variations in cardiac tissue facilitate the formation of isolated sites of wavefront breakthrough that may enable abnormal electrical activity in small regions of diseased tissue to develop into more widespread reentrant activity.", "journal": "Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology", "date": "2012-11-01", "authors": ["Marjorie LetitiaHubbard", "Craig SHenriquez"], "doi": "10.1093/europace/eus267\n10.1172/JCI115173\n10.1161/01.CIR.88.3.915\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2005.06.019\n10.1159/000210398\n10.1161/01.CIR.92.3.587\n10.1083/jcb.60.3.586\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00273-0\n10.1023/A:1021154115673\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1771\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2004.06.010\n10.1161/01.RES.76.3.366\n10.1161/01.RES.83.8.781\n10.1161/01.RES.0000209770.72203.01\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2006.10.023\n10.1152/ajpheart.00689.2009\n10.1529/biophysj.108.137349\n10.1016/j.mbs.2005.04.003\n10.1093/europace/eum203\n10.1161/01.RES.74.6.1071\n10.1007/BF02127704\n10.1161/01.RES.75.6.1014\n10.1016/S0008-6363(96)00216-7\n10.1161/01.RES.81.5.727\n10.1152/physrev.00025.2003\n10.1126/science.275.5301.841\n10.1161/01.RES.73.5.914\n10.1016/j.bpj.2009.02.019"}

We observed that PER2(LUC), but not per1(luc) is rhythmic in atrial tissue, while both per1(luc) and PER2(LUC) exhibit rhythmicity in other cultured tissues. In contrast to the SCN and liver, both per1(luc) and PER2(LUC) bioluminescence amplitudes were increased in response to DEX treatment, and the PER2(LUC) amplitude response was dependent on the time of treatment. Large phase-shift responses to both medium and DEX treatments were observed in the atrium, and phase responses to medium treatment were not attributed to serum content but the treatment procedure itself. The phase-response curves of atrium to both DEX and medium treatments were found to be different to the liver. Moreover, the time of day of the culturing procedure itself influenced the phase of the circadian clock in each of the cultured tissues, but the magnitude of this response was uniquely large in atrial tissue.

Continuous in situ characterization of BCTs, for 21 days, revealed that three critical factors cooperatively improve BCT formation and function: both (i) addition of fibroblasts and (ii) ascorbic acid supplementation support extracellular matrix remodelling and CB fusion, and (iii) increasing static stretch supports sarcomere alignment and CM coupling. All factors together considerably enhanced the contractility of murine and human BCTs, leading to a so far unparalleled active tension of 4.4 mN/mm(2) in human BCTs using optimized conditions. Finally, advanced protocols were implemented for the generation of human PSC-derived cardiac tissue using a defined animal-free matrix composition.\nBCT with contractile forces comparable with native myocardium can be generated from enriched, PSC-derived CMs, based on a novel concept of tissue formation from non-dissociated cardiac cell aggregates. In combination with the successful generation of tissue using a defined animal-free matrix, this represents a major step towards clinical applicability of stem cell-based heart tissue for myocardial repair.", "journal": "European heart journal", "date": "2012-10-30", "authors": ["GeorgeKensah", "AngelicaRoa Lara", "JuliaDahlmann", "RobertZweigerdt", "KristinSchwanke", "JanHegermann", "DavidSkvorc", "AnkeGawol", "AzadehAzizian", "StefanWagner", "Lars SMaier", "AndreasKrause", "GeraldDr\u00e4ger", "MatthiasOchs", "AxelHaverich", "InaGruh", "UlrichMartin"], "doi": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehs349"}
{"title": "Generation of human secondary cardiospheres as a potent cell processing strategy for cell-based cardiac repair.", "abstract": "Cell therapy is a promising approach for repairing damaged heart. However, there are large rooms to be improved in therapeutic efficacy. We cultured a small quantity (5-10\u00a0mg) of heart biopsy tissues from 16 patients who received heart transplantation. We produced primary and secondary cardiospheres (CSs) using repeated three-dimensional culture strategy and characterized the cells. Approximately 5000 secondary CSs were acquired after 45 days. Genetic analysis confirmed that the progenitor cells in the secondary CSs originated from the innate heart, but not from extra-cardiac organs. The expressions of Oct4 and Nanog were significantly induced in secondary CSs compared with adherent cells derived from primary CSs. Those expressions in secondary CSs were higher in a cytokine-deprived medium than in a cytokine-supplemented one, suggesting that formation of the three-dimensional structure was important to enhance stemness whereas supplementation with various cytokines was not essential. Signal blocking experiments showed that the ERK and VEGF pathways are indispensable for sphere formation. To optimize cell processing, we compared four different methods of generating spheres. Method based on the hanging-drop or AggreWell\u2122 was superior to that based on the poly-d-lysine-coated dish or Petri dish with respect to homogeneity of the product, cellular potency and overall simplicity of the process. When transplanted into the ischemic myocardium of immunocompromised mice, human secondary CSs differentiated into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. These results demonstrate that generation of secondary CSs from a small quantity of adult human cardiac tissue is a feasible and effective cell processing strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cell therapy.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2012-10-30", "authors": ["Hyun-JaiCho", "Ho-JaeLee", "Yeon-JuChung", "Ju-YoungKim", "Hyun-JuCho", "Han-MoYang", "Yoo-WookKwon", "Hae-YoungLee", "Byung-HeeOh", "Young-BaePark", "Hyo-SooKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.10.011"}

Current in vitro models fall short in deciphering the mechanisms of hypertrophy induced by afterload enhancement. The aim of this study was to develop an experimental model that allows investigating the impact of afterload enhancement (AE) on work-performing heart muscles in vitro. Fibrin-based engineered heart tissue (EHT) was cast between two hollow elastic silicone posts in a 24-well cell culture format. After 2 weeks, the posts were reinforced with metal braces, which markedly increased afterload of the spontaneously beating EHTs. Serum-free, triiodothyronine-, and hydrocortisone-supplemented medium conditions were established to prevent undefined serum effects. Control EHTs were handled identically without reinforcement. Endothelin-1 (ET-1)- or phenylephrine (PE)-stimulated EHTs served as positive control for hypertrophy. Cardiomyocytes in EHTs enlarged by 28.4 % under AE and to a similar extent by ET-1- or PE-stimulation (40.6 or 23.6 %), as determined by dystrophin staining. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was accompanied by activation of the fetal gene program, increased glucose consumption, and increased mRNA levels and extracellular deposition of collagen-1. Importantly, afterload-enhanced EHTs exhibited reduced contractile force and impaired diastolic relaxation directly after release of the metal braces. These deleterious effects of afterload enhancement were preventable by endothelin-A, but not endothelin-B receptor blockade. Sustained afterload enhancement of EHTs alone is sufficient to induce pathological cardiac remodeling with reduced contractile function and increased glucose consumption. The model will be useful to investigate novel therapeutic approaches in a simple and fast manner.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2012-10-27", "authors": ["Marc NHirt", "Nils AS\u00f6rensen", "Lena MBartholdt", "JasperBoeddinghaus", "SebastianSchaaf", "AlexandraEder", "IngraVollert", "AndreaSt\u00f6hr", "ThomasSchulze", "AnikaWitten", "MonikaStoll", "ArneHansen", "ThomasEschenhagen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-012-0307-z\n10.1007/s12265-010-9182-x\n10.1172/JCI31044\n10.1016/j.ehj.2004.06.038\n10.1152/ajpheart.01267.2006\n10.1093/cvr/cvq308\n10.1007/s10741-008-9125-7\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.106.079426\n10.1161/01.RES.0000077012.11088.BC\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211458\n10.1038/nrm1983\n10.1056/NEJMra072139\n10.1007/s00395-011-0222-8\n10.1161/hh1901.096706\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.608828\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.249433\n10.1001/jama.1996.03530440037034\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243410\n10.1007/s00134-003-1993-7\n10.1007/s00395-011-0228-2\n10.1097/00004872-199917020-00011\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.06.020\n10.1056/NEJMra063052\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2010.04.053\n10.1073/pnas.88.18.8277\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.59.1.551\n10.1007/s003950050107\n10.1172/JCI24682\n10.1161/01.RES.51.6.787\n10.1007/s00395-012-0273-5\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.943431\n10.1007/s00395-010-0115-2\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237206\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.109.853200\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.01.009\n10.1074/jbc.271.11.6483\n10.1161/hh0202.103644\n10.1038/ncb1137"}

This property provides a candidate mechanism for generation of pathogenic ectopy in cardiac tissue. The purpose of this study was to determine the biophysical mechanism of DIA in terms of the ion conductance properties of the cardiomyocyte membrane. First, we determined, by use of the conventional whole-cell patch-clamp technique, the membrane conductance and DIA properties of ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from adult rat heart. Second, we reproduced and analysed DIA properties by using an adapted version of the experimentally based mathematical cardiomyocyte model of Pandit et al. (Biophys J 81:3029-3051 2001, Biophys J 84:832-841 2003) and Padmala and Demir (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 14:990-995 2003). DIA in 23 rat cardiomyocytes was a damped membrane potential oscillation with a variable number of action potentials and/or waves, depending on the strength of the depolarizing current and the particular cell. The adapted model was used to reconstruct the DIA properties of a particular cardiomyocyte from its whole-cell voltage-clamp currents. The main currents involved in DIA were an L-type calcium current (I CaL) and a slowly activating and inactivating Kv current (I ss), with linear (I B) and inward rectifier (I K1) currents acting as background currents and I Na and I t as modulators. Essential for DIA is a sufficiently large window current of a slowly inactivating I CaL combined with a critically sized repolarizing current I ss. Slow inactivation of I ss makes DIA transient. In conclusion, we established a membrane mechanism of DIA primarily based on I CaL, I ss and inward rectifier properties; this may be helpful in understanding cardiac ectopy and its treatment.", "journal": "European biophysics journal : EBJ", "date": "2012-10-24", "authors": ["Dirk LYpey", "Wilbert P Mvan Meerwijk", "SobanUmar", "Daniel APijnappels", "Martin JSchalij", "Arnoudvan der Laarse"], "doi": "10.1007/s00249-012-0866-9"}

We demonstrate that this combined approach resulted in increased viability, vascularization and functionality of the cardiac patch. After implantation in a mouse model of myocardial infarction, VEGF-expressing patches displayed significantly improved engraftment, survival and differentiation of cardiomyocytes, leading to greatly enhanced contractility as compared to controls not expressing VEGF. Controlled VEGF expression also mediated the formation of mature vascular networks, both within the engineered patches and in the underlying ischemic myocardium.

{"title": "Comparison of conventional chemotherapy, stealth liposomes and temperature-sensitive liposomes in a mathematical model.", "abstract": "Various liposomal drug carriers have been developed to overcome short plasma half-life and toxicity related side effects of chemotherapeutic agents. We developed a mathematical model to compare different liposome formulations of doxorubicin (DOX): conventional chemotherapy (Free-DOX), Stealth liposomes (Stealth-DOX), temperature sensitive liposomes (TSL) with intra-vascular triggered release (TSL-i), and TSL with extra-vascular triggered release (TSL-e). All formulations were administered as bolus at a dose of 9 mg/kg. For TSL, we assumed locally triggered release due to hyperthermia for 30 min. Drug concentrations were determined in systemic plasma, aggregate body tissue, cardiac tissue, tumor plasma, tumor interstitial space, and tumor cells. All compartments were assumed perfectly mixed, and represented by ordinary differential equations. Contribution of liposomal extravasation was negligible in the case of TSL-i, but was the major delivery mechanism for Stealth-DOX and for TSL-e. The dominant delivery mechanism for TSL-i was release within the tumor plasma compartment with subsequent tissue- and cell uptake of released DOX. Maximum intracellular tumor drug concentrations for Free-DOX, Stealth-DOX, TSL-i, and TSL-e were 3.4, 0.4, 100.6, and 15.9 \u00b5g/g, respectively. TSL-i and TSL-e allowed for high local tumor drug concentrations with reduced systemic exposure compared to Free-DOX. While Stealth-DOX resulted in high tumor tissue concentrations compared to Free-DOX, only a small fraction was bioavailable, resulting in little cellular uptake. Consistent with clinical data, Stealth-DOX resulted in similar tumor intracellular concentrations as Free-DOX, but with reduced systemic exposure. Optimal release time constants for maximum cellular uptake for Stealth-DOX, TSL-e, and TSL-i were 45 min, 11 min, and <3 s, respectively. Optimal release time constants were shorter for MDR cells, with \u223c4 min for Stealth-DOX and for TSL-e. Tissue concentrations correlated well quantitatively with a prior in-vivo study.

We have found that myosin heavy chain 6 (myh6), a myosin gene usually considered heart-specific in Xenopus and other animals, is expressed in limbs of E. coqui embryos. The gene for microRNA(miR)-208 is contained in an intron of the E. coqui myh6 gene as in mammals, and miR -208 was detected as a microRNA, more highly expressed in a microarray of E. coqui limb buds, compared to Xenopus laevis limb buds. Myh6 is also expressed in several muscles of tadpoles and froglets of Xenopus tropicalis.

Detection of radiation pneumonitis associated with early radiation-induced lung injury (2-4 weeks postirradiation) may provide an opportunity to adjust treatment, before the onset of acute pneumonitis and/or irreversible fibrosis. In this study, localized magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and imaging of hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate (pyruvate) and (13)C-lactate (lactate) were performed in the thorax and kidney regions of rats 2 weeks following whole-thorax irradiation (14 Gy).

{"title": "Expansion of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury after instillation of three forms of multi-walled carbon nanotubes.", "abstract": "The exceptional physical-chemical properties of carbon nanotubes have lead to their use in diverse commercial and biomedical applications. However, their utilization has raised concerns about human exposure that may predispose individuals to adverse health risks. The present study investigated the susceptibility to cardiac ischemic injury following a single exposure to various forms of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). It was hypothesized that oropharyngeal aspiration of MWCNTs exacerbates myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R injury).\nOropharyngeal aspiration was performed on male C57BL/6J mice with a single amount of MWCNT (0.01 - 100 \u03bcg) suspended in 100 \u03bcL of a surfactant saline (SS) solution. Three forms of MWCNTs were used in this study: unmodified, commercial grade (C-grade), and functionalized forms that were modified either by acid treatment (carboxylated, COOH) or nitrogenation (N-doped) and a SS vehicle. The pulmonary inflammation, serum cytokine profile and cardiac ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury were assessed at 1, 7 and 28 days post-aspiration.\nPulmonary response to MWCNT oropharyngeal aspiration assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) revealed modest increases in protein and inflammatory cell recruitment. Lung histology showed modest tissue inflammation as compared to the SS group. Serum levels of eotaxin were significantly elevated in the carboxylated MWCNT aspirated mice 1 day post exposure. Oropharyngeal aspiration of all three forms of MWCNTs resulted in a time and/or dose-dependent exacerbation of myocardial infarction. The severity of myocardial injury varied with the form of MWCNTs used. The N-doped MWCNT produced the greatest expansion of the infarct at any time point and required a log concentration lower to establish a no effect level. The expansion of the I/R injury remained significantly elevated at 28 days following aspiration of the COOH and N-doped forms, but not the C-grade as compared to SS.\nOur results suggest that oropharyngeal aspiration of MWCNT promotes increased susceptibility of cardiac tissue to ischemia/reperfusion injury without a significant pulmonary inflammatory response.

Fifty adult male Wistar rats are randomly classified into five groups: treadmill exercise, FG, combination of treadmill exercise + FG, L-NAME, and saline. Treadmill exercise was performed between 25 and 64 minutes at the speed of 15-22 m per minute for 8 weeks and five sessions a week. The FG will be fed through gavage with 90 mg/kg dosage. Hypertension was induced by l-NAME (10 mg/kg) for 8 weeks and six sessions a week. Administration of L-NAME for 8 weeks caused significant increase in HSP72, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and protein carbonyl (PC), and significant decrease in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and nitric oxide (NO) level, when compared with the saline group. In contrast, both treadmill exercise and/or FG protocols, in particular, the combined protocol, led to the improvement in HSP72 and balance in oxidant/antioxidant process and inhibited vascular dysfunction, when compared with the L-NAME group.

Our mathematical model introduces fibroblasts randomly, to mimic diffuse fibrosis, in the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov (TNNP) model for human ventricular tissue; the passive fibroblasts in our model do not exhibit an action potential in the absence of coupling with myocytes; and we allow for a coupling between nearby myocytes and fibroblasts. Our study of a single myocyte-fibroblast (MF) composite, with a single myocyte coupled to N(f) fibroblasts via a gap-junctional conductance G(gap), reveals five qualitatively different responses for this composite. Our investigations of two-dimensional domains with a random distribution of fibroblasts in a myocyte background reveal that, as the percentage P(f) of fibroblasts increases, the conduction velocity of a plane wave decreases until there is conduction failure. If we consider spiral-wave dynamics in such a medium we find, in two dimensions, a variety of nonequilibrium states, temporally periodic, quasiperiodic, chaotic, and quiescent, and an intricate sequence of transitions between them; we also study the analogous sequence of transitions for three-dimensional scroll waves in a three-dimensional version of our mathematical model that includes both fiber rotation and transmural heterogeneity.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a sizable sub-group of small non-coding RNAs, which degrade or inhibit the translation of their target mRNAs, thus regulating gene expression and play an important role in a wide range of biologic processes. Recent studies have reported that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in the cardiovascular system under some pathological conditions.

{"title": "Global changes in the rat heart proteome induced by prolonged morphine treatment and withdrawal.", "abstract": "Morphine belongs among the most commonly used opioids in medical practice due to its strong analgesic effects. However, sustained administration of morphine leads to the development of tolerance and dependence and may cause long-lasting alterations in nervous tissue. Although proteomic approaches enabled to reveal changes in multiple gene expression in the brain as a consequence of morphine treatment, there is lack of information about the effect of this drug on heart tissue. Here we studied the effect of 10-day morphine exposure and subsequent drug withdrawal (3 or 6 days) on the rat heart proteome. Using the iTRAQ technique, we identified 541 proteins in the cytosol, 595 proteins in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction and 538 proteins in the mitochondria-enriched fraction derived from the left ventricles. Altogether, the expression levels of 237 proteins were altered by morphine treatment or withdrawal. The majority of changes (58 proteins) occurred in the cytosol after a 3-day abstinence period. Significant alterations were found in the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP27, \u03b1-B crystallin, HSP70, HSP10 and HSP60), whose levels were markedly up-regulated after morphine treatment or withdrawal. Besides that morphine exposure up-regulated MAPK p38 (isoform CRA_b) which is a well-known up-stream mediator of phosphorylation and activation of HSP27 and \u03b1-B crystallin. Whereas there were no alterations in the levels of proteins involved in oxidative stress, several changes were determined in the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins.

Treatment for rats with ISO altered the activities of some of the key mitochondrial enzymes related to energy metabolism, the levels of some stress proteins, and the proteins related to apoptosis. These changes were found to be ameliorated when the animals were pretreated with melatonin at a dose of 10 mg/kg BW, i.p. In addition to its ability to reduce ISO-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, we also studied the role of melatonin in the recovery of the cardiac tissue after ISO-induced damage. Continuation of melatonin treatment in rats after the withdrawal of ISO treatment was found to reduce the activities of cardiac injury biomarkers including serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and cardio-specific LDH1 to control levels. The levels of tissue lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione were also brought back to that seen in control animals by continued melatonin treatment. Continuation of melatonin treatment in post-ISO treatment period was also found to improve cardiac tissue morphology and heart function.

One of the important targets of oxytocin is cardiovascular system. Present studies were aimed at testing the hypothesis that prolonged treatment with oxytocin (simulation of stress-induced rise in circulating oxytocin) activates intracellular signaling pathways playing a role in ischemia/reperfusion injury. Furthermore, we tested protective effects of oxytocin treatment in vivo against cardiac injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion of isolated hearts. Male Wistar rats were treated with oxytocin or vehicle continuously via osmotic minipumps for 2 weeks. The hearts were used for biochemical measurements or isolated for Langendorff perfusion. Treatment with oxytocin resulted in a significant increase in specific phosphorylation (activation) of p38-MAPK and Akt kinase, an increase in phosphorylated Hsp27 and an elevation in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels in left ventricular heart tissue. There were no significant changes in the activation of MMP-2 and ERK in the left heart ventricle of oxytocin-treated rats. Postischemic recovery of functional parameters LVDP, RPP, +dP/dtmax and -dP/dtmax was better in the hearts of oxytocin-treated rats compared to that in the controls. Oxytocin treatment significantly reduced infarct size to 15.1 + 3.2% as compared to 32.4 + 3.5% in vehicle-treated rats (p < 0.01). This is the first evidence for cardioprotective effects of oxytocin administered in vivo simulating chronic stress-induced elevation in plasma oxytocin.

Ex vivo proliferation, c-kit maintenance, and cellular attachment were significantly enhanced in the amine group. The amine coating also increased procollagen type I (pro-COL1) expression and increased phosphorylation signals, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and cytosolic Src, as well as enhanced ERK/CDK2 signaling.

There are no existing medical treatments that can cure chronic HF and the only currently available therapeutic option for end-stage HF is heart transplantation. However, transplantation is limited by the shortage of donor organs and patients require lifelong immunosuppression. In the past 10 years, stem cell-based cardiac therapy has been proposed as a promising approach for the treatment of IHD. There is a variety of potential stem cell types for cardiac repair and regeneration, including bone marrow cells (BMCs), resident cardiac stem cells (CSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Stem cell-based therapy may comprise cell transplantation or cardiac tissue engineering (CTE), which might be an attractive alternative to solve the problems of low retention and poor survival of transplanted cells.

However, insight into the histo-anatomical basis for cardiac tissue re-arrangement during contraction is limited. In this report, we describe dynamic changes in regionally prevailing cardiomyocyte (fibre) and myolaminar (sheet) orientations, using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) of ventricles in the same living heart in two different mechanical states. Hearts, isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats, were Langendorff-perfused and imaged, initially in their slack state during cardioplegic arrest, then during lithium-induced contracture. Regional fibre- and sheet-orientations were derived from DTI-data on a voxel-wise basis. Contraction was accompanied with a decrease in left-handed helical fibres (handedness relative to the baso-apical direction) in basal, equatorial, and apical sub-epicardium (by 14.0%, 17.3%, 15.8% respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and an increase in right-handed helical fibres of the sub-endocardium (by 11.0%, 12.1% and 16.1%, respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Two predominant sheet-populations were observed, with sheet-angles of either positive (\u03b2+) or negative (\u03b2-) polarity relative to a 'chamber-horizontal plane' (defined as normal to the left ventricular long-axis). In contracture, mean 'intersection'-angle (geometrically quantifiable intersection of sheet-angle projections) between \u03b2+ and \u03b2- sheet-populations increased from 86.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5\u00b0 (slack) to 108.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4\u00b0 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Subsequent high-resolution DTI of fixed myocardium, and histological sectioning, reconfirmed the existence of alternating sheet-plane populations. Our results suggest that myocardial tissue layers in alternating sheet-populations align into a more chamber-horizontal orientation during contraction.

Thus, the main aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of sub-chronic cigarette smoke exposure on the mRNA expression of cardiac hypertrophy genes, cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and the oxidative stress markers in heart rats. For this purpose, Wistar albino rats were exposed to increasing doses of passive cigarette smoke 2, 4, 8, and 24 cigarettes per day for 7 consecutive days. The mRNA expression of fifteen cardiac genes was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that the levels of hypertrophic genes; atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and \u03b2-myosin heavy chain were significantly induced, whereas the anti-hypertrophic gene \u03b1-myosin heavy chain was dramatically inhibited, in heart tissues of passive-smoke-exposed groups compared with normal-control groups. This was accompanied with a significant induction of CYP enzymes; CYP1A1, CYP2C11, CYP2E1, and CYP3A2, and the expression of oxidative stress genes, heme oxygenase 1, catalase, cyclooxygenase, and glutathione S-Transferase. The ability of cigarette smoke to induce cardiac hypertrophic genes, CYPs enzymes, and oxidative stress, collectively explore the molecular mechanism of cigarette smoke-induced cardiac diseases and brings further investigative attention to the public health issue of the injurious effects of chronic passive smoke exposure.

{"title": "Superoxide production during ischemia-reperfusion in the perfused rat heart: a comparison of two methods of measurement.", "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in many aspects of tissue/cellular metabolic signaling and pathology, including cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion damage. Recent reports of enhanced ROS production under global or simulated ischemia in intact heart or isolated cardiomyocytes, respectively, and its decrease again upon reperfusion are paradoxical. Mechanisms for increasing ROS production with decreasing reactant (oxygen) concentration remain elusive, making it important to critically evaluate the experimental methods used to measure ROS production. In the present paper superoxide production in isolated perfused rat hearts was monitored by lucigenin chemiluminescence or dihydroethidine (DHE) oxidation product fluorescence in parallel with redox state of flavin and cytochrome oxidase. Lucigenin luminescence decreased in ischemia and increased again upon reperfusion, transiently reaching values eightfold the control value coincidently with an overshoot of mitochondrial oxygen concentration. Hypoxic perfusion decreased lucigenin chemiluminescence in spite of coronary flow increase, whereas change in lucigenin concentration in the perfusate had negligible effect. In contrast to lucigenin luminescence, the fluorescence of the DHE oxidation product increased continuously during a 30-min global ischemia and decreased precipitously upon reperfusion, this change is coincident with absorption changes of the oxygen-binding protein myoglobin. The time course of DHE oxidation product fluorescence during ischemia and reperfusion was similar to that of the mitochondrial membrane potential probe safranin as shown in perfused heart previously [Ylitalo KV, Ala-R\u00e4mi A, Liimatta EV, Peuhkurinen KJ, Hassinen IE. J Mol Cell Cardiol 2000;32:1223-38]. In solution under high oxygen partial pressure DHE was mainly oxidized to a product, whose fluorescence, absorbance and mass spectra were similar to ethidium, and this product behaved like a mitochondrial membrane potential probe in isolated mitochondria. As a membrane permeable cation it accumulates into the mitochondria when the membrane potential is high (high intramitochondrial concentration quenches fluorescence) and then is released (increased fluorescence) during hypoxia/ischemia. Upon reperfusion it is re-accumulated in the mitochondria as the membrane potential recovers. The non-specific oxidation of DHE makes this dye less suitable for superoxide detection in experiments on isolated perfused hearts that necessitate high oxygen partial pressure in the perfusate. The time course of lucigenin luminescence during ischemia/reperfusion is consistent with decreased ROS production during ischemia/hypoxia, while the oxygen concentration is decreased, followed by an overshoot when the heart tissue is reperfused and the oxygen pressures return to normal or above normal.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2012-10-06", "authors": ["Juha PN\u00e4p\u00e4nkangas", "Erkki VLiimatta", "P\u00e4iviJoensuu", "UlrichBergmann", "KariYlitalo", "Ilmo EHassinen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.09.011"}

However, the role of DPP4 in chronic heart failure independent of coronary artery disease remains unclear.\nWe first localized the membrane-bound form of DPP4 to the capillary endothelia of rat and human heart tissue. Diabetes mellitus promoted the activation of the membrane-bound form of DPP4, leading to reduced myocardial stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1 concentrations and resultant angiogenic impairment in rats. The diabetic rats exhibited diastolic left ventricular dysfunction (DHF) with enhanced interstitial fibrosis caused partly by the increased ratio of matrix metalloproteinase-2 to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 in a DPP4-dependent fashion. Both genetic and pharmacological DPP4 suppression reversed the stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1-dependent microvasculopathy and DHF associated with diabetes mellitus. Pressure overload induced DHF, which was reversed by DPP4 inhibition via a glucagon-like peptide-1/cAMP-dependent mechanism distinct from that for diabetic heart. In patients with DHF, the circulating DPP4 activity in peripheral veins was associated with that in coronary sinus and with E/e', an echocardiographic parameter representing DHF. Comorbid diabetes mellitus increased the circulating DPP4 activities in both peripheral veins and coronary sinus.\nDPP4 inhibition reverses DHF via membrane-bound DPP4/stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1-dependent local actions on angiogenesis and circulating DPP4/glucagon-like peptide-1-mediated inotropic actions.

{"title": "Migration of cardiomyocytes is essential for heart regeneration in zebrafish.", "abstract": "Adult zebrafish possess a significant ability to regenerate injured heart tissue through proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes, which contrasts with the inability of mammals to do so after the immediate postnatal period. Zebrafish therefore provide a model system in which to study how an injured heart can be repaired. However, it remains unknown what important processes cardiomyocytes are involved in other than partial de-differentiation and proliferation. Here we show that migration of cardiomyocytes to the injury site is essential for heart regeneration. Ventricular amputation induced expression of cxcl12a and cxcr4b, genes encoding a chemokine ligand and its receptor. We found that cxcl12a was expressed in the epicardial tissue and that Cxcr4 was expressed in cardiomyocytes. We show that pharmacological blocking of Cxcr4 function as well as genetic loss of cxcr4b function causes failure to regenerate the heart after ventricular resection. Cardiomyocyte proliferation was not affected but a large portion of proliferating cardiomyocytes remained localized outside the injury site. A photoconvertible fluorescent reporter-based cardiomyocyte-tracing assay demonstrates that cardiomyocytes migrated into the injury site in control hearts but that migration was inhibited in the Cxcr4-blocked hearts. By contrast, the epicardial cells and vascular endothelial cells were not affected by blocking Cxcr4 function. Our data show that the migration of cardiomyocytes into the injury site is regulated independently of proliferation, and that coordination of both processes is necessary for heart regeneration.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2012-10-05", "authors": ["JunjiItou", "IsaoOishi", "HirokoKawakami", "Tiffany JGlass", "JennaRichter", "AustinJohnson", "Troy CLund", "YasuhikoKawakami"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.079756"}

There was a significant increase in myocardial catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) enzymes in amlodipine treated group (1.37, 10.27, 6.39) when compared to IR injured group (0.81, 6.87, 4.53). Histopathology studies showed amlodipine reduce cardiocyte damage in cardiac injury during the cardiac IR. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) study confirmed the cardioprotective role of amlodipine against IR induced cardiac injury. On the basis of findings, it is hypothesized that a portion of the beneficial actions of amlodipine may involve the release or action of NO and probably by its antioxidant properties.", "journal": "Journal of environmental biology", "date": "2012-10-04", "authors": ["Najam AliKhan", "PronobeshChattopadhyay", "MohammadAbid", "AbhijeetPawdey", "KamalKishore", "Arun KumarWahi"], "doi": null}

This study was aimed to investigate the specific role of MSC(CXCR4) in neovascularization of infarcted myocardium using a suicide gene approach.\nMSCs were transduced with either lentivirus-null vector/GFP (MSC(Null) as control) or vector encoding for overexpressing CXCR4/GFP. The MSC derived-endothelial cell (EC) differentiation was assessed by a tube formation assay, Dil-ac-LDL uptake, EC marker expression, and VE-cadherin promoter activity assay. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR or Western blot. The suicide gene approach was under the control of VE-cadherin promoter. In vivo studies: Cell patches containing MSC(Null) or MSC(CXCR4) were transduced with suicide gene and implanted into the myocardium of MI rat. Rats received either ganciclovir (GCV) or vehicle after cell implantation. After one month, the cardiac functional changes and neovascularization were assessed by echocardiography, histological analysis, and micro-CT imaging.\nThe expression of VEGF-A and HIF-1\u03b1 was significantly higher in MSC(CXCR4) as compared to MSC(Null) under hypoxia. Additionally, MSC(CXCR4) enhanced new vessel formation and EC differentiation, as well as STAT3 phosphorylation under hypoxia. STAT3 participated in the transcription of VE-cadherin in MSC(CXCR4) under hypoxia, which was inhibited by WP1066 (a STAT3 inhibitor). In addition, GCV specifically induced death of ECs with suicide gene activation. In vivo studies: MSC(CXCR4) implantation promoted cardiac functional restoration, reduced infarct size, improved cardiac remodeling, and enhanced neovascularization in ischemic heart tissue. New vessels derived from MSC(CXCR4) were observed at the injured heart margins and communicated with native coronary arteries. However, the derived vessel networks were reduced by GCV, reversing improvement of cardiac function.\nThe transplanted MSC(CXCR4) enhanced neovascularization after MI by boosting release of angiogenic factors and increasing the potential of endothelial differentiation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-10-03", "authors": ["JialiangLiang", "WeiHuang", "XiyongYu", "AtifAshraf", "Kishore KWary", "MeifengXu", "Ronald WMillard", "MuhammadAshraf", "YigangWang"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0046158"}

A hallmark of HF is a transition towards a foetal genotype which correlates with loss of cardiac functions. Thus, we wanted to investigate whether the foetal and neonatal cardiac ventricle displays serotonin responsiveness. Wistar rat hearts were collected day 3 and 1 before expected birth (days -3 and -1), as well as day 1, 3, 5 and 113 (age matched with Sham and HF) after birth. Hearts from post-infarction HF and sham-operated animals (Sham) were also collected. Heart tissue was examined for mRNA expression of 5-HT(4), 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2B) serotonin receptors, 5-HT transporter, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and myosin heavy chain (MHC)-\u03b1 and MHC-\u03b2 (real-time quantitative RT-PCR) as well as 5-HT-receptor-mediated increase in contractile function exvivo (electrical field stimulation of ventricular strips from foetal and neonatal rats and left ventricular papillary muscle from adult rats in organ bath). Both 5-HT(4) mRNA expression and functional responses were highest at day -3 and decreased gradually to day 5, with a further decrease to adult levels. In HF, receptor mRNA levels and functional responses reappeared, but to lower levels than in the foetal ventricle. The 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2B) receptor mRNA levels increased to a maximum immediately after birth, but of these, only the 5-HT(2A) receptor mediated a positive inotropic response.

The decomposition of such electrograms into non-fractionated components is expected to provide additional information to allow a more precise classification of the microstructural properties adjacent to a given recording site. For the sake of this, an analytic signal model is introduced in this study that is capable of reliably identifying extracellular waveforms associated with sites of initiating, free-running, and terminating or colliding activation wavefronts. Using this signal model as a template, a procedure is developed for the automatic decomposition of complex fractionated electrograms into non-fractionated components. The decomposition method has been validated using electrograms obtained from one- and two-dimensional computer simulations in which all relevant intracellular and extracellular quantities are accessible at a very high spatiotemporal resolution and can be manipulated in a controlled manner. Fractionated electrograms were generated in these models by incorporating microstructural obstacles that mimicked inlays of connective tissue. Using this signal model, fractionated electrograms emerging from microstructural heterogeneities in the submillimeter range with latencies between components down to 0.6 ms can be decomposed.", "journal": "Biomedizinische Technik.

{"title": "Sex and gender aspects in antiarrhythmic therapy.", "abstract": "Although cardiac arrhythmia had long been considered a predominantly male syndrome, it is now clear that arrhythmia is also a primary cause of mortality in women. Notably, the manifestation of specific arrhythmia syndromes appears to be gender specific. In particular, female sex is an independent risk factor for development of torsade de pointes (TdP) arrhythmias not only in congenital long QT syndromes but also in acquired long QT syndromes which occur as adverse effects of existing drugs. Males, on the other hand, are more likely to develop Brugada syndrome. Recent clinical and experimental studies suggest that these differences may stem from intrinsic sex differences in cardiac tissue. These include fundamental electrical differences resulting from variable ion channel expression and diverse sex hormonal regulation via long-term genomic and acute nongenomic pathways, and sex differences in drug responses and metabolisms. Undoubtedly, determining the effect of gender on cardiac function will be difficult and require sophisticated methodologies. However, gender differences underlying predilection to distinct arrhythmia syndromes must be revealed so that new therapeutic strategies that take gender into account can be applied to at-risk patients.", "journal": "Handbook of experimental pharmacology", "date": "2012-10-03", "authors": ["JunkoKurokawa", "MasamiKodama", "TetsushiFurukawa", "Colleen EClancy"], "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-30726-3_12"}

Histopathological examination, stereological design-based method (optical disector) and morphometry (vessels, cardiomyocytes and an amount of collagen) were used. Data were analysed using two-way ANOVA. Regardless of time of infection, myocardial tissue from the infected mice fed high-fat chow showed myocarditis characterized by a higher number of inflammatory foci, several areas displaying coagulation of cardiac fibres, a greater loss of cardiomyocytes and fibroblast proliferation than in the standard chow control. Comparing infected mice from acute and chronic infections, a higher cardiomyocyte hyperplasia (P < 0\u00b70001) and higher amounts of collagen (P < 0\u00b705) were observed than in standard chow control. In addition, all animals fed high-fat chow showed lower numerical density and total number of cardiomyocytes (P < 0\u00b705), thicker vessel walls and narrowed luminal intramyocardial vessels (P > 0\u00b705) than in the standard chow control.

Similar to many patients with VLCADD, VLCAD-deficient mice (VLCAD(-/-)) remain asymptomatic over a long period of time. In order to identify the involved compensatory mechanisms, wild-type and VLCAD(-/-) mice were fed one year either with a normal diet or with a diet in which medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) replaced long-chain triglycerides, as approved intervention in VLCADD. The expression of the mitochondrial long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) was quantified at mRNA and protein level in heart, liver and skeletal muscle. The oxidation capacity of the different tissues was measured by LC-MS/MS using acyl-CoA substrates with a chain length of 8 to 20 carbons. Moreover, in white skeletal muscle the role of glycolysis and concomitant muscle fibre adaptation was investigated. In one year old VLCAD(-/-) mice MCAD and LCAD play an important role in order to compensate deficiency of VLCAD especially in the heart and in the liver. However, the white gastrocnemius muscle develops alternative compensatory mechanism based on a different substrate selection and increased glucose oxidation. Finally, the application of an MCT diet over one year has no effects on LCAD or MCAD expression. MCT results in the VLCAD(-/-) mice only in a very modest improvement of medium-chain acyl-CoA oxidation capacity restricted to cardiac tissue. In conclusion, VLCAD(-/-) mice develop tissue-specific strategies to compensate deficiency of VLCAD either by induction of other mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenases or by enhancement of glucose oxidation. In the muscle, there is evidence of a muscle fibre type adaptation with a predominance of glycolytic muscle fibres.

{"title": "Poor maternal nutrition followed by accelerated postnatal growth leads to alterations in DNA damage and repair, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and oxidative defense capacity in rat heart.", "abstract": "Low birth weight and accelerated postnatal growth lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We reported previously that rats exposed to a low-protein diet in utero and postnatal catch-up growth (recuperated) develop metabolic dysfunction and have reduced life span. Here we explored the hypothesis that cardiac oxidative and nitrosative stress leading to DNA damage and accelerated cellular aging could contribute to these phenotypes. Recuperated animals had a low birth weight (P<0.001) but caught up in weight to controls during lactation. At weaning, recuperated cardiac tissue had increased (P<0.05) protein nitrotyrosination and DNA single-stranded breaks. This condition was preceded by increased expression of DNA damage repair molecules 8-oxoguanine-DNA-glycosylase-1, nei-endonuclease-VIII-like, X-ray-repair-complementing-defective-repair-1, and Nthl endonuclease III-like-1 on d 3. These differences were maintained on d 22 and became more pronounced in the case of 8-oxoguanine-DNA-glycosylase-1 and nei-endonuclease-VIII-like. This was accompanied by increases in xanthine oxidase (P<0.001) and NADPH oxidase (P<0.05), major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The detrimental effects of increased ROS in recuperated offspring may be exaggerated at 22 d by reductions (P<0.001) in the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxin-3 and CuZn-superoxide-dismutase.

{"title": "Peripartum cardiomyopathy. An update.", "abstract": "Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare disease of the heart muscle that affects women with previously unknown heart diseases during pregnancy or in the first months after delivery. Cardinal symptoms are dyspnoea and fluid retention. However, tachycardia, cardiogenic thromboembolism and other clinical signs of cardiac dysfunction may also herald this uncommon cause of heart failure. The estimated incidence of PPCM shows large regional variations: in Europe and the United States it is between 1:2000 and 1:4000. The markedly higher incidence rates observed in Haitian or South African women (up to 1:300) suggest that genetic or environmental factors may play a pathogenetic role. However, the underlying aetiology of PPCM still is unclear. Besides genetic susceptibility an abnormal autoimmune response against cardiac tissue components, viral infections or an irregular activity of cathepsin D generating a potentially cardio-toxic splice variant of prolactin have been discussed. New therapeutic strategies as immune modulation or prolactin inhibition were therefore suggested, but are not yet established. Treatment strategies focus on the standard therapies for heart failure and its complications. During pregnancy heart failure therapy is limited to substances without fetotoxic effects. But even with optimal heart failure therapy the course of the disease exhibits large variations ranging from full recovery to deterioration of heart function and even early cardiac death.

{"title": "Impact of new electrocardiographic criteria in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) has originally been described as a disorder characterized by fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium, primarily of the right ventricle (RV), and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, sudden death, and at a late stage progressive heart failure. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia or cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) was the previous name of the disease. However, similar histopathologic changes are also found in the left ventricle (LV). AC is also considered a hereditary disease. Recent molecular genetic studies provide accumulating evidence that fibrofatty replacement is preceded by mutation-related desmosomal changes. Desmosomal dysfunction may lead to mechanical and thereafter electrical uncoupling, ultimately resulting in conduction delay. This activation delay and conduction block, provide a substrate for re-entrant mechanisms and thereby ventricular tachycardia (VT). The gold standard for AC diagnosis is demonstration of transmural fibrofatty replacement in cardiac tissue obtained by autopsy or surgery. To facilitate diagnosis in clinical practice, an international Task Force defined in 1994 a set of criteria (TFC) based on electrocardiographic, functional and morphologic features, and family history. These criteria have recently been revised. Routine 12-lead electrocardiography is one of the most important tools for AC diagnosis in all stages of the disease. Even in the absence of other markers in the early concealed stage of the disease, in line with early slow conduction and electrical uncoupling ECG analysis may contribute to early diagnosis. Activation delay and site of origin of VT are reflected in various characteristics of the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram.

RNTs are novel biocompatible nanomaterials assembled from synthetic analogs of DNA bases guanine and cytosine that self-assemble within minutes when placed in aqueous solutions at body temperatures. These materials could potentially improve cardiomyocyte functions and solidification time of pHEMA and CNF composites. Because heart tissue is conductive, CNFs were added to pHEMA to increase the composite's conductivity. Our results showed that cardiomyocyte density increased after 4 h, 1 day, and 3 days with greater amounts of CNFs and greater amounts of RNTs in pHEMA (up to 10 mg mL(-1) CNFs and 0.05 mg mL(-1) RNTs). Factors that may have increased cardiomyocyte functions include greater wettability, conductivity, and an increase in surface nanoroughness with greater amounts of CNFs and RNTs. In effect, contact angles measured on the surface of the composites decreased while the conductivity and surface roughness increased as CNFs and RNTs content increased. Lastly, the ultimate tensile modulus decreased for composites with greater amounts of CNFs.

Presently, the termination of these types of arrhythmia is achieved by use of antitachycardia pacing or cardioversion. However, these techniques have serious drawbacks, in that they either have limited application or produce undesirable side effects. Low-energy far-field stimulation has recently been proposed as a superior therapy. This proposed therapeutic method would exploit the phenomenon in which the application of low-energy far-field shocks induces a large number of activation sites (\"virtual electrodes\") in tissue. It has been found that the formation of such sites can lead to the termination of undesired states in the heart and the restoration of normal beating. In this study we investigate a particular aspect of this method. Here we seek to determine how the activation site density depends on the applied electric field through in vitro experiments carried out on neonatal rat cardiac tissue cultures. The results indicate that the activation site density increases exponentially as a function of the intracellular conductivity and the level of cell isotropy. Additionally, we report numerical results obtained from bidomain simulations of the Beeler-Reuter model that are quantitatively consistent with our experimental results. Also, we derive an intuitive analytical framework that describes the activation site density and provides useful information for determining the ratio of longitudinal to transverse conductivity in a cardiac tissue culture. The results obtained here should be useful in the development of an actual therapeutic method based on low-energy far-field pacing.

Male Wistar rats were separated into 6 groups and treated during 60 days as follows: groups (1), (2) and (3) were fed a casein-based diet; groups (4), (5) and (6), a soy-based diet; (1) and (4) were given tap water; (2) and (5) tap water containing 15 ppm of Cd\u00b2\u207a; and (3) and (6) tap water containing 100 ppm of Cd\u00b2\u207a. Serum lipid peroxides increased and PON-1 activity decreased in group (3). Lipoperoxidation also increased in the heart of all intoxicated groups; however protein oxidation only augmented in (3) and reduced glutathione levels diminished in (2) and (3). Catalase activity increased in groups (3) and (6) while superoxide dismutase activity increased only in (6). Glutathione peroxidase activity decreased in groups (3) and (6). Nrf2 expression was higher in groups (3) and (6), and MTI expression augmented in (3). Histological examination of the heart tissue showed the development of hypertrophic and fusion of cardiomyocytes along with foci of myocardial fiber necrosis.

Despite significant progress in this field, current cardiac tissue models are not yet able to stably maintain functional characteristics of cardiomyocytes for long-term culture and therapeutic purposes. The objective of this study was to fabricate bioactive 3-D chitosan nanofiber scaffolds using an electrospinning technique and exploring its potential for long-term cardiac function in the 3-D co-culture model. Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide biomaterial that is biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic, and cost effective. Electrospun chitosan was utilized to provide structural scaffolding characterized by scale and architectural resemblance to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in vivo. The chitosan fibers were coated with fibronectin via adsorption in order to enhance cellular adhesion to the fibers and migration into the interfibrous milieu. Ventricular cardiomyocytes were harvested from neonatal rats and studied in various culture conditions (i.e., mono- and co-cultures) for their viability and function. Cellular morphology and functionality were examined using immunofluorescent staining for alpha-sarcomeric actin (SM-actin) and gap junction protein, Connexin-43 (Cx43). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy were used to investigate cellular morphology, spatial organization, and contractions. Calcium indicator was used to monitor calcium ion flux of beating cardiomyocytes. The results demonstrate that the chitosan nanofibers retained their cylindrical morphology in long-term cell cultures and exhibited good cellular attachment and spreading in the presence of adhesion molecule, fibronectin. Cardiomyocyte mono-cultures resulted in loss of cardiomyocyte polarity and islands of non-coherent contractions. However, the cardiomyocyte-fibroblast co-cultures resulted in polarized cardiomyocyte morphology and retained their morphology and function for long-term culture. The Cx43 expression in the fibroblast co-culture was higher than the cardiomyocytes mono-culture and endothelial cells co-culture. In addition, fibroblast co-cultures demonstrated synchronized contractions involving large tissue-like cellular networks. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to test chitosan nanofiber scaffolds as a 3-D cardiac co-culture model. Our results demonstrate that chitosan nanofibers can serve as a potential scaffold that can retain cardiac structure and function.

S100A1 is a member of the Ca(2+)-binding S100 protein family. It is expressed in brain and heart tissue, where it plays a crucial role as a modulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis, energy metabolism, neurotransmitter release, and contractile performance. Biological effects of S100A1 have been attributed to its direct interaction with a variety of target proteins. The (patho)physiological relevance of S100A1 makes it an important molecular target for future therapeutic intervention. S-Nitrosylation is a post-translational modification of proteins, which plays a role in cellular signal transduction under physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we confirmed that S100A1 protein is endogenously modified by Cys(85) S-nitrosylation in PC12 cells, which are a well established model system for studying S100A1 function. We used isothermal calorimetry to show that S-nitrosylation facilitates the formation of Ca(2+)-loaded S100A1 at physiological ionic strength conditions. To establish the unique influence of the S-nitroso group, our study describes high resolution three-dimensional structures of human apo-S100A1 protein with the Cys(85) thiol group in reduced and S-nitrosylated states. Solution structures of the proteins are based on NMR data obtained at physiological ionic strength. Comparative analysis shows that S-nitrosylation fine tunes the overall architecture of S100A1 protein. Although the typical S100 protein intersubunit four-helix bundle is conserved upon S-nitrosylation, the conformation of S100A1 protein is reorganized at the sites most important for target recognition (i.e. the C-terminal helix and the linker connecting two EF-hand domains). In summary, this study discloses cysteine S-nitrosylation as a new factor responsible for increasing functional diversity of S100A1 and helps explain the role of S100A1 as a Ca(2+) signal transmitter sensitive to NO/redox equilibrium within cells.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2012-09-20", "authors": ["MartinaLenar\u010di\u010d \u017divkovi\u0107", "MonikaZar\u0119ba-Kozio\u0142", "LiliyaZhukova", "Jaros\u0142awPozna\u0144ski", "IgorZhukov", "AleksandraWys\u0142ouch-Cieszy\u0144ska"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M112.418392"}

There are two ways to remove homocysteine from embryonic cardiac cells: remethylation to form methionine or transsulfuration to form cysteine. Cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the first step of homocysteine transsulfuration as a rate-limiting enzyme. In this study, we identified a functional variant -4673C>G (rs2850144) in the CBS gene promoter region that significantly reduces the susceptibility to congenital heart disease (CHD) in a Han Chinese population consisting of 2 340 CHD patients and 2 270 controls. Individuals carrying the heterozygous CG and homozygous GG genotypes had a 15% (odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75-0.96, P = 0.011) and 40% (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73, P = 1.78 \u00d7 10(-7)) reduced risk to develop CHD than the wild-type CC genotype carriers in the combined samples, respectively. Additional stratified analyses demonstrated that CBS -4673C>G is significantly related to septation defects and conotruncal defects. In vivo detection of CBS mRNA levels in human cardiac tissues and in vitro luciferase assays consistently showed that the minor G allele significantly increased CBS transcription. A functional analysis revealed that both the attenuated transcription suppressor SP1 binding affinity and the CBS promoter hypomethylation specifically linked with the minor G allele contributed to the remarkably upregulated CBS expression. Consequently, the carriers with genetically increased CBS expression would benefit from the protection due to the low homocysteine levels maintained by CBS in certain cells during the critical heart development stages. These results shed light on unexpected role of CBS and highlight the importance of homocysteine removal in cardiac development.Cell Research advance online publication 18 September 2012; doi:10.1038/cr.2012.135.", "journal": "Cell research", "date": "2012-09-19", "authors": ["Jian-YuanZhao", "Xue-YanYang", "Kai-HuShi", "Shu-NaSun", "JiaHou", "Zhi-ZhouYe", "JueWang", "Wen-YuanDuan", "BinQiao", "Yi-JiangChen", "Hong-BingShen", "Guo-YingHuang", "LiJin", "Hong-YanWang"], "doi": "10.1038/cr.2012.135"}

In the present study, we observed that heart-specific HB-EGF transgenic (TG) mice had systolic dysfunction with decreased fractional shortening (FS%), increased end-systolic diameter (LVIDs) at 5 months of age, increased heart fibrosis, and increased mRNA expression of Col1\u03b11 and Col3\u03b11 at 1, 3, 5 and 7 months of age compared to nontransgenic (NTG) littermates. However, the left ventricular anterior wall thickness at end-systole (LVAWs) of the TG mice was not different than the NTG mice. Phosphorylation levels of Akt, mTor and p70s6k were increased due to HB-EGF expression in TG mice compared with the NTG mice at 3 and 7 months of age. Additionally, activated Akt, mTor and p70s6k were co-localized with vimentin to cardiac fibroblasts isolated from TG mice. Furthermore, HB-EGF significantly increased phosphorylation levels of Akt, mTor and p70s6k and increased expression of type I collagen in cultured primary cardiac fibroblasts. Rapamycin (Rapa) and CRM197, inhibitors of mTor and HB-EGF respectively, could inhibit the expression of type I collagen in the cultured primary cardiac fibroblasts and Rapa suppressed interstitial fibrosis of the heart tissues in vivo. In addition, a BrdU assay showed that HB-EGF increased proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts by 30% compared with cells without HB-EGF treatment. HB-EGF-induced proliferation was completely diminished in the presence of Rapa.

Twenty-one spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) aged 52 weeks with heart failure were randomly divided into three groups: two receiving Rosuvastatin at 20 and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively, and the third, placebo for comparison with seven Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) as controls. After an 8-week treatment, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and echocardiographic features were evaluated; mRNA level of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and plasma NT-proBNP concentration were measured; the heart tissues were observed under electron microscope (EM); myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump (SERCA-2) activity and mitochondria cytochrome C oxidase (CCO) activity were measured; the expressions of SERCA-2a, phospholamban (PLB), ryanodine receptor2 (RyR2), sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1), Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1) were detected by Western blot and RT-qPCR; and the total and phosphorylation of protein kinase C\u03b1/\u03b2 (PKC\u03b1/\u03b2) were measured. Aged SHRs with heart failure was characterized by significantly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular fraction shortening, enhanced left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and LV Volume, accompanied by increased plasma NT-proBNP and elevated BNP gene expression. Damaged myofibrils, vacuolated mitochondria and swollen sarcoplasmic reticulum were observed by EM. Myocardium mitochondria CCO and SERCA-2 activity decreased. The expressions of PLB and NCX1 increased significantly with up-regulation of PPI-1 and down-regulation of CaMKII, whereas that of RyR2 decreased. Rosuvastatin was found to ameliorate the heart failure in aged SHRs and to improve changes in SERCA-2a, PLB, RyR2, NCX1, CaMKII and PPI-1; PKC\u03b1/\u03b22 signal pathway to be suppressed; the protective effect of Rosuvastatin to be dose dependent.

{"title": "Interventions in Wnt signaling as a novel therapeutic approach to improve myocardial infarct healing.", "abstract": "Following myocardial infarction, wound healing takes place in the infarct area where the non-viable cardiac tissue is replaced by a scar. Inadequate wound healing or insufficient maintenance of the extracellular matrix in the scar can lead to excessive dilatation of the ventricles, one of the hallmarks of congestive heart failure. Therefore, it is important to better understand the wound-healing process in the heart and to develop new therapeutic agents that target the infarct area in order to maintain an adequate cardiac function. One of these potential novel therapeutic targets is Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling plays an important role in embryonic myocardial development but in the adult heart the pathway is thought to be silent. However, there is increasing evidence that components of the Wnt pathway are re-expressed during cardiac repair, implying a regulatory role. Recently, several studies have been published where the effect of interventions in Wnt signaling on infarct healing has been studied. In this review, we will summarize the results of these studies and discuss the effects of these interventions on the different cell types that are involved in the wound healing process.", "journal": "Fibrogenesis & tissue repair", "date": "2012-09-13", "authors": ["Kevin CmHermans", "Evangelos PDaskalopoulos", "W MatthijsBlankesteijn"], "doi": "10.1186/1755-1536-5-16\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00212-6\n10.1161/01.RES.62.3.572\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00187-X\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.916346\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.10.033\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.04.030\n10.1038/nrcardio.2009.103\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000085658.98621.49\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.704197\n10.1038/nrcardio.2009.199\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.113126\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.06.016\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.06.025\n10.1016/j.devcel.2007.06.006\n10.1254/jphs.10R28FM\n10.1007/s00395-010-0100-9\n10.1242/dmm.006510\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2004.tb00281.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000093186.22847.4C\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210053\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2006.11.001\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600817\n10.1002/jcb.20400\n10.1242/jcs.00623\n10.1172/JCI28551\n10.1006/bbrc.1999.1860\n10.1002/jcp.21410\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2007.10.018\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.219840\n10.1126/scisignal.135re9\n10.1161/01.RES.0000046452.67724.B8\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.209809\n10.1038/nrm809\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00065-0\n10.1161/hy0202.103268\n10.1006/jmcc.1996.0080\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01450.x\n10.1038/nm1613\n10.1002/path.2281\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.06.013\n10.1073/pnas.0608799103\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0275\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.650903\n10.1038/nm0597-541\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019809\n10.1074/jbc.M603916200\n10.1093/cvr/cvq067\n10.1073/pnas.1004708107\n10.1016/S1010-7940(03)00506-2\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.232280\n10.1016/j.carpath.2007.12.012\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.160952\n10.4049/jimmunol.1000181\n10.1038/ncb1811\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0739\n10.1371/journal.pone.0015521\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.976969\n10.1056/NEJMcibr0810801\n10.1073/pnas.0808393105\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.047\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64601-9\n10.1172/JCI42556\n10.1016/j.tcm.2012.02.006\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.05.025\n10.1073/pnas.0706760104\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehr388\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.06.010\n10.1073/pnas.92.11.4857\n10.1073/pnas.0610024104\n10.1073/pnas.0803437105\n10.1038/nm979\n10.1074/jbc.M300373200\n10.1074/jbc.M110.135335\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.250282"}

However, the mechanisms and cellular sources are unknown. Sympathetic nerve stimulation (SS) and bradykinin (BK), an endogenous inducer of endothelial tPA release, may play roles, potentially involving different sources or mechanisms revealed by different release patterns. Therefore, we compared the cardiac tPA release patterns during repeated coronary BK infusions and SS, both with an ensuing period of local myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Nine pigs were subjected to four periods of coronary BK infusion (4 min) and another nine animals to four periods of SS (4 min). Finally, 10 min of I/R was induced in both groups. The single-peaked BK-induced tPA release declined toward baseline by repeated infusions, but tPA release reappeared during I/R. In contrast, total tPA release during repeated SS and subsequent I/R was more stable, and SS-induced total tPA and norepinephrine (NE) releases were strongly correlated. Surprisingly, the instantaneous SS-induced tPA release was biphasic with a stable first peak, and a second peak declining toward baseline by repeated stimulations. The fluctuations in cardiac release of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and the endogenous BK inhibitor angiotensin-converting enzyme, could not explain the diverging tPA release patterns. Different tPA release patterns were demonstrated during SS and BK stimulation, as well as diverging responses to repeated stimulations and subsequent I/R. This study demonstrates strong association between tPA and NE during SS and possibly two different sources or mechanisms for SS-induced tPA release.", "journal": "Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis", "date": "2012-09-12", "authors": ["TrudeAspelin", "MortenEriksen", "ArnfinnIlebekk", "Jan-ArneBj\u00f6rkman", "TorsteinLyberg"], "doi": "10.1097/MBC.0b013e328357d388"}

Neonatal rat cardiac cells were seeded in Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD)-attached alginate scaffolds, and the constructs were cultivated in a compression bioreactor. A daily, short-term (30 min) compression (i.e., \"intermittent compression\") for 4 days induced the formation of cardiac tissue with typical striation, while in the continuously compressed constructs (i.e., \"continuous compression\"), the cells remained spherical. By Western blot, on day 4 the expression of the gap junction protein connexin 43 was significantly greater in the \"intermittent compression\" constructs and the cardiomyocyte markers (\u03b1-actinin and N-cadherin) showed a trend of better preservation compared to the noncompressed constructs. This regime of compression had no effect on the proliferation of nonmyocyte cells, which maintained low expression level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

Addition of endothelial cells to the formative stages of EHT has been demonstrated to result in prevascularization, or the formation of capillary-like structures. The detailed study of the effects of prevascularization on EHT contractile function is lacking. Here, we evaluated the functional impact of prevascularization by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in self-organizing EHT. EHT fibers were generated by the self-organization of neonatal rat cardiac cells on a fibrin hydrogel scaffold with or without HUVECs. Contractile function was measured and force-length relationship and rate of force production were assessed. Immunofluorescent studies were used to evaluate arrangement and distribution of HUVECs within the EHT fibers. RT-PCR was used to assess the transcript levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1a (Hif-1\u03b1). EHT with HUVECs manifested tubule-like structures at the periphery during fiber formation. After fiber formation, HUVECs were heterogeneously located throughout the EHT fiber and human CD31+ tubule-like structures were identified. The expression level of Hif-1\u03b1 did not change with the addition of HUVECs. However, maximal force and rate of force generation were not improved in HUVECs containing EHT as compared to control EHT fibers.

{"title": "Sepsis-induced cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction involves altered mitochondrial-localization of tyrosine kinase Src and tyrosine phosphatase SHP2.", "abstract": "Our previous research demonstrated that sepsis produces mitochondrial dysfunction with increased mitochondrial oxidative stress in the heart. The present study investigated the role of mitochondria-localized signaling molecules, tyrosine kinase Src and tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, in sepsis-induced cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction using a rat pneumonia-related sepsis model. SD rats were given an intratracheal injection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4\u00d710(6) CFU per rat, (or vehicle for shams); heart tissues were then harvested and subcellular fractions were prepared. By Western blot, we detected a gradual and significant decrease in Src and an increase in SHP2 in cardiac mitochondria within 24 hours post-inoculation. Furthermore, at 24 hours post-inoculation, sepsis caused a near 70% reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of all cardiac mitochondrial proteins. Decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of certain mitochondrial structural proteins (porin, cyclophilin D and cytochrome C) and functional proteins (complex II subunit 30kD and complex I subunit NDUFB8) were evident in the hearts of septic rats. In vitro, pre-treatment of mitochondrial fractions with recombinant active Src kinase elevated OXPHOS complex I and II-III activity, whereas the effect of SHP2 phosphatase was opposite. Neither Src nor SHP2 affected complex IV and V activity under the same conditions. By immunoprecipitation, we showed that Src and SHP2 consistently interacted with complex I and III in the heart, suggesting that complex I and III contain putative substrates of Src and SHP2. In addition, in vitro treatment of mitochondrial fractions with active Src suppressed sepsis-associated mtROS production and protected aconitase activity, an indirect marker of mitochondrial oxidative stress. On the contrary, active SHP2 phosphatase overproduced mtROS and deactivated aconitase under the same in vitro conditions. In conclusion, our data suggest that changes in mitochondria-localized signaling molecules Src and SHP2 constitute a potential signaling pathway to affect mitochondrial dysfunction in the heart during sepsis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-09-07", "authors": ["Qun SZang", "BobbieMartinez", "XiaoYao", "David LMaass", "LishaMa", "Steven EWolf", "Joseph PMinei"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0043424"}

Hearts were excised and perfusion-washed to remove extracellular calcium after 0.5 h of hypothermia (n = 9), 4 h of hypothermia (n = 8), and after 4 h of hypothermia and 2 h rewarming (n = 9). A normothermic group, kept at 37 \u00b0C for 5 h, served as control (n = 6). [Ca(2+) ](i) was determined in perchloric acid extracts of heart tissue. Spontaneous cardiac electromechanic work was maintained during hypothermia without cardiac arrest or ischaemia.\nBetween 0.5 and 4 h at 15 \u00b0C, a six-fold increase in cardiac [Ca(2+) ](i) was observed (0.55 \u00b1 0.10 vs. 2.93 \u00b1 0.76 \u03bcmol (g dry wt)(-1) ). Rewarming resulted in a 33% decline in [Ca(2+) ](i) , but the actual value was significantly above the value measured in control hearts.\nWe show that calcium overload is a characteristic feature of the beating heart during deep hypothermia, which aggravates by increasing duration of exposure.

Current therapies can only retard the progression of disease and hence tissue engineering strategies are required to facilitate the engineering of a suitable biomaterial to repair MI. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro properties of an injectable biomaterial for the regeneration of infarcted myocardium. Fabrication of core/shell fibers was by co-axial electrospinning, with poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) as core material and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) as shell material. The PLLA was removed by treatment of the PGS/PLLA core/shell fibers with DCM:hexane (2:1) to obtain PGS short fibers. These PGS short fibers offer the advantage of providing a minimally invasive injectable technique for the regeneration of infarcted myocardium. The scaffolds were characterized by SEM, FTIR and contact angle and cell-scaffold interactions using cardiomyocytes. The results showed that the cardiac marker proteins actinin, troponin, myosin heavy chain and connexin 43 were expressed more on short PGS fibers compared to PLLA nanofibers. We hypothesized that the injection of cells along with short PGS fibers would increase cell transplant retention and survival within the infarct, compared to the standard cell injection system.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2012-09-06", "authors": ["RajeswariRavichandran", "Jayarama ReddyVenugopal", "SubramanianSundarrajan", "ShayantiMukherjee", "RadhakrishnanSridhar", "SeeramRamakrishna"], "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/23/38/385102"}

Balb/c mice were immunized intraperitoneal (i.p.) with sheep erythrocytes for the primary immunization. Water dispersion of fullerene C60 was injected i.p. once at the dose 50 ng to mice on first, third and sixth days after immunization. During immune response, the increment ofmalonic dialdehide (MDA) was enhanced in liver, kidneys and heart tissues. Fullerene C60 induced POL during the latent phase of immune response, but inhibited this process during progression of immune response. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase in liver and spleen tissues were induced after injection of fullerene C60 to intact mice. After immunization, high level of activity of antioxidant enzymes and low level of organs mass factor were determined. Injection of fullerene C60 reduced the activities of SOD and catalase in spleen tissues.

{"title": "Diabetes triggers a PARP1 mediated death pathway in the heart through participation of FoxO1.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte cell death is a major contributing factor for diabetic cardiomyopathy, and multiple mechanisms have been proposed for its development. We hypothesized that following diabetes, an increased nuclear presence of the Forkhead transcription factor, FoxO1, could turn on cardiac cell death through mediation of nitrosative stress. Streptozotocin (100 mg/kg) was used to induce irreversible hyperglycemia in Wistar rats, and heart tissues and blood samples extracted starting from 1 to 4 days. Diazoxide (100 mg/kg), which produced acute reversible hyperglycemia, were followed for up to 12 h. In both animal models of hyperglycemia, attenuation of survival signals was accompanied by increased nuclear FoxO1. This was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in iNOS expression and iNOS induced protein nitrosylation of GAPDH, increased GAPDH binding to Siah1 and facilitated nuclear translocation of the complex. Even though caspase-3 was cleaved during diabetes, its nitrosylation modification affected its ability to inactivate PARP. As a result, there was PARP activation followed by nuclear compartmentalization of AIF, and increased phosphatidyl serine externalization. Our data suggests a role for FoxO1 mediated iNOS induced S-nitrosylation of target proteins like GAPDH and caspase-3 in initiating cardiac cell death following hyperglycemia, and could explain the impact of glycemic control in preventing cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2012-09-04", "authors": ["PrasanthPuthanveetil", "DahaiZhang", "YingWang", "FangWang", "AndreaWan", "AshrafAbrahani", "BrianRodrigues"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.08.013"}

An additional approach to structural isoform selectivity is to identify compounds with use- or state-dependent profiles, i.e. inhibition efficacy based on the gating of the ion channel. In general nerve cells in damaged or inflamed tissue are more depolarized and electrically active compared to healthy nerve cells in for instance the heart. This observation has led to the design of two types of screening protocols emulating the voltage condition of peripheral neurons or cardiac tissue. The two voltage protocols have been developed to identify both use- and state-dependent antagonists. In this paper we describe an attempt to merge the two different protocols into one to increase screening efficacy, while retaining relevant state- and use-dependent pharmacology. The new protocol is constructed of two stimulation pulses and a slow voltage ramp for simultaneous assessment of resting and state-dependent block.

Treatment of chronic heart disease often involves pharmacological blockade of adrenergic receptors. This study examined the specific changes in neuronal sensitivity of guinea pig intrinsic cardiac neurons to autonomic modulators in animals with chronic cardiac disease, in the presence or absence of adrenergic blockage. Myocardial infarction (MI) was produced by ligature of the coronary artery and associated vein on the dorsal surface of the heart. Pressure overload (PO) was induced by a banding of the descending dorsal aorta (\u223c20% constriction).

At termination, intracellular recordings from individual neurons in whole mounts of the cardiac plexus were used to assess changes in physiological responses. Timolol treatment did not inhibit the increased sensitivity to norepinephrine seen in both MI and PO animals, but it did inhibit the stimulatory effects of angiotensin II on the norepinephrine-induced increases in neuronal excitability. Timolol treatment also inhibited the increase in synaptically evoked action potentials observed in PO animals with stimulation of fiber tract bundles. These results demonstrate that \u03b2-adrenergic blockade can inhibit specific aspects of remodeling within the intrinsic cardiac plexus.

In addition, SUL and PEITC suppressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in the left ventricle of heart tissue infected with the LP-BM5 retrovirus by inactivating cytoplasmic nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB). In conclusion, LP-BM5 retrovirus infection was related to survival of murine AIDS mice, and NF-\u03baB-mediated iNOS expression may be an important mediator of left ventricle dysfunction of the heart. Furthermore, certain ITCs may have the potential to improve AIDS-related heart dysfunction due to their inhibition of apoptosis by decreasing iNOS and Bax expression through suppression of NF-\u03baB.", "journal": "Journal of medicinal food", "date": "2012-08-29", "authors": ["Jin-NyoungHo", "Ho-GeunYoon", "Chang-SooPark", "SunohKim", "WoojinJun", "RyowonChoue", "JeongminLee"], "doi": "10.1089/jmf.2011.1906"}

Male ICR mice underwent coronary artery ligation or sham surgery (n = 10-12 per group). The selective A(2B) AdoR antagonist GS-6201 (4 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally twice daily starting immediately after surgery and continuing for 14 days. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed before surgery and after 7, 14, and 28 days. A subgroup of mice was killed 72 h after surgery, and the activity of caspase-1, a key proinflammatory mediator, was measured in the cardiac tissue. All sham-operated mice were alive at 4 weeks, whereas 50% of vehicle-treated mice and 75% of GS-6201-treated mice were alive at 4 weeks after surgery. Compared with vehicle, treatment with GS-6201 prevented caspase-1 activation in the heart at 72 h after AMI (P < 0.001) and significantly limited the increase in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic diameter by 40% (P < 0.001), the decrease in LV ejection fraction by 18% (P < 0.01) and the changes in the myocardial performance index by 88% (P < 0.001) at 28 days after AMI.

Here, we address this challenge using macroporous, flexible and free-standing nanowire nanoelectronic scaffolds (nanoES), and their hybrids with synthetic or natural biomaterials. 3D macroporous nanoES mimic the structure of natural tissue scaffolds, and they were formed by self-organization of coplanar reticular networks with built-in strain and by manipulation of 2D mesh matrices. NanoES exhibited robust electronic properties and have been used alone or combined with other biomaterials as biocompatible extracellular scaffolds for 3D culture of neurons, cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, we show the integrated sensory capability of the nanoES by real-time monitoring of the local electrical activity within 3D nanoES/cardiomyocyte constructs, the response of 3D-nanoES-based neural and cardiac tissue models to drugs, and distinct pH changes inside and outside tubular vascular smooth muscle constructs.", "journal": "Nature materials", "date": "2012-08-28", "authors": ["BozhiTian", "JiaLiu", "TalDvir", "LihuaJin", "Jonathan HTsui", "QuanQing", "ZhigangSuo", "RobertLanger", "Daniel SKohane", "Charles MLieber"], "doi": "10.1038/nmat3404"}

RVVA-PLA\u2082-I was non-lethal to mice at the tested dose, however, it affected the different organs of mice particularly the liver and cardiac tissues as deduced from the enzymatic activities measured in mice serum after injection of this PLA\u2082 enzyme. RVVA-PLA\u2082-I preferentially hydrolyzed phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine) of erythrocyte membrane compared to the liver mitochondrial membrane. Interestingly, RVVA-PLA\u2082-I failed to hydrolyze membrane phospholipids of HT-29 (colon adenocarcinoma) cells, which contain an abundance of phosphatidylcholine in its outer membrane, within 24h of incubation. The gas-chromatographic (GC) analysis of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids' release patterns from intact mitochondrial and erythrocyte membranes after the addition of RVVA-PLA\u2082-I showed a distinctly different result. The results are certainly a reflection of differences in the outer membrane phospholipid composition of tested membranes owing to which they are hydrolyzed by the venom PLA\u2082s to a different extent. The chemical modification of essential amino acids present in the active site, neutralization study with polyvalent antivenom and heat-inactivation of RVVA-PLA\u2082-I suggested the correlation between catalytic and membrane damaging activities of this PLA\u2082 enzyme.

We aimed to investigate the influence of verapamil (a P-gp inhibitor)--bufadienolides interaction on cardiotoxicity and bufadienolide uptake by the isolated heart. The study was performed in Langendorff isolated perfused guinea-pig hearts by bufadienolides infusion in the absence and presence of verapamil (250, 500ng/ml). Arrhythmia parameters were evaluated by ECG and the content of bufadienolides in heart were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). In the present of verapamil, the wide QRS duration and lightly rapid heart rate (HR) were markedly reduced in the early stage of bufadienolide intoxication. However, the ECG changes characterized by prolonged P-R interval, and slow heart rate and low QRS amplitude in the late stage of bufadienolide intoxication were significantly enhanced. Furthermore, the contents of a variety of bufadienolide compounds in the verapamil+bufadienolide group were significantly higher when cardiac arrest occurred. Although verapamil reduced the bufadienolide-induced ventricular arrhythmias, verapamil worsened heart block and lethal bradycardia of bufadienolides partly via increasing the uptake of bufadienolides in heart tissue, which could compromise the protective effects of verapamil against bufadienolide intoxication.

We applied three-dimensional confocal imaging and image analysis to quantitatively describe the features of native and engineered cardiac tissue. Quantitative analysis methods were developed and applied to test the hypothesis that environmental cues direct engineered tissue toward a phenotype resembling that of age-matched native myocardium. The analytical approach was applied to engineered cardiac tissue with and without the application of electrical stimulation as well as to age-matched and adult native tissue. Individual myocytes were segmented from confocal image stacks and assigned a coordinate system from which measures of cell geometry and connexin-43 spatial distribution were calculated. The data were collected from 9 nonstimulated and 12 electrically stimulated engineered tissue constructs and 5 postnatal day 12 and 7 adult hearts. The myocyte volume fraction was nearly double in stimulated engineered tissue compared to nonstimulated engineered tissue (0.34 \u00b1 0.14 vs 0.18 \u00b1 0.06) but less than half of the native postnatal day 12 (0.90 \u00b1 0.06) and adult (0.91 \u00b1 0.04) myocardium. The myocytes under electrical stimulation were more elongated compared to nonstimulated myocytes and exhibited similar lengths, widths, and heights as in age-matched myocardium. Furthermore, the percentage of connexin-43-positive membrane staining was similar in the electrically stimulated, postnatal day 12, and adult myocytes, whereas it was significantly lower in the nonstimulated myocytes. Connexin-43 was found to be primarily located at cell ends for adult myocytes and irregularly but densely clustered over the membranes of nonstimulated, stimulated, and postnatal day 12 myocytes. These findings support our hypothesis and reveal that the application of environmental cues produces tissue with structural features more representative of age-matched native myocardium than adult myocardium.

Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were established from lymphocytes of individuals with trisomy 21, the chromosomal abnormality causing Down syndrome. Gene expression profiles generated from DNA microarrays of LCLs from individuals without heart defects (CHD(-); n = 22) were compared with those of LCLs from patients with cardiac malformations (CHD(+); n = 21). After quantile normalization, principal component analysis revealed that AVSD carriers could be distinguished from a combined group of ASD or VSD (ASD+VSD) carriers. From 9,758 expressed genes, we identified 889 and 1,016 genes differentially expressed between CHD(-) and AVSD and CHD(-) and ASD+VSD, respectively, with only 119 genes in common. A specific chromosomal enrichment was found in each group of affected genes. Among the differentially expressed genes, more than 65% are expressed in human or mouse fetal heart tissues (GEO dataset). Additional LCLs from new groups of AVSD and ASD+VSD patients were analyzed by quantitative PCR; observed expression ratios were similar to microarray results. Analysis of GO categories revealed enrichment of genes from pathways regulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis in patients with AVSD and of genes involved in semaphorin-plexin-driven cardiogenesis and the formation of cytoplasmic microtubules in patients with ASD-VSD. A pathway-oriented search revealed enrichment in the ciliome for both groups and a specific enrichment in Hedgehog and Jak-stat pathways among ASD+VSD patients.

The matrix sandwich promoted an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as in gastrulation with the generation of N-cadherin-positive mesenchymal cells. Combining the matrix sandwich with sequential application of growth factors (Activin A, bone morphogenetic protein 4, and basic fibroblast growth factor) generated CMs with high purity (up to 98%) and yield (up to 11 CMs/input PSC) from multiple PSC lines.

Previous studies suggest that cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in thalassemia. We tested the hypothesis that iron overload causes dysfunction of cardiac mitochondria isolated from thalassemic mice. Cardiac mitochondria were isolated from the heart tissue of genetically-altered, \u03b2-thalassemic mice (HT) and adult wild-type mice (WT). Ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) at various concentrations (0-5 \u03bcg/ml) was applied to induce iron toxicity. Pharmacological interventions, facilitated by mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) blocker, CsA, and mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) blocker, Ru360, were used to study their respective effects on cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction. Cardiac mitochondrial ROS production, mitochondrial membrane potential changes, and mitochondrial swelling were determined. Iron overload caused increased ROS production, mitochondrial depolarization, and mitochondrial swelling in a dose-dependent manner in WT and HT cardiac mitochondria. CsA decreased only ROS production in WT and HT cardiac mitochondria, whereas Ru360 completely prevented the development of cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction by decreasing ROS, mitochondrial depolarization, and swelling in both WT and HT cardiac mitochondria. Ru360, an MCU blocker, provides protective effects by preventing ROS production and mitochondrial depolarization as well as attenuating mitochondrial swelling caused by Fe(2+) overload. These findings indicate that the MCU could be a major portal for Fe(2+) entry into cardiac mitochondria.

Because the mechanism by which cryAB prevents apoptosis has not been fully characterized, we examined its protective effects at the cellular level by silencing cryAB in mouse neonatal CMs using lentivector-mediated transduction of short hairpin RNAs. Subcellular fractionation of whole hearts showed that cryAB is cytosolic under control conditions, and after H(2)O(2) exposure, it translocates to the mitochondria. Phosphorylated cryAB (PcryAB) is mainly associated with the mitochondria, and any residual cytosolic PcryAB translocates to the mitochondria after H(2)O(2) exposure. H(2)O(2) exposure caused increases in cryAB and PcryAB levels, and cryAB silencing resulted in increased levels of apoptosis after exposure to H(2)O(2). Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed an apparent interaction of both cryAB and PcryAB with mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC), translocase of outer mitochondrial membranes 20 kDa (TOM 20), caspase 3, and caspase 12 in mouse cardiac tissue.

Here we examined the effect of intracoronary artery transplantation of human CLCs in a swine model of chronic heart failure. Twenty-four pigs underwent balloon-occlusion of the first diagonal branch followed by reperfusion, with a second balloon-occlusion of the left ascending coronary artery 1 week later followed by reperfusion. Four weeks after the second occlusion/reperfusion, 17 of the 18 surviving animals with severe chronic MI (ejection fraction <35% by echocardiography) were immunosuppressed then randomly assigned to receive either intracoronary artery transplantation of hCLCs hADMPCs or placebo lactic Ringer's solution with heparin. Intracoronary artery transplantation was followed by the distribution of DiI-stained hCLCs into the scarred myocardial milieu. Echocardiography at post-transplant days 4 and 8 weeks showed rescue and maintenance of cardiac function in the hCLCs transplanted group, but not in the control animals, indicating myocardial functional recovery by hCLCs intracoronary transplantation. At 8 week post-transplantation, 7 of 8 hCLCs transplanted animals were still alive compared with only 1 of the 5 control (p=0.0147). Histological studies at week 12 post-transplantation demonstrated engraftment of the pre DiI-stained hCLCs into the scarred myocardium and their expression of human specific alpha-cardiac actin. Human alpha cardiac actin-positive cells also expressed cardiac nuclear factors; nkx2.5 and GATA-4. Our results suggest that intracoronary artery transplantation of hCLCs is a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for future cardiac tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2012-08-18", "authors": ["HanayukiOkura", "AyamiSaga", "MayumiSoeda", "ShigeruMiyagawa", "YoshikiSawa", "TakashiDaimon", "AkihiroIchinose", "AkifumiMatsuyama"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.004"}
{"title": "Tissue retention of doxorubicin and its effects on cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle function.", "abstract": "Cancer-related fatigue is a pervasive syndrome experienced by a majority of cancer patients undergoing treatment, and muscular dysfunction may be a key component in the development and progression of this syndrome. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of many cancers. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of DOX exposure on the function of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle tissues and examine the role accumulation of DOX may play in this process. In these studies, rats were treated with DOX and measurements of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle function were assessed 1, 3, and 5 days after exposure. All muscular tissues showed significant and severe dysfunction, yet there was heterogeneity both in the time course of dysfunction and in the accumulation of DOX. Cardiac and skeletal muscle exhibited a time-dependent progressive decline in function during the 5 days following DOX treatment. In contrast, vascular function showed a decline in function that could be characterized as rapid onset and was sustained for the duration of the 5-day observation period. DOX accumulation was greatest in cardiac tissue, yet all muscular tissues showed a similar degree of dysfunction. Our data suggest that in muscular tissues both DOX-dependent and DOX-independent mechanisms may be involved with the muscular dysfunction observed following DOX treatment. Furthermore, this study highlights the fact that dysfunction of skeletal and smooth muscle may be an underappreciated aspect of DOX toxicity and may be a key component of cancer-related fatigue in these patients.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2012-08-15", "authors": ["ReidHayward", "DavidHydock", "NoahGibson", "StephanieGreufe", "EricBredahl", "TraciParry"], "doi": "10.1007/s13105-012-0200-0"}

Artificial matrices reproducing mechanical and structural properties of the native tissue may facilitate survival, retention and functional integration of adult stem or progenitor cells, by conditioning the cells prior to, and during, transplantation. Here we combined autologous cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) with nanotopographically defined hydrogels mimicking the native myocardial matrix, to form in vitro cardiac stem cell niches, and control cell function and fate. These platforms were used to produce cardiac patches that could be transplanted at the site of infarct. In culture, highly anisotropic, but not more randomized nanotopographic, control augmented cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. It also dramatically enhanced early, and, in the presence of mature cardiomyocytes, late cardiomyogenesis. Nanotopography sensing and transcriptional response was mediated via p190RhoGAP. In a rat infarction model, engraftment of nanofabricated scaffolds with CDCs enhanced retention and growth of transplanted cells, and their integration with the host tissue. The infarcted ventricle wall increased in thickness, with higher cell viability and better collagen organization.

Nephrotoxicity and cardiotoxicity represent it's major complication upon clinical use. The present study was carried out to evaluate the possible protective effect of DL-\u03b1-lipoic acid (LA) against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. Different groups of rats (n = 10) were administered either saline (control), cisplatin (10 mg/kg, i.p.), LA (100 mg/kg, i.p.) or their combination (LA 30 min prior to cisplatin administration). Twenty-four hours later all animals were decapitated and sera were used for estimation of activities of urea (BUN), creatinine (Cr), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK). Homogenates of the kidney and heart were used for estimation of oxidative stress markers (reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and nitric oxide (NO)). Additionally, caspase-3 activities and DNA-fragmentation were investigated in renal tissues. The results showed that cisplatin produced significant elevation in serum activities of LDH, CK, BUN, and Cr and also induced significant elevation in the oxidative stress makers (MDA and NO) accompanied by significant reduction in GSH and SOD in both kidney and heart. The integrity of DNA was heavily damaged and caspase-3 was activated in renal tissues. The results emphasized nephrotoxicty and cardiotoxicity of cisplatin. On the other hand, prior administration of LA significantly attenuated the cisplatin-evoked disturbances in the above mentioned parameters and protected both kidney and heart tissues. The histopathological examination emphasized the obtained results. In conclusion, LA is suggested to be a potential candidate to ameliorate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and cardiotoxicity without altering the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin.", "journal": "Drug discoveries & therapeutics", "date": "2012-08-15", "authors": ["AsmmaHussein", "Amany A EAhmed", "Samia AShouman", "SabrySharawy"], "doi": null}

These include the biomaterial architecture, strength and stiffness, cell alignment, and/or incorporation of multiple cell types. In this article, we explore the combinatorial use of decellularized tissues, moldable hydrogels, patterned cell-seeding, and cell-sheet engineering and find that a combination of these methods is optimal in the recreation of transplantable cardiac-like tissue in vivo. We show that decellularized urinary bladder matrix (UBM), that is compliant and suturable, supports the survival of cell cultures but does not allow maintenance of cell-to-cell contacts of transferred cell-sheets (presumably, due to its rough surface). Moreover, the UBM material must be filled with hyaluronan (HA) hydrogels for smoothing rough surfaces and allowing the delivery of greater cell numbers. We additionally incorporated our previously developed \"wrinkled\" microchip for inducing alignment of cardiac cells with a laser-etched mask for co-seeding patterned \"channels\" of cells. This article also introduces a novel method of plasma coating for cell-sheet engineering that compares well with electron bean irradiation methods and may be combined with our \"wrinkled\" surfaces to facilitate the alignment of cardiac cells into sheets. Our data shows that an optimal design for generating cardiac tissue would include (1) decellularized matrix seeded with endothelial cells in a HA layered with (2) prealigned cardiac cell-sheets fabricated using our \"wrinkled\" microchips and thermo-responsive polymer [poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)] cell sheet transfer system.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

To date, the pathogenic mechanisms of LQT2 mutations have been predominantly described in the context of the hERG1a isoform. In the present study, we investigated the functional consequences of the LQT2 mutation G628S in the hERG1b and hERG1a(USO) isoforms.\nA double-stable, mammalian expression system was developed to characterize isoform-specific dominant-negative effects of G628S-containing channels when co-expressed at equivalent levels with wild-type hERG1a. Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed to study the trafficking and co-assembly of wild-type and mutant hERG1 isoforms. Patch-clamp electrophysiology was performed to characterize hERG1 channel function and the isoform-specific dominant-negative effects associated with the G628S mutation.\nThe non-functional hERG1a-G628S and hERG1b-G628S channels co-assembled with wild-type hERG1a and dominantly suppressed hERG1 current. In contrast, G628S-induced dominant-negative effects were absent in the context of the hERG1a(USO) isoform. hERG1a(USO)-G628S channels did not appreciably associate with hERG1a and did not significantly suppress hERG1 current when co-expressed at equivalent ratios or at ratios that approximate those found in cardiac tissue.

Despite extensive investigations into the effects of doxorubicin on the cardiovascular system, the molecular mechanisms of toxicity remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs are endogenously transcribed non-coding 22 nucleotide long RNAs that regulate gene expression by decreasing mRNA stability and translation and play key roles in cardiac physiology and pathologies. Increasing doses of doxorubicin, but not etoposide (a Topoisomerase II inhibitor devoid of cardiovascular toxicity), specifically induced the up-regulation of miR-208b, miR-216b, miR-215, miR-34c and miR-367 in rat hearts. Furthermore, the lowest dosing regime (1 mg/kg/week for 2 weeks) led to a detectable increase of miR-216b in the absence of histopathological findings or alteration of classical cardiac stress biomarkers. In silico microRNA target predictions suggested that a number of doxorubicin-responsive microRNAs may regulate mRNAs involved in cardiac tissue remodeling. In particular miR-34c was able to mediate the DOX-induced changes of Sipa1 mRNA (a mitogen-induced Rap/Ran GTPase activating protein) at the post-transcriptional level and in a seed sequence dependent manner.

However, a critical number of cells that synchronously exhibit EADs are needed to result in arrhythmia triggers and substrates in tissue. In this study, we use mathematical modeling and computer simulations to investigate EAD synchronization and arrhythmia induction in tissue models with random cell-to-cell variations. Our major observations are as follows. Random cell-to-cell variations in action potential duration without EAD presence do not cause large dispersion of refractoriness in well-coupled tissue. In the presence of phase-2 EADs, the cells may synchronously exhibit the same number of EADs or no EADs with a very small dispersion of refractoriness, or synchronize regionally to result in large dispersion of refractoriness. In the presence of phase-3 EADs, regional synchronization leads to propagating EADs, forming PVCs in tissue. Interestingly, even though the uncoupled cells exhibit either no EAD or only a single EAD, when these cells are coupled to form a tissue, more than one PVC can occur. When the PVCs occur at different locations and time, multifocal arrhythmias are triggered, with the foci shifting in space and time in an irregular manner.

Conversely, infarction of adult mice resulted in a modest induction of (c-kit)EGFP(+) cells within the infarct, which did not express Nkx2.5 or undergo myogenic differentiation, but adopted a vascular fate within the infarction, indicating a lack of authentic CPC. Explantation of infarcted neonatal and adult heart tissue to scid mice, and adoptive transfer of labeled bone marrow, confirmed the cardiac source of myogenic (neonate) and angiogenic (neonate and adult) cells. FACS-purified (c-kit)EGFP(+)/(\u03b1MHC)mCherry(-) (noncardiac) cells from microdissected infarcts within 6 h of infarction underwent cardiac differentiation, forming spontaneously beating myocytes in vitro; cre/LoxP fate mapping identified a noncardiac population of (c-kit)EGFP(+) myocytes within infarctions, indicating that the induction of undifferentiated precursors contributes to localized myogenesis. Thus, adult postinfarct myogenic failure is likely not due to a context-dependent restriction of precursor differentiation, and c-kit induction following injury of the adult heart does not define precursor status.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2012-08-01", "authors": ["Sophy AJesty", "Michele ASteffey", "Frank KLee", "MartinBreitbach", "MichaelHesse", "ShaunReining", "Jane CLee", "Robert MDoran", "Alexander YuNikitin", "Bernd KFleischmann", "Michael IKotlikoff"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1208114109"}
{"title": "Biofabrication enables efficient interrogation and optimization of sequential culture of endothelial cells, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes for formation of vascular cords in cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "We previously reported that preculture of fibroblasts (FBs) and endothelial cells (ECs) prior to cardiomyocytes (CMs) improved the structural and functional properties of engineered cardiac tissue compared to culture of CMs alone or co-culture of all three cell types. However, these approaches did not result in formation of capillary-like cords, which are precursors to vascularization in vivo. Here we hypothesized that seeding the ECs first on Matrigel and then FBs 24 h later to stabilize the endothelial network (sequential preculture) would enhance cord formation in engineered cardiac organoids. Three sequential preculture groups were tested by seeding ECs (D4T line) at 8%, 15% and 31% of the total cell number on Matrigel-coated microchannels and incubating for 24 h. Cardiac FBs were then seeded (32%, 25% and 9% of the total cell number, respectively) and incubated an additional 24 h. Finally, neonatal rat CMs (60% of the total cell number) were added and the organoids were cultivated for seven days. Within 24 h, the 8% EC group formed elongated cords which eventually developed into beating cylindrical organoids, while the 15% and 31% EC groups proliferated into flat EC monolayers with poor viability. Excitation threshold (ET) in the 8% EC group (3.4 \u00b1 1.2 V cm(-1)) was comparable to that of the CM group (3.3 \u00b1 1.4 V cm(-1)). The ET worsened with increasing EC seeding density (15% EC: 4.4 \u00b1 1.5 V cm(-1); 31% EC: 4.9 \u00b1 1.5 V cm(-1)).

Whereas human-ether-a-go-go related gene screening has become routine to mitigate proarrhythmic risk, the development of in vitro assays predicting additional on- and off-target biochemical toxicities will benefit from cellular models exhibiting true cardiomyocyte characteristics such as native tissue-like mitochondrial activity. Human stem cell-derived tissue cells may provide such a model. This hypothesis was tested using a combination of flux analysis, gene and protein expression, and toxicity-profiling techniques to characterize mitochondrial function in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human cardiomyocytes in the presence of differing carbon sources over extended periods in cell culture. Functional analyses demonstrate that iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are (1) capable of utilizing anaerobic or aerobic respiration depending upon the available carbon substrate and (2) bioenergetically closest to adult heart tissue cells when cultured in galactose or galactose supplemented with fatty acids. We utilized this model to test a variety of kinase inhibitors with known clinical cardiac liabilities for their potential toxicity toward these cells. We found that the kinase inhibitors showed a dose-dependent toxicity to iPSC cardiomyocytes grown in galactose and that oxygen consumption rates were significantly more affected than adenosine triphosphate production.

In the present study, we evaluated whether BD suppresses growth and breast-to lung cancer metastasis in an orthotopic model of human breast cancer cells implanted in mice. Oral application of BD (100 mg/kg of body weight for 4 weeks) by intragastric gavage did not affect body weight or activity of liver enzymes and did not show any sign of toxicity in liver, spleen, kidney, lung and heart tissues in mice. Moreover, BD significantly decreased the change in tumor volume over time compared to the control group (p=0.002). BD treatment also markedly decreased the incidence of breast-to-lung cancer metastasis from 67% (control) to 20% (BD) (p<0.05) and the number of metastases from 2.8 (0.0, 48.0) in the control group to 0.0 (0.0, 14.2) in the BD treatment group (p<0.05). Finally, anti-metastatic activity of BD in vivo was further confirmed by the downregulation of expression of PLAU (urokinase plasminogen activator, uPA) and CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor-4) genes in breast tumors.

{"title": "Slow Calcium-Depolarization-Calcium waves may initiate fast local depolarization waves in ventricular tissue.", "abstract": "Intercellular calcium waves in cardiac myocytes are a well-recognized, if incompletely understood, phenomenon. In a variety of preparations, investigators have reported multi-cellular calcium waves or triggered propagated contractions, but the mechanisms of propagation and pathological importance of these events remain unclear. Here, we review existing experimental data and present a computational approach to investigate the mechanisms of multi-cellular calcium wave propagation. Over the past 50 years, the standard modeling paradigm for excitable cardiac tissue has seen increasingly detailed models of the dynamics of individual cells coupled in tissue solely by intercellular and interstitial current flow. Although very successful, this modeling regime has been unable to capture two important phenomena: 1) the slow intercellular calcium waves observed experimentally, and 2) how intercellular calcium events resulting in delayed after depolarizations at the cellular level could overcome a source-sink mismatch to initiate depolarization waves in tissue. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model with subcellular spatial resolution, in which we allow both inter- and intracellular current flow and calcium diffusion. In simulations of coupled cells employing this model, we observe: a) slow inter-cellular calcium waves propagating at about 0.1\u00a0mm/s, b) faster Calcium-Depolarization-Calcium (CDC) waves, traveling at about 1\u00a0mm/s, and c) CDC-waves that can set off fast depolarization-waves (50\u00a0cm/s) in tissue with varying gap-junction conductivity.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2012-07-31", "authors": ["AslakTveito", "Glenn TerjeLines", "Andrew GEdwards", "Mary MMaleckar", "AnushkaMichailova", "JohanHake", "AndrewMcCulloch"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.07.005"}

The main metabolic changes after Roundup(\u00ae) exposure were related to disturbance in energy metabolism and metabolic biomarkers such as alanine, succinate, acetate and propionate, suggesting the occcurence of anaerobiosis and the impairment of oxydative metabolism. Results showed also that peak intensities of amino acids used as biomarker of anaerobiosis in molluscs are time and dose dependent. In the opposite, phosphoarginine and ATP level are dependent to Roundup(\u00ae) concentration rather than to the time of exposure. We suggest that changes in energy demands require adjustements in the forward arginine kinase reaction rate.

{"title": "Rapamycin reverses elevated mTORC1 signaling in lamin A/C-deficient mice, rescues cardiac and skeletal muscle function, and extends survival.", "abstract": "Mutations in LMNA, the gene that encodes A-type lamins, cause multiple diseases including dystrophies of the skeletal muscle and fat, dilated cardiomyopathy, and progeria-like syndromes (collectively termed laminopathies). Reduced A-type lamin function, however, is most commonly associated with skeletal muscle dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy rather than lipodystrophy or progeria. The mechanisms underlying these diseases are only beginning to be unraveled. We report that mice deficient in Lmna, which corresponds to the human gene LMNA, have enhanced mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) signaling specifically in tissues linked to pathology, namely, cardiac and skeletal muscle. Pharmacologic reversal of elevated mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin improves cardiac and skeletal muscle function and enhances survival in mice lacking A-type lamins. At the cellular level, rapamycin decreases the number of myocytes with abnormal desmin accumulation and decreases the amount of desmin in both muscle and cardiac tissue of Lmna(-/-) mice. In addition, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling with rapamycin improves defective autophagic-mediated degradation in Lmna(-/-) mice. Together, these findings point to aberrant mTORC1 signaling as a mechanistic component of laminopathies associated with reduced A-type lamin function and offer a potential therapeutic approach, namely, the use of rapamycin-related mTORC1 inhibitors.", "journal": "Science translational medicine", "date": "2012-07-28", "authors": ["Fresnida JRamos", "Steven CChen", "Michael GGarelick", "Dao-FuDai", "Chen-YuLiao", "Katherine HSchreiber", "Vivian LMacKay", "Elroy HAn", "RandyStrong", "Warren CLadiges", "Peter SRabinovitch", "MattKaeberlein", "Brian KKennedy"], "doi": "10.1126/scitranslmed.3003802"}

In this study, isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured with several culture conditions in vitro and characterized for cell proliferation, myofibril organization, and cardiac functionality by assessing cell morphology, immunocytochemical staining, and time-lapse confocal scanning microscopy. When cardiomyocytes were cultured in liver cell line derived conditioned medium without exogenous growth factors and cytokines, the cell proliferation increased, cell morphology was highly elongated, and subsequent myofibril organization was highly developed. These developed myofibril organization also showed high level of contractibility and synchronization, representing high functionality of cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Role of endothelial AADC in cardiac synthesis of serotonin and nitrates accumulation.", "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) regulates different cardiac functions by acting directly on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Today, it is widely accepted that activated platelets represent a major source of 5-HT. In contrast, a supposed production of 5-HT in the heart is still controversial. To address this issue, we investigated the expression and localization of 5-HT synthesizing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) and L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in the heart. We also evaluated their involvement in cardiac production of 5-HT. TPH1 was weakly expressed in mouse and rat heart and appeared restricted to mast cells. Degranulation of mast cells by compound 48/80 did not modify 5-HT cardiac content in mice. Western blots and immunolabelling experiments showed an abundant expression of AADC in the mouse and rat heart and its co-localization with endothelial cells. Incubation of cardiac homogenate with the AADC substrate (5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan) 5-HTP or intraperitoneal injection of 5-HTP in mice significantly increased cardiac 5-HT. These effects were prevented by the AADC inhibitor benserazide. Finally, 5-HTP administration in mice increased phosphorylation of aortic nitric oxide synthase 3 at Ser (1177) as well as accumulation of nitrates in cardiac tissue. This suggests that the increase in 5-HT production by AADC leads to activation of endothelial and cardiac nitric oxide pathway.

Since that time, negative filament tension of scroll waves and the resulting complex, often turbulent dynamics was studied in many generic models of excitable media as well as in physiologically realistic models of cardiac tissue.

For cardiac tissue ablation, RFA technology has evolved from nonirrigated to saline-irrigated ablation electrodes to improve both safety and effectiveness.\nTen patients with resistant hypertension underwent renal angiography, followed by bilateral RSDN with a saline-irrigated RFA catheter. Ambulatory blood pressure recordings (24 h) were obtained at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure. Repeat renal angiography was performed during follow-up to assess for arterial stenosis or aneurysm.

{"title": "Ratiometric imaging of calcium during ischemia-reperfusion injury in isolated mouse hearts using Fura-2.", "abstract": "We present an easily implementable method for measuring Fura-2 fluorescence from isolated mouse hearts using a commercially available switching light source and CCD camera. After calibration, it provides a good estimate of intracellular [Ca2+] with both high spatial and temporal resolutions, permitting study of changes in dispersion of diastolic [Ca2+], Ca2+ transient dynamics, and conduction velocities in mouse hearts. In a proof-of-principle study, we imaged isolated Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts with reversible regional myocardial infarctions.\nIsolated mouse hearts were perfused in the Landendorff-mode and loaded with Fura-2. Hearts were then paced rapidly and subjected to 15 minutes of regional ischemia by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, following which the ligation was removed to allow reperfusion for 15 minutes. Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded at regular intervals using a high-speed CCD camera. The two wavelengths of excitation light were interleaved at a rate of 1 KHz with a computer controlled switching light source to illuminate the heart.\nFura-2 produced consistent Ca2+ transients from different hearts. Ligating the coronary artery rapidly generated a well defined region with a dramatic rise in diastolic Ca2+ without a significant change in transient amplitude; Ca2+ handling normalized during reperfusion. Conduction velocity was reduced by around 50% during ischemia, and did not recover significantly when monitored for 15 minutes following reperfusion.\nOur method of imaging Fura-2 from isolated whole hearts is capable of detecting pathological changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels in cardiac tissue. The persistent change in the conduction velocities indicates that changes to tissue connectivity rather than altered intracellular Ca2+ handling may be underlying the electrical instabilities commonly seen in patients following a myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering online", "date": "2012-07-21", "authors": ["RaghavVenkataraman", "Mark RHolcomb", "ReneHarder", "Bj\u00f6rn CKnollmann", "FranzBaudenbacher"], "doi": "10.1186/1475-925X-11-39\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e3182009701\n10.1016/S0002-9149(73)80036-0\n10.1002/clc.4960230703\n10.1016/j.hlc.2007.03.001\n10.1093/cvr/28.1.1\n10.1161/01.RES.65.4.1045\n10.1161/01.RES.0000187456.06162.cb\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.70.113006.100455\n10.1093/cvr/cvn133\n10.1529/biophysj.105.061820\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.176248\n10.1117/1.1316091\n10.1161/01.RES.0000130529.18016.35\n10.1161/hc4201.097136\n10.1152/ajpheart.01398.2006\n10.1016/S0008-6363(03)00467-X\n10.1161/01.RES.0000159387.00749.3c\n10.1016/j.jbbm.2007.01.006\n10.1016/S0006-3495(96)79306-2\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1157\n10.1016/S0024-3205(03)00538-1\n10.1016/j.ceca.2003.10.001\n10.1113/expphysiol.2009.048215\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.09.002\n10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81274-8\n10.1016/j.jbbm.2003.11.001\n10.1152/ajpheart.00374.2003\n10.1152/ajpheart.00058.2008\n10.1161/01.RES.65.4.1029\n10.1161/01.CIR.78.4.1047\n10.1161/01.RES.71.6.1334\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.00661.x\n10.1196/annals.1380.020\n10.1016/S0008-6363(96)00217-9\n10.1161/01.RES.79.6.1100\n10.1016/S0006-3495(90)82494-2\n10.1016/0022-2828(92)93390-6\n10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00241-8\n10.1152/physrev.00024.2007\n10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.03.013\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.789149\n10.1172/JCI112770\n10.1021/bi00437a003"}

An I(KATP) channel opener, pinacidil, was used to abbreviate APD. Rapid pacing was then performed. Upon abrupt cessation of rapid pacing with cycle lengths of 60-200 milliseconds, there were APD(90) prolongation and the corresponding Ca(i) overloading in the first postpacing beats. The duration of Ca(i) transient recovered to 50% (DCaT(50) ) and 90% (DCaT(90) ) in the first postpacing beats was significantly longer than baseline. Abnormal Ca(i) elevation coupled with shortened APD produced late-phase 3 EAD induced triggered activity and VF. In additional 6 preparations, the heart tissues were treated with BAPTA-AM, a calcium chelator. BAPTA-AM significantly reduced the maximal Ca(i) amplitude (26.4 \u00b1 3.5% of the control; P < 0.001) and the duration of Ca(i) transients in the mapped region, preventing the development of EAD and triggered activity that initiated VF.\nI (KATP) channel activation along with Ca(i) overloading are associated with the development of late-phase 3 EAD and VF. Because acute myocardial ischemia activates the I(KATP) channel, late-phase 3 EADs may be a mechanism for VF initiation during acute myocardial ischemia.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology", "date": "2012-07-20", "authors": ["LiangTang", "BoyoungJoung", "MasahiroOgawa", "Peng-ShengChen", "Shien-FongLin"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1540-8167.2012.02400.x"}

Transient and low release of NO by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) has been shown to be beneficial, while high and sustained release by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) may be detrimental in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. The present study was designed to evaluate whether genistein could prevent isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy in male Wistar rats (150-200 g, 10-12 weeks old) rats. Isoproterenol (5 mg\u00b7(kg body weight)(-1)) was injected subcutaneously once daily for 14 days to induced cardiac hypertrophy. Genistein (0.1 and 0.2 mg\u00b7kg(-1), subcutaneous injection once daily) was administered along with isoproterenol. Heart tissue was studied for myocyte size and fibrosis. Myocardial thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase levels, and 1-OH proline (collagen content) were also estimated. Genistein significantly prevented any isoproterenol-induced increase in heart weight to body weight ratio, left ventricular mass (echocardiographic), myocardial 1-OH proline, fibrosis, myocyte size and myocardial oxidative stress. These beneficial effects of genistein were blocked by a nonselective NOS inhibitor (L-NAME), but not by a selective iNOS inhibitor (aminoguanidine). Thus, the present study suggests that the salutary effects of genistein on isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy may be mediated through inhibition of iNOS and potentiation of eNOS activities.", "journal": "Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology", "date": "2012-07-20", "authors": ["Subir KumarMaulik", "PankajPrabhakar", "Amit KumarDinda", "SandeepSeth"], "doi": "10.1139/y2012-068"}

For the blood specimens both whole blood and buffy coat fraction were analyzed. The specimens were from patients living in the USA, with suspected exposure to T. cruzi through organ transplantation, contact with triatomine bugs or laboratory accidents, and from immunosuppressed patients with suspected Chagas disease reactivation. Real-time PCR was successfully used to diagnose acute and Chagas disease reactivation in 20 patients, including one case of organ-transmitted infection and one congenital case. Analysis of buffy coat fractions of EDTA blood led to faster diagnosis in six of these patients compared to whole blood analysis. The three real-time PCR assays produced identical results for 94% of the specimens. The major reason for discrepant results was variable sensitivity among the assays, but two of the real-time PCR assays also produced four false positive results.\nThese data strongly indicate that at least two PCR assays with different performances should be combined to increase the accuracy.

The aim of this study was to compare human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from different somatic cell sources regarding their generation efficiency and cardiac differentiation potential, and functionalities of cardiomyocytes.\nWe generated hiPSCs from hair keratinocytes, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and skin fibroblasts by using two different virus systems. We show that MSCs and fibroblasts are more easily reprogrammed than keratinocytes. This corresponds to higher methylation levels of minimal promoter regions of the OCT4 and NANOG genes in keratinocytes than in MSCs and fibroblasts. The success rate and reprogramming efficiency was significantly higher by using the STEMCCA system than the OSNL system. All analysed hiPSCs are pluripotent and show phenotypical characteristics similar to human embryonic stem cells.

We characterized contractile patterns and measured contractile function using a force transducer, and assessed force-length relationship, maximal force generation, and rate of force generation. Action potential and conduction velocity of EHT were measured with optical mapping, and transcript levels of myosin heavy chain beta were measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.\nIncreasing the cell number per construct resulted in an increase in fiber volume. The force-length relationship was negatively impacted by increasing cell number. Maximal force generation and rate of force generation were also abrogated with increasing cell number. This decrease was not likely attributable to a selective expansion of noncontractile cells as myosin heavy chain beta levels were stable. Irregular contractile behavior was more prevalent in constructs with more cells. Engineered heart tissue (1\u00d710(6)/construct) had an action potential duration of 140.2 milliseconds and a conduction velocity of 23.2 cm/s.\nEngineered heart tissue displays physiologically relevant features shared with native myocardium. Engineered heart tissue scale-up by increasing cell number abrogates contractile function, possibly as a result of suboptimal cardiomyocyte performance in the absence of vasculature.

The training program consisted of swimming one hour each day, five days a week, for six weeks. At the end of sixth week, rats in exhausted exercise group were forced to swim until exhaustion and then they were immediately sacrificed, while rats in rest group were sacrificed at rest. Training alone or in combination with CoQ10 supplementation reduced to increasing MDA levels due to exhaustive exercise in rat heart (p<0.05). The trained-rest with CoQ10 group showed lower 8-OHdG levels than the control-rest with CoQ10 group. Exhaustive exercise effect was significant on SOD activity. Exhaustive exercise increased GSH levels in control groups while decreased GSH levels in training groups (p<0.05). In conclusion, the results suggest that CoQ10 supplementation combined with training may inhibit lipid peroxidation and DNA damage in the heart tissue.

In cardiac tissue, alternans can be spatially concordant or discordant, of which the latter has been shown to increase dispersion of repolarization and promote a substrate for initiation of ventricular fibrillation. Alternans has been studied almost exclusively under constant cycle length pacing conditions. However, heart rate varies greatly on a beat-by-beat basis in normal and pathological conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine if applying a repetitive but non-constant pacing pattern, specifically cycle length oscillation (CLO), promotes or suppresses a proarrhythmic substrate. We performed computational simulations and optical mapping experiments to investigate the potential consequences of CLO. In a single cell computational model, CLO induced APD and Ca(i) alternans, which became \"phase-matched\" with the applied oscillation. As a consequence of the phase-matching, in one-dimensional cable simulations, neonatal rat ventricular myocyte monolayers, and isolated adult guinea pig hearts CLO could transiently induce spatial and electromechanical discordant alternans followed by a steady-state of concordance. Our results demonstrated that under certain conditions, CLO can initiate ventricular fibrillation in the isolated hearts.

{"title": "A composite polymer nanoparticle overcomes multidrug resistance and ameliorates doxorubicin-associated cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Acquired chemotherapy resistance is a major contributor to treatment failure in oncology. For example, the efficacy of the common anticancer agent doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in cancer cells. While dose escalation of DOX can circumvent such resistance to a degree, this is precluded by the appearance of cardiotoxicity, a particularly debilitating condition in children. In vitro studies have established the ability of the natural phytochemical curcumin to overcome MDR; however, its widespread clinical application is restricted by poor solubility and low bioavailability. Building upon our recently developed polymer nanoparticle of curcumin (NanoCurc or NC) that significantly enhances the systemic bioavailability of curcumin, we synthesized a doxorubicin-curcumin composite nanoparticle formulation called NanoDoxCurc (NDC) for overcoming DOX resistance. Compared to DOX alone, NDC inhibited the MDR phenotype and caused striking growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo in several models of DOX-resistant cancers (multiple myeloma, acute leukemia, prostate and ovarian cancers, respectively). Notably, NDC-treated mice also demonstrated complete absence of cardiac toxicity, as assessed by echocardiography, or any bone marrow suppression, even at cumulative dosages where free DOX and pegylated liposomal DOX (Doxil\u00ae) resulted in demonstrable attenuation of cardiac function and hematological toxicities. This improvement in safety profile was achieved through a reduction of DOX-induced intracellular oxidative stress, as indicated by total glutathione levels and glutathione peroxidase activity in cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Age-dependent changes in ion channel mRNA expression in canine cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "The expression pattern of cardiac ion channels displays marked changes during ontogeny. This study was designed to follow the developmental changes in the expression of major ventricular and atrial ion channel proteins (including both pore forming and regulatory subunits) in canine cardiac tissues at the mRNA level using competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Therefore, the corresponding mRNA levels were compared in myocardial tissues excised from embryonic (25-60 days of gestation) and adult (2-3 years old) canine hearts. Expression level of Kv4.3, Kv1.4, KChIP2, KvLQT1, and Cav3.2 mRNAs were higher in the adult than in the embryonic hearts, while expression of Nav1.5 and minK mRNAs were higher in the embryonic than in the adult myocardium. No change in Kir2.1, HERG, Kv1.5, and Cav1.2 mRNA was observed during ontogeny. Direction of the developmental change in the mRNA level, determined for any specific channel protein, was identical in the atrial and ventricular samples. The age-dependent increase observed in the expression of Kv4.3, Kv1.4, KChIP2, and KvLQT1 is congruent with the greater repolarization reserve of the adult myocardium, associated with higher densities of Ito and IKs. The results indicate that age-dependent changes in the expression pattern of many ion channels are similar in canine and healthy human myocardium, therefore, canine cardiac muscle can be considered as a good model of studying developmental changes in the human heart.", "journal": "General physiology and biophysics", "date": "2012-07-12", "authors": ["M\u00f3nikaG\u00f6nczi", "P\u00e9terBirinyi", "BernadettBal\u00e1zs", "NorbertSzentandr\u00e1ssy", "G\u00e1borHarmati", "Zolt\u00e1nK\u00f6nczei", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3Csernoch", "P\u00e9ter PN\u00e1n\u00e1si"], "doi": "10.4149/gpb_2012_017"}

Little is known about the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms of missense mutations located in the armadillo (ARM) domains of PKP2, as well as their consequences on human cardiac pathology.\nWe focused on in vivo and in vitro studies of the PKP2 founder mutation c.2386T>C (p.C796R), and demonstrated in cardiac tissue from 2 related mutation carriers a patchy expression pattern ranging from unchanged to totally absent immunoreactive signals of PKP2 and other desmosomal proteins. In vitro expression analysis of mutant PKP2 in cardiac derived HL-1 cells revealed unstable proteins that fail to interact with desmoplakin and are targeted by degradation involving calpain proteases. Bacterial expression, crystallization, and structural modeling of mutated proteins impacting different ARM domains and helices of PKP2 confirmed their instability and degradation, resulting in the same remaining protein fragment that was crystallized and used to model the entire ARM domain of PKP2.\nThe p.C796R and other ARVC-related PKP2 mutations indicate loss of function effects by intrinsic instability and calpain proteases mediated degradation in in vitro model systems, suggesting haploinsufficiency as the most likely cause for the genesis of dominant ARVC due to mutations in PKP2.", "journal": "Circulation.

To determine whether the cargo of endothelially targeted liposomes is internalized by endothelial cells and transported into tissue, and to evaluate whether such liposomes can accumulate in models of cardiovascular disease, we tracked the fate of the cargo (a hydrophilic fluorescent dye) and shell (conjugated with a radioisotope) of a heart-homing liposome (CRPPR-conjugated). The ex vivo heart was imaged with confocal microscopy and the in vivo heart with positron emission tomography in sham-treated mice and models of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and myocardial infarction (MI). Within 30 min of injection of 20mg/kg CRPPR liposomes, fluorescence increased by 47 fold in the tissue surrounding the vascular lumen, as compared with non-targeted liposomes. Both the accumulation on the endothelium and the interstitial fluorescence saturated at an injected dose of 20mg/kg. In both I/R and MI models, CRPPR liposomes accumulated in diseased sites, although less than in surrounding healthy tissue. The accumulation in the diseased sites increased with time post-injury: the ratio of accumulated radioactivity in the diseased and healthy cardiac tissue increased from 0.20\u00b10.04, to 0.58\u00b10.12 and 0.61\u00b10.19 for 1, 7, and 99 days post-MI, indicating the potential for adequate delivery and therapeutic efficacy if the targeted particles are injected at 7 or more days post-MI.

We have now used an alternative gene expression analysis tool to reanalyze this transcriptome and identify hyperactivation of a third branch of the MAP kinase cascade, p38\u03b1 signaling. Biochemical analysis of hearts from Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice showed enhanced p38\u03b1 activation prior to and after the onset of heart disease as well as in hearts from human subjects with cardiomyopathy caused by LMNA mutations. Treatment of Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice with the p38\u03b1 inhibitor ARRY-371797 prevented left ventricular dilatation and deterioration of fractional shortening compared with placebo-treated mice but did not block the expression of collagen genes involved in cardiac fibrosis.

{"title": "RAGE-dependent activation of gene expression of superoxide dismutase and vanins by AGE-rich extracts in mice cardiac tissue and murine cardiac fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are stable compounds formed from initial Maillard reaction products. They are considered as markers for ageing and often associated with age-related, degenerative diseases. Bread crust represents an established model for nutritional compounds rich in AGEs and is able to induce antioxidative defense genes such as superoxide dismutases and vanins in cardiac cells. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extend the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) contributes to this response. Signal transduction in response to bread crust extract was analysed in cardiac fibroblasts derived from C57/B6-NCrl (RAGE +/+) and the corresponding RAGE-knock out C57/B6-NCrl mouse strain (RAGE -/-). Activation of superoxide dismutases in animals was then analysed upon bread crust feeding in these two mice strains. Cardiac fibroblasts from RAGE -/- mice did not express RAGE, but the expression of AGER-1 and AGER-3 was up-regulated, whereas the expression of SR-B1 was down-regulated. RAGE -/- cells were less sensitive to BCE in terms of MAP-kinase phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB reporter gene activation. Bread crust extract induced mRNA levels of MnSOD and Vnn-1 were also reduced in RAGE -/- cells, whereas Vnn-3 mRNA accumulation seemed to be RAGE receptor independent. In bread crust feeding experiments, RAGE -/- mice did not exhibit an activation of MnSOD-mRNA and -protein accumulation as observed for the RAGE +/+ animals. In conclusion, RAGE was clearly a major factor for the induction of antioxidant defense signals derived from bread crust in cardiac fibroblast and mice. Nevertheless higher doses of bread crust extract could overcome the RAGE dependency in cell cultures, indicating that additional mechanisms are involved in BCE-mediated activation of SOD and vanin expression.", "journal": "Food & function", "date": "2012-07-10", "authors": ["BeatriceLeuner", "StefanieRuhs", "Hans-J\u00fcrgenBr\u00f6mme", "AngelikaBierhaus", "SaadettinSel", "Rolf-EdgarSilber", "VeronikaSomoza", "AndreasSimm", "NorbertNass"], "doi": "10.1039/c2fo30030c"}

In contrast to beam-scanning confocal microscopy, where the laser focus must be scanned both laterally and axially to collect a volume, we obtain depth information without the necessity of depth scanning. In this method, the emitted fluorescence is collected in the backward direction and is sent through a phase plate that encodes the depth information into the phase of a spectrally resolved interference pattern. We demonstrate that decoding this phase information allows for depth localization accuracy better than 4 \u00b5m over a 500 \u00b5m depth-of-field. In a high numerical aperture configuration with a much smaller depth of field, a localization accuracy of tens of nanometers can be achieved. This approach is ideally suited for miniature endoscopes, where space limitations at the endoscope tip render depth scanning difficult.

{"title": "Hydrogen sulfide anion regulates redox signaling via electrophile sulfhydration.", "abstract": "An emerging aspect of redox signaling is the pathway mediated by electrophilic byproducts, such as nitrated cyclic nucleotide (for example, 8-nitroguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-nitro-cGMP)) and nitro or keto derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids, generated via reactions of inflammation-related enzymes, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and secondary products. Here we report that enzymatically generated hydrogen sulfide anion (HS(-)) regulates the metabolism and signaling actions of various electrophiles. HS(-) reacts with electrophiles, best represented by 8-nitro-cGMP, via direct sulfhydration and modulates cellular redox signaling. The relevance of this reaction is reinforced by the significant 8-nitro-cGMP formation in mouse cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction that is modulated by alterations in HS(-) biosynthesis. Cardiac HS(-), in turn, suppresses electrophile-mediated H-Ras activation and cardiac cell senescence, contributing to the beneficial effects of HS(-) on myocardial infarction-associated heart failure.

Adequate selenium intake is needed to maximize the activity of selenoproteins, among which glutathione peroxidases have been shown to play a major role in cellular defense against oxidative stress initiated by excess reactive oxygen species. In humans, a low selenium status has been linked to increased risk of various diseases, including heart disease. The main objective of this review is to present current knowledge on the role of selenium in cardiac health. Experimental studies have shown that selenium may exert protective effects on cardiac tissue in animal models involving oxidative stress. Because of the narrow safety margin of this mineral, most interventional studies in humans have reported inconsistent findings. Major determinants of selenium status in humans are not well understood and several nondietary factors might be associated with reduced selenium status.

In recent years, it has become clear that specific Regulators of G protein Signaling proteins (RGS proteins) suppress muscarinic sensitivity and parasympathetic tone, identifying RGS proteins as intriguing potential therapeutic targets. In the present study, we have identified the effects of 1\u2009\u03bcM ACh and 1\u2009\u03bcM NA on the intrinsic action potentials of sinoatrial (SA) nodal and atrial myocytes. Single cells were enzymatically isolated from the SA node or from the left atrium of rabbit hearts. Action potentials were recorded using the amphotericin-perforated patch-clamp technique in the absence and presence of ACh, NA, or a combination of both. In SA nodal myocytes, ACh increased cycle length and decreased diastolic depolarization rate, whereas NA decreased cycle length and increased diastolic depolarization rate. Both ACh and NA increased maximum upstroke velocity. Furthermore, ACh hyperpolarized the maximum diastolic potential. In atrial myocytes stimulated at 2\u2009Hz, both ACh and NA hyperpolarized the maximum diastolic potential, increased the action potential amplitude, and increased the maximum upstroke velocity. Action potential duration at 50 and 90% repolarization was decreased by ACh, but increased by NA.

For early cardiomyocytes cultured on substrates of various stiffnesses, contractile function as measured by force production, work output and calcium handling is optimized when the culture substrate stiffness mimics that of the tissue from which the cells were obtained. This optimal contractile function corresponds to changes in sarcomeric protein conformation and organization that promote contractile ability. In light of current models for myofibillogenesis, a recent mathematical model of striation and alignment on elastic substrates helps to illuminate how substrate stiffness modulates early myofibril formation and organization. During embryonic heart formation and maturation, cardiac tissue mechanics change dynamically.

{"title": "High expression of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase and proinflammatory markers in human ischemic heart tissue.", "abstract": "A common feature of the ischemic heart and atherosclerotic plaques is the presence of hypoxia (insufficient levels of oxygen in the tissue). Hypoxia has pronounced effects on almost every aspect of cell physiology, and the nuclear transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) regulates adaptive responses to low concentrations of oxygen in mammalian cells. In our recent work, we observed that hypoxia increases the proinflammatory enzyme arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15B) in human carotid plaques. ALOX15 has recently been shown to be present in the human myocardium, but the effect of ischemia on its expression has not been investigated. Here we test the hypothesis that ischemia of the heart leads to increased expression of ALOX15, and found an almost 2-fold increase in HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA expression and a 17-fold upregulation of ALOX15 mRNA expression in the ischemic heart biopsies from patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery compared with non ischemic heart tissue. To investigate the effect of low oxygen concentration on ALOX15 we incubated human vascular muscle cells in hypoxia and showed that expression of ALOX15 increased 22-fold compared with cells incubated in normoxic conditions. We also observed increased mRNA levels of proinflammatory markers in ischemic heart tissue compared with non-ischemic controls. In summary, we demonstrate increased ALOX15 in human ischemic heart biopsies. Furthermore we demonstrate that hypoxia increases ALOX15 in human muscle cells.

In this context, the present work aims to investigate in vivo DOX cardiac, hepatic and renal toxicity in the same animal model, with special relevance on alterations of mitochondrial bioenergetics. To this end, male Wistar rats were sub-chronically (7 wks, 2 mg/Kg) or acutely (20 mg/Kg) treated with DOX and sacrificed one week or 24 hours after the last injection, respectively. Alterations of mitochondrial bioenergetics showed treatment-dependent differences between tissues. No alterations were observed for cardiac mitochondria in the acute model but decreased ADP-stimulated respiration was detected in the sub-chronic treatment. In the acute treatment model, ADP-stimulated respiration was increased in liver and decreased in kidney mitochondria. Aconitase activity, a marker of oxidative stress, was decreased in renal mitochondria in the acute and in heart in the sub-chronic model. Interestingly, alterations of cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics co-existed with an absence of echocardiograph, histopathological or ultra-structural alterations. Besides, no plasma markers of cardiac injury were found in any of the time points studied.

We have produced muscle-specific Glut4 knockout (KO) mice using Cre/LoxP technology on a C57BL6/J background and shown undetectable levels of GLUT4 in both skeletal muscle and heart. Our aim was to determine whether complete deletion of muscle GLUT4 does in fact lead to perturbations in glucose homoeostasis. Glucose tolerance, glucose turnover and 2-deoxyglucose uptake into muscle and fat under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions were assessed in 12-week-old KO and control mice using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and hyperinsulinaemic/euglycaemic clamp respectively. KO mice weighed ~17% less and had significantly heavier hearts compared with control mice. Basally, plasma glucose and plasma insulin were significantly lower in the KO compared with control mice, which conferred normal glucose tolerance. Despite the lack of GLUT4 in the KO mouse muscle, glucose uptake was not impaired in skeletal muscle but was reduced in heart under insulin-stimulated conditions. Neither GLUT1 nor GLUT12 protein levels were altered in the skeletal muscle or heart tissue of our KO mice. High-fat feeding did not alter glucose tolerance in the KO mice but led to elevated plasma insulin levels during the glucose tolerance test.

They belong to the chemical derivatives of polyketides, which are synthesized from fatty acid precursors. Although acetogenins have displayed diverse biological activities, the anti-proliferative effect on human cancer cells has been widely reported. Acetogenins are inhibitors of complex I in the electron transport chain therefore they interrupt ATP synthesis in mitochondria. We tested a new acetogenins-enriched extract from the seed of Persea americana in order to investigate if any toxicity was induced on cardiac tissue and determine the involved mechanism. In isolated perfused heart we found that contractility was completely inhibited at an accumulative dose of 77\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. In isolated cardiomyocytes, the acetogenins-enriched extract induced apoptosis through the activation of the intrinsic pathway at 43\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. In isolated mitochondria, it inhibited complex I activity on NADH-linked respiration, as would be expected, but also induced permeability transition on succinate-linked respiration. Cyclosporine A, a known blocker of permeability transition, significantly prevented the permeability transition triggered by the acetogenins-enriched extract. In addition, our acetogenins-enriched extract inhibited ADP/ATP exchange, suggesting that an important element in phosphate or adenylate transport was affected. In this manner we suggest that acetogenins-enriched extract from Persea americana could directly modulate permeability transition, an entity not yet associated with the acetogenins' direct effects, resulting in cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes", "date": "2012-06-27", "authors": ["ChristianSilva-Platas", "Noem\u00edGarc\u00eda", "EvaristoFern\u00e1ndez-Sada", "DanielD\u00e1vila", "CarmenHern\u00e1ndez-Brenes", "DarianaRodr\u00edguez", "GerardoGarc\u00eda-Rivas"], "doi": "10.1007/s10863-012-9452-1"}

We studied the effect of rosuvastatin on acute myocardial infarction induced experimentally in rats focusing on angiogenesis as a potential mechanism underlying the drug effect. Acute myocardial infarction was induced by injecting the rats with two doses of isoproterenol (85 mg/kg/24 h, s.c.). Rats were examined for their electrocardiographic pattern and myocardial fibrosis one week after injection of isoproterenol (time for initiating therapy) and eight weeks thereafter (the end of therapeutic period) to examine the progression of the injury. Examination of the heart tissues at the end of week 9 showed a non significant decrease in the degree of myocardial fibrosis compared to those observed at week 1, indicating a slow rate of recovery from isoproterenol-induced injury. Treatment with rosuvastatin (5 or 10 mg/kg) for 8 weeks in myocardial-infarct rats enhanced the electrocardiographic pattern, reduced serum cardiac biomarkers, reduced tissue tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level. In addition, immunohistochemical staining revealed higher expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), VEGF and CD(34) (a marker for microvessel density) in the cardiac tissues after treatment with rosuvastatin compared to control group.

Ventricular PI staining was quantified by fluorescent imaging. Histological analysis was performed using Masson's Trichrome staining. Results showed PI staining concentrated near the shock electrode in all hearts. Without recovery, PI staining was similar between normal and MI groups around the shock electrode and over the whole ventricles.

We hypothesized that delivering MSCs in a hydrogel with a modulus matched to that of native heart tissue should stimulate MSC differentiation into cardiac cells. We have developed a thermosensitive and injectable hydrogel suitable for the delivery of cells into the heart, and found that the appropriate gel modulus can differentiate MSCs into cardiac cells with high efficiency. The hydrogel was based on N-isopropylacrylamide, N-acryloxysuccinimide, acrylic acid and poly(trimethylene carbonate)-hydroxyethyl methacrylate. The hydrogel solution can be readily injected through needles commonly used for heart injection, and is capable of gelling within 7s at 37\u00b0C. The formed gels were highly flexible, with breaking strains (>300%) higher than that of native heart tissue and moduli within the range of native heart tissue (1-140 kPa). Controlling the concentration of the hydrogel solution resulted in hydrogels with three different moduli: 16, 45 and 65 kPa. The moduli were decoupled from the gel water content and oxygen diffusion, parameters that can also influence cell differentiation. MSCs survived in the hydrogels throughout the entire culture period, and it was observed that gel stiffness did not affect cell survival. After 14 days of culture, more than 76% of MSCs had differentiated into cardiac cells in the 45 and 65 kPa gels, as confirmed by the expression of cardiac markers at both the gene and protein levels. MSCs in the hydrogel with the 65 kPa modulus had the highest differentiation efficiency. The differentiated cells also developed calcium channels that imparted an electrophysiological property, and gap junctions for cell-cell communication. The efficiency of differentiation reported in this study was much higher than for the differentiation approaches described in the literature, such as chemical induction and co-culture of MSCs and cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that the novel hydrogel holds great promise for delivering MSCs into an infarcted heart for the generation of new heart tissue.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2012-06-26", "authors": ["ZhenqingLi", "XiaoleiGuo", "Andre FPalmer", "HiranmoyDas", "JianjunGuan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2012.06.024"}

Lung and heart tissues were assessed by morphological and cellular morphometric methods.\nWe observed evident ultra structural changes of the lung air-blood barrier (LABB) by the 7-10(th) day of training. Structural damage of LABB was most considerable after 2 weeks of IHT exposure, its ultrastructure partially normalized by the end of the IHT 4-weeks course: there was diminishing of LABB hydration and disappearance of areas of its destruction. The structural changes in the heart blood-tissue barrier (HBTB) were considerably less marked compared with those in LABB during the 1(st) and 2(nd) weeks of training. Heart tissue structural changes increased by the end of the fourth week of IHT. Both tissue cells revealed no significant necrotic damage of mitochondria after IHT, while changes relating to the energy-directed restructuring of mitochondria were observed. We hypothesized that acute moderate hypoxia promotes a specific type of mitosis in lung and heart tissues.\nUltrastructural changes in the rat lung and heart tissues depend on IHT duration.

Using transforming growth factor-\u03b2 treated monolayers of neonatal rat ventricular cells (NRVCs), which retain several key aspects of the healing infarct such as an excess of contractile myofibroblasts and slowed, heterogeneous conduction, we assessed the ability of hESC-CMs to improve conduction and prevent arrhythmias. Cells from beating embryoid bodies (hESC-CMs) can form functional monolayers which beat spontaneously and can be electrically stimulated, with mean action potential duration of 275 \u00b1 36 ms and conduction velocity (CV) of 10.6 \u00b1 4.2 cm/s (n = 3). These cells, or cells from non-beating embryoid bodies (hEBCs) were added to anisotropic, NRVC monolayers. Immunostaining demonstrated hESC-CM survival and engraftment, and dye transfer assays confirmed functional coupling between hESC-CMs and NRVCs. Conduction velocities significantly increased in anisotropic NRVC monolayers after engraftment of hESC-CMs (13.4 \u00b1 0.9 cm/s, n = 35 vs. 30.1 \u00b1 3.2 cm/s, n = 20 in the longitudinal direction and 4.3 \u00b1 0.3 cm/s vs. 9.3 \u00b1 0.9 cm/s in the transverse direction), but decreased to even lower values after engraftment of non-cardiac hEBCs (to 10.6 \u00b1 1.3 cm/s and 3.1 \u00b1 0.5 cm/s, n = 11, respectively). Furthermore, reentrant wave vulnerability in NRVC monolayers decreased by 20% after engraftment of hESC-CMs, but did not change with engraftment of hEBCs. Finally, the culture of hESC-CMs in transwell inserts, which prevents juxtacrine interactions, or engraftment with connexin43-silenced hESC-CMs provided no functional improvement to NRVC monolayers. These results demonstrate that hESC-CMs can reverse the slowing of conduction velocity, reduce the incidence of reentry, and augment impaired electrical propagation via gap junction coupling to host cardiomyocytes in this arrhythmogenic in vitro model.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2012-06-21", "authors": ["Susan AThompson", "Paul WBurridge", "Elizabeth ALipke", "MichaelShamblott", "Elias TZambidis", "LeslieTung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.01.023"}

However, little is known about the dynamic regulation of leukocyte recruitment into inflamed heart tissue, largely due to technical difficulties inherent in imaging moving tissue. Here, we report a method for imaging beating murine hearts using intravital 2-photon microscopy. Using this method, we visualized neutrophil trafficking at baseline and during inflammation. Ischemia reperfusion injury induced by transplantation or transient coronary artery ligation led to recruitment of neutrophils to the heart, their extravasation from coronary veins, and infiltration of the myocardium where they formed large clusters. Grafting hearts containing mutant ICAM-1, a ligand important for neutrophil recruitment, reduced the crawling velocities of neutrophils within vessels, and markedly inhibited their extravasation. Similar impairment was seen with the inhibition of Mac-1, a receptor for ICAM-1. Blockade of LFA-1, another ICAM-1 receptor, prevented neutrophil adherence to endothelium and extravasation in heart grafts.

Obese individuals have high circulating levels of leptin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue and involved in energy homeostasis. Growing evidence suggests that leptin may contribute to the development of cardiac dysfunction. In a large prospective study leptin has been shown to be an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. An independent positive association has also been found between plasma leptin levels and heart rate in hypertensive patients and heart transplant recipients. In animal studies chronic leptin infusion increased heart rate and blood pressure. It has also been demonstrated that circulating leptin levels are elevated in patients with heart failure. The level of plasma leptin was associated with increased myocardial wall thickness and correlated with left ventricular mass, suggesting a role for this hormone in mediating left ventricular hypertrophy in humans. Moreover, leptin directly induced hypertrophy and hyperplasia in human and rodent cardiomyocytes, accompanied by cardiac extracellular matrix remodelling. Leptin may also influence energy substrate utilisation in cardiac tissue. These findings suggest that leptin acting directly or through the sympathetic nervous system may have adverse effects on cardiac structure and function, and that chronic hyperleptinaemia may greatly increase the risk of cardiac disorders. Additional studies are needed to define the role of leptin in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology, nevertheless the reduction in plasma leptin levels with caloric restriction and weight loss may prevent cardiac dysfunction in obese patients.", "journal": "Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online)", "date": "2012-06-19", "authors": ["JoannaKarbowska", "Zdzis\u0142awKochan"], "doi": "10.5604/17322693.997817"}

This study investigated whether oxazaphosphorines alter the expression of organic cation/carnitine transporter (OCTN2) and antioxidant genes and if so, whether these alterations contribute to CP and IFO-induced cardiotoxicity. Adult male Wistar albino rats were assigned to one of six treatment groups namely, control, L carnitine, CP, IFO, CP plus L carnitine and IFO plus L carnitine. In cardiac and kidney tissues, CP and IFO significantly decreased mRNA and protein expression of OCTN2. Oxazaphosphorines significantly increased serum acyl-carnitine/free carnitine ratio and urinary carnitine excretion and significantly decreased total carnitine in cardiac tissues. Interestingly, carnitine supplementation completely reversed the biochemical and gene expression changes-induced by oxazaphosphorines to the control values, except OCTN2 expression remained inhibited by IFO. Data from this study suggest that: (1) Oxazaphosphorines decreased myocardial carnitine content following the inhibition of OCTN2 mRNA and protein expression in cardiac tissues.

The model is then altered, to include heterogeneous conductivities in the ischaemic region and larger border zone widths, in order to better reproduce realistic scenarios. Initial results for the rectangular and cylindrical ischaemic shapes show a central depression over the ischaemic region, for low ischaemic thicknesses, which separates into three depressions as the ischaemic thickness increases. For ischaemic thicknesses above 70% an elevation appears over the ischaemic region and this increases in magnitude as the ischaemia becomes transmural. Results for the semi-ellipsoidal shape, however, differ, with the central depression separating into only two depressions as the thickness increases. Changing the conductivity inside the ischaemic region significantly affects results for each geometry, with depression staying over the ischaemic region for much higher levels of ischaemia (up to 90% thickness).

{"title": "[One-dimensional time-dependent model of the cardiac pacemaker activity induced by the mechanoelectric feedback in a thermo-electro-mechanical background].", "abstract": "In a healthy heart, the mechanoelectric feedback (MEF) process acts as an intrinsic regulatory mechanism of the myocardium which allows the normal cardiac contraction by damping mechanical perturbations in order to generate a new healthy electromechanical situation. However, under certain conditions, the MEF can be a generator of dramatic arrhythmias by inducing local electrical depolarizations as a result of abnormal cardiac tissue deformations, via stretch-activated channels (SACs). Then, these perturbations can propagate in the whole heart and lead to global cardiac dysfunctions. In the present study, we qualitatively investigate the influence of temperature on autonomous electrical activity generated by the MEF.\nWe introduce a one-dimensional time-dependent model containing all the key ingredients that allow accounting for the excitation-contraction coupling, the MEF and the thermoelectric coupling.\nOur simulations show that an autonomous electrical activity can be induced by cardiac deformations, but only inside a certain temperature interval. In addition, in some cases, the autonomous electrical activity takes place in a periodic way like a pacemaker. We also highlight that some properties of action potentials, generated by the mechanoelectric feedback, are significantly influenced by temperature. Moreover, in the situation where a pacemaker activity occurs, we also show that the period is heavily temperature-dependent.\nOur qualitative model shows that the temperature is a significant factor with regards to the electromechanical behavior of the heart and more specifically, with regards to the autonomous electrical activity induced by the cardiac tissue deformations.", "journal": "Annales de cardiologie et d'angeiologie", "date": "2012-06-12", "authors": ["ACollet", "TDesaive", "P CDauby"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ancard.2012.04.019"}
{"title": "Natriuretic peptides as therapy in cardiac ischaemia/reperfusion.", "abstract": "Natriuretic peptides elicit vasodilation, increased sodium excretion and concomitant diuresis, and counteract the RAAS. In the heart itself, natriuretic peptides may also act anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic. This has led to the pursuit of natriuretic peptides and chemically modified peptides as adjunctive therapy in myocardial ischaemia. However, natriuretic peptide infusion may also influence the endogenous natriuretic peptide response and lipid accumulation. We hypothesised that a) natriuretic peptide infusion (BNP and CD-NP) is cardiomyocyte protective, b) affects the endogenous response, and c) facilitate cardiac lipid accumulation. We examined these effects in a minimally invasive porcine model of regional cardiac ischaemia and reperfusion. The studies were supplemented by a 48-hour porcine model of ischemia and reperfusion as well as an in vitro study of BNP administered in a HL-1 cell model of \"ischaemia/reperfusion\". Infarct size was determined by TTC staining, plasma troponin T release, and total RNA integrity in cardiac tissue samples. The endogenous response was assessed by a processing-independent proANP immunoassay and mRNA quantitation. Lipids in plasma and myocardial tissue were determined by TLC. The studies show that natriuretic peptides decrease cardiomyocyte damage, possibly partly through indirect mechanisms. Furthermore, BNP infusion completely inverts the endogenous response, whereas CD-NP infusion does not. Finally, both natriuretic peptides increase plasma free fatty acids, which is associated with an increased cardiac lipid accumulation in non-ischaemic myocardium. In conclusion, the studies suggest that natriuretic peptides are beneficial in terms of reduced cardiac injury. In addition, the endogenous natriuretic peptide response is inverted. The results advocate for pursuing natriuretic peptide treatment in ischaemia/reperfusion damage. However, the metabolic consequences in a cardiac tissue challenged by ischaemia should be pursued before testing the peptides in patients.", "journal": "Danish medical journal", "date": "2012-06-09", "authors": ["Birgitte SaimaKousholt"], "doi": null}
{"title": "HER2-targeted liposomal doxorubicin displays enhanced anti-tumorigenic effects without associated cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Anthracycline-based regimens are a mainstay of early breast cancer therapy, however their use is limited by cardiac toxicity. The potential for cardiotoxicity is a major consideration in the design and development of combinatorial therapies incorporating anthracyclines and agents that target the HER2-mediated signaling pathway, such as trastuzumab. In this regard, HER2-targeted liposomal doxorubicin was developed to provide clinical benefit by both reducing the cardiotoxicity observed with anthracyclines and enhancing the therapeutic potential of HER2-based therapies that are currently available for HER2-overexpressing cancers. While documenting the enhanced therapeutic potential of HER2-targeted liposomal doxorubicin can be done with existing models, there has been no validated human cardiac cell-based assay system to rigorously assess the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines. To understand if HER2-targeting of liposomal doxorubicin is possible with a favorable cardiac safety profile, we applied a human stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte platform to evaluate the doxorubicin exposure of human cardiac cells to HER2-targeted liposomal doxorubicin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known application of a stem cell-derived system for evaluating preclinical cardiotoxicity of an investigational agent. We demonstrate that HER2-targeted liposomal doxorubicin has little or no uptake into human cardiomyocytes, does not inhibit HER2-mediated signaling, results in little or no evidence of cardiomyocyte cell death or dysfunction, and retains the low penetration into heart tissue of liposomal doxorubicin.

{"title": "The role of lipooligosaccharide phosphorylcholine in colonization and pathogenesis of Histophilus somni in cattle.", "abstract": "Histophilus somni is a Gram-negative bacterium and member of the Pasteurellaceae that is responsible for respiratory disease and other systemic infections in cattle. One of the bacterium's virulence factors is antigenic phase variation of its lipooligosaccharide (LOS). LOS antigenic variation may occur through variation in composition or structure of glycoses or their substitutions, such as phosphorylcholine (ChoP). However, the role of ChoP in the pathogenesis of H. somni disease has not been established. In Haemophilus influenzae ChoP on the LOS binds to platelet activating factor on epithelial cells, promoting bacterial colonization of the host upper respiratory tract. However, ChoP is not expressed in the blood as it also binds C-reactive protein, resulting in complement activation and killing of the bacteria. In order to simulate the susceptibility of calves with suppressed immunity due to stress or previous infection, calves were challenged with bovine herpes virus-1 or dexamethazone 3\u2009days prior to challenge with H. somni. Following challenge, expression of ChoP on the LOS of 2 different H. somni strains was associated with colonization of the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, lack of ChoP expression was associated with bacteria recovered from systemic sites. Histopathology of cardiac tissue from myocarditis revealed lesions containing bacterial clusters that appeared similar to a biofilm. Furthermore, some respiratory cultures contained substantial numbers of Pasteurella multocida, which were not present on preculture screens. Subsequent biofilm experiments have shown that H. somni and P. multocida grow equally well together in a biofilm, suggesting a commensal relationship may exist between the two species. Our results also showed that ChoP contributed to, but was not required for, adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells. In conclusion, expression of ChoP on H. somni LOS contributed to colonization of the bacteria to the host upper respiratory tract, but phase variable loss of ChoP expression may help the bacteria survive systemically.", "journal": "Veterinary research", "date": "2012-06-09", "authors": ["Shaadi FElswaifi", "William KScarratt", "Thomas JInzana"], "doi": "10.1186/1297-9716-43-49\n10.1111/j.1365-3083.1988.tb02424.x\n10.1006/mpat.1996.0086\n10.1128/IAI.69.3.1650-1660.2001\n10.1016/j.micinf.2008.11.011\n10.1128/IAI.70.9.4870-4879.2002\n10.1016/j.micpath.2009.08.001\n10.1084/jem.187.4.631\n10.1128/IAI.68.8.4593-4597.2000\n10.1080/00016480802468195\n10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01952.x\n10.1046/j.1462-5822.2001.00132.x\n10.1128/IAI.74.3.1828-1836.2006\n10.1128/JB.00532-07\n10.1016/j.micpath.2004.10.006\n10.1186/1297-9716-43-21\n10.1136/vr.116.8.215\n10.1128/IAI.01177-06\n10.1017/S1466252307001417\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18102.x\n10.1016/S0923-2508(00)00174-1\n10.1128/IAI.00741-07\n10.1128/IAI.68.9.5416-5419.2000\n10.1128/JB.00948-07\n10.1099/00222615-44-1-35\n10.1354/vp.08-VP-0332-O-DEX\n10.1128/IAI.01691-06\n10.1016/S0378-1135(03)00020-8\n10.1128/IAI.00614-06\n10.1016/j.micpath.2005.08.002\n10.1016/S0021-9975(08)80031-X\n10.1128/JB.00479-07"}

{"title": "CXCR4 gene transfer prevents pressure overload induced heart failure.", "abstract": "Stem cell and gene therapies are being pursued as strategies for repairing damaged cardiac tissue following myocardial infarction in an attempt to prevent heart failure. The chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) and its ligand, CXCL12, play a critical role in stem cell recruitment post-acute myocardial infarction. Whereas progenitor cell migration via the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is well characterized, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of CXCR4 mediated modulation of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. We used gene therapy to test the effects of CXCR4 gene delivery on adverse ventricular remodeling due to pressure overload. We assessed the effect of cardiac overexpression of CXCR4 during trans-aortic constriction (TAC) using a cardiotropic adeno-associated viral vector (AAV9) carrying the CXCR4 gene. Cardiac overexpression of CXCR4 in mice with pressure overload prevented ventricular remodeling, preserved capillary density and maintained function as determined by echocardiography and in vivo hemodynamics. In isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes, CXCL12 treatment prevented isoproterenol induced hypertrophy and interrupted the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. Finally, a complex involving the L-type calcium channel, \u03b22-adrenoceptor, and CXCR4 (Cav1.2/\u03b22AR/CXCR4) was identified in healthy cardiac myocytes and was shown to dissociate as a consequence of heart failure. CXCR4 administered to the heart via gene transfer prevents pressure overload induced heart failure. The identification of CXCR4 participation in a Cav1.2-\u03b22AR regulatory complex provides further insight into the mechanism by which CXCR4 modulates calcium homeostasis and chronic pressure overload responses in the cardiac myocyte.

{"title": "Short-term therapy with simvastatin reduces inflammatory mediators and heart inflammation during the acute phase of experimental Chagas disease.", "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi infection induces progressive cardiac inflammation that leads to fibrosis and modifications in the heart architecture and functionality. Statins, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been studied due to their pleiotropic roles in modulating the inflammatory response. Our goal was to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on the cardiac inflammatory process using a cardiotropic strain of T. cruzi in a murine model of Chagas cardiomyopathy. C57BL/6 mice were infected with 500 trypomastigotes of the Colombian strain of T. cruzi and treated with an oral dose of simvastatin (20 mg/Kg/day) for one month and inflammatory and morphometric parameters were subsequently evaluated in the serum and in the heart, respectively. Simvastatin reduced the total cholesterol and inflammatory mediators (interferon-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, CCL2 and CCL5) in the serum and in the heart tissue at 30 days post-infection. Additionally, a proportional reduction in heart weight and inflammatory infiltration was observed. Simvastatin also reduced epimastigote proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and was able to reduce blood trypomastigotes and heart amastigote nests during the acute phase of Chagas disease in vivo. Based on these data, we conclude that simvastatin exerts a modulatory effect on the inflammatory mediators that are elicited by the Colombian strain of T. cruzi and ameliorates the heart damage that is observed in a murine model of Chagas disease.", "journal": "Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz", "date": "2012-06-06", "authors": ["Rafael RodriguesSilva", "DeenaShrestha-Bajracharya", "Camila MegaleAlmeida-Leite", "R\u00f4muloLeite", "Maria TerezinhaBahia", "AndreTalvani"], "doi": "10.1590/s0074-02762012000400012"}

{"title": "Thick acellular heart extracellular matrix with inherent vasculature: a potential platform for myocardial tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "The decellularization of porcine heart tissue offers many opportunities for the production of physiologically relevant myocardial mimetic scaffolds. Earlier, we reported the successful isolation of a thin porcine cardiac extracellular matrix (pcECM) exhibiting relevant bio-mechanical properties for myocardial tissue engineering. Nevertheless, since native cardiac tissue is much thicker, such thin scaffolds may offer limited regeneration capacity. However, generation of thicker myocardial mimetic tissue constructs is hindered by diffusion limitations (~100 \u03bcm), and the lack of a proper vascular-like network within these constructs. In our present work, we focused on optimizing the decellularization procedure for thicker tissue slabs (10-15 mm), while retaining their inherent vasculature, and on characterizing the resulting pcECM. The trypsin/Triton-based perfusion procedure that resulted in a nonimmunogenic and cell-supportive pcECM was found to be more effective in cell removal and in the preservation of fiber morphology and structural characteristics than stirring, sonication, or sodium dodecyl sulfate/Triton-based procedures. Mass spectroscopy revealed that the pcECM is mainly composed of ECM proteins with no apparent cellular protein remains. Mechanical testing indicated that the obtained pcECM is viscoelastic in nature and possesses the typical stress-strain profile of biological materials. It is stiffer than native tissue yet exhibits matched mechanical properties in terms of energy dissipation, toughness, and ultimate stress behavior. Vascular network functionality was maintained to the first three-four branches from the main coronary vessels. Taken together, these results reaffirm the efficiency of the decellularization procedure reported herein for yielding thick nonimmunogenic cell-supportive pcECM scaffolds, preserving both native tissue ultra-structural properties and an inherent vascular network.

{"title": "An oxygen release system to augment cardiac progenitor cell survival and differentiation under hypoxic condition.", "abstract": "Stem cell therapy has the potential to regenerate heart tissue damaged by myocardial infarction (MI), but it experiences extremely low efficacy. One of the major causes is the inferior cell survival under hypoxic condition of the infarcted hearts. We examined whether an oxygen-releasing system capable of sustainedly supplying oxygen to stem cells would augment cell survival and cardiac differentiation under hypoxic condition mimicking that of the infarcted hearts. The oxygen-releasing system consisted of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-releasing microspheres, catalase and an injectable, thermosensitive hydrogel. The microspheres were based on poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and a complex of H(2)O(2) and poly(2-vinlypyrridione) (PVP). The oxygen was generated after the released H(2)O(2) was decomposed by catalase. The hydrogel was designed to improve the retention of microspheres and stem cells in the beating heart tissue during myocardial injection. The oxygen-releasing system was capable of sustainedly releasing oxygen for at least two weeks. The release kinetics was dependent on the ratio of H(2)O(2)/VP. The hydrogel was based on N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm), acrylic acid (AAc), and a macromer hydroxyethyl methacrylate-oligo(hydroxybutyrate) (HEMA-oHB). The hydrogel had a stiffness matching that of the heart tissue and was able to stimulate the cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Under hypoxic condition mimicking that of the infarcted hearts (1% O(2)), CDCs encapsulated in the hydrogel experienced massive cell death. Introduction of oxygen release in the hydrogel significantly augmented cell survival; no cell death was found after seven days of culture, and cells even grew after seven days. Under hypoxic condition, cardiac differentiation of CDCs was completely silenced in the hydrogel, as confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels. However, introduction of oxygen release restored the differentiation.

Clinical evidence demonstrates that MR antagonism is protective even when plasma aldosterone levels are not increased. We hypothesize that MR activation in macrophages drives the profibrotic phenotype in the heart even when aldosterone levels are not elevated. The aim of the present study was to establish the role of macrophage MR signaling in mediating cardiac tissue remodeling caused by nitric oxide (NO) deficiency, a mineralocorticoid-independent insult. Male wild-type (MRflox/flox) and macrophage MR-knockout (MRflox/flox/LysMCre/+; mac-MRKO) mice were uninephrectomized, maintained on 0.9% NaCl drinking solution, with either vehicle (control) or the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 150 mg/kg/d) for 8 wk. NO deficiency increased systolic blood pressure at 4 wk in wild-type L-NAME/salt-treated mice compared with all other groups. At 8 wk, systolic blood pressure was increased above control in both L-NAME/salt treated wild-type and mac-MRKO mice by approximately 28 mm Hg by L-NAME/salt. Recruitment of macrophages was increased 2- to 3-fold in both L-NAME/salt treated wild-type and mac-MRKO. Inducible NOS positive macrophage infiltration and TNF\u03b1 mRNA expression was greater in wild-type L-NAME/salt-treated mice compared with mac-MRKO, demonstrating that loss of MR reduces M1 phenotype. mRNA levels for markers of vascular inflammation and oxidative stress (NADPH oxidase 2, p22phox, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, G protein-coupled chemokine receptor 5) were similar in treated wild-type and mac-MRKO mice compared with control groups. In contrast, L-NAME/salt treatment increased interstitial collagen deposition in wild-type by about 33% but not in mac-MRKO mice. mRNA levels for connective tissue growth factor and collagen III were also increased above control treatment in wild-type (1.931 \u00b1 0.215 vs. 1 \u00b1 0.073) but not mac-MRKO mice (1.403 \u00b1 0.150 vs. 1.286 \u00b1 0.255).

In particular, the passive mechanical properties of the myocardium are described by the Holzapfel-Ogden relation, whereas the activation model is based on the concept of active strain. There, an incompatible intermediate configuration is considered, which entails a multiplicative decomposition between active and passive deformation gradients. The underlying Euler-Lagrange equations for minimizing the total energy are written in terms of these deformation factors, where the active part is assumed to depend, at the cell level, on the electrodynamics and on the specific orientation of the cardiomyocytes. The active strain formulation is compared with the classical active stress model from both numerical and modeling perspectives. The well-posedness of the linear system derived from a generic Newton iteration of the original problem is analyzed, and different mechanical activation functions are considered. Taylor-Hood and MINI finite elements are used in the discretization of the overall mechanical problem. The results of several numerical experiments show that the proposed formulation is mathematically consistent and is able to represent the main features of the phenomenon, while allowing savings in computational costs.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2012-06-01", "authors": ["SimoneRossi", "RicardoRuiz-Baier", "Luca FPavarino", "AlfioQuarteroni"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.2473"}
{"title": "Comparison of Atlantic salmon individuals with different outcomes of cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS).", "abstract": "Cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) is a severe disease of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) associated with significant economic losses in the aquaculture industry. CMS is diagnosed with a severe inflammation and degradation of myocardial tissue caused by a double-stranded RNA virus named piscine myocarditis virus (PMCV), with structural similarities to the Totiviridae family. In the present study we characterized individual host responses and genomic determinants of different disease outcomes.\nFrom time course studies of experimentally infected Atlantic salmon post-smolts, fish exhibited different outcomes of infection and disease. High responder (HR) fish were characterized with sustained and increased viral load and pathology in heart tissue. Low responder (LR) fish showed declining viral load from 6-10 weeks post infection (wpi) and absence of pathology. Global gene expression (SIQ2.0 oligonucleotide microarray) in HR and LR hearts during infection was compared, in order to characterize differences in the host response and to identify genes with expression patterns that could explain or predict the different outcomes of disease. Virus-responsive genes involved in early antiviral and innate immune responses were upregulated equally in LR and HR at the first stage (2-4 wpi), reflecting the initial increase in virus replication. Repression of heart muscle development was identified by gene ontology enrichment analyses, indicating the early onset of pathology. By six weeks both responder groups had comparable viral load, while increased pathology was observed in HR fish. This was reflected by induced expression of genes implicated in apoptosis and cell death mechanisms, presumably related to lymphocyte regulation and survival. In contrast, LR fish showed earlier activation of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. At the late stage of infection, increased pathology and viral load in HR was accompanied by a broad activation of genes involved in adaptive immunity and particularly T cell responses, probably reflecting the increased infiltration and homing of virus-specific T cells to the infected heart. This was in sharp contrast to LR fish, where recovery and reduced viral load was associated with a significantly reduced transcription of adaptive immunity genes and activation of genes involved in energy metabolism.\nIn contrast to LR, a stronger and sustained expression of genes involved in adaptive immune responses in heart tissue of HR at the late stage of disease probably reflected the increased lymphocyte infiltration and pathological outcome. In addition to controlled adaptive immunity and activation of genes involved in cardiac energy metabolism in LR at the late stage, recovery of this group could also be related to an earlier activation of NOD-like receptor signaling and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathways.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2012-06-01", "authors": ["GerritTimmerhaus", "AlekseiKrasnov", "HaraldTakle", "SergeyAfanasyev", "P\u00e5lNilsen", "MaritRode", "Sven MartinJ\u00f8rgensen"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-13-205\n10.1136/vr.146.17.500\n10.1128/JVI.02154-10\n10.1186/1471-2164-12-459\n10.1186/1743-422X-7-309\n10.1016/j.cbd.2010.04.006\n10.1128/JVI.78.10.5288-5298.2004\n10.1016/j.bcp.2011.01.011\n10.2177/jsci.29.8\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0128\n10.1128/CVI.00031-07\n10.1186/1742-4690-1-39\n10.1016/j.autrev.2008.07.044\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2010.07.045\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.15.1.749\n10.1086/381501\n10.1006/fsim.1994.1032\n10.1016/j.coi.2010.01.004\n10.1038/nri2802\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2010.00919.x\n10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797\n10.1093/nar/29.9.e45\n10.1007/s10126-005-5164-4\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bth078\n10.1186/1471-2164-9-299\n10.1111/j.1095-8649.2008.01876.x\n10.1093/nar/gkn176\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bti551"}
{"title": "Heart wall myofibers are arranged in minimal surfaces to optimize organ function.", "abstract": "Heart wall myofibers wind as helices around the ventricles, strengthening them in a manner analogous to the reinforcement of concrete cylindrical columns by spiral steel cables [Richart FE, et al. (1929) Univ of Illinois, Eng Exp Stn Bull 190]. A multitude of such fibers, arranged smoothly and regularly, contract and relax as an integrated functional unit as the heart beats. To orchestrate this motion, fiber tangling must be avoided and pumping should be efficient. Current models of myofiber orientation across the heart wall suggest groupings into sheets or bands, but the precise geometry of bundles of myofibers is unknown. Here we show that this arrangement takes the form of a special minimal surface, the generalized helicoid [Blair DE, Vanstone JR (1978) Minimal Submanifolds and Geodesics 13-16], closing the gap between individual myofibers and their collective wall structure. The model holds across species, with a smooth variation in its three curvature parameters within the myocardial wall providing tight fits to diffusion magnetic resonance images from the rat, the dog, and the human. Mathematically it explains how myofibers are bundled in the heart wall while economizing fiber length and optimizing ventricular ejection volume as they contract. The generalized helicoid provides a unique foundation for analyzing the fibrous composite of the heart wall and should therefore find applications in heart tissue engineering and in the study of heart muscle diseases.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2012-05-31", "authors": ["PeterSavadjiev", "Gustav JStrijkers", "Adrianus JBakermans", "EmmanuelPiuze", "Steven WZucker", "KaleemSiddiqi"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1120785109\n10.1109/ICCV.2007.4409086"}

Male Sprague Dawley rats were pretreated with LYC (4mg/kg, p.o.) once daily for 21 days. After the treatment period, ISO (85mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously, once daily, to rats for 2 days. Hemodynamic parameters, cardiac marker enzymes, antioxidant, and oxidative stress parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured. ISO treated rats showed significant changes in heart rates, heart weights and serum lipid profiles. The activity of aspartate aminotranferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) were increased significantly (p<0.01) in the serum of ISO rats. The levels of lipid peroxides (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS), protein carbonyl content (PCC) and neutrophil infiltration marker; myeloperoxidase (MPO) were significantly (p<0.01) increased. In addition, the activities of lysosomal enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and cathepsin-d) in the serum and heart of ISO rats were increased significantly. Furthermore, a marked decrease in the levels of serum and cardiac reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C and cardiac enzymatic antioxidants; superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) were observed. In vitro study confirmed the strong antioxidant effect of LYC on total antioxidant activity. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that LYC supplementation to ISO rats significantly ameliorated lysosomal membrane damage as well as the alterations in cardiac enzymes, lipid profile and oxidative stress markers. These findings revealed the cardioprotective effects of LYC against ISO-induced oxidative stress and cardiotoxicity in rats.

It has become increasingly apparent that cardiac transcription factors also play critical roles in the regulation of expression of many functional genes in the prenatal and postnatal hearts. Accordingly, mutations of cardiac transcription factors cannot only result in congenital heart defects but also alter heart function thereby predisposing to heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias. In this review, we summarize the roles of Iroquois homeobox (Irx) family of transcription factors in heart development and function. In all, 6 Irx genes are expressed with distinct and overlapping patterns in the mammalian heart.

The ability to derive patient-specific human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) may provide a solution to these challenges. We aimed to derive hiPSCs from heart failure (HF) patients, to induce their cardiomyocyte differentiation, to characterize the generated hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and to evaluate their ability to integrate with pre-existing cardiac tissue.\nDermal fibroblasts from two HF patients were reprogrammed by retroviral delivery of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 or by using an excisable polycistronic lentiviral vector. The resulting HF-hiPSCs displayed adequate reprogramming properties and could be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes with the same efficiency as control hiPSCs (derived from human foreskin fibroblasts). Gene expression and immunostaining studies confirmed the cardiomyocyte phenotype of the differentiating HF-hiPSC-CMs. Multi-electrode array recordings revealed the development of a functional cardiac syncytium and adequate chronotropic responses to adrenergic and cholinergic stimulation. Next, functional integration and synchronized electrical activities were demonstrated between hiPSC-CMs and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in co-culture studies. Finally, in vivo transplantation studies in the rat heart revealed the ability of the HF-hiPSC-CMs to engraft, survive, and structurally integrate with host cardiomyocytes.\nHuman-induced pluripotent stem cells can be established from patients with advanced heart failure and coaxed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, which can integrate with host cardiac tissue.

ZDF\u2009+\u2009Ins (n\u2009=\u20096) were treated with insulin for the last 6\u2009weeks of life. Gene expression of Ca2+ ATPase in the cardiac sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SERCA2a, further abbreviated as SERCA) and phospholamban (PLB) were determined by northern blotting. Ca2+ transport of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR) was assessed by oxalate-facilitated 45Ca-uptake in left ventricular homogenates. In addition, isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes were stimulated in cell culture with insulin, glucose or triiodthyronine (T3, positive control). mRNA expression of SERCA and PLB were measured by Taqman PCR. Furthermore, effects of insulin treatment on force of contraction and relaxation were evaluated by cardiomyocytes grown in a three-dimensional collagen matrix (engineered heart tissue, EHT) stimulated for 5\u2009days by insulin.

The increase in the SERCA/PLB ratio in ZDF and ZDF\u2009\u00b1\u2009Ins was accompanied by enhanced Ca2+ uptake to the SR (control 1.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 vs. ZDF 1.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06* vs. ZDF\u2009+\u2009Ins 2.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1* \u03bcg/mg/min, *p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. control). Interestingly, there was a significant correlation between Ca2+ uptake and SERCA2a expression. As shown by in-vitro experiments, the effect of insulin on SERCA2a mRNA expression seemed to have a direct effect on cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, long-term treatment of engineered heart tissue with insulin increased the SERCA/PLB ratio and accelerated relaxation time. Akt was significantly phosphorylated by insulin. This effect could be abolished by wortmannin.\nThe current data demonstrate that early type 2 diabetes is associated with an increase in the SERCA/PLB ratio and that insulin directly stimulates SERCA expression and relaxation velocity.

{"title": "Dietary Yucca schidigera supplementation reduces arsenic-induced oxidative stress in Swiss albino mice.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of dietary supplementation with Yucca schidigera (Ys) on lipid peroxidation (LPO), antioxidant activity, some biochemical parameters and histopathological changes in arsenic-exposed mice. Forty Swiss albino male mice were divided into five equal groups. Group I (control group) was given normal diet and tap water for 28 days. Group II (arsenic group) was given normal diet and 100 mg/L arsenic along with drinking water for 28 days. Groups III-V were given three different doses of Ys (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) in supplemented diet and arsenic (100 mg/L) along with drinking water throughout the entire period of 28 days. The arsenic significantly increased serum biochemical parameters and malondialdehyde levels in blood and tissue. However, arsenic significantly decreased tissue glutathione concentration, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. In contrast, dietary supplementation of Ys, in a dose-dependent manner, resulted in reversal of arsenic-induced oxidative stress, LPO and activities of antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, Ys also exhibited protective action against the arsenic-induced focal gliosis and hyperemi in brain, necrosis and degeneration in liver, degeneration and dilatation in Bowman's capsule of kidney and hyaline degeneration in heart tissue of mice. Consequently, our results demonstrate that Ys especially high-dose supplementation in diet decreases arsenic-induced oxidative stress and enhances the antioxidant defence mechanism and regenerate of tissues in Swiss albino mice.", "journal": "Toxicology and industrial health", "date": "2012-05-23", "authors": ["SinanInce", "IsmailKucukkurt", "RuhiTurkmen", "Hasan HuseyinDemirel", "EmineSever"], "doi": "10.1177/0748233712446730"}

The aim of this work was to characterize cardiac changes and inflammatory cell types associated with a clinical HSMI outbreak in Atlantic salmon using immunohistochemistry. Different immune cells and cardiac tissue responses associated with the disease were identified using different markers. The spectrum of inflammatory cells associated with the cardiac pathology consisted of mainly CD3(+) T lymphocytes, moderate numbers of macrophages and eosinophilic granulocytes. Proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immuno-reaction identified significantly increased nuclear and cytoplasmic staining as well as identifying hypertrophic nuclei. Strong immunostaining was observed for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II in HSMI hearts. Although low in number, a few positive cells in diseased hearts were detected using the mature myeloid cell line granulocytes/monocytes antibody indicating more positive cells in diseased than non-diseased hearts. The recombinant tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) antibody identified stained macrophage-like cells and endothelial cells around lesions in addition to eosinophilic granular cells (EGCs). These findings suggested that the inflammatory response in diseased hearts comprised of mostly CD3(+) T lymphocytes and eosinophilic granular cells and hearts exhibited high cell turnover where DNA damage/repair might be the case (as identified by PCNA, caspase 3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labeling (TUNEL) reactivity).", "journal": "Fish & shellfish immunology", "date": "2012-05-23", "authors": ["Muhammad NaveedYousaf", "Erling OlafKoppang", "KarstenSkj\u00f8dt", "BerndK\u00f6llner", "IvarHordvik", "JunZou", "ChrisSecombes", "Mark DPowell"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fsi.2012.05.008"}

PCRs are alternative methods, more sensitive than conventional parasitological techniques, which due to their low sensitivities are considered unsuitable for these purposes. The aim of this study was to investigate a sensitive diagnostic strategy to quantify blood and cardiac tissues parasites based on real-time PCR tools during acute and chronic phases of murine Chagas disease, as well as to monitor the evolution of infection in those mice under specific treatment. In parallel, fresh blood examination, immunological analysis and quantification of cardiac inflammation were also performed to confront and improve real-time PCR data. Similar profiles of parasitemia curves were observed in both quantification techniques during the acute phase of the infection. In contrast, parasites could be quantified only by real-time PCR at 60 and 120 days of infection. In cardiac tissue, real-time PCR detected T. cruzi DNA in 100% of infected mice, and using this tool a significant Pearson correlation between parasite load in peripheral blood and in cardiac tissue during acute and chronic phases was observed. Levels of serum CCL2, CCL5 and nitric oxide were coincident with parasite load but focal and diffuse mononuclear infiltrates was observed, even with significant (p<0.05) reduction of parasitism after 60 days of infection. Later, this methodology was used to monitor the evolution of infection in animals treated with itraconazole (Itz). Itz-treatment induced a reduction of parasite load in both blood and cardiac muscle at the treatment period, but after the end of chemotherapy an increase of parasitism was detected. Interestingly, inflammatory mediators levels and heart inflammation intensity had similar evolution to the parasite load, in the group of animals treated. Taken together, our data show that real-time PCR strategy used was suitable for studies of murine T. cruzi infection and may prove useful in investigations involving experimental chemotherapy of the disease and the benefits of treatment in relation to parasitism and inflammatory response.", "journal": "Acta tropica", "date": "2012-05-23", "authors": ["S\u00e9rgioCaldas", "Ivo SantanaCaldas", "L\u00edvia de FigueiredoDiniz", "Wanderson Geraldo deLima", "Riva de PaulaOliveira", "Alzira BatistaCec\u00edlio", "IsabelaRibeiro", "Andr\u00e9Talvani", "Maria TerezinhaBahia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.05.002"}
{"title": "Controlling the contractile strength of engineered cardiac muscle by hierarchal tissue architecture.", "abstract": "The heart is a muscular organ with a wrapping, laminar structure embedded with neural and vascular networks, collagen fibrils, fibroblasts, and cardiac myocytes that facilitate contraction. We hypothesized that these non-muscle components may have functional benefit, serving as important structural alignment cues in inter- and intra-cellular organization of cardiac myocytes. Previous studies have demonstrated that alignment of engineered myocardium enhances calcium handling, but how this impacts actual force generation remains unclear. Quantitative assays are needed to determine the effect of alignment on contractile function and muscle physiology. To test this, micropatterned surfaces were used to build 2-dimensional myocardium from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with distinct architectures: confluent isotropic (serving as the unaligned control), confluent anisotropic, and 20\u00a0\u03bcm spaced, parallel arrays of multicellular myocardial fibers. We combined image analysis of sarcomere orientation with muscular thin film contractile force assays in order to calculate the peak sarcomere-generated stress as a function of tissue architecture. Here we report that increasing peak systolic stress in engineered cardiac tissues corresponds with increasing sarcomere alignment. This change is larger than would be anticipated from enhanced calcium handling and increased uniaxial alignment alone. These results suggest that boundary conditions (heterogeneities) encoded in the extracellular space can regulate muscle tissue function, and that structural organization and cytoskeletal alignment are critically important for maximizing peak force generation.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2012-05-19", "authors": ["Adam WFeinberg", "Patrick WAlford", "HongweiJin", "Crystal MRipplinger", "Andreas AWerdich", "Sean PSheehy", "AnnaGrosberg", "Kevin KitParker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.043"}

High nitric oxide (NO) levels have been shown to be associated with cardiomyopathy severity in patients. Further, NO produced via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) is proposed to play a role in Trypanosoma cruzi control. However, the participation of iNOS/NOS2 and NO in T. cruzi control and heart injury has been questioned. Here, using chronically infected rhesus monkeys and iNOS/NOS2-deficient (Nos2(-/-)) mice we explored the participation of iNOS/NOS2-derived NO in heart injury in T. cruzi infection.\nRhesus monkeys and C57BL/6 and Nos2(-/-) mice were infected with the Colombian T. cruzi strain. Parasite DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction, T. cruzi antigens and iNOS/NOS2(+) cells were immunohistochemically detected in heart sections and NO levels in serum were determined by Griess reagent. Heart injury was assessed by electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), creatine kinase heart isoenzyme (CK-MB) activity levels in serum and connexin 43 (Cx43) expression in the cardiac tissue.\nChronically infected monkeys presented conduction abnormalities, cardiac inflammation and fibrosis, which resembled the spectrum of human chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC). Importantly, chronic myocarditis was associated with parasite persistence. Moreover, Cx43 loss and increased CK-MB activity levels were primarily correlated with iNOS/NOS2(+) cells infiltrating the cardiac tissue and NO levels in serum. Studies in Nos2(-/-) mice reinforced that the iNOS/NOS2-NO pathway plays a pivotal role in T. cruzi-elicited cardiomyocyte injury and in conduction abnormalities that were associated with Cx43 loss in the cardiac tissue.\nT. cruzi-infected rhesus monkeys reproduce features of CCC. Moreover, our data support that in T. cruzi infection persistent parasite-triggered iNOS/NOS2 in the cardiac tissue and NO overproduction might contribute to CCC severity, mainly disturbing of the molecular pathway involved in electrical synchrony.

{"title": "High molecular weight calmodulin-binding protein: 20 years onwards-a potential therapeutic calpain inhibitor.", "abstract": "Apoptosis in cardiovascular diseases is considered to be a major reason for heart failure. Caspase-independent apoptosis due to calpains and other proteases occurs due to increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels which act on a feed-forward mechanism. Calpains are Ca(2+)-activated cysteine proteases present in the cytosol as inactive proenzymes. Calpastatin is most efficient and specific calpain inhibitor present in vivo. Earlier, we had reported the expression of novel high molecular weight calmodulin-binding protein (HMWCaMBP) in human and animal cardiac tissue and in very minute quantities in brains and lungs. HMWCaMBP showed calpastatin activity and was also found to be highly homologous to calpastatin I and calpastatin II. Decreased expression of HMWCaMBP was observed during ischemia as it is susceptible to proteolysis by calpains during ischemia-reperfusion. In normal myocardium, HMWCaMBP may protect its substrate from calpains. However, during an early stage of ischemia/reperfusion due to increased Ca(2+) influx, calpain activity often exceeds HMWCaMBP activity. This leads to proteolysis of HMWCaMBP and other protein substrates, resulting in cellular damage. The role of HMWCaMBP in ischemia/reperfusion is yet to be elucidated.

In this paper we specifically investigate the electroelastic pinning-unpinning mechanism in order to include cardiac contraction in the preexisting theoretically modeled defibrillation scenarios. Based on a two-dimensional minimal electromechanical model, we show numerically the existence of an unpinning band characterized by the size of the obstacle, the pacing site, and the frequency.

The hydrogel was highly flexible at body temperature with breaking strain >1000% and Young's modulus 45 kPa. When MSCs were encapsulated in the hydrogel and cultured under normal culture conditions (10% FBS and 21% O(2)), the cells differentiated into cardiomyocyte-like cells. However, the differentiation was retarded, and even diminished, under low nutrient and low oxygen conditions, which are typical of the infarcted heart. We hypothesized that enhancing MSC survival under low nutrient and low oxygen conditions would restore the differentiation. To enhance cell survival, a pro-survival growth factor (bFGF) was loaded in the hydrogel. bFGF was able to sustainedly release from the hydrogel for 21 days. Under the low nutrient and low oxygen conditions (1% O(2) and 1% FBS), bFGF enhanced MSC survival and differentiation in the hydrogel. After 14 days of culture, survival of 70.5% of MSCs remained in the bFGF-loaded hydrogel, while only 4.9% of MSCs remained in the hydrogel without bFGF. The differentiation toward cardiomyocyte-like cells was completely inhibited at 1% FBS and 1% oxygen. Loading bFGF in the hydrogel restored the differentiation, as confirmed by the expression of cardiac markers at both the gene (MEF2C and CACNA1c) and protein (cTnI and connexin 43) levels. bFGF loading also up-regulated the paracrine effect of MSCs.

Recently, the expression of several inhibitory receptors has been associated with T cell dysfunction and exhaustion. In this study, we have examined the expression of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor 1 (LIR-1) by peripheral T. cruzi antigen-responsive IFN-gamma (IFN-\u03b3)-producing and total T cells from chronically T. cruzi-infected subjects with different clinical forms of the disease. CTAL-4 expression was also evaluated in heart tissue sections from subjects with severe myocarditis. The majority of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4(+) T cells responsive to a parasite lysate preparation were found to express CTLA-4 but considerably lower frequencies express LIR-1, irrespective of the clinical status of the donor. Conversely, few IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells responsive to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids expressed CTLA-4 and LIR-1. Polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3 antibodies induced higher frequencies of CD4(+)CTAL-4(+) T cells in patients with severe heart disease than in asymptomatic subjects. Ligation of CTLA-4 and LIR-1 with their agonistic antibodies, in vitro, reduces IFN-\u03b3 production. Conversely, CTLA-4 blockade did not improved IFN-\u03b3 production in response to T. cruzi antigens. Subjects with chronic T. cruzi infection had increased numbers of CD4(+)LIR-1(+) among total peripheral blood mononuclear cells, relative to uninfected individuals and these numbers decreased after treatment with benznidazole. CTLA-4 was also expressed by CD3(+) T lymphocytes infiltrating heart tissues from chronically infected subjects with severe myocarditis.

The present study investigates the ability of Aegle marmelos fruit extract to prevent pathological changes and oxidative stress after isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction in rats. In vitro studies showed that Aegle marmelos fruit extract possesses antioxidant activity. Administration of isoproterenol (85\u00a0mg/kg body weight) to rats resulted in significantly elevated plasma transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase, however, cardiac tissue analyses showed decreased activity of the above enzymes compared to experimental control rats. Further, isoproterenol administration significantly increased plasma and cardiac tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lowered the activities of cardiac tissue superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase when compared to control groups. Pretreatment with Aegle marmelos fruit extract at a dose of 150\u00a0mg/kg body weight for a period of 45 days significantly prevented the observed alterations. Our data suggest that Aegle marmelos fruit extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and elevating antioxidants status in isoproterenol treated rats.

Petrolisthes cinctipes is a temperate mid-high intertidal zone crab species that can experience wintertime habitat temperatures below the freezing point of seawater. We examined how cold tolerance changed during the initial phase of thermal acclimation to cold and warm temperatures, as well as the persistence of cold tolerance during long-term thermal acclimation. Thermal acclimation for as little as 6 h at 8\u00b0C enhanced cold tolerance during a 1 h exposure to -2\u00b0C relative to crabs acclimated to 18\u00b0C. Potential mechanisms for this enhanced tolerance were elucidated using cDNA microarrays to probe for differences in gene expression in cardiac tissue of warm- and cold-acclimated crabs during the first day of thermal acclimation. No changes in gene expression were detected until 12 h of thermal acclimation. Genes strongly upregulated in warm-acclimated crabs represented immune response and extracellular/intercellular processes, suggesting that warm-acclimated crabs had a generalized stress response and may have been remodelling tissues or altering intercellular processes. Genes strongly upregulated in cold-acclimated crabs included many that are involved in glucose production, suggesting that cold acclimation involves increasing intracellular glucose as a cryoprotectant. Structural cytoskeletal proteins were also strongly represented among the genes upregulated in only cold-acclimated crabs. There were no consistent changes in composition or the level of unsaturation of membrane phospholipid fatty acids with cold acclimation, which suggests that neither short- nor long-term changes in cold tolerance are mediated by changes in membrane fatty acid composition. Overall, our study demonstrates that initial changes in cold tolerance are likely not regulated by transcriptomic responses, but that gene-expression-related changes in homeostasis begin within 12 h, the length of a tidal cycle.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2012-05-11", "authors": ["DariaRonges", "Jillian PWalsh", "Brent JSinclair", "Jonathon HStillman"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.069658"}

Male myocardium demonstrates greater loss in cardiac function in the presence of a given TNF level compared to female. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that estrogen has little influence on reducing TNF-caused myocardial dysfunction in female hearts, suggesting that male hormone - testosterone may be responsible for gender differences in TNF-mediated myocardial damage. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesize that endogenous testosterone plays a detrimental role in TNF-induced myocardial injury in male hearts.\nIsolated mouse hearts from age-matched adult males, females, castrated males and males treated with androgen receptor blocker-flutamide were subjected to 45 minutes of TNF infusion via a Langendorff model. Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and heart rate were continuously recorded. After TNF infusion, heart tissue was analyzed for myocardial levels of caspase-8 and caspase-3 by Western blot assay.\nTNF infusion significantly depressed LVDP, but not heart rate in males. Myocardial rate pressure product (RPP, LVDP*heart rate) was markedly decreased in male hearts compared to females in exposure to TNF, which was associated with higher levels of TNF-induced caspase-8 and caspase-3. Importantly, depletion of endogenous testosterone by castration or blockade of androgen receptor by flutamide treatment abolished TNF-decreased RPP in male hearts. However, castration or flutamide treatment did not affect TNF production and myocardial expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2.\nOur study shows that testosterone is critical to the gender difference in TNF-induced detrimental effects on myocardium.

The F344 recipients accepted the F344/EGFPTg transplants, whereas they rejected the cardiac tissue from the F344/HLA-B27Tg rats by 39.4 \u00b1 6.5 days, due to high production of anti-HLA-B27 IgM- and IgG-specific antibodies.

{"title": "Spatiotemporally controlled cardiac conduction block using high-frequency electrical stimulation.", "abstract": "Methods for the electrical inhibition of cardiac excitation have long been sought to control excitability and conduction, but to date remain largely impractical. High-amplitude alternating current (AC) stimulation has been known to extend cardiac action potentials (APs), and has been recently exploited to terminate reentrant arrhythmias by producing reversible conduction blocks. Yet, low-amplitude currents at similar frequencies have been shown to entrain cardiac tissues by generation of repetitive APs, leading in some cases to ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamic collapse in vivo. Therefore, an inhibition method that does not lead to entrainment - irrespective of the stimulation amplitude (bound to fluctuate in an in vivo setting) - is highly desirable.\nWe investigated the effects of broader amplitude and frequency ranges on the inhibitory effects of extracellular AC stimulation on HL-1 cardiomyocytes cultured on microelectrode arrays, using both sinusoidal and square waveforms. Our results indicate that, at sufficiently high frequencies, cardiac tissue exhibits a binary response to stimulus amplitude with either prolonged APs or no effect, thereby effectively avoiding the risks of entrainment by repetitive firing observed at lower frequencies. We further demonstrate the ability to precisely define reversible local conduction blocks in beating cultures without influencing the propagation activity in non-blocked areas. The conduction blocks were spatiotemporally controlled by electrode geometry and stimuli duration, respectively, and sustainable for long durations (300 s).\nInhibition of cardiac excitation induced by high-frequency AC stimulation exhibits a binary response to amplitude above a threshold frequency, enabling the generation of reversible conduction blocks without the risks of entrainment.

{"title": "Protection of rat cardiac myocytes by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and 2,3-butanedione.", "abstract": "Earlier studies by our group showed that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) enhances the hypothermic preservation of rat cardiac myocytes and the functional recovery of animal hearts after hypothermic storage. However, the mechanisms involved were not clear. We extended the cardiomyocyte studies by testing whether the FBP effects were due to chelation of extracellular calcium, leading to lower intracellular levels. We also tested effects of 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM), pyruvate, and adenine nucleotide precursors. Cardiomyocytes were incubated in ischemic suspension at 3 \u00b0C, and aliquots examined over 48 to 72 hours for retention of rod-shaped morphology, a measure of viability. Cytosolic Ca(2+) levels were measured in some experiments. FBP at 5 mM reduced the death rate even when added after one or two days of incubation. It caused cytosolic calcium levels that were 33% lower than controls in freshly-isolated cells and 70% lower after one day of incubation. EGTA protected against cell death similarly to FBP. These results indicated that one of the mechanisms by which FBP exerts protective effects is through chelation of extracellular calcium. BDM was strongly protective and reduced cytosolic calcium by 30% after one day of incubation. As with FBP, BDM was effective when added after one or two days of incubation. BDM may be useful in combination with FBP in preserving heart tissue. Pyruvate, adenine, and ribose provided little or no protection during hypothermia.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-05-05", "authors": ["Thomas JWheeler", "SufanChien"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035023"}

We aimed to assess the effect of single intratracheal pulmonary exposure to vanadium-rich respirable oil combustion PM (HP-10) on the intrinsic myocardial ischemic tolerance and mitochondrial integrity in rats. The authors subjected isolated heart tissue slices derived from saline or PM-exposed rats to low glucose low oxygen induced ischemia followed by oxygenated condition with glucose supplementation. Mitochondrial structural integrity was determined by TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and functionality by the 3-(4, 5 dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Rats exposed to PM exhibited no apparent inhibition of mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity in oxygenated conditions at 24 or 48 hr post-PM exposure. However, in conditions of simulated ischemia/reoxygenation, these heart slices showed a delayed but consistent and significant decrease in dehydrogenase activity compared to controls at 48 hr after exposure to PM. Electron microscopy revealed significant myocardial mitochondrial injury upon exposure to PM characterized by mitochondrial swelling and fusion. The authors conclude that exposure to soluble vanadium-rich PM induces mitochondrial functional impairment and structural abnormality, which compromises mitochondrial respiration and results in decreased tolerance to ischemia/reoxygenation in rats.", "journal": "Toxicologic pathology", "date": "2012-05-03", "authors": ["EliahuGolomb", "DidiMatza", "Connie ACummings", "HerzlSchwalb", "Urmila PKodavanti", "AvivaSchneider", "EstherHouminer", "AmitKorach", "AbrahamNyska", "Oz MShapira"], "doi": "10.1177/0192623312441409"}

Oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of cardiac dysfunction and injury. Supplementation with \u03b1-tocopherol protects the body against oxidative stress and its related complications. This study was proposed to examine the protective effect of \u03b1-tocopherol against MSG-induced biochemical and histological alterations in blood and cardiac tissue of rats for a period of 180 days.\nChronic oral administration of MSG (4 g kg(-1)) caused oxidative stress that was manifested by significant increase (P < 0.05) in malondialdehyde, conjugated dienes and by the decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase in cardiac tissue. The significantly increased (P < 0.05) activities of aspartate transaminase, creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum suggested a cardiac functional disorder. Moreover, heart muscle fibers showed cloudy swelling, fiber separation and vascular congestion. Administration of \u03b1-tocopherol (200 mg kg(-1)) significantly (P < 0.05) attenuated the MSG-induced biochemical alterations in serum and cardiac tissue. \u03b1-Tocopherol also prevented the pathological changes in cardiac tissue when compared with the MSG-treated group.\nOur findings suggest that \u03b1-tocopherol may have a protective effect against MSG-induced cardiotoxicity, possibly through its antioxidant activity.", "journal": "Journal of the science of food and agriculture", "date": "2012-05-03", "authors": ["SauganthPaul", "AbhilashMohanan", "Mathews VVarghese", "ManjuAlex", "HarikumaranNair"], "doi": "10.1002/jsfa.5714"}

The method is based on the coherence of the second-harmonic backscatter. Because the same signals that are used to construct harmonic B-mode images are also used to construct HSCI images, the benefits obtained with harmonic imaging are also obtained with HSCI. Harmonic imaging has been the primary tool for suppressing clutter in diagnostic ultrasound imaging, however secondharmonic echoes are not necessarily immune to the effects of clutter. HSCI and SLSC imaging are less sensitive to clutter because clutter has low spatial coherence. HSCI shows favorable imaging characteristics such as improved contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), improved speckle SNR, and better delineation of borders and other structures compared with fundamental and harmonic B-mode imaging. CNRs of up to 1.9 were obtained from in vivo imaging of human cardiac tissue with HSCI, compared with 0.6, 0.9, and 1.5 in fundamental B-mode, harmonic B-mode, and SLSC imaging, respectively. In vivo experiments in human liver tissue demonstrated SNRs of up to 3.4 for HSCI compared with 1.9 for harmonic B-mode.

{"title": "Age and obesity-associated changes in the expression and activation of components of the AMPK signaling pathway in human right atrial tissue.", "abstract": "Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, heart failure, and premature cardiac aging. In the heart, intrinsic activation of the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) plays a pivotal role in the stress response to ischemia and hypertrophy. Furthermore, AMPK is an important regulator of cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of obesity and aging on the AMPK signaling pathway in human cardiac tissue.\n60 male cardiac surgery patients were included in the study and divided into 4 groups (old normal weight: ON; old obese: OO; young normal weight: YN, young obese: YO) according to their body mass index (18.5-25: normal weight or 30-35: obese) and age (<55 years: young or >70: old) with 15 patients each. Right atrial tissue (RA) was analyzed for the expression of the AMPK upstream kinases CAMKK and LKB1, activation of AMPK as well as phosphorylation of the AMPK downstream targets ACC, eEF2, mTOR and eNOS. Epicardial adipose tissue was analyzed for the expression of the endogenous AMPK activator adiponectin. The metabolic state of all patients was further characterized in fasting blood samples.\nOld patients (ON, OO) and young obese (YO) subjects displayed higher fasting glucose, insulin and leptin serum levels compared to the young, normal weight group, although HbA1c was below the threshold required for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Serum adiponectin as well as total adiponectin protein expression in epicardial adipose tissue was decreased in these three groups. Analyses of adiponectin isoforms by native gel electrophoresis revealed significant differences in the high molecular weight (HMW) isoforms between the groups. Despite the low total serum adiponectin and HMW adiponectin, AMPK activation was high in the RA of obese patients (YO, OO). Among the AMPK upstream kinases, LKB1 expression showed a strong positive correlation with AMPK activation. While the phosphorylation of the AMPK downstream targets mTOR, eEF-2 and ACC was not altered, phospho-eNOS was significantly lower in old patients (ON, OO). Despite strong AMPK activation, mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration were impaired in old (ON, OO) and young obese (YO) subjects.\nThese data indicate that obesity and aging result in significant changes although many direct parameters in the AMPK signaling pathway are not changed in the same direction.

Using this technique between mouse heart and skeletal muscle (skm) tissues, we aimed to construct a cDNA-library that was specific to heart tissue and to identify the potential candidate genes that might be responsible for the development of cardiac diseases or related pathophysiological conditions. In the first step of the study, we created a cDNA-library between mouse heart and skm tissues. The homologies of the randomly selected 215 clones were analyzed and then classified by function. A total of 146 genes were analyzed for their expression profiles in the heart and skm tissues in published mouse microarray dataset. In the second step, we analyzed the expression patterns of the selected genes by Northern blot and RNA in situ hybridization (RISH). In Northern blot analyses, the expression levels of Myl3, Myl2, Mfn2, Dcn, Pdlim4, mt-Co3, mt-Co1, Atpase6 and Tsc22d1 genes were higher in heart than skm. For first time with this study, expression patterns of Pdlim4 and Tsc22d1 genes in mouse heart and skm were shown by RISH. In the last step, 43 genes in this library were identified to have relationships mostly with cardiac diseases and/or related phenotypes.

Our hypothesis is that MTX side effects can be attenuated by directing the drug to the target cells (i.e., leukocytes) using (cyclo(1,12)PenPRGGSVLVTGC) peptide (cIBR). To test this hypothesis, MTX was conjugated to the N-terminus of cIBR peptide to give MTX-cIBR conjugate. MTX-cIBR (5.0 mg/kg) suppressed joint arthritis in adjuvant arthritis rats and prevented periarticular inflammation and bone resorption of the limb joints. In vitro, the toxicity of MTX-cIBR peptide against Molt-3 T cells was inhibited by anti-lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) antibody and cIBR peptide in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the uptake of MTX-cIBR was partially mediated by LFA-1. Chemical stability studies indicated that MTX-cIBR was most stable at pH 6.0. The MTX portion of MTX-cIBR was unstable under acidic conditions, whereas the cIBR portion was unstable under basic conditions. In biological media, MTX-cIBR had short half lives in rat plasma (44 min) and homogenized rat heart tissue (38 min). This low plasma stability may contribute to the low in vivo efficacy of MTX-cIBR; therefore, there is a need to design a more stable conjugate to improve the in vivo efficacy.", "journal": "Journal of pharmaceutical sciences", "date": "2012-04-28", "authors": ["SumitMajumdar", "Meagan EAnderson", "Christine RXu", "Tatyana VYakovleva", "Leo CGu", "Thomas RMalefyt", "Teruna JSiahaan"], "doi": "10.1002/jps.23164\n10.1002/med.20225"}

Until now, this important issue has not been appropriately investigated. We hypothesized that the expression of seven internal reference genes would show stable per-unit-living tissue expression in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. This was found for cyclophilin A, GAPDH, RPL-32, and PolR2A mRNA, with GAPDH showing the highest degree of stability (R = 0.11), suggesting unchanged rates of mRNA transcription in live cells and complete degradation of mRNA from dead cells. The infarct size-dependent degradation of GAPDH was further supported by a close correlation between changes in GAPDH mRNA and changes in RNA quality measured as RNA integrity number (R = 0.90, P < 0.05). In contrast, \u03b2-actin and 18S rRNA showed stable expression per-unit-weight tissue and a positive correlation with infarct size (R = 0.61 and R = 0.77, P < 0.05 for both analyses). The amount of total RNA extracted per-unit-weight tissue did not differ between groups despite wide variation in infarct size (7.1-50.1%). When \u03b2-actin expression was assessed using four different normalization strategies, GAPDH and geNorm provided appropriate per-unit-living expression, while 18S and total RNA resulted in marked underestimations.

Cardiomyocyte lesion evaluated by creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme activity levels in the serum and electrical abnormalities revealed by electrocardiogram were not associated with the intensity of heart parasitism and myocarditis in the chronic infection. Further, there was no association between heart injury and systemic anti-T. cruzi CD8(+) T-cell capacity to produce interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) and to perform specific cytotoxicity.

The adoptive cell transfer to T. cruzi-infected cd8(-/-) recipients showed that the CD8(+) cells from infected ifn\u03b3(-/-)pfn(+/+) donors migrate towards the cardiac tissue to a greater extent and caused a more severe cardiomyocyte lesion than CD8(+) cells from ifn\u03b3(+/+)pfn(-/-) donors.

{"title": "Increased expression of calcium-sensing receptors in atherosclerosis confers hypersensitivity to acute myocardial infarction in rats.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Most cases of AMI result from coronary atherosclerosis (AS). The pathogenic mechanisms underlying AS lesions and AMI are incompletely understood. Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR) belong to a family of G-protein-coupled receptors. We previously discovered that CaSR was expressed in the heart tissue of adult rats. CaSR may contribute to AMI in AS. We initially established a rat model of AS by injection of vitamin D(3) and feeding with a high-fat diet. Isoproterenol (ISO) was used to induce AMI. The MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), tetrazolium chloride staining, and cardiac function parameters were selected as indicators of myocardial damage or necrosis. Cardiac apoptosis was analyzed by transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Expression of CaSR, Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, and p-p38 were determined by Western blot analysis. Compared with the control group, levels of cTnT, CK-MB, and LDH; number of TUNEL-positive cells; and expression of CaSR, Bax, caspase-3, p-ERK1/2, p-JNK and p-p38, were significantly increased, whereas cardiac function and expression of Bcl-2 were decreased markedly in isoproterenol (ISO)-treated group (C/ISO) and AS groups. These changes were significant in the AS/ISO group than in the C/ISO group or AS group. The upregulation of CaSR during AS formation renders hypersensitivity to AMI. Activation of the pro-apoptotic mitochondria pathway and JNK-p38 MAPK pathway triggered by increased expression of CaSR may be one of molecular mechanisms underlying AMI in AS.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2012-04-25", "authors": ["JinGuo", "Hong-ZhuLi", "Lu-ChuanWang", "Wei-HuaZhang", "Guang-WeiLi", "Wen-JingXing", "RuiWang", "Chang-QingXu"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-012-1312-0"}
{"title": "Improving cardiac conduction with a skeletal muscle sodium channel by gene and cell therapy.", "abstract": "The voltage-gated Na+ channel is a critical determinant of the action potential (AP) upstroke. Increasing Na+ conductance may speed AP propagation. In this study, we propose use of the skeletal muscle Na+ channel SkM1 as a more favorable gene than the cardiac isoform SCN5A to enhance conduction velocity in depolarized cardiac tissue. We used cells that electrically coupled with cardiac myocytes as a delivery platform to introduce the Na+ channels. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were stably transfected with SkM1 or SCN5A. SkM1 had a more depolarized (18 mV shift) inactivation curve than SCN5A. We also found that SkM1 recovered faster from inactivation than SCN5A. When coupled with SkM1 expressing cells, cultured myocytes showed an increase in the dV/dtmax of the AP. Expression of SCN5A had no such effect. In an in vitro cardiac syncytium, coculture of neonatal cardiac myocytes with SkM1 expressing but not SCN5A expressing cells significantly increased the conduction velocity under both normal and depolarized conditions. In an in vitro reentry model induced by high-frequency stimulation, expression of SkM1 also enhanced angular velocity of the induced reentry. These results suggest that cells carrying a Na+ channel with a more depolarized inactivation curve can improve cardiac excitability and conduction in depolarized tissues.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2012-04-25", "authors": ["JiaLu", "Hong-ZhanWang", "ZhihengJia", "JoanZuckerman", "ZhongjuLu", "YuanjianGuo", "Gerard J JBoink", "Peter RBrink", "Richard BRobinson", "EmiliaEntcheva", "Ira SCohen"], "doi": "10.1097/FJC.0b013e3182588b00"}
{"title": "Heart ablation using a planar rectangular high intensity ultrasound transducer and MRI guidance.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate a flat rectangular (3\u00d710mm(2)) MRI compatible transducer operating at 5MHz. The main task was to explore the feasibility of creating deep lesions in heart at a depth of at least 15mm. The size of thermal necrosis in heart tissue was estimated as a function of power and time using a simulation model. The system was then tested in an excised lamb heart. In this study, we were able to create lesions of 15mm deep with acoustic power of 6W for an exposure of approximately 1min. The contrast to noise ratio (CNR) between lesion and heart tissue was evaluated using fast spin echo (FSE). The CNR value was approximately 22 using T1W FSE. Maximum CNR was achieved with repetition time (TR) between 300 and 800ms. Using T2W FSE, the corresponding CNR was approximately 13 for the 14 in vivo experiments. The average lesion depth was 11.93mm with a standard deviation of 0.62mm. In vivo irradiation conditions were 6W for 60s. The size of the lesion in the other two dimensions was close to 3\u00d710mm(2) (size of the transducer element).", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2012-04-25", "authors": ["AndreasCouppis", "ChristakisDamianou", "PanayiotisKyriacou", "CyrilLafon", "FrancoiseChavrier", "Jean-YvesChapelon", "AlainBirer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2012.03.010"}
{"title": "Evidence for FHL1 as a novel disease gene for isolated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and myocardial disarray. HCM is caused by mutations in sarcomeric genes, but in >40% of patients, the mutation is not yet identified. We hypothesized that FHL1, encoding four-and-a-half-LIM domains 1, could be another disease gene since it has been shown to cause distinct myopathies, sometimes associated with cardiomyopathy. We evaluated 121 HCM patients, devoid of a mutation in known disease genes. We identified three novel variants in FHL1 (c.134delA/K45Sfs, c.459C>A/C153X and c.827G>C/C276S). Whereas the c.459C>A variant was associated with muscle weakness in some patients, the c.134delA and c.827G>C variants were associated with isolated HCM. Gene transfer of the latter variants in C2C12 myoblasts and cardiac myocytes revealed reduced levels of FHL1 mutant proteins, which could be rescued by proteasome inhibition. Contractility measurements after adeno-associated virus transduction in rat-engineered heart tissue (EHT) showed: (i) higher and lower forces of contraction with K45Sfs and C276S, respectively, and (ii) prolonged contraction and relaxation with both mutants. All mutants except one activated the fetal hypertrophic gene program in EHT. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for FHL1 to be a novel gene for isolated HCM. These data, together with previous findings of proteasome impairment in HCM, suggest that FHL1 mutant proteins may act as poison peptides, leading to hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and/or altered contractility, all features of HCM.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2012-04-24", "authors": ["Felix WFriedrich", "Brendan RWilding", "SilkeReischmann", "ClaudiaCrocini", "PatrickLang", "PhilippeCharron", "Oliver JM\u00fcller", "Meagan JMcGrath", "IngraVollert", "ArneHansen", "Wolfgang ALinke", "ChristianHengstenberg", "Gis\u00e8leBonne", "StellanMorner", "ThomasWichter", "HugoMadeira", "EloisaArbustini", "ThomasEschenhagen", "Christina AMitchell", "RichardIsnard", "LucieCarrier"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/dds157"}
{"title": "Dephosphorylation of cardiac proteins in vitro - a matter of phosphatase specificity.", "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is reversibly regulated by the interplay between kinases and phosphatases. Recent developments within the field of proteomics have revealed the extent of this modification in nature. To date there is still a lack of information about phosphatase specificity for different proteomes and their conditions to achieve maximum enzyme activity. This information is important per se, and in addition often requested in functional and biochemical in vitro studies, where a dephosphorylated sample is needed as a negative control to define baseline conditions. In this study, we have addressed the effectiveness of two phosphatases endogenously present in the heart (protein phosphatases 1 and 2A) and two generic phosphatases (alkaline phosphatase and lambda protein phosphatase) on three cardiac subproteomes known to be regulated by phosphorylation. We optimized the dephoshorylating conditions on a cardiac tissue fraction comprising cytosolic and myofilament proteins using 2DE and MS. The two most efficient conditions were further investigated on a mitochondrial-enriched fraction. Dephosphorylation of specific proteins depends on the phosphatase, its concentration, as well as sample preparation including buffer composition. Finally, we analyzed the efficiency of alkaline phosphatase, the phosphatase with the broadest substrate specificity, using TiO(2) peptide enrichment and 2DLC-MS/MS. Under these conditions, 95% of the detected cardiac cytoplasmic-enriched phospho-proteome was dephosphorylated. In summary, targeting dephosphorylation of the cardiac muscle subproteomes or a specific protein will drive the selection of the specific phosphatase, and each requires different conditions for optimal performance.", "journal": "Proteomics", "date": "2012-04-24", "authors": ["CathrineHusberg", "GiulioAgnetti", "Ronald JHolewinski", "GeirChristensen", "Jennifer EVan Eyk"], "doi": "10.1002/pmic.201100116"}
{"title": "Substrate stiffness modulates gene expression and phenotype in neonatal cardiomyocytes in vitro.", "abstract": "Biomaterials to be used as cell delivery systems for cardiac tissue engineering should be able to comply with cardiac muscle contractile activity, while favoring cell survival and neo-angiogenesis in a hostile environment. Biocompatible synthetic materials can be tailored to mimic cardiac tissue three-dimensional organization in the micro- and nanoscales. Nonetheless, they usually display mechanical properties that are far from those of the native myocardium and thus could affect host cell survival and activity. In the present investigation, inert poly-\u03b5-caprolactone planar layers were manufactured to change the surface stiffness (with Young's modulus ranging from 1 to 133 MPa) without changing matrix chemistry. These substrates were challenged with neonatal murine cardiomyocytes to study the possible effect of substrate stiffness on such cell behavior without changing biological cues. Interestingly, softer substrates (0.91\u00b10.08 and 1.53\u00b10.16 MPa) were found to harbor mostly mature cardiomyocytes having assembled sarcomeres, as shown by the expression of alpha actinin and myosin heavy chain in typical striations and the upregulation of sarcomeric actin mRNA. On the other hand, a preferential expression of immature cardiac cell genes (Nkx-2.5) and proteins (GATA-4) in cardiac cells grown onto stiffer materials (49.67\u00b12.56 and 133.23\u00b18.67 MPa) was detected. This result could not be ascribed to significant differences in cell adhesion or proliferation induced by the substrates, but to the stabilization of cardiomyocyte differentiated phenotype induced by softer layers. In fact, cardiac cell electromechanical coupling was shown to be more organized on softer surfaces, as highlighted by connexin 43 distribution. Moreover, a differential regulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling was detected on soft films (0.91\u00b10.08 MPa) as compared with the stiffest (133.23\u00b18.67 MPa). Finally, the upregulation of a number of genes involved in inflammatory processes was detected when the stiffest polymer is used. These events highlight the differences in cell mechanosensitivity in a heterogeneous cell preparation and are likely to contribute to the differences encountered in cardiac cell phenotype induced by substrate stiffness.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation: novel and safe strategy based on the modulation of the antioxidant system.", "abstract": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia following cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. The pathogenesis of postoperative AF is multifactorial. Oxidative stress, caused by the unavoidable ischemia-reperfusion event occurring in this setting, is a major contributory factor. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-derived effects could result in lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, or DNA oxidation of cardiac tissue, thus leading to functional and structural myocardial remodeling. The vulnerability of myocardial tissue to the oxidative challenge is also dependent on the activity of the antioxidant system. High ROS levels, overwhelming this system, should result in deleterious cellular effects, such as the induction of necrosis, apoptosis, or autophagy. Nevertheless, tissue exposure to low to moderate ROS levels could trigger a survival response with a trend to reinforce the antioxidant defense system. Administration of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), known to involve a moderate ROS production, is consistent with a diminished vulnerability to the development of postoperative AF. Accordingly, supplementation of n-3 PUFA successfully reduced the incidence of postoperative AF after coronary bypass grafting. This response is due to an up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes, as shown in experimental models. In turn, non-enzymatic antioxidant reinforcement through vitamin C administration prior to cardiac surgery has also reduced the postoperative AF incidence. Therefore, it should be expected that a mixed therapy result in an improvement of the cardioprotective effect by modulating both components of the antioxidant system. We present novel available evidence supporting the hypothesis of an effective prevention of postoperative AF including a two-step therapeutic strategy: n-3 PUFA followed by vitamin C supplementation to patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. The present study should encourage the design of clinical trials aimed to test the efficacy of this strategy to offer new therapeutic opportunities to patients challenged by ischemia-reperfusion

We explored the occurrence of copy number differences in monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for the presence of a CHD, as an illustrative model for chromosomal mosaicism in CHDs. Array comparative genomic hybridization was performed on peripheral blood-derived DNA obtained from 6 discordant MZ twin pairs and on sex-matched reference samples. To identify CNV differences between both twin members as well as potential CNVs in both twins contributing to the phenotype, DNA from each twin was hybridized against its co-twin, and against a normal control. Three copy number differences in 1 out of 6 MZ twin pairs were detected, confirming the occurrence of somatic CNV events in MZ twins. Further investigation by copy number and (epi)genome sequencing analyses in MZ twins, discordant for the presence of CHDs, is required to improve our knowledge on how postzygotic genetic, environmental and stochastic factors can affect human heart development.", "journal": "Molecular syndromology", "date": "2012-04-19", "authors": ["JBreckpot", "BThienpont", "MGewillig", "KAllegaert", "J RVermeesch", "KDevriendt"], "doi": "10.1159/000335284"}
{"title": "Contrast enhanced micro-computed tomography resolves the 3-dimensional morphology of the cardiac conduction system in mammalian hearts.", "abstract": "The general anatomy of the cardiac conduction system (CCS) has been known for 100 years, but its complex and irregular three-dimensional (3D) geometry is not so well understood. This is largely because the conducting tissue is not distinct from the surrounding tissue by dissection. The best descriptions of its anatomy come from studies based on serial sectioning of samples taken from the appropriate areas of the heart. Low X-ray attenuation has formerly ruled out micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) as a modality to resolve internal structures of soft tissue, but incorporation of iodine, which has a high molecular weight, into those tissues enhances the differential attenuation of X-rays and allows visualisation of fine detail in embryos and skeletal muscle. Here, with the use of a iodine based contrast agent (I(2)KI), we present contrast enhanced micro-CT images of cardiac tissue from rat and rabbit in which the three major subdivisions of the CCS can be differentiated from the surrounding contractile myocardium and visualised in 3D. Structures identified include the sinoatrial node (SAN) and the atrioventricular conduction axis: the penetrating bundle, His bundle, the bundle branches and the Purkinje network. Although the current findings are consistent with existing anatomical representations, the representations shown here offer superior resolution and are the first 3D representations of the CCS within a single intact mammalian heart.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-04-18", "authors": ["Robert SStephenson", "Mark RBoyett", "GeorgeHart", "TheodoraNikolaidou", "XueCai", "Antonio FCorno", "NelsonAlphonso", "NathanJeffery", "Jonathan CJarvis"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0035299"}
{"title": "Low O2 avoidance is associated with physiological perturbation but not exhaustion in the snapper (Pagrus auratus: Sparidae).", "abstract": "It is already known that the New Zealand snapper (Pagrus auratus, Sparidae) does not avoid hypoxia until reaching an oxygen partial pressure (PO(2)) of 3.1\u00b11.2 kPa at 18 \u00b0C. Avoidance at this level of PO(2) and temperature is below the critical oxygen partial pressure of the species (P(crit)=5.8\u00b10.6 kPa, 43.5\u00b14.5 mmHg) and is therefore expected to result in major physiological stress. Results from the current study showed that avoidance was associated with numerous physiological perturbations, including a significant endocrine response, haematological changes, osmoregulatory disturbance and metabolic adjustments in the heart, liver and muscle. Snapper clearly experienced physiological stress at the point of avoidance but they were not however in a state of physiological exhaustion since some fuel reserves were still available. In addition to avoidance, snapper also showed a subtle reduction in swimming speed - this energy-saving response may have helped snapper minimise the physiological challenge of low O(2) residence. It is therefore concluded that snapper can reside in water below their P(crit) threshold for brief periods of time and, without any evidence of physiological exhaustion at the point of avoidance, fish should recover quickly once normoxia is selected. Lastly, with signs of anaerobic metabolism in cardiac tissue at the point of avoidance, we tentatively suggest that snapper may leave hypoxia to protect heart function.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

{"title": "Engineering of oriented myocardium on three-dimensional micropatterned collagen-chitosan hydrogel.", "abstract": "Surface topography and electrical field stimulation are important guidance cues that aid the organization and contractility of cardiomyocytes in vivo. We report here on the use of these biomimetic cues in vitro to engineer an implantable contractile cardiac tissue.\nPhotocrosslinkable collagen-chitosan hydrogels with microgrooves of 10 \u00b5m, 20 \u00b5m and 100 \u00b5m in width were fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molds. The hydrogels were seeded with cardiomyocytes, placed into a bioreactor array with the microgrooves aligned with the electrical field lines, and stimulated with biphasic square pulses at 1 Hz and 2.5 V/cm.\nAt Day 6, cardiomyocytes were aligned in the direction of the microgrooves. When cultivated without electrical stimulation, the excitation threshold of engineered cardiac tissues using micropatterned hydrogels was significantly lower than using smooth hydrogels, thus showing the importance of cell alignment to cardiac function. The success rate of achieving beating constructs was higher with the application of electrical stimulation. In addition, formation of dense contractile cardiac organoids was observed in groups with both biomimetic cues. The cultivation of cardiomyocytes on hydrogels with 10 \u00b5m grooves yielded 100% beating tissues with or without electrical stimulation, thus suggesting a smaller groove width is necessary for cells to communicate and form proper gap junctions. However, electrical field stimulation further increased cell density and enhanced tissue morphology which may be essential for the integration of the tissue construct to the native heart tissue upon implantation.\nThe biodegradability of the hydrogel substrate allows for the rapid translation of the engineered, oriented cardiac tissue to clinical applications.", "journal": "The International journal of artificial organs", "date": "2012-04-17", "authors": ["Loraine L YChiu", "KatarinaJanic", "MilicaRadisic"], "doi": "10.5301/ijao.5000084"}
{"title": "Serendipitous discovery of a novel protein signaling mechanism in heart failure.", "abstract": "A number of protein signaling mechanisms are known to be involved in the progression of heart failure, yet the mechanism(s) by which the heart fails remains poorly understood. Therefore, we undertook a global approach to this question and used an antibody microarray to identify proteins differentially expressed in dysfunctional right ventricles in a bovine model of heart failure and the results were validated using cardiac tissue from both bovine and human heart failure. We found that protein disulfide isomerase 3, PDIA3, a protein that resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, is significantly upregulated in both animal and human models of right and left heart failure. Altered expression of this protein has not previously been described in models of heart failure. In our initial microarray analysis, we found that CSK (c-Src kinase) was among the proteins upregulated in failing bovine ventricle. To further elucidate the role of CSK in heart failure, we studied the expression of its downstream target, Src, and found that Src expression and phosphorylation were markedly upregulated in failing ventricles. However, we also noted a smaller immunologically reactive protein that was only seen in experimental animals. In order to positively identify the smaller, Src-reactive protein, we used 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrophotometry. Surprisingly, we identified this protein as PDIA3, a protein that did not belong to the Src family of proteins. Upon sequence examination we found that PDIA3 contains a short C-terminal sequence with strong homology to Src and that it was this short sequence to which the antibody was generated. PDIA3 participates in MHC class I presentation and is implicated in the progression of valvular dysfunction in rheumatic heart disease, as well as calcium modulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The molecule resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and participates in disulfide bond formation during protein folding by interacting with calnexin and calreticulin. This interaction may indirectly effect SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-transport ATPase) activity and by extension contribute to the calcium dysregulation that characterizes progressive heart failure. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role that PDIA3 may play in the progression of heart failure.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2012-04-17", "authors": ["Andrea MVitello", "YanmeiDu", "Peter MButtrick", "Lori AWalker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.03.124"}

NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 are important sources of reactive oxygen species in the heart, but knowledge of the calcium-dependent NOX5 in the heart is lacking. The presence of NOX5 was studied via RT-PCR in heart tissue from patients with end-stage heart failure; the tissue was obtained during cardiac transplantation surgery. NOX5 positivity and cellular localization were studied via IHC and digital-imaging microscopy in heart tissues of patients who did not have heart disease and in infarction areas of patients who died of myocardial infarctions of different durations. Furthermore, NOX5 expression was analyzed in vitro by using Western blot analysis. NOX5 RNA was found in the hearts of controls and patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In controls, NOX5 localized to the endothelium of a limited number of intramyocardial blood vessels and to a limited number of scattered cardiomyocytes. In infarcted hearts, NOX5 expression increased, especially in infarctions >12 hours, which manifested as an increase in NOX5-positive intramyocardial blood vessels, as well as in endothelium, smooth muscle, and cardiomyocytes. NOX5 was found in cardiomyocyte cytoplasm, plasma membrane, intercalated disks, and cross striations. Western blot analysis confirmed NOX5 expression in isolated human cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Myocyte-depleted engineered cardiac tissues support therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "The therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for restoring cardiac function after cardiomyocyte loss remains controversial. Engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) offer a simplified three-dimensional in vitro model system to evaluate stem cell therapies. We hypothesized that contractile properties of dysfunctional ECTs would be enhanced by MSC treatment. ECTs were created from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with and without bone marrow-derived adult rat MSCs in a type-I collagen and Matrigel scaffold using custom elastomer molds with integrated cantilever force sensors. Three experimental groups included the following: (1) baseline condition ECT consisting only of myocytes, (2) 50% myocyte-depleted ECT, modeling a dysfunctional state, and (3) 50% myocyte-depleted ECT plus 10% MSC, modeling dysfunctional myocardium with intervention. Developed stress (DS) and pacing threshold voltage (VT) were measured using 2-Hz field stimulation at 37\u00b0C on culture days 5, 10, 15, and 20. By day 5, DS of myocyte-depleted ECTs was significantly lower than baseline, and VT was elevated. In MSC-supplemented ECTs, DS and VT were significantly better than myocyte-depleted values, approaching baseline ECTs. Findings were similar through culture day 15, but lost significance at day 20. Trends in DS were partly explained by changes in the cell number and alignment with time. Thus, supplementing myocyte-depleted ECTs with MSCs transiently improved contractile function and compensated for a 50% loss of cardiomyocytes, mimicking recent animal studies and clinical trials and supporting the potential of MSCs for myocardial therapy.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Mitochondrial \u0394\u03a8m from WT mice on C and PIO diets was -166\u00b14 mV and -147\u00b16 mV, respectively (P<0.05). These values were lower than in UCP-2 KO mice on C and PIO (-180\u00b14 mV and -180\u00b14 mV, respectively; P<0.05). Maximal complex III inhibitable superoxide from WT mice on C and PIO diets was 22.5\u00b11.3 and 17.8\u00b11.1 AU, respectively (P<0.05), and were lower than UCP-2 KO on C and PIO (32.9\u00b12.3 and 29.2\u00b11.9 AU, respectively; P<0.05). Postanoxia, the respiratory control index (RCI) in mitochondria from WT mice with and without PIO was 2.5\u00b10.3 and 2.4\u00b10.2, respectively, and exceeded that of UCP-2 KO mice on C and PIO (1.2\u00b10.1 and 1.4\u00b10.1, respectively; P<0.05). In summary, chronic PPAR\u03b3 stimulation leads to depolarization of the inner membrane and reduced superoxide of isolated heart mitochondria, which was critically dependent on increased expression of UCP-2. Thus, UCP-2 expression affords resistance to brief anoxia-reoxygenation.", "journal": "Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine", "date": "2012-04-17", "authors": ["Jes\u00fas ACabrera", "Elizabeth AZiemba", "RobertColbert", "Rosemary FKelly", "MichaelKuskowski", "Edgar AArriaga", "WimSluiter", "Dirk JDuncker", "Herbert BWard", "Edward OMcFalls"], "doi": "10.1016/j.trsl.2011.11.001"}
{"title": "Splicing transitions of the anchoring protein ENH during striated muscle development.", "abstract": "The ENH (PDLIM5) protein acts as a scaffold to tether various functional proteins at subcellular sites via PDZ and three LIM domains. Splicing of the ENH primary transcript generates various products with different repertories of protein interaction modules. Three LIM-containing ENH predominates in neonatal cardiac tissue, whereas LIM-less ENHs are abundant in adult hearts, as well as skeletal muscles. Here we examine the timing of splicing transitions of ENH gene products during postnatal heart development and C2C12 myoblast differentiation. Real-time PCR analysis shows that LIM-containing ENH1 mRNA is gradually decreased during postnatal heart development, whereas transcripts with the short exon 5 appear in the late postnatal period and continues to increase until at least one month after birth. The splicing transition from LIM-containing ENH1 to LIM-less ENHs is also observed during the early period of C2C12 differentiation. This transition correlates with the emergence of ENH transcripts with the short exon 5, as well as the expression of myogenin mRNA. In contrast, the shift from the short exon 5 to the exon 7 occurs in the late differentiation period. The timing of this late event corresponds to the appearance of mRNA for the skeletal myosin heavy chain MYH4. Thus, coordinated and stepwise splicing transitions result in the production of specific ENH transcripts in mature striated muscles.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2012-04-14", "authors": ["JumpeiIto", "TaikiHashimoto", "ShoNakamura", "YusukeAita", "TomokoYamazaki", "WernerSchlegel", "KoichiTakimoto", "Andr\u00e9s DMaturana"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.03.142"}

The tendency for these lesions to recur following resection, their immunopathological characteristics, along with their histological and molecular profile, may implicate the presence of an infective agent in this type of tumor. In this study, we investigated the presence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA in a cohort of cardiac myxomas in a tertiary referral centre. Twenty-nine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sporadic cardiac myxomas were obtained, 17 of which were shown to be informative. These were compared to 19 macroscopically and microscopically normal heart tissue specimens. The detection of HSV-1 and -2 genomic sequences was achieved with the use of a combined nested PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism methodology. The presence of HSV-1 and/or -2 DNA was demonstrated in 6 of 17 (35%) informative sporadic cardiac myxomas, whereas no HSV DNA was detected in normal heart tissues (P < 0.01). The existence of HSV-1/2 DNA in sporadic cardiac myxomas, along with its absence from normal heart tissues, reinforces the possibility that HSV infection might be involved in the development of these lesions.

To assess management strategies for the use of radiotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer in Italy, in 2009, the Italian Society of Radiation Oncology Lung Cancer Study Group proposed the survey to all Italian radiation oncology institutions. Results were compared with literature data and international reports.\nQuestionnaires on patterns of care of non-small cell lung cancer were sent to radiation oncology centers active at June 2009 and evaluated data recorded in 2008.\nA total of 65 of 143 Italian centers responded to the questionnaire. The responding centers reflect the distribution of radiotherapy centers throughout the country. Of the treated patients, 55.2% were stage III, and most cases had a good performance status. FDG-PET was routinely used by 51% of centers for diagnostic and contouring phases. Postoperative radiotherapy was prescribed to pN1 and pN2 patients in 42.2% and 98.5%, respectively. The possible use of neo-adjuvant concomitant chemoradiation was declared by 70% of responders. A sequential chemoradiation approach was actually used in 43.6% of cases, induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy in 42.4%, and upfront concomitant radiochemotherapy in only 14%. In 53% of the institutions, patients have a clinical examination by a radiation oncologist only after the beginning of chemotherapy and in 82.4% of cases they have already received 2-4 cycles of chemotherapy. Most of the institutions exclude elective nodal irradiation from routine application. Total dose and fractionation in adjuvant, neoadjuvant, curative and palliative settings confirm literature data. There were significant differences in treatment planning constraints applied for lung, esophageal and cardiac tissues. Of the responding centers, 41% had stereotactic therapy for primary inoperable lung cancer and for metastatic lesions.\nIn Italy, daily practice differs in some ways from the evidence supported by the results of meta-analyses/clinical trials as regards concurrent chemoradiation approaches.

For this purpose, 3-4 months old 28 rats with 280-310\u00a0g body weights were equally divided into 4 groups (control, TCDD, PCA, TCDD\u00a0+\u00a0PCA group). A 2\u00a0\u03bcg/kg dose of 2,3,7,8-TCDD and 100\u00a0mg/kg dose of PCA were dissolved in corn oil and given orally to the rats for 45 days. The results indicated that TCDD induced oxidative stress by increasing the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and by decreasing the levels of glutathione, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in the heart tissue of rats. In contrast, PCA treatment prevents the toxic effects of TCDD on oxidative stress. In addition, histopathological alterations such as necrosis and hemorrhage occurred in TCDD group, and PCA treatment partially prevents these alterations in heart tissue. In this study, it was concluded that TCDD exposure led to toxic effects in heart tissue and PCA treatment could prevent the toxicity of TCDD.", "journal": "Toxicology and industrial health", "date": "2012-04-13", "authors": ["OsmanCiftci", "Olcay MuratDisli", "NecatiTimurkaan"], "doi": "10.1177/0748233712442735"}

In this study, we present a graph-based method, which relies on point-to-point path finding to estimate activation times for single points in cardiac tissue with minimal computational costs. To validate our approach, activation times are compared to monodomain simulation results for an anatomically based rabbit ventricular model, incorporating realistic fiber orientation and conduction heterogeneities. Differences in activation times between the graph-based method and monodomain results are less than 10% of the total activation time, and computational performance is orders of magnitude faster with the proposed method when calculating activation times at single points.

However, the increased production has been accompanied by the emergence of infectious diseases. Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is one example of an emerging disease in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L). Since the first recognition as a disease entity in 1999 it has become a widespread and economically important disease in Norway. The disease was recently found to be associated with infection with a novel reovirus, piscine reovirus (PRV). The load of PRV, examined by RT-qPCR, correlated with severity of HSMI in naturally and experimentally infected salmon. The disease is characterized by epi-, endo- and myocarditis, myocardial necrosis, myositis and necrosis of the red skeletal muscle. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of PRV antigens in heart tissue of Atlantic salmon and monitor the virus distribution in the heart during the disease development. This included target cell specificity, viral load and tissue location during an HSMI outbreak. Rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against putative PRV capsid proteins \u03bc1C and \u03c31 and used in immunohistochemical analysis of archived salmon heart tissue from an experimental infection. The results are consistent with the histopathological changes of HSMI and showed a sequential staining pattern with PRV antigens initially present in leukocyte-like cells and subsequently in cardiomyocytes in the heart ventricle. Our results confirm the association between PRV and HSMI, and strengthen the hypothesis of PRV being the causative agent of HSMI.

Forty atrial septal defect (ASD) patients who had no migraine previously were enrolled.

Previous work suggests that fatigued PBC subjects have evidence of autonomic dysfunction and may be at a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. The manifestation of this risk is not clear. This pilot study investigated whether alterations in cardiac torsion and strain could be detected in fatigued or nonfatigued early-stage PBC patients. We performed cardiac tissue tagging and anatomical cine-imaging in 13 early-stage PBC patients (including 7 with significant fatigue) and 10 control subjects to calculate cardiac torsion and strain throughout systole and diastole. From the cardiac tagging, we calculated the torsion-to-shortening ratio (TSR), a measure of subepicardial torsion exerting mechanical advantage over subendocardial shortening. Autonomic function testing was performed to evaluate baroreceptor effective index on standing. TSR was markedly increased in the fatigued PBC patients (0.70 \u00b1 0.13) compared with both controls (0.46 \u00b1 0.11, P = 0.002) and nonfatigued PBC patients (0.44 \u00b1 0.12, P = 0.003). Decreased baroreceptor effective index on standing strongly correlated with increased TSR within the whole PBC group (r = -0.71, P = 0.007). Fatigued PBC patients demonstrate a redistribution of myocardial strain characteristic of a reduced relative contribution to contraction from the subendocardium. This is analogous to the changes found in healthy aging for subjects \u223c16 yr older than the fatigued PBC patients.

{"title": "The novel chromogranin A-derived serpinin and pyroglutaminated serpinin peptides are positive cardiac \u03b2-adrenergic-like inotropes.", "abstract": "Three forms of serpinin peptides, serpinin (Ala26Leu), pyroglutaminated (pGlu)-serpinin (pGlu23Leu), and serpinin-Arg-Arg-Gly (Ala29Gly), are derived from cleavage at pairs of basic residues in the highly conserved C terminus of chromogranin A (CgA). Serpinin induces PN-1 expression in neuroendocrine cells to up-regulate granule biogenesis via a cAMP-protein kinase A-Sp1 pathway, while pGlu-serpinin inhibits cell death. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that serpinin peptides are produced in the heart and act as novel \u03b2-adrenergic-like cardiac modulators. We detected serpinin peptides in the rat heart by HPLC and ELISA methods. The peptides included predominantly Ala29Gly and pGlu-serpinin and a small amount of serpinin. Using the Langendorff perfused rat heart to evaluate the hemodynamic changes, we found that serpinin and pGlu-serpinin exert dose-dependent positive inotropic and lusitropic effects at 11-165 nM, within the first 5 min after administration. The pGlu-serpinin-induced contractility is more potent than that of serpinin, starting from 1 nM. Using the isolated rat papillary muscle preparation to measure contractility in terms of tension development and muscle length, we further corroborated the pGlu-serpinin-induced positive inotropism. Ala29Gly was unable to affect myocardial performance. Both pGlu-serpinin and serpinin act through a \u03b21-adrenergic receptor/adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA pathway, indicating that, contrary to the \u03b2-blocking profile of the other CgA-derived cardiosuppressive peptides, vasostatin-1 and catestatin, these two C-terminal peptides act as \u03b2-adrenergic-like agonists. In cardiac tissue extracts, pGlu-serpinin increased intracellular cAMP levels and phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN)Ser16, ERK1/2, and GSK-3\u03b2. Serpinin and pGlu-serpinin peptides emerge as novel \u03b2-adrenergic inotropic and lusitropic modulators, suggesting that CgA and the other derived cardioactive peptides can play a key role in how the myocardium orchestrates its complex response to sympathochromaffin stimulation.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2012-03-31", "authors": ["BrunoTota", "StefanoGentile", "TeresaPasqua", "EleonoraBassino", "HisatsuguKoshimizu", "Niamh XCawley", "Maria CCerra", "Y PengLoh", "TommasoAngelone"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.11-201111\n10.1007/s12031-011-9521-7"}

A major barrier to cell survival after transplantation involves inadequate vascularization. Continuous observation of cardiac tissue engraftment and angiogenesis could help understand these processes and allow for identification of the optimal conditions for these therapeutic interventions. We investigated the ability of a skin-fold chamber model to allow for engraftment of differentiated myocardial tissue in mice. Neonatal atrial and ventricular tissues were implanted in the in vivo chambers. All myocardial implants had a high rate of engraftment (86-95%). Tissue engraftment was preceded by a 'bleeding phase' in both the atrial and ventricular implants. This occurred earlier in ventricular compared with atrial implants. Spontaneous contractions were observed after an average of 13 days after implantation in all chambers but occurred earlier in ventricular compared with atrial implants. The host cells surrounded the myocardial implants circumferentially, but have limited infiltration into these grafts. This is the first report of successful ectopic engraftment of differentiated myocardium using a skin-fold chamber.

We treated rats with the I/R with or without preadministration with LGP. The levels of HSP70 and carboxy terminus of HSP70-interacting protein (CHIP) in the heart tissue were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. The effect of CHIP on suppression of HSP70 and the effect of LGP on suppression of CHIP were investigated with an I/R rat model and a cell culture model. The results showed that I/R-induced infarction in the heart could be alleviated by pretreatment with LGP. HSP70 was detected in na\u00efve rat heart tissue extracts. I/R treatment significantly suppressed the level of HSP70 and increased the levels of CHIP in the heart. A complex of CHIP/HSP70 was detected in heart tissue extracts. The addition of recombinant CHIP to culture inhibited HSP70 in heart cells. LGP was bound CHIP in heart cells and prevented the CHIP from binding HSP70. In summary, I/R can suppress HSP70 and increase CHIP in heart cells. CHIP can suppress HSP70 that can be prevented by pretreatment with LGP.

Arsenic (after 30 to 95 min perfusion at 10 \u03bcM) significantly prolonged APD(90), increased triangulation of the AP and elicited early afterdepolarizations (EADs) only in isolated guinea-pig and dog Purkinje fibers but not in rabbit and porcine (minipig) Purkinje fibers. Arsenic induced a prolongation of the APD(90) and increases in triangulation and the occurrence of EADs was not observed in papillary muscles of guinea-pigs and rabbits. Arsenic at 4 increasing concentrations from 0.1 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM at the standard perfusion-time of 15 min per concentration, and after a continuous 90-min perfusion at 1 \u03bcM and 1 Hz did not induce these direct effects on APD(90), triangulation and EADs in isolated guinea-pig Purkinje fibers, but it at 1 \u00b5M elicited EADs in 2 out of 7 preparations after 90 min at 0.2 Hz.\nThe present study demonstrates that the choice of species and cardiac tissue as well as perfusion-time play important roles in arsenic-induced direct/acute effects on APD(90) and induction of EADs in vitro.", "journal": "Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods", "date": "2012-03-27", "authors": ["Hua RongLu", "EddyVlaminckx", "FrankCools", "David JGallacher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vascn.2012.03.002"}
{"title": "Proteomic analysis of effluents from perfused human heart for transplantation: identification of potential biomarkers for ischemic heart damage.", "abstract": "Biomarkers released from the heart at early stage of ischemia are very important to diagnosis of ischemic heart disease and salvage myocytes from death. Known specific markers for blood tests including CK-MB, cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) are released after the onset of significant necrosis instead of early ischemia. Thus, they are not good biomarkers to diagnose myocardial injury before necrosis happens. Therefore, in this study, we performed proteomic analysis on effluents from perfused human hearts of donors at different ischemic time.\nAfter global ischemia for 0 min, 30 min and 60 min at 4\u00b0C, effluents from five perfused hearts were analyzed respectively, by High performance liquid chromatography-Chip-Mass spectrometry (HPLC-Chip-MS) system. Total 196 highly reliable proteins were identified. 107 proteins were identified at the beginning of ischemia, 174 and 175 proteins at ischemic 30 min and ischemic 60 min, respectively. With the exception of cardiac troponin I and T, all known biomarkers for myocardial ischemia were detected in our study. However, there were four glycolytic enzymes and two targets of matrix metalloproteinase released significantly from the heart when ischemic time was increasing. These proteins were L-lactate dehydrogenase B(LDHB), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (PGAM2), gelsolin and isoform 8 of titin. PGAM2, LDHB and titin were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays kits. The mean concentrations of LDHB and PGAM2 in samples showed an increasing trend when ischemic time was extending. In addition, 33% identified proteins are involved in metabolism. Protein to protein interaction network analysis showed glycolytic enzymes, such as isoform alpha-enolase of alpha-enolase, isoform 1 of triosephosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, had more connections than other proteins in myocardial metabolism during ischemia.\nIt is the first time to use effluents of human perfused heart to study the proteins released during myocardial ischemia by HPLC-Chip-MS system. There might be many potential biomarkers for mild ischemic injury in myocardium, especially isoform 8 of titin and M-type of PGAM2 that are more specific in the cardiac tissue than in the others. Furthermore, glycolysis is one of the important conversions during early ischemia in myocardium.

A number of factors including the sex hormone testosterone, components of innate immunity, and profibrotic cytokines have been identified in animal models as important pathogenic mechanisms that increase inflammation and susceptibility to chronic dilated cardiomyopathy. The clinical presentation of acute myocarditis is non-specific and mimics more common causes of heart failure and arrhythmias. Suspected myocarditis is currently confirmed using advanced non-invasive imaging and histopathologic examination of heart tissue.

Previously, we established a cardiovascular cell differentiation system from mouse pluripotent stem cells, in which cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial cells (ECs), and mural cells (MCs) can be systematically induced and purified. Combining this with cell sheet technology, we generated cardiac tissue sheets reassembled with defined cardiovascular populations. Here, we show the potentials and mechanisms of cardiac tissue sheet transplantation in cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI). Transplantation of the cardiac tissue sheet to a rat MI model showed significant and sustained improvement of systolic function accompanied by neovascularization. Reduction of the infarct wall thinning and fibrotic length indicated the attenuation of left ventricular remodeling. Cell tracing with species-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization after transplantation revealed a relatively early loss of transplanted cells and an increase in endogenous neovascularization in the proximity of the graft, suggesting an indirect angiogenic effect of cardiac tissue sheets rather than direct CM contributions. We prospectively dissected the functional mechanisms with cell type-controlled sheet analyses. Sheet CMs were the main source of vascular endothelial growth factor. Transplantation of sheets lacking CMs resulted in the disappearance of neovascularization and subsequent functional improvement, indicating that the beneficial effects of the sheet were achieved by sheet CMs. ECs and MCs enhanced the sheet functions and structural integration.

In recent years cardiac tissue engineering has been established as a possible future treatment option for cardiac disease. However, the quality of engineered myocardial tissues remains poor. In tissue engineering it is important that the scaffold allows cells to attach, spread, maintain their differentiation status or differentiate into functional cells in order to exhibit their physiological function. Here, we have investigated the suitability of the natural cardiac extracellular matrix component nephronectin as an adhesive material for cardiac tissue engineering. Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were seeded on collagen-, fibronectin- or nephronectin-coated glass coverslips and analyzed for cell adhesion, cellular metabolic activity, response to extracellular stimuli, cell-to-cell communication, differentiation and contractility. Our data demonstrate that most neonatal cardiomyocytes attached in an RGD domain-dependent manner within 18 h to nephronectin. The cells exhibited high metabolic activity, responded to growth factor stimuli and maintained their differentiation status. Moreover, nephronectin promoted sarcomere maturation and alignment, cell-to-cell communication and synchronous contractions.

In the present study, we examined the role and underlying mechanisms of TK in peripheral endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function. Peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells containing EPCs were isolated from rat. The in vitro effects of TK on EPC differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and vascular tube formation capacity were studied in the presence or absence of TK, kinin B(2) receptor antagonist (icatibant), and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Apoptosis was evaluated by flow-cytometry analysis using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, as well as western-blot analysis of Akt phosphorylation and cleaved caspase-3. Using an MI mouse model, we then examined the in vivo effects of human TK gene adenoviral vector (Ad.hTK) administration on the number of CD34(+)Flk-1(+) progenitors in the peripheral circulation, heart tissue, extent of vasculogenesis, and heart function. Administration of TK significantly increased the number of Dil-LDL/UEA-lectin double-positive early EPCs, as well as their migration and tube formation properties in vitro. Transduction of TK in cultured EPCs attenuated apoptosis induced by hypoxia and led to an increase in Akt phosphorylation and a decrease in cleaved caspase-3 levels. The beneficial effects of TK were blocked by pretreatment with icatibant and LY294002. The expression of recombinant human TK in the ischemic mouse heart significantly improved cardiac contractility and reduced infarct size 7 days after gene delivery. Compared with the Ad.Null group, Ad.hTK reduced mortality and preserved left ventricular function by increasing the number of CD34(+)Flk-1(+) EPCs and promoting the growth of capillaries and arterioles in the peri-infarct myocardium.

Using micromolded nonadhesive agarose hydrogels containing 822 concave recesses (800 \u03bcm deep \u00d7 400 \u03bcm wide), we demonstrated that neonatal rat ventricular CMs and CFs alone or in combination self-assembled into viable (Live/Dead stain) spherical-shaped microtissues.

{"title": "MicroRNA-214 protects the mouse heart from ischemic injury by controlling Ca\u00b2\u207a overload and cell death.", "abstract": "Early reperfusion of ischemic cardiac tissue remains the most effective intervention for improving clinical outcome following myocardial infarction. However, abnormal increases in intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a during myocardial reperfusion can cause cardiomyocyte death and consequent loss of cardiac function, referred to as ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. Therapeutic modulation of Ca\u00b2\u207a handling provides some cardioprotection against the paradoxical effects of restoring blood flow to the heart, highlighting the significance of Ca\u00b2\u207a overload to IR injury. Cardiac IR is also accompanied by dynamic changes in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs); for example, miR-214 is upregulated during ischemic injury and heart failure, but its potential role in these processes is unknown. Here, we show that genetic deletion of miR-214 in mice causes loss of cardiac contractility, increased apoptosis, and excessive fibrosis in response to IR injury. The cardioprotective roles of miR-214 during IR injury were attributed to repression of the mRNA encoding sodium/calcium exchanger 1 (Ncx1), a key regulator of Ca\u00b2\u207a influx; and to repression of several downstream effectors of Ca\u00b2\u207a signaling that mediate cell death.

Further study showed that matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), a key regulator involved in cardiac fibrosis, was the target of miR-27b. The expression of MMP13 was decreased and the expression of Col I and III was increased in miR-27b transgenic mice..

However, due to decreased oxygen supply and insufficient wash out of waste products in the inner layers of such preparations, electrophysiological functions could be compromised. Although the cascade of events triggered by cutting off perfusion is well known, it remains unclear as to which degree electrophysiological function in viable surface layers is affected by pathological processes occurring in adjacent tissue. Using a 3D numerical bidomain model, we aim to quantify the impact of superfusion-induced heterogeneities occurring in the depth of the tissue on impulse propagation in superficial layers. Simulations demonstrated that both the pattern of activation as well as the distribution of extracellular potentials close to the surface remain essentially unchanged. This was true also for the electrophysiological properties of cells in the surface layer, where most relevant depolarization parameters varied by less than 5.5\u00a0%. The main observed effect on the surface was related to action potential duration that shortened noticeably by 53\u00a0% as hypoxia deteriorated.

Sepsis was produced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats via intratracheal injection of S. pneumonia (4 \u00d7 10(6) colony formation units per rat). A single dose of Mito-Vit-E, vitamin E, or control vehicle, at 21.5 \u03bcmol/kg, was administered 30 min postinoculation. Blood was collected, and heart tissue was harvested at various time points. Mito-Vit-E in vivo distribution was confirmed by mass spectrometry. In cardiac mitochondria, Mito-Vit-E improved total antioxidant capacity and suppressed H(2)O(2) generation, whereas vitamin E offered little effect. In cytosol, both antioxidants decreased H(2)O(2) levels, but only vitamin E strengthened antioxidant capacity. Mito-Vit-E protected mitochondrial structure and function in the heart during sepsis, demonstrated by reduction in lipid and protein oxidation, preservation of mitochondrial membrane integrity, and recovery of respiratory function. While both Mito-Vit-E and vitamin E suppressed sepsis-induced peripheral and myocardial production of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and interleukin-6), Mito-Vit-E exhibited significantly higher efficacy (P < 0.05). Stronger anti-inflammatory action of Mito-Vit-E was further shown by its near-complete inhibition of sepsis-induced myeloperoxidase accumulation in myocardium, suggesting its effect on neutrophil infiltration. Echocardiography analysis indicated that Mito-Vit-E ameliorated cardiac contractility of sepsis animals, shown by improved fractional shortening and ejection fraction.

{"title": "Microdomain heterogeneity in 3D affects the mechanics of neonatal cardiac myocyte contraction.", "abstract": "Cardiac muscle cells are known to adapt to their physical surroundings, optimizing intracellular organization and contractile function for a given culture environment. A previously developed in vitro model system has shown that the inclusion of discrete microscale domains (or microrods) in three dimensions (3D) can alter long-term growth responses of neonatal ventricular myocytes. The aim of this work was to understand how cellular contact with such a domain affects various mechanical changes involved in cardiac muscle cell remodeling. Myocytes were maintained in 3D gels over 5 days in the presence or absence of 100-\u03bcm-long microrods, and the effect of this local heterogeneity on cell behavior was analyzed via several imaging techniques. Microrod abutment resulted in approximately twofold increases in the maximum displacement of spontaneously beating myocytes, as based on confocal microscopy scans of the gel xy-plane or the myocyte long axis. In addition, microrods caused significant increases in the proportion of aligned myofibrils (\u226420\u00b0 deviation from long axis) in fixed myocytes. Microrod-related differences in axial contraction could be abrogated by long-term interruption of certain signals of the RhoA-/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) or protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Furthermore, microrod-induced increases in myocyte size and protein content were prevented by ROCK inhibition. In all, the data suggest that microdomain heterogeneity in 3D appears to promote the development of axially aligned contractile machinery in muscle cells, an observation that may have relevance to a number of cardiac tissue engineering interventions.", "journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "date": "2012-03-13", "authors": ["Matthew WCurtis", "ElisaBudyn", "Tejal ADesai", "Allen MSamarel", "BrendaRussell"], "doi": "10.1007/s10237-012-0384-9\n10.1002/bit.23353"}

Electron and fluorescence microscopy revealed altered morphology of the Opa1(+/-) mice mitochondrial network; unexpectedly, mitochondria were larger with the presence of clusters of fused mitochondria and altered cristae. In permeabilized mutant ventricular fibres, mitochondrial functional properties were maintained, but direct energy channelling between mitochondria and myofilaments was weakened. Importantly, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) opening in isolated permeabilized cardiomyocytes and in isolated mitochondria was significantly less sensitive to mitochondrial calcium accumulation. Finally, 6 weeks after transversal aortic constriction, Opa1(+/-) hearts demonstrated hypertrophy almost two-fold higher (P< 0.01) than in wild-type mice with altered ejection fraction (decrease in 43 vs. 22% in Opa1(+/+) mice, P< 0.05).\nThese results suggest that, in adult cardiomyocytes, OPA1 plays an important role in mitochondrial morphology and PTP functioning.

Unlike the synthesized PGS2:2 elastomers, the PGS2:5 materials were characterized by an overall mechanical instability in their loading behavior under the three successive loading conditions tested. An oscillatory response in the mechanical properties of the synthesized elastomers was observed throughout the loading cycles, with measured increased storage modulus values at the first loading cycle, stabilizing to lower values at subsequent cycles. These elastomers were characterized at 4 \u00b0C and were found to have storage modulus values of 850 and 1430 kPa at the third loading cycle, respectively, in agreement with previously reported values of the rat and human myocardium.

{"title": "M3 subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor promotes cardioprotection via the suppression of miR-376b-5p.", "abstract": "The M(3) subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M(3)-mAChR) plays a protective role in myocardial ischemia and microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in many cardiac pathophysiological processes, including ischemia-induced cardiac injury. However, the role of miRNAs in M(3)-mAChR mediated cardioprotection remains unexplored. The present study was designed to identify miRNAs that are involved in cardioprotective effects of M(3)-mAChR against myocardial ischemia and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We established rat model of myocardial ischemia and performed miRNA microarray analysis to identify miRNAs involved in the cardioprotection of M(3)-mAChR. In H9c2 cells, the viability, intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), miR-376b-5p expression level, brain derived neurophic factor (BDNF) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) levels were measured. Our results demonstrated that M(3)-mAChR protected myocardial ischemia injury. Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR revealed that miR-376b-5p was significantly up-regulated in ischemic heart tissue and the M(3)-mAChRs agonist choline reversed its up-regulation. In vitro, miR-376b-5p promoted H(2)O(2)-induced H9c2 cell injuries measured by cells viability, [Ca(2+)]i and ROS. Western blot and luciferase assay identified BDNF as a direct target of miR-376b-5p. M(3)-mAChR activated NF-\u03baB and thereby inhibited miR-376b-5p expression. Our data show that a novel M(3)-mAChR/NF-\u03baB/miR-376b-5p/BDNF axis plays an important role in modulating cardioprotection. MiR-376b-5p promotes myocardial ischemia injury possibly by inhibiting BDNF expression and M(3)-mAChR provides cardioprotection at least partially mediated by the downregulation of miR-376b-5p through NF-\u03baB. These findings provide new insight into the potential mechanism by which M(3)-mAChR provides cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia injury.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-03-08", "authors": ["ZhenyuPan", "YuepingGuo", "HanpingQi", "KaiFan", "ShuWang", "HuaZhao", "YuhuaFan", "JingXie", "FengGuo", "YunlongHou", "NingWang", "RongHuo", "YongZhang", "YanLiu", "ZhiminDu"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0032571"}
{"title": "Ischemic cardiac tissue conditioned media induced differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into early stage cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent, can be easily expanded in culture and hence are an attractive therapeutic tool for cardiac repair. MSCs have tremendous potential to transdifferentiate to cardiac lineage both in vitro and in vivo. The present study examined the differentiation capacity of conditioned media derived from ischemic cardiac tissue on human MSCs. Human Bone marrow-derived MSCs after due characterization by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry for MSC specific markers were induced by culture media derived from ischemic (n\u00a0=\u00a013) and non-ischemic (n\u00a0=\u00a018) human cardiac tissue. Parallel cultures were treated with 5-azacytidine (5-azaC), a potent cardiomyogen. MSCs induced with ischemic conditioned media formed myotube like structures, expressed sarcomeric Troponin I, alpha myosin heavy chain proteins and were positive for cardiac specific markers (Nkx2.5, human atrial natriuretic peptide, myosin light chain-2a, GATA-4) as was observed in 5-azaC treated cells. However, uninduced MSCs as well as those induced with non-ischemic cardiac conditioned media still maintained the fibroblast morphology even after 3\u00a0weeks post-induction. Transmission electron microscopic studies of cardiomyocyte-like cells derived from MSCs revealed presence of sarcomeric bands but failed to show gap junctions and intercalated discs as of adult cardiomyocytes. These findings demonstrate that ischemic cardiac conditioned media induces morphological and molecular changes in MSCs with cardiac features, but at a primitive stage. Proteomics analysis of the ischemic conditioned media revealed differential expression of three relevant proteins (C-type lectin superfamily member 13, Testis-specific chromodomain protein Y2 and ADP/ATP translocase 1), whose exact role in cardiac regeneration needs further analysis.", "journal": "Cytotechnology", "date": "2012-03-08", "authors": ["BalasundariRamesh", "Dillip KumarBishi", "SuneelRallapalli", "SarasabarathiArumugam", "Kotturathu MammenCherian", "SomaGuhathakurta"], "doi": "10.1007/s10616-012-9440-7\n10.1510/icvts.2007.157875\n10.1056/NEJM200106073442303\n10.1016/j.biocel.2003.10.018\n10.1038/sj.bmt.1703940\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)02933-9\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.12.022\n10.1073/pnas.91.25.11797\n10.1056/NEJM200003023420904\n10.1159/000102000\n10.1073/pnas.152302499\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2004.01.002\n10.1161/hc0102.101442\n10.1074/jbc.M609350200\n10.1136/hrt.2004.038224\n10.1002/prot.22472"}
{"title": "Vascular and mesenchymal factors during heart development: a chronological study.", "abstract": "As heart development is an incomplete described area, and likewise an important source of intra- and post-partum morbidity and mortality, we have aimed at analyzing both vascular and cytoskeletal factors during early heart development in humans. The distribution of CD105, CD31, \u03b1-SMA, vimentin and desmin have been studied on a series of normal human heart tissues varying between five and 33 weeks of gestational age, utilizing both enzymatic single immunohistochemistry, as well as double immunofluorescence. We showed here that CD105 is already expressed at five weeks of gestational age in the future endocardium, and that between 9 and 10 weeks it shows clear-cut formed vessels. CD31 was also present diffusely at five weeks in the myocardium, while beginning with seven weeks, endocardium and vessels were clearly positive. Contrary to what it might be expected for striated muscle cells, cardiomyocytes were \u03b1-SMA positive between 9 and 20 weeks, a time window during which the marker showed clear-cut sarcomer formation. Desmin was first detected at nine weeks lining the cardiomyocyte plasma membrane, and after 17 weeks it showed the adult-like striated pattern of the protein. As expected, vimentin was already present in the mesenchymal cells from the first investigated time point, retaining a perivascular localization only towards higher ages.

We observed significant telomere shortening in liver and cardiac tissues in sedentary 1-year-old mice compared with young (8 weeks) baseline mice that were attenuated in exercised 1-year-old animals. In contrast, skeletal muscle exhibited significant telomere shortening in exercise mice compared with sedentary and young mice. Telomerase enzyme activity was increased in skeletal muscle of exercise compared with sedentary animals but was similar in cardiac and liver tissues. We observed significant age-related decreases in expression of telomere-related genes that were attenuated by exercise in cardiac and skeletal muscle but not liver. Protein content of TRF1 was significantly increased in plantaris muscle with age. In summary, long-term exercise altered telomere dynamics, slowing age-related decreases in telomere length in cardiac and liver tissue but contributing to shortening in exercised skeletal muscle.", "journal": "The journals of gerontology.

{"title": "Altered expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and improved myocardial energetic state during late ischemic preconditioning.", "abstract": "Altered expression of mitochondrial electron transport proteins has been shown in early preconditioned myocardial tissue. We wished to determine whether these alterations persist in the Second Window of Protection (SWOP) and if so, whether a favorable energetic state is facilitated during subsequent ischemia. Fourteen pigs underwent a SWOP protocol with ten 2-minute balloon inflations in the LAD artery, each separated by 2 minutes reperfusion. Twenty-four hours later, mitochondria were isolated from SWOP and SHAM pig hearts and analyzed for uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 content by western blot analysis, proteomic changes by iTRAQ(\u00ae) and respiration by an oxygen electrode. In parallel in vivo studies, high-energy nucleotides were obtained by transmural biopsy from anesthetized SWOP and SHAM pigs at baseline and during sustained low-flow ischemia. Compared with SHAM mitochondria, ex vivo SWOP heart tissue demonstrated increased expression of UCP-2, Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and Complex V (ATPase) proteins. In comparison with SHAM pigs during in vivo conditions, transmural energetics in SWOP hearts, as estimated by the free energy of ATP hydrolysis (\u0394G(0)), were similar at baseline but had decreased by the end of low-flow ischemia (-57.0 \u00b1 2.1 versus -51.1 \u00b1 1.4 kJ/mol; P < 0.05). In conclusion, within isolated mitochondria from preconditioned SWOP hearts, UCP-2 is increased and in concert with enhanced Complex IV and V proteins, imparts a favorable energetic state during low-flow ischemia. These data support the notion that mitochondrial adaptations that may reduce oxidant damage do not reduce the overall efficiency of energetics during sustained oxygen deprivation.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We hypothesized that xanthine oxidase-inhibitor allopurinol (ALP) may decrease hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, ameliorate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis, and attenuate the development of left ventricle (LV) diastolic dysfunction in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes.\nControl Sprague Dawley (C) or streptozotocin-induced diabetic (D) rats were either untreated or treated with allopurinol (100 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks starting at 1 week after streptozotocin injection.

The cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin-stained paraffin-embedded sections of LVs. Myocardial collagens I and III were assessed by immunol histochemistry and Western blotting. Echocardiography was performed to characterize cardiac structure and function.\nIn diabetic rats, both plasma and cardiac tissue levels of free 15-F2t-isoprostane were increased (p < 0.05 vs. control), accompanied with significant increase (p < 0.05 vs. control) in cross-section area and myocardial collagen deposition of LV cardiomyocyte. Echocardiography in diabetic rats showed that LV weight/body weight ratio was significantly higher than in control rats, whereas the levels of LV end-diastolic volume and stroke volume were decreased (all p < 0.05 diabetic vs. control).

The aim of this study was to establish a quantitative proteomics analysis of FFPE tissue by combining the label-free approach with optimised protein extraction and separation conditions. As a model system we used FFPE heart tissue of control and exposed C57BL/6 mice after total body irradiation using a gamma ray dose of 3 gray.

This study investigated the concomitant changes occurring in heart tissue and tumors of mice bearing a subcutaneous 4T1 mammary tumor following treatment with AN-7, Dox, or their combination. Dox or AN-7 alone led to inhibition of both tumor growth and lung metastases, whereas their combination significantly increased their anticancer efficacy and attenuated Dox- toxicity. Molecular analysis revealed that treatment with Dox, AN-7, and to a greater degree, AN-7 together with Dox increased tumor levels of \u03b3H2AX, the marker for DNA double-strand breaks and decreased the expression of Rad51, a protein needed for DNA repair. These events culminated in increased apoptosis, manifested by the appearance of cytochrome-c in the cytosol. In the myocardium, Dox-induced cardiomyopathy was associated with an increase in \u03b3H2AX expression and a reduction in Rad51 and MRE11 expression and increased apoptosis. The addition of AN-7 to the Dox treatment protected the heart from Dox insults as was manifested by a decrease in \u03b3H2AX levels, an increase in Rad51 and MRE11 expression, and a diminution of cytochrome-c release. Tumor fibrosis was high in untreated mice but diminished in Dox- and AN-7-treated mice and was almost abrogated in AN-7+Dox-treated mice. By contrast, in the myocardium, Dox alone induced a dramatic increase in fibrosis, and AN7+Dox attenuated it. The high expression levels of c-Kit, Ki-67, c-Myc, lo-FGF, and VEGF in 4T1 tumors were significantly reduced by Dox or AN-7 and further attenuated by AN-7+Dox. In the myocardium, Dox suppressed these markers, whereas AN-7+Dox restored their expression.

The current study describes the first such mouse model--a fetal myocardial environment grafted into the adult kidney capsule. Here it is used to test whether cells descended from bone marrow can regenerate cardiac myocytes. One week after receiving the fetal heart grafts, recipients were lethally irradiated and transplanted with marrow from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing C57Bl/6J (B6) donors using normal B6 recipients and fetal donors. Levels of myocyte regeneration from GFP marrow within both fetal myocardium and adult hearts of recipients were evaluated histologically. Fetal myocardium transplants had rich neovascularization and beat regularly after 2 weeks, continuing at checkpoints of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and12 months after transplantation. At each time point, GFP-expressing rod-shaped myocytes were found in the fetal myocardium, but only a few were found in the adult hearts. The average count of repopulated myocardium with green rod-shaped myocytes was 996.8 cells per gram of fetal myocardial tissue, and 28.7 cells per adult heart tissue, representing a thirty-five fold increase in fetal myocardium compared to the adult heart at 12 months (when numbers of green rod-shaped myocytes were normalized to per gram of myocardial tissue). Thus, bone marrow cells can differentiate to myocytes in the fetal myocardial environment.

According to our findings, most stable reference genes in the RV and RR were hmbs/hprt and hmbs/tbp/hprt respectively. In the IRR, six reference genes were recommended for normalization purposes; however, in view of experimental feasibility limitations, target gene expression could be normalized against the three most stable reference genes (ywhaz/pabp/hmbs) without loss of sensitivity.

{"title": "Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury: from basic science to clinical bedside.", "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury contributes to adverse cardiovascular outcomes after myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery or circulatory arrest. Primarily, no blood flow to the heart causes an imbalance between oxygen demand and supply, named ischemia (from the Greek isch, restriction; and haema, blood), resulting in damage or dysfunction of the cardiac tissue. Instinctively, early and fast restoration of blood flow has been established to be the treatment of choice to prevent further tissue injury. Indeed, the use of thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the most effective strategy for reducing the size of a myocardial infarct and improving the clinical outcome. Unfortunately, restoring blood flow to the ischemic myocardium, named reperfusion, can also induce injury. This phenomenon was therefore termed myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. Subsequent studies in animal models of acute myocardial infarction suggest that myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury accounts for up to 50% of the final size of a myocardial infarct. Consequently, many researchers aim to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury to find therapeutic strategies ultimately reducing the final infarct size. Despite the identification of numerous therapeutic strategies at the bench, many of them are just in the process of being translated to bedside.

This results in decreased left ventricular E/A ratio. Doppler imaging showed no significant differences in E/A ratios (p = .48) among old (18-20 years) breeders and nonbreeders despite differences in estrogen levels. A cross-sectional study of 1- to 20-year-old naked mole rats (n = 76) revealed that E/A ratios declined with age in females (n = 40; p = .002) but not in males (n = 36; p = 0.45).

Using a sensitive HPLC detection system, 5-HT was also detectable in the mouse heart and human atrium. Furthermore, we could identify 5-HT in isolated cardiomyocytes from adult mice. These findings were supported by detection of the activity of 5-HT-forming enzymes-tryptophan hydroxylase and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase-in isolated cardiomyocytes from adult mice and by inhibition of these enzymes with p-chlorophenylalanine and 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine.

When we compared Ca(+2) handling proteins according to HF aetiology, ICM showed higher levels of calmodulin (24%, p<0.01), calcineurin (26%, p<0.01) and Ca(2+)/Calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII\u03b4(b) nuclear isoform 62%, p<0.001) than the CNT group. However, these proteins in DCM did not significantly increase. Furthermore, ICM showed a significant elevation in MEF2C (33%, p<0.01), and GATA4 (49%, p<0.05); also NFAT1 (66%, p<0.001) was increased, producing the resultant translocation of this transcriptional factor into the nuclei. These results were supported by fluorescence and electron microscopy analysis. Whereas, DCM only had a significant increase in GATA4 (52%, p<0.05). Correlations between NFAT1 and MEF2C in both groups (ICM r\u200a=\u200a0.38 and DCM r\u200a=\u200a0.59, p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively) were found; only ICM showed a correlation between GATA4 and NFAT1 (r\u200a=\u200a0.37, p<0.05).\nThis study shows an increase of Ca(2+) handling machinery synthesis and their cardiac transcription pathways in HF, being more markedly increased in ICM. Furthermore, there is a significant association between MEF2, NFAT1 and GATA4. These proteins could be therapeutic targets to improve myocardial function.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-03-01", "authors": ["RaquelCort\u00e9s", "MiguelRivera", "EstherRosell\u00f3-Llet\u00ed", "LuisMart\u00ednez-Dolz", "LuisAlmenar", "InmaculadaAzor\u00edn", "FranciscaLago", "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3nGonz\u00e1lez-Juanatey", "ManuelPortol\u00e9s"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0030915"}

Self-organizing EHT can be generated in fiber form, which makes the assessment of contractile function convenient with a force transducer. Contractile function is a key parameter of EHT performance. Analysis of EHT force data is often performed manually; however, this approach is time consuming, incomplete and subjective. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a computer algorithm to efficiently and objectively analyze EHT force data. This algorithm incorporates data filtering, individual contraction detection and validation, inter/intracontractile analysis and intersample analysis. We found the algorithm to be accurate in contraction detection, validation and magnitude measurement as compared to human operators. The algorithm was efficient in processing hundreds of data acquisitions and was able to determine force-length curves, force-frequency relationships and compare various contractile parameters such as peak systolic force generation. We conclude that this computer algorithm is a key adjunct to the objective and efficient assessment of EHT contractile function.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2012-03-01", "authors": ["GrantMathews", "ClausSondergaard", "AngelaJeffreys", "WilliamChilds", "Bao LinhLe", "AmritSahota", "SkenderNajibi", "JanNolta", "Ming-SingSi"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2012.2187899"}
{"title": "Retrograde perfusion and filling of mouse coronary vasculature as preparation for micro computed tomography imaging.", "abstract": "Visualization of the vasculature is becoming increasingly important for understanding many different disease states. While several techniques exist for imaging vasculature, few are able to visualize the vascular network as a whole while extending to a resolution that includes the smaller vessels. Additionally, many vascular casting techniques destroy the surrounding tissue, preventing further analysis of the sample. One method which circumvents these issues is micro-Computed Tomography (\u03bcCT). \u03bcCT imaging can scan at resolutions <10 microns, is capable of producing 3D reconstructions of the vascular network, and leaves the tissue intact for subsequent analysis (e.g., histology and morphometry). However, imaging vessels by ex vivo \u03bcCT methods requires that the vessels be filled with a radiopaque compound. As such, the accurate representation of vasculature produced by \u03bcCT imaging is contingent upon reliable and complete filling of the vessels. In this protocol, we describe a technique for filling mouse coronary vessels in preparation for \u03bcCT imaging. Two predominate techniques exist for filling the coronary vasculature: in vivo via cannulation and retrograde perfusion of the aorta (or a branch off the aortic arch), or ex vivo via a Langendorff perfusion system. Here we describe an in vivo aortic cannulation method which has been specifically designed to ensure filling of all vessels. We use a low viscosity radiopaque compound called Microfil which can perfuse through the smallest vessels to fill all the capillaries, as well as both the arterial and venous sides of the vascular network. Vessels are perfused with buffer using a pressurized perfusion system, and then filled with Microfil. To ensure that Microfil fills the small higher resistance vessels, we ligate the large branches emanating from the aorta, which diverts the Microfil into the coronaries. Once filling is complete, to prevent the elastic nature of cardiac tissue from squeezing Microfil out of some vessels, we ligate accessible major vascular exit points immediately after filling. Therefore, our technique is optimized for complete filling and maximum retention of the filling agent, enabling visualization of the complete coronary vascular network--arteries, capillaries, and veins alike.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-02-23", "authors": ["Jill JWeyers", "Dara DCarlson", "Charles EMurry", "Stephen MSchwartz", "William MMahoney"], "doi": "10.3791/3740"}

HERG, a potassium channel protein, is a transmembrane protein, which increases in concentration on the cell surface of cancer cells. Apart from cancer cells, this protein is found only in the brain & heart tissue, in very low number. The proliferation of cells in cancer is dependent on activation of this protein, and it has been noted that blocking of this protein with drug molecule, helps inhibit the proliferation of the cells further. The current work aims to study the binding potentials of \u03ba-PVIIA, conotoxin isolated from Conus purpurascens venom with HERG K+ channel of tumor cells, where HERG mutation has been noted. The toxin under consideration i.e. \u03ba-conotoxins-PVIIA (\u03ba-PVIIA) is a 27 residue peptide. The docking studies suggest that the conotoxin binds stably to the HERG protein. The study shows that the peptide interacts with the charged extracellular unit of the HERG protein, i.e. the extracellular portion of the S5 domain named S5-P extracellular linker. Study of binding of toxins of similar origin, with normal potassium channels has been studied in silico.

On the 61st day, the animals were sacrificed, and marker enzymes like lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) were estimated in serum. In the heart tissue sample, antioxidant status, lipid peroxidation and anti-inflammatory properties of AEC were determined. Isoproterenol significantly increased the release of LDH, CK in serum, decreased the antioxidant status in the heart along with an increase in lipid peroxidation. Nitritive stress and apoptosis were seen in isoproterenol-induced rat heart.

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are stable end products of the Maillard reaction, whereby AGE accumulation is considered not only a biomarker of aging but is also associated with several degenerative diseases. AGEs are recognized by several receptor molecules of which the receptor of AGEs (RAGE) is currently the most intensively studied receptor. Activation of RAGE causes an unfavorable proinflammatory state and deletion of RAGE in diabetic animals has been reported to protect against atherosclerosis. AGEs and a high fat diet are associated with cardiovascular diseases, whereas is still not clear whether a direct link between high fat nutrition and AGEs exists in vivo.\nC57BL/6 and C57BL/6 RAGE\u00a0-/- mice were fed a high fat diet to induce obesity. Weight, insulin, lipid levels, AGE modifications, and cardiac gene expression were analyzed.\nThe absence of RAGE resulted in accelerated weight gain, increased plasma cholesterol, and higher insulin levels in obese mice. The hearts of normal and obese RAGE\u00a0-/- mice contained lower levels of the AGE arginine-pyrimidine and 3DG-imidazolone than RAGE\u00a0+\u2009/\u2009+ animals.

We studied the time course of %AC in the anterior midleft ventricular wall of normal canine heart in vivo (n = 14) during atrial pacing over the entire cardiac cycle using transmurally implanted markers and biplane cineradiography (8 ms/frame). %AC was calculated as the myocardial area change relative to the elemental material area on the circumferential-longitudinal plane at the reference configuration (=end diastole). %AC was compared with %\u03bb(f) that was determined from the transmural fiber orientation directly measured in the heart tissue. The time course of both %AC and %\u03bb(f) was determined in the subepicardial, midwall, and subendocardial layers. The time course of %AC and %\u03bb(f) was significantly different, and the difference was more pronounced towards the endocardium. %AC consistently overestimated %\u03bb(f). The timing of the peak %AC was significantly delayed compared to that of the peak %\u03bb(f). We conclude that %AC is significantly different from %\u03bb(f) both in magnitude and timing in vivo. %AC overestimates %\u03bb(f), and the overestimation is worse toward the endocardial layers.

Histological studies confirmed the damage due to cadmium.

Treatment of rats with cadmium also caused alterations in the activities of mitochondrial Kreb's cycle as well as respiratory chain enzymes. All these changes were ameliorated when the rats were pre-treated with an aqueous extract of Curry leaf (Murraya koenigii).

Punctures were performed without the use of electrocautery and by delivering radiofrequency energy to the transseptal needle using a standard electrocautery pen at 3 target sites (fossa ovalis, non-fossa ovalis septum, and aorta). The tissue of the submerged heart was gently tented, and the needle was advanced on delivery of radiofrequency. The devices were retracted, and the needle was flushed in a collection basin. None of the TSPs without cautery caused tissue coring. For TSPs using electrocautery, the frequency of coring was at least 21% for any puncture permutation used in the study and averaged 37% at septal sites (P<0.001 compared with punctures without cautery). Tissue coring occurred in 33 of 96 (35%) punctures through the fossa ovalis and in 38 of 96 (40%) punctures through non-fossa ovalis septum. The frequency of tissue coring at aortic sites was 62 of 96 (65%), which was significantly higher than at the septal sites (P<0.001).\nIn an animal preparation, TSP at the level of the fossa ovalis using electrocautery and a standard open-ended Brockenbrough needle resulted in coring of the septal tissue in 35% of cases (33 of 96 punctures).", "journal": "Circulation.

It has been suggested that amlodipine inhibits oxidative stress. In this study, we evaluated the effects of amlodipine on the total antioxidant capacity of heart tissue and blood in 36 control and cholesterol-fed male New Zealand white rabbits.\nThe rabbits were divided into four groups (n = 9). Group 1 rabbits were fed a regular diet, group 2 were fed a diet with 2% cholesterol, group 3 were fed a regular diet plus 5 mg/kg/day oral amlodipine, and group 4 were fed 2% cholesterol diet plus amlodipine 5 mg/kg/day. At the end of eight weeks, blood samples were drawn and at the same time heart tissue was isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After homogenisation, the solution was centrifuged and the light supernatant was stored at -80\u00b0C. This was used for determination of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and (MDA) levels.\nEight weeks of amlodipine treatment significantly reduced the levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides in the group on the hypercholesterolaemic diet (p < 0.05). In the blood, the level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances increased in the rabbits on the 2% cholesterol diet (group 2) and 2% cholesterol-plusamlodipine diet (group 4) and decreased in the amlodipineonly group (group 3) (p < 0.05). Lipid peroxidation in the heart tissue was similar to that in the blood, except in the amlodipine-only group (group 3).

{"title": "Disparities in the association of the ryanodine receptor and the FK506-binding proteins in mammalian heart.", "abstract": "The FK506-binding proteins (FKBP12 and FKBP12.6; also known as FKBP1A and FKBP1B, respectively) are accessory subunits of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca(2+) release channel. Aberrant RyR2-FKBP12.6 interactions have been proposed to be the underlying cause of channel dysfunction in acquired and inherited cardiac disease. However, the stoichiometry of the RyR2 association with FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 in mammalian heart is currently unknown. Here, we describe detailed quantitative analysis of cardiac stoichiometry between RyR2 and FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 using immunoblotting and [(3)H]ryanodine-binding assays, revealing striking disparities between four mammalian species. In mouse and pig heart, RyR2 is found complexed with both FKBP12 and FKBP12.6, although the former is the most abundant isoform. In rat heart, RyR2 is predominantly associated with FKBP12.6, whereas in rabbit it is associated with FKBP12 only. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate RyR2-specific interaction with both FKBP isoforms in native cardiac tissue. Assuming four FKBP-binding sites per RyR2 tetramer, only a small proportion of available sites are occupied by endogenous FKBP12.6. FKBP interactions with RyR2 are very strong and resistant to drug (FK506, rapamycin and cyclic ADPribose) and redox (H(2)O(2) and diamide) treatment. By contrast, the RyR1-FKBP12 association in skeletal muscle is readily disrupted under oxidative conditions. This is the first study to directly assess association of endogenous FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 with RyR2 in native cardiac tissue. Our results challenge the widespread perception that RyR2 associates exclusively with FKBP12.6 to near saturation, with important implications for the role of the FK506-binding proteins in RyR2 pathophysiology and cardiac disease.", "journal": "Journal of cell science", "date": "2012-02-14", "authors": ["SpyrosZissimopoulos", "SaraSeifan", "ChloeMaxwell", "Alan JWilliams", "F AnthonyLai"], "doi": "10.1242/jcs.098012"}

Macaques often develop myocardial fibrosis with age, which can result in the loss of normal cardiac architecture with the expansion of the extracellular matrix and deposition of collagen. The etiology and pathogenesis of this pernicious process is poorly understood. Cardiac fibrosis was assessed using histologic and immunohistochemical techniques in cardiac tissue sections from 34 rhesus macaques. Overall left ventricular and left ventricular mid-myocardial interstitial/perivascular fibrosis were positively correlated with age (r = .6522, p < .0001 and r = .4704, p = .005, respectively). When divided into young (mean = 2.8 years), middle-aged (mean = 17.5 years), and advanced age (mean = 29.2 years) groups, immunophenotypic characterization of antigen presenting cells revealed differential expression of CD163 and DC-SIGN between the young and middle-aged groups compared to the advanced age group (p < .0001). HAM-56 expression decreased significantly in the advanced age cohort (p = .0021).

However, the molecular mechanism that links diabetes to cardiomyopathy is incompletely understood. Insulin resistance is a hallmark feature of diabetes, and the FoxO family of transcription factors, which regulate cell size, viability, and metabolism, are established targets of insulin and growth factor signaling. Here, we set out to evaluate a possible role of FoxO proteins in diabetic cardiomyopathy. We found that FoxO proteins were persistently activated in cardiac tissue in mice with diabetes induced either genetically or by high-fat diet (HFD). FoxO activity was critically linked with development of cardiomyopathy: cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of FoxO1 rescued HFD-induced declines in cardiac function and preserved cardiomyocyte insulin responsiveness. FoxO1-depleted cells displayed a shift in their metabolic substrate usage, from free fatty acids to glucose, associated with decreased accumulation of lipids in the heart. Furthermore, we found that FoxO1-dependent downregulation of IRS1 resulted in blunted Akt signaling and insulin resistance.

{"title": "The statistics of calcium-mediated focal excitations on a one-dimensional cable.", "abstract": "It is well known that various cardiac arrhythmias are initiated by an ill-timed excitation that originates from a focal region of the heart. However, up to now, it is not known what governs the timing, location, and morphology of these focal excitations. Recent studies have shown that these excitations can be caused by abnormalities in the calcium (Ca) cycling system. However, the cause-and-effect relationships linking subcellular Ca dynamics and focal activity in cardiac tissue is not completely understood. In this article, we present a minimal model of Ca-mediated focal excitations in cardiac tissue. This model accounts for the stochastic nature of spontaneous Ca release on a one-dimensional cable of cardiac cells. Using this model, we show that the timing of focal excitations is equivalent to a first passage time problem in a spatially extended system. In particular, we find that for a short cable the mean first passage time increases exponentially with the number of cells in tissue, and is critically dependent on the ratio of inward to outward currents near the threshold for an action potential. For long cables excitations occurs due to ectopic foci that occur on a length scale determined by the minimum length of tissue that can induce an action potential. Furthermore, we find that for long cables the mean first passage time decreases as a power law in the number cells. These results provide precise criteria for the occurrence of focal excitations in cardiac tissue, and will serve as a guide to determine the propensity of Ca-mediated triggered arrhythmias in the heart.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2012-02-14", "authors": ["WeiChen", "MesfinAsfaw", "YohannesShiferaw"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2011.12.045"}

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EMF on heart tissue by biochemical and histomorphological evaluations in EMF-exposed adult rats. In this study, 28 male Wistar rats weighing 200-250\u00a0g were used. The rats were divided into two groups: sham group (n\u00a0=\u00a014) and EMF group (n\u00a0=\u00a014). Rats in sham group were exposed to same conditions as the EMF group except the exposure to EMF. Rats in EMF group were exposed to a 50-Hz EMF of 3\u00a0mT for 4\u00a0h/day and 7\u00a0days/week for 2\u00a0months. After 2\u00a0months of exposure, rats were killed; the hearts were excised and evaluated. Determination of oxidative stress parameters was performed spectrophotometrically. To detect apoptotic cells, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and caspase-3 immunohistochemistry were performed. In EMF-exposed group, levels of lipid peroxidation significantly increased and activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase decreased compared with sham group. The number of TUNEL-positive cells and caspase-3 immunoreactivity increased in EMF-exposed rats compared with sham. Under electron microscopy, there were mitochondrial degeneration, reduction in myofibrils, dilated sarcoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear vacuolization in EMF-exposed rats. In conclusion, the results show that the exposure to EMF causes oxidative stress, apoptosis and morphologic damage in myocardium of adult rats.

We designed a computer controlled system capable of simultaneous fluorescence mapping and HIFU ablation. Using this system, linear lesions were created in isolated rabbit atria (n=6), and point lesions were created in the ventricles of whole-heart (n=6) preparations by applying HIFU at clinical doses (4-16 W). Additionally, we evaluate the gap size in ablation lines necessary for conduction in atrial preparations (n=4). The voltage sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS was used to assess functional damage produced by HIFU. Optical coherence tomography and general histology were used to evaluate lesion extent. Conduction block was achieved in 1 (17%) of 6 atrial preparations with a single ablation line. Following 10 minutes of rest, 0 (0%) of 6 atrial preparations demonstrated sustained conduction block from a single ablation line. Tissue displacement of 1 to 3 mm was observed during HIFU application due to acoustic radiation force along the lesion line. Additionally, excessive acoustic pressure and high temperature from HIFU generated cavitation, causing macroscopic tissue damage. A minimum gap size of 1.5 mm was found to conduct electric activity.\nThis study identified 3 potential mechanisms responsible for the failure of HIFU ablation in cardiac tissues.

The disease is characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities, as well as predisposition to malignancies. Our recent observation that heart tissue from patients with Costello syndrome showed a loss of the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) inspired our present study aimed to explore a functional involvement of the chondroitin sulfate (CS) biosynthesis gene Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11/Chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase-1 (CHST11/C4ST-1), as well as an impaired chondroitin sulfation balance, as a downstream mediator of oncogenic HRAS in Costello syndrome. Here we demonstrate a loss of C4S, as well as a reduction in C4ST-1 mRNA and protein expression, in primary fibroblasts from Costello syndrome patients. We go on to show that expression of oncogenic HRAS in normal fibroblasts can repress C4ST-1 expression, whereas interference with oncogenic HRAS signaling in Costello syndrome fibroblasts elevated C4ST-1 expression, thus identifying C4ST-1 as a negatively regulated target gene of HRAS signaling. Importantly, we show that forced expression of C4ST-1 in Costello fibroblasts could rescue the proliferation and elastogenesis defects associated with oncogenic HRAS signaling in these cells. Our results indicate reduced C4ST-1 expression and chondroitin sulfation imbalance mediating the effects of oncogenic HRAS signaling in the pathogenesis of Costello syndrome.

For obvious reasons, the heart has been taken as the primary target for this METH-induced toxicity. The demonstration that failure of brain stem cardiovascular regulation, rather than the heart, holds the key to cardiovascular collapse induced by the pesticide mevinphos implicates another potential underlying mechanism. The present study evaluated the hypothesis that METH effects acute cardiovascular depression by dampening the functional integrity of baroreflex via an action on brain stem nuclei that are associated with this homeostatic mechanism.\nThe distribution of METH in brain and heart on intravenous administration in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and the resultant changes in arterial pressure (AP), heart rate (HR) and indices for baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone and cardiac responses were evaluated, alongside survival rate and time.\nIntravenous administration of METH (12 or 24 mg/kg) resulted in a time-dependent and dose-dependent distribution of the psychostimulant in brain and heart. The distribution of METH to neural substrates associated with brain stem cardiovascular regulation was significantly larger than brain targets for its neurological and psychological effects; the concentration of METH in cardiac tissues was the lowest among all tissues studied. In animals that succumbed to METH, the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone and cardiac response were defunct, concomitant with cessation of AP and HR. On the other hand, although depressed, those two indices in animals that survived were maintained, alongside sustainable AP and HR. Linear regression analysis further revealed that the degree of dampening of brain stem cardiovascular regulation was positively and significantly correlated with the concentration of METH in key neural substrate involved in this homeostatic mechanism.\nWe conclude that on intravenous administration, METH exhibits a preferential distribution to brain stem nuclei that are associated with cardiovascular regulation. We further found that the concentration of METH in those brain stem sites dictates the extent that baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone and cardiac responses are compromised, which in turn determines survival or fatality because of cardiovascular collapse.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical science", "date": "2012-02-09", "authors": ["Faith C HLi", "J CYen", "Samuel H HChan", "Alice Y WChang"], "doi": "10.1186/1423-0127-19-16\n10.3109/15563659409000444\n10.1016/S0736-4679(99)00009-8\n10.1046/j.1360-0443.2002.00195.x\n10.1002/bmc.225\n10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02894.x\n10.1080/09595230801919460\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5260-06.2007\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.07.052\n10.1007/BF01345245\n10.1016/j.neuint.2009.04.010\n10.2176/nmc.31.49\n10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02231.x\n10.1016/0379-0738(93)90209-S\n10.1007/s11904-005-0016-4\n10.1016/S0024-3205(03)00260-1\n10.1371/journal.pone.0007744\n10.1097/SHK.0b013e3181a71027\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01508.x\n10.1007/BF02974041\n10.1016/S1353-1131(96)90025-5\n10.1016/j.legalmed.2005.12.004\n10.1017/S1461145704005036\n10.1016/0378-4347(92)80529-Y\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030589"}

There is a high unmet medical need for treatment of fungal infections in neonatal patients, who may be at higher risk of infections involving bone, brain, and heart tissues. This in vivo preclinical study investigated anidulafungin distribution in plasma, bone, brain, and heart tissues in neonatal rats. Postnatal day (PND) 4 and PND 8 Fischer (F344/DuCrl) rats were dosed subcutaneously once with anidulafungin (10 mg/kg) or once daily for 5 days (PND 4-8). Plasma and tissue samples were collected and anidulafungin levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The mean plasma Cmax and AUC0-24 values were consistent with single-dose plasma pharmacokinetics (dose normalized) reported previously for adult rats. Observed bone concentrations were similar to plasma concentrations regardless of dosing duration, with bone-to-plasma concentration ratios of approximately 1.0. Heart concentrations were higher than plasma, with heart to plasma concentration ratios of 1.3- to 1.8-fold. Brain concentrations were low after single dose, with brain-to-plasma concentration ratio of approximately 0.23, but increased to approximately 0.71 after 5 days of dosing. Tissue concentrations were nearly identical after single-dose administration in both PND 4 and PND 8 animals, indicating that anidulafungin does not appear to differentially distribute in this period in neonatal rats. In conclusion, anidulafungin distributes to bone, brain, and heart tissues of neonatal rats; such results are supportive of further investigation of efficacy against infections involving bone, brain, and heart tissues.", "journal": "Birth defects research.

Recently, farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR), a member of the metabolic nuclear receptor superfamily, has been demonstrated to be expressed in vascular cells, with important roles in vascular physiology/pathology. However, the potential cardiac function of FXR remains unclear. We investigated the cardiac expression and biological function of FXR.\nFarnesoid-X-receptor was detected in both isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. Natural and synthetic FXR agonists upregulated cardiac FXR expression, stimulated myocyte apoptosis, and reduced myocyte viability dose- and time-dependently. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that FXR agonists disrupted mitochondria, characterized by mitochondrial permeability transition pores activation, mitochondrial potential dissipation, cytochrome c release, and both caspase-9 and -3 activation. Such mitochondrial apoptotic responses were abolished by siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous FXR or pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial death signalling. Furthermore, low levels of FXR were detected in the adult mouse heart, with significant (\u223c2.0-fold) upregulation after myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (MI/R). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of FXR significantly reduced myocardial apoptosis by 29.0-53.4%, decreased infarct size by 23.4-49.7%, and improved cardiac function in ischaemic/reperfused myocardium.\nThese results demonstrate that nuclear receptor FXR acts as a novel functional receptor in cardiac tissue, regulates apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, and contributes to MI/R injury.", "journal": "European heart journal", "date": "2012-02-07", "authors": ["JunPu", "AncaiYuan", "PeirenShan", "ErheGao", "XiaoliangWang", "YajingWang", "Wayne BondLau", "WalterKoch", "Xin-LiangMa", "BenHe"], "doi": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehs011"}

We examined if eph/ephrin could participate in cardiac tissue cyto-organization.\nWe reported the expression of cardiac ephrin-B1 in both endothelial cells and for the first time in CMs where ephrin-B1 localized specifically at the lateral membrane. Ephrin-B1 knock-out (KO) mice progressively developed cardiac tissue disorganization with loss of adult CM rod-shape and sarcomeric and intercalated disk structural disorganization confirmed in CM-specific ephrin-B1 KO mice. CMs lateral membrane exhibited abnormal structure by electron microscopy and notably increased stiffness by atomic force microscopy. In wild-type CMs, ephrin-B1 interacted with claudin-5/ZO-1 complex at the lateral membrane, whereas the complex disappeared in KO/CM-specific ephrin-B1 KO mice. Ephrin-B1 deficiency resulted in decreased mRNA expression of CM basement membrane components and disorganized fibrillar collagen matrix, independently of classical integrin/dystroglycan system. KO/CM-specific ephrin-B1 KO mice exhibited increased left ventricle diameter and delayed atrioventricular conduction. Under pressure overload stress, KO mice were prone to death and exhibited striking tissue disorganization. Finally, failing CMs displayed downregulated ephrin-B1/claudin-5 gene expression linearly related to the ejection fraction.\nEphrin-B1 is necessary for cardiac tissue architecture cohesion by stabilizing the adult CM morphology through regulation of its lateral membrane.

Hence, we investigated its pro-arrhythmic potential in various in vitro models.\nPro-arrhythmic effects of terfenadine were investigated in rabbit isolated hearts and left ventricular wedge preparations.

In both the rabbit left ventricular wedge and heart preparations, terfenadine at 1 \u00b5M only slightly prolonged the QT- and JT-intervals but at 10 \u00b5M, it caused a marked widening of the QRS complex, cardiac wavelength shortening, incidences of in-excitability and non-TdP-like ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) without prolongation of the QT/JT-interval. At 10 \u00b5M terfenadine elicited a lower incidence of early afterdepolarizations versus non- Torsades de Pointes (TdP)-like VT/VF (100% incidence), and did not induce TdPs. Although the concentration of terfenadine in the tissue-bath was low, it accumulated within the heart tissue.\nOur data suggest that: (i) the induction of non-TdP-like VT/VF, which is caused by slowing of conduction via blockade of I(Na) (like Class Ic flecainide), may constitute a more important risk for terfenadine-induced cardiac death; (ii) although terfenadine is a potent hERG blocker, the risk for non-TdP-like VT/VF exceeds the risk for TdPs; and (iii) cardiac wavelength (\u03bb) could serve as a biomarker to predict terfenadine-induced VT/VF.", "journal": "British journal of pharmacology", "date": "2012-02-04", "authors": ["Hua RongLu", "An NHermans", "David JGallacher"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.01880.x"}

Because most heparin-binding growth factor activities are regulated by GAGs, structural and functional alterations of these polysaccharides may consequently affect the integrity of tissues during critical physiological and pathological processes. Here, we investigated whether the aging process can induce changes in the myocardial GAG composition in rats and whether these changes can affect the activities of particular heparin-binding growth factors known to sustain cardiac tissue integrity. Our results showed an age-dependent increase of GAG levels in the left ventricle. Biochemical and immunohistological studies pointed out heparan sulfates (HS) as the GAG species that increased with age. ELISA-based competition assays showed altered capacities of the aged myocardial GAGs to bind FGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF but not HB EGF. Mitogenic assays in cultured cells showed an age-dependent decrease of the elderly GAG capacities to potentiate FGF-2 whereas the potentiating effect on VEGF(165) was increased, as confirmed by augmented angiogenic cell proliferation in Matrigel plugs. Moreover, HS disaccharide analysis showed considerably altered 6-O-sulfation with modest changes in N- and 2-O-sulfations. Together, these findings suggest a physiological significance of HS structural and functional alterations during aging.

We studied highly curved excitation wave fronts in the cardiac tissue culture and found that in the conditions of normal, non-inhibited excitability the curvature effects do not play essential role in the propagation. Neither narrow isthmuses nor sharp corners of the obstacles, being classical objects for production of extremely curved wave front, affect non-inhibited wave propagation. The curvature-related phenomena of the propagation block and wave detachment from the obstacle boundary were observed only after partial suppression of the sodium channels with Lidocaine. Computer simulations confirmed the experimental observations.

Ablation of the Ctr1 high-affinity Cu transporter in flies and mouse cells, mutation of Ctr1, and Cu chelators all reduce the ability of the MAP kinase kinase Mek1 to phosphorylate the MAP kinase Erk. Moreover, mice bearing a cardiac-tissue-specific knockout of Ctr1 are deficient in Erk phosphorylation in cardiac tissue. in vitro investigations reveal that recombinant Mek1 binds two Cu atoms with high affinity and that Cu enhances Mek1 phosphorylation of Erk in a dose-dependent fashion. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggest that Cu is important for promoting the Mek1-Erk physical interaction that precedes the phosphorylation of Erk by Mek1. These results demonstrate a role for Ctr1 and Cu in activating a pathway well known to play a key role in normal physiology and in cancer.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2012-02-01", "authors": ["Michelle LTurski", "Donita CBrady", "Hyung JKim", "Byung-EunKim", "YasuhiroNose", "Christopher MCounter", "Dennis RWinge", "Dennis JThiele"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.05722-11"}

ISO-induced rats showed elevated levels of cardiac troponins T (cTn T) and I (cTn I) and increased activity of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) in serum. Lipid peroxidative markers (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), conjugated dienes (CD) and lipid hydroperoxides (HP)) elevated in the plasma and heart tissue whereas decreased activities of enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR)) in erythrocytes and heart tissue of ISO-induced rats. Non-enzymatic antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E and reduced glutathione (GSH)) levels were decreased significantly in the plasma and heart tissue of ISO-induced rats. Furthermore, ISO-induced rats showed increased DNA fragmentation, upregulations of myocardial pro-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 associated-x (Bax), caspase-3, -8 and -9, cytochrome c, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), Fas and down-regulated expressions of anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL).

{"title": "Finasteride as a potential tool to improve mesenchymal stem cell transplantation for myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy has emerged as a potent therapeutic strategy to improve myocardial infarction. However MSCs therapy encounters a few obstacles regarding the poor viability of the transplanted cells. Therefore, it is important to explore a strategy to enhance post-transplanted MSC viability. To overcome this problem, several protocols were suggested mainly by activating PI3K/Akt pathway. The PI3K/Akt cascade regulates several cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. Finasteride is a specific inhibitor of type II 5\u03b1-reductase; the enzyme converts testosterone (T) to the more potent androgen receptor agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Testosterone is found to stimulate rapid phosphorylation of Akt, and thereby activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. This pathway could lead to decreased apoptosis of the MSCs via increasing the expression of Bcl-2 and reducing Bax expression. It has been also reported that DHT would confine the differentiation capacity of MSCs so that a reduction in DHT levels caused by Finasteride would be accompanied by increased facilitation in differentiation of MSCs to cardiomyocyte by means of the signals originating from the injured cardiac tissue. These mechanisms could propose the potential role for Finasteride to improve the MSCs therapy for myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2012-02-01", "authors": ["Ali MSharifi", "SayehMottaghi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2011.12.021"}

A microbiological study was conducted in 6 naturally infected bucks that had been diagnosed as chronic auricular asymptomatic carriers of Mycoplasma (M.) mycoides subsp. capri (Mmc) more than one year previously. To detect mycoplasmas, cultures and PCR were performed on 46 samples taken from each goat from the cardio-respiratory, digestive, nervous, lymph and genitourinary systems and several joints. Of a total of 274 samples analyzed, 28 were positive for mycoplasmas (10.1%): Mmc was detected in 17 (6.1%), Mycoplasma (M.) agalactiae in 12 (4.3%) and both microorganisms were identified in one of the samples. In all 6 goats, mixed infection was observed despite none being auricular carriers of M. agalactiae. Mycoplasma spp. were identified at 15 different sites; the most frequent sites being the joints (31.2%, 5 positive samples), lymph nodes (25%, 4 positive samples) and respiratory tract (25%, 4 positive samples). Positive results were also obtained in three brain tissue (18.7%), two cardiac tissue (12.5%) and one ileum, urethra, testicle and bulbourethral gland (6.25%) samples. The histopathological findings may suggest the presence of mild chronic conditions in some of the organs where the bacteria were found. Our findings reveal for the first time the capacity of Mmc and M. agalactiae to colonize several other organ systems in chronically naturally infected auricular carriers, possibly representing an added risk factor for the spread of these microorganisms.

However, its clinical use is severely limited by the development of a progressive dose-dependent cardiomyopathy that results in irreversible congestive heart failure. To provide a strategy for constraining or minimizing the cumulative cardiotoxicity of THP, a pirarubicin liposome powder (L-THP) was appropriately prepared, and the cumulative cardiotoxicity of L-THP and free THP (F-THP) were investigated on Sprague-Dawley rats after 3 successive doses. Urinary samples for metabonomic study, serum samples for biochemical assay, and heart samples for histopathology test were collected. As a result, the metabonomics-based findings such as PLS-DA plotting showed minimal metabolic alterations in L-THP as compared to F-THP, and correlated with the changes of serum biochemical assay and cardiac histopathology as measurements of damage to heart tissue. Our results confirm that when encapsulated into liposomes, the cumulative cardiotoxicity of THP can be greatly ameliorated. Lipophilic aglycone metabolites of THP associated with redox cycling are cardiotoxic for the possibility of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Also, metabonomic analysis shows that the successive doses of THP will lead to severe metabolic pathways disturbances in the cell energy production.

We analysed the functional adaptation and structural changes of the right ventricular myocardium, blood vessels, and interstitial tissue 30 days after the increased afterload.\nThe pulmonary artery banding induced an increase in the right ventricular free wall thickness of banded rats when compared with controls, which was mainly justified by an increase in cardiomyocyte area and in the percentage of extracellular fibrosis. The infusion of basic fibroblastic growth factor promotes a more extensive capillary network in banded rats (p < 0.001), which modulates the compensatory response of the right ventricle, promoting the hypertrophy of contractile elements and limiting the areas in which fibrosis develops (p < 0.001).\nThe subcutaneous infusion with osmotic pumps was a valid and reproducible method of delivering basic fibroblast growth factor to heart tissue.

In allergologic literature, heart involvement during anaphylactic reactions is well documented, but Kounis syndrome is hardly mentioned. Single case reports and small case series of angina triggered by allergic reactions have been reported for many years, and involvement of histamine and others mast cell mediators in the pathogenesis of coronary spasm has long been hypothesized, but the existence of an allergic acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is still questioned in the allergologic scientific community. Putative mechanisms of an allergic acute coronary syndrome include coronary spasm or heart tissue-resident mast cell activation (precipitating coronary spasm or inducing plaque rupture and coronary or stent thrombosis) due to systemic increase of allergic mediators, or heart tissue-resident mast cell activation by local stimuli. Indeed, the pathogenic mechanism of an ACS after an allergic insult might be related to direct effects of mast cell mediators on the myocardium and the atherosclerotic plaque, or to exacerbation of preexisting disease by the hemodynamic stress of the acute allergic/anaphylactic reaction.

Redox-MHD possesses unique capabilities to control fluid flow using ionic current from oxidation and reduction processes at electrodes in a magnetic field, making it attractive to fine-tune fluid flow around tissues for \"tissue-on-a-chip\" applications. The manuscript describes a parallel setup to study two tissue samples simultaneously, and 6-min static incubation with Triton X100. Tissue viability was subsequently determined by assaying perfusate for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, where LDH serves as an injury marker. Incubation with KHGB containing 5 mM hexaammineruthenium(III) (ruhex) redox species with and without a pair of NdFeB magnets (\u223c 0.39 T, placed parallel to the chamber) exhibited no additional tissue insult. MHD fluid flow, viewed by tracking microbeads with microscopy, occurred only when the magnet was present and stimulating electrodes were activated. Pulsating MHD flow with a frequency similar to the stimulating waveform was superimposed over thermal convection (from a hotplate) for Triton-KHGB, but fluid speed was up to twice as fast for ruhex-Triton-KHGB. A large transient ionic current, achieved when switching on the stimulating electrodes, generates MHD perturbations visible over varying peristaltic flow.

{"title": "Electrical remodeling in dyssynchrony and resynchronization.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is associated with anatomic and functional remodeling of cardiac tissues in both animal models and humans, which alters Ca(2+) homeostasis, protein phosphorylation, excitation-contraction coupling, results in arrhythmias. Indeed, the electrophysiological hallmark of cells and tissues isolated from failing hearts is prolongation of action potential duration (APD) and conduction slowing. The changes in cellular and tissue function are regionally heterogenous particularly in the dyssynchronously contracting heart. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is widely applied in patients with HF and dyssynchronous left ventricular (LV) contraction (DHF), but the electrophysiological consequences of CRT are not fully understood. We demonstrated the molecular and cellular basis of excitability, conduction, and electrical remodeling in DHF and its restoration by CRT using a canine tachypacing HF model. CRT partially reversed the DHF-induced downregulation of K(+) current and improved Na(+) channel gating and abbreviated persistent (late) Na(+) current. CRT reduced Ca(2+)/calmodulin protein kinase II activity and restored transverse tubular system and spatial distribution of ryanodine receptor, thus it significantly improved Ca(2+) homeostasis especially in myocytes from late-activated, lateral wall and restored the DHF-induced blunted \u03b2-adrenergic receptor responsiveness. CRT abbreviated DHF-induced prolongation of APD in the lateral wall myocytes and reduced the LV regional gradient of APD and suppressed the development of early afterdepolarizations. In conclusion, CRT partially restores the DHF-induced ion channel remodeling, abnormal Ca(2+) homeostasis, blunted \u03b2-adrenergic response, and regional heterogeneity of APD, thus it may suppress ventricular arrhythmias and contribute to the mortality benefit of CRT as well as improve mechanical performance of the heart.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular translational research", "date": "2012-01-25", "authors": ["TakeshiAiba", "GordonTomaselli"], "doi": "10.1007/s12265-012-9348-9"}

While expression of human CD39 in a murine model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury confers cardiac protection, the translational therapeutic potential of these findings requires further testing in a large animal model. To determine if transgenic expression of CD39 reduces infarct size in a swine model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, transgenic pigs expressing human CD39 (hCD39) were generated via somatic cell nuclear transfer and characterized. Expression of hC39 in cardiac tissue was confirmed by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. Myocardial I/R injury was induced by intracoronary balloon inflation in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery for 60 min followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. The ischemic area was delineated by perfusion with 5% phthalo blue and the myocardial infarct size was determined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. During ischemia, the rate-pressure product was significantly lower in control versus hCD39-Tg swine.

Doxorubicin produces genotoxic stress and p53 activation in both carcinoma and non-carcinoma cells. Although its side effects in non-carcinoma cells, especially in heart tissue, are well known, the molecular targets of doxorubicin are poorly characterized. Here, we report that doxorubicin inhibits AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) resulting in SIRT1 dysfunction and p53 accumulation. Spontaneously immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or H9C2 cardiomyocyte were exposed to doxorubicin at different doses and durations. Cell death and p53, SIRT1, and AMPK levels were examined by Western blot. In MEFs, doxorubicin inhibited AMPK activation, increased cell death, and induced robust p53 accumulation. Genetic deletion of AMPK\u03b11 reduced NAD(+) levels and SIRT1 activity and significantly increased the levels of p53 and cell death. Pre-activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside or transfection with an adenovirus encoding a constitutively active AMPK (AMPK-CA) markedly reduced the effects of doxorubicin in MEFs from Ampk\u03b11 knock-out mice. Conversely, pre-inhibition of Ampk further sensitized MEFs to doxorubicin-induced cell death. Genetic knockdown of p53 protected both wild-type and Ampk\u03b11(-/-) MEFs from doxorubicin-induced cell death. p53 accumulation in Ampk\u03b11(-/-) MEFs was reversed by SIRT1 activation by resveratrol.

However, little is known about its effect on cardiac remodeling associated with diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, this study was designed to study the effects of pioglitazone on cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy in a rat model of diabetic nephropathy. For this purpose, male Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups (n = 10 per group): normal (N) group, diabetic (D) group, diabetic nephropathic (DN) group received an equal amount of vehicle (0.5% carboxy methyl cellulose), and diabetic nephropathic group treated by oral administration of pioglitazone (10 mg/kg per d) for 4 weeks. Diabetic nephropathy was induced by subtotal nephrectomy plus streptozotocin (STZ) injection. The results revealed that DN rats showed excessive deposition of collagen fibers in their cardiac tissue, along with a marked myocyte hypertrophy. This was associated with a dramatic upregulation of cardiac transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) gene. Furthermore, the gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) decreased, while the gene expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2) increased in the hearts of DN rats. In addition, enhanced lipid peroxidation and myocardial injury, evidenced by a significant increase in their serum creatine kinase-MB level were observed in DN rats. All these abnormalities were ameliorated by pioglitazone administration. Our findings suggest that upregulation of cardiac TGF-\u03b21 gene along with the imbalance between MMP-2 and TIMP-2 expressions is critically involved in cardiac fibrosis associated with diabetic nephropathy.

Of these, after E2 exposure, the myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein (MYLIP) gene was induced in tissues of men only. Focusing on Mylip and employing isolated mouse CMs, we confirmed our hypotheses that the E2 effect is CM- and sex-specific and conserved between humans and mice.

{"title": "Cardioprotective radiotherapy: the circadian way.", "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) has been established to improve both local control as well as overall survival rates in breast cancer. However, RT especially in left-sided breast cancer also irradiates a portion of the heart. Radiation associated toxicity to the heart assumes significance because of improval in survival of breast cancer patients. A circadian pattern has been reported in the myocardial oxygen demand and myocardial ischaemia with the cardiac tissue being more susceptible to injury between 6 am and noon. Radiation damages blood vessels of all sizes causing an increase in capillary wall permeability and dilatation of vessels leading to the characteristic radiation erythema followed by an inflammatory cell infiltrate. Coronary artery spasm may be the reason behind some cases of sudden death occurring in patients after radiation therapy.

In the case of cardiovascular disease, and particularly myocardial infarction, this signaling axis is implicated in many of these processes, and has an additional role in providing trophic support for cells and utilizing paracrine mechanisms to enhance cell survival, promote angiogenesis, and stimulate differentiation. Current research is focused on elucidating these complex events, and so far have produced promising results that have led to the development of cell therapies that can more effectively repair cardiac tissue following ischemic injury than currently used treatments.

Almost half of ARVC patients have a mutation in genes encoding cell adhesion proteins of the desmosome, including plakoglobin (JUP). We previously reported that cardiac tissue-specific plakoglobin (PG) knockout (PG CKO) mice have no apparent conduction abnormality and survive longer than expected. Importantly, the PG homolog, \u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1), showed increased association with the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) in PG CKO hearts. To determine whether \u03b2-catenin is required to maintain cardiac conduction in the absence of PG, we generated mice lacking both PG and \u03b2-catenin specifically in the heart (i.e., double knockout [DKO]). The DKO mice exhibited cardiomyopathy, fibrous tissue replacement, and conduction abnormalities resulting in SCD. Loss of the cadherin linker proteins resulted in dissolution of the intercalated disc (ICD) structure. Moreover, Cx43-containing gap junction plaques were reduced at the ICD, consistent with the arrhythmogenicity of the DKO hearts. Finally, ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring captured the abrupt onset of spontaneous lethal ventricular arrhythmia in the DKO mice.

{"title": "Postmortem cardiac tissue maintains gene expression profile even after late harvesting.", "abstract": "Gene expression studies can be used to help identify disease-associated genes by comparing the levels of expressed transcripts between cases and controls, and to identify functional genetic variants (expression quantitative loci or eQTLs) by comparing expression levels between individuals with different genotypes. While many of these studies are performed in blood or lymphoblastoid cell lines due to tissue accessibility, the relevance of expression differences in tissues that are not the primary site of disease is unclear. Further, many eQTLs are tissue specific. Thus, there is a clear and compelling need to conduct gene expression studies in tissues that are specifically relevant to the disease of interest. One major technical concern about using autopsy-derived tissue is how representative it is of physiologic conditions, given the effect of postmortem interval on tissue degradation.\nIn this study, we monitored the gene expression of 13 tissue samples harvested from a rapid autopsy heart (non-failed heart) and 7 from a cardiac explant (failed heart) through 24 hours of autolysis. The 24 hour autopsy simulation was designed to reflect a typical autopsy scenario where a body may begin cooling to ambient temperature for ~12 hours, before transportation and storage in a refrigerated room in a morgue. In addition, we also simulated a scenario wherein the body was left at room temperature for up to 24 hours before being found. A small fraction (< 2.5%) of genes showed fluctuations in expression over the 24 hr period and largely belong to immune and signal response and energy metabolism-related processes. Global expression analysis suggests that RNA expression is reproducible over 24 hours of autolysis with 95% genes showing < 1.2 fold change. Comparing the rapid autopsy to the failed heart identified 480 differentially expressed genes, including several types of collagens, lumican (LUM), natriuretic peptide A (NPPA) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which allows for the clear separation between failing and non-failing heart based on gene expression profiles.\nOur results demonstrate that RNA from autopsy-derived tissue, even up to 24 hours of autolysis, can be used to identify biologically relevant expression pattern differences, thus serving as a practical source for gene expression experiments.", "journal": "BMC genomics", "date": "2012-01-19", "authors": ["SimoneGupta", "Marc KHalushka", "Gina MHilton", "Dan EArking"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-13-26\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2009.03.004\n10.1093/hmg/ddh065\n10.1016/j.biopsych.2003.10.013\n10.1016/j.brainres.2006.09.025\n10.1016/j.forsciint.2010.07.005\n10.1002/prca.200800051\n10.1089/10665270050514954\n10.1073/pnas.150242097\n10.1126/science.278.5338.680\n10.1016/j.jbiotec.2006.07.032\n10.1093/bioinformatics/19.2.185\n10.1073/pnas.0400782101\n10.1073/pnas.091062498\n10.1186/gb-2003-4-5-p3\n10.1161/hc3501.095215\n10.1016/0002-8703(88)90763-6\n10.1042/CS20030044\n10.1038/ng.134\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.07.038\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.12.010\n10.1152/ajpheart.00355.2005\n10.1007/s00018-006-6085-8\n10.1253/circj.CJ-09-0465\n10.1186/1755-8794-1-64\n10.1073/pnas.162370099\n10.1369/jhc.6A7152.2007\n10.1016/j.carpath.2008.12.007\n10.1073/pnas.221465998"}

Here we show how this method can be applied for long-term studies in safety pharmacology.\nIn freshly prepared cardiac slices from guinea-pig or rat ventricle, extracellular field potentials (FP) and intracellular action potentials (AP) were recorded in response to electrical stimulation using the 4-channel heart slice screening system 'Synchroslice'. To assess viability of the slices on consecutive days after preparation, drug effects on FP/AP parameters, like duration and latency, were monitored.\nIn the presence of the potassium channel blocker E4031 (1 \u03bcM), FP and AP duration (FPD and APD) were significantly increased (FPD, 39.0%; APD, 28.1%) in guinea-pig ventricular slices. Similar changes were observed 24-28 h after slice preparation (FPD, 48.6%; APD, 25.4%). Furthermore, AP duration was reduced in the presence of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (10 \u03bcM) on the day of preparation (40.5%) and 24-28 h later (38.7%). In contrast, in the presence of the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (30 mM) AP duration was prolonged 4.95 and 4.19-fold, 2-8 h and 24-28 h after preparation, respectively.

{"title": "The role of non-covalent interactions in anticancer drug loading and kinetic stability of polymeric micelles.", "abstract": "A new series of acid- and urea-functionalized polycarbonate block copolymers were synthesized via organocatalytic living ring-opening polymerization using methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a macroinitiator to form micelles as drug delivery carriers. The micelles were characterized for critical micelle concentration, particle size and size distribution, kinetic stability and loading capacity for a model anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX) having an amine group. The acid/urea groups were placed in block forms (i.e. acid as the middle block or the end block) or randomly distributed in the polycarbonate block to investigate molecular structure effect. The micelles formed from the polymers in both random and block forms provided high drug loading capacity due to strong ionic interaction between the acid in the polymer and the amine in DOX. However, the polymers with acid and urea groups placed in the block forms formed micelles with wider size distribution (two size populations), and their DOX-loaded micelles were less stable. The number of acid/urea groups in the random form was further varied from 5 to 8, 13 and 19 to study its effects on self-assembly behaviors and DOX loading. An increased number of acid/urea groups yielded DOX-loaded micelles with smaller size and enhanced kinetic stability because of improved inter-molecular polycarbonate-polycarbonate (urea-urea and urea-acid) hydrogen-bonding and polycarbonate-DOX (acid-amine) ionic interactions. However, when the number of acid/urea groups was 13 or higher, micelles aggregated in a serum-containing medium, and freeze-dried DOX-loaded micelles were unable to re-disperse in an aqueous solution. Among all the polymers synthesized in this study, 1b with 8 acid/urea groups in the random form had the optimum properties. In vitro release studies showed that DOX release from 1b micelles was sustained over 7 h without significant initial burst release. MTT assays demonstrated that the polymer was not toxic towards HepG2 and HEK293 cells. Importantly, DOX-loaded micelles were potent against HepG2 cells with IC(50) of 0.26 mg/L, comparable to that of free DOX (IC(50): 0.20 mg/L). In addition, DOX-loaded 1b micelles yielded lower DOX content in the heart tissue of the tested mice as compared to free DOX formulation after i.v. injection.

Little is known about the molecular pathways that control the differentiation of CDC. In this study, we examined the role of Notch 1/J kappa-recombining binding protein (RBPJ) signaling, a critical cell-fate decision pathway, in CDC differentiation. We isolated CDC from mouse cardiospheres and analyzed the differentiation of transduced cells expressing the Notch1 intracellular domain (N1-ICD), the active form of Notch1, using a terminal differentiation marker polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. We found that Notch1 primarily supported the differentiation of CDC into smooth muscle cells (SMC), as demonstrated by the upreguation of key SMC proteins, including smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (Myh11) and SM22\u03b1 (Tagln), in N1-ICD expressing CDC. Conversely, genetic ablation of RBPJ in CDC diminished the expression of SMC differentiation markers, confirming that SMC differentiation CDC is dependent on RBPJ. Finally, in vivo experiments demonstrate enhanced numbers of smooth muscle actin-expressing implanted cells after an injection of N1-ICD-expressing CDC into ischemic myocardium (44\u00b18/high power field (hpf) vs. 11\u00b14/high power field (hpf), n=7 sections, P<0.05).

Temperature-induced nerve failure may play an important role in determining organismal thermal tolerance limits and distribution patterns. To expand our understanding of the role of neuronal thermal performance in setting thermal limits, we compared the thermal performance of neurons from five porcelain crab (genus Petrolisthes) congeners that differ in thermal habitat. In experiment 1, neuronal performance of sensory neurons was determined by extracellular recording of spontaneous action potentials during thermal ramps. Arrhenius break temperatures of action potential generation were used to calculate maximum critical temperature (CT(max)) and minimum critical temperature (CT(min)) for neuronal performance. CT(max) and CT(min) were related to habitat temperature across the five species and were found to respond to acclimation temperature. In experiment 2, we assessed the performance of neurons from Petrolisthes cinctipes acclimated at 8\u00b0, 18\u00b0, and 25\u00b0C when placed at 30\u00b0C (near the whole-organism CT(max) of this species) and demonstrated that neural performance near whole-organism CT(max) increases with increasing acclimation temperature. In experiment 3, we compared the thermal limits of sensory afferents and pacemaker efferents and found that they were correlated, although pacemaker efferents tended to have a higher CT(max) and reduced plasticity.

In this study, we fed senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8, n=11 per group) semisynthetic diets with 10% olive oil containing either high (HP) or low amounts of olive oil phenolics (LP) for 4.5 months.

Nrf2-dependent gene expression may be impaired during the aging process. Therefore, we measured Nrf2 and its target genes glutathione-S-transferase (GST), \u03b3-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (\u03b3-GCS), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NAD(P)H]:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and paraoxonase-2 (PON2) in the hearts of these mice.

The HP-fed mice had significantly higher PON1 activity in serum compared to those receiving the LP diet. Furthermore, HP feeding increased relative SIRT1 mRNA levels. Additional mechanistic cell culture experiments were performed, and they suggest that the olive oil phenolic hydroxytyrosol present in the HP oil may be responsible for the induction of Nrf2-dependent gene expression and the increase in PON activity.

Moreover, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and CCL-5, but not FOXP3+ expression, was increased in draining lymph nodes in isoproterenol-injured animals, indicating that the observed lymphocyte population that proliferated in response to cardiac components presented a pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic profile. In contrast, lymphocytes from draining lymph nodes of rats given a heart homogenate by gavage 7 days before isoproterenol did not proliferate. Furthermore, the group rendered tolerant expressed cardiac FOXP3+ earlier than did the control group, and showed a milder inflammatory infiltrate, lower MMP-9 expression, less collagen deposition, and improved cardiac performance when compared to animals that received only isoproterenol administration. The present findings suggest that the establishment of oral tolerance to heart components prior to myocardial infarction may drive the cardiac healing process to proceed with less inflammation and fibrosis, thus preserving contractile organ function.", "journal": "Autoimmunity", "date": "2012-01-13", "authors": ["Gustavo CamposRamos", "SilviaDalb\u00f3", "Daniela PereiraLeite", "ElianeGoldfeder", "Cl\u00e1udia RochaCarvalho", "Nelson MonteiroVaz", "JamilAssreuy"], "doi": "10.3109/08916934.2011.647134"}

A recent study showed that male KLF10-encoded TGF\u03b2 Inducible Early Gene-1 knock-out mice (TIEG-/-) develop HCM with 13-fold up-regulation of PTTG1-encoded pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1. We hypothesized TIEG1 could be a novel candidate gene in the pathogenesis of genotype negative HCM in humans, possibly through a loss of its repression on PTTG1 expression. A cohort of 923 unrelated patients from two independent HCM centers was analyzed for mutations in TIEG's four translated exons using DHPLC and direct DNA-sequencing. Site directed mutagenesis was performed to clone novel variants. The effect of TIEG1 mutations on SMAD7 and PTTG1 promoters was studied using transient transfection and luciferase-assays. Altered expression of PTTG1 in cardiac tissue was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine levels of PTTG1 protein in hypertrophic diseases. Six novel TIEG1 missense mutations were discovered in six patients (two males/four females, mean age at diagnosis 56.2\u00b123 years, MLVWT 20.8\u00b14\u2009mm). Compared to WT TIEG1, five TIEG1 mutants significantly increased PTTG1 promoter function similar to TIEG1-/--mice. By IHC, PTTG1-protein expression was significantly increased in multiple models of hypertrophic cardiac disease, including TIEG1-mutation positive HCM compared to normal hearts. This is the first article to associate mutations in TIEG1 to human disease with the discovery of six novel, HCM-associated variants. Functional assays suggest a role for PTTG1 in the pathogenesis of TIEG1-mediated HCM.

We have investigated a paradigm, which could achieve such a goal, using vitamin B12 (vit.B12), at the dose recommended in cyanide poisoning, and very low levels of methemoglobin (MetHb). Hydroxocobalamin in the plasma, supernatant of kidney, and heart tissue homogenates of rats that had received vit.B12 (140\u2009mg.kg(-1) intravenous) was found in the \u03bcM range. Exogenous H2S (100\u2009\u03bcM) added to the plasma or supernatants of these rats decreased at a significantly higher rate than in control rats. In the latter however a spontaneous oxidation of exogenous H2S occurred. In vitro, hydroxocobalamin solution (100\u2009\u03bcM) decreased, within <2\u2009min, an equimolar concentration of H2S by 80%. Three to five percent MetHb prevented H2S induced hyperventilation in vivo and decreased exogenous H2S in vitro by 25-40\u2009\u03bcM within 30\u2009s.

Dexmedetomidine is an \u03b1(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist used in anesthesia that may have cardioprotective properties against ischemia/reperfusion injury. We investigate whether dexmedetomidine administration activates cardiac survival kinases and induces cardioprotection against regional ischemia/reperfusion injury. In in vivo and ex vivo models, rat hearts were subjected to 30 min of regional ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion with dexmedetomidine before ischemia. The \u03b1(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine was also given before ischemia, alone or with dexmedetomidine. Erk1/2, Akt and eNOS phosphorylations were determined before ischemia/reperfusion. Cardioprotection after regional ischemia/reperfusion was assessed from infarct size measurement and ventricular function recovery. Localization of \u03b1(2)-adrenergic receptors in cardiac tissue was also assessed. Dexmedetomidine preconditioning increased levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2, Akt and eNOS forms before ischemia/reperfusion; being significantly reversed by yohimbine in both models. Dexmedetomidine preconditioning (in vivo model) and peri-insult protection (ex vivo model) significantly reduced myocardial infarction size, improved functional recovery and yohimbine abolished dexmedetomidine-induced cardioprotection in both models. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002 reversed myocardial infarction size reduction induced by dexmedetomidine preconditioning. The three isotypes of \u03b1(2)-adrenergic receptors were detected in the whole cardiac tissue whereas only the subtypes 2A and 2C were observed in isolated rat adult cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Development and application of a LC-MS/MS method to quantify basal adenosine concentration in human plasma from patients undergoing on-pump CABG surgery.", "abstract": "A sensitive and robust LC-MS/MS method was developed to quantify basal adenosine concentrations in human plasma of patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. A strong cation exchange (SCX) monolithic cartridge was used to enrich analyte, improve robustness, and reduce biological complexity. A simple modifier-free mobile phase was employed to improve sensitivity and reproducibility. This method exhibits consistent precision and accuracy, and the RSDs or REs of all the intraday and interday determinations were within 10%. The calibration curve was linear across the examined dynamic range from 1nM to 500nM (r(2)=0.996). LOD and LOQ were determined to be 0.257nM and 0.857nM respectively, while LLOQ was below 10nM. This method was used to monitor changes of adenosine levels in patient plasma drawn intraoperatively during on-pump CABG surgery. The analysis of 84 patients revealed that the mean concentration of adenosine in coronary sinus plasma after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is higher than that in coronary sinus before CPB (p=0.0024; two-tailed t-test) and that in radial artery plasma after CPB (p=0.0409; two-tailed t-test). These findings suggest that the equilibrium between adenosine production and elimination has favored the elevation of adenosine basal level during on-pump CABG surgery and the change is specific to heart tissues. Evaluation of adenosine with a sensitive and robust analytical method has important implications on providing consistent results and meaningful insights into adenosine regulation, as well as its steady state and sustained action on the heart. Relating patient characteristics or clinical outcomes with basal adenosine concentration can be used to optimize the CABG-CPB maneuver by regulating adenosine level via pharmacological intervention, and differentiating adenosine's contribution to cardioprotection from other modulatory factors.", "journal": "Journal of chromatography.

The formation of the heart relies heavily upon the rapid proliferation of cardiomyocytes at a specific stage during early development, and interfering with the ability of these cells to grow during this time frame results in heart defects that include thin ventricle walls, as well as malformed ventricular septums. Thus, since cardiomyocyte proliferation represents a key step in early cardiac development and identifying the mechanisms that underlie cardiomyocyte proliferation has become an important area of study, techniques to identify and study proliferating cardiomyocytes in vivo are needed. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining are powerful tools for studying cardiomyocyte proliferation in the developing animal. The phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 (pH3) only occurs in cells undergoing mitosis, making pH3 a marker for labeling proliferating cells.

Curcumin pretreatment of fibroblasts inhibited parasite invasion. Treatment reduced the expression of the low density lipoprotein receptor, which is involved in T. cruzi host cell invasion. Curcumin treatment of T. cruzi-infected CD1 mice reduced parasitemia and decreased the parasitism of infected heart tissue. This was associated with a significant reduction in macrophage infiltration and inflammation in both the heart and liver; moreover, curcumin-treated infected mice displayed a 100% survival rate in contrast to the 60% survival rate commonly observed in untreated infected mice.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether or not cystamine possesses anti-apoptotic effects with emphasis on LV tissue of lupus-prone mice NZB/W-F1. Cystamine treatment was performed by daily intraperitoneal administration. Morphology and apoptotic status of ventricular tissues in the treated mice were assessed by microscopy and TUNEL assay, respectively. Levels of apoptotic biomarkers were determined using immunoblot. Our results revealed that cystamine significantly attenuated the apoptosis of LV tissues in NZB/W-F1 mice, whereas the morphology of the tissues was slightly altered. In addition, cystamine reduced level of Fas and inhibited activation of caspase-8. Cystamine also increased level of Bcl-2 and phosphorylation of Bad, and decreased level of Bad and truncated Bid (tBid). Moreover, level of cytosolic cytochrome c and Apaf-1, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were suppressed in response to cystamine treatment. In Balb/c mice, as normal control mice, changes in cell morphology and levels of the tested apoptotic components were found insignificant in the LV tissues.

Activity of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB is increased in the diseased heart; however, our present understanding of how the individual subunits contribute to cardiovascular disease is limited. We assign a new role for the c-Rel subunit as a stimulator of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. We discovered that c-Rel-deficient mice have smaller hearts at birth, as well as during adulthood, and are protected from developing cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis after chronic angiotensin infusion. Results of both gene expression and cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analyses identified transcriptional activators of hypertrophy, myocyte enhancer family, Gata4, and Tbx proteins as Rel gene targets. We suggest that the p50 subunit could limit the prohypertrophic actions of c-Rel in the normal heart, because p50 overexpression in H9c2 cells repressed c-Rel levels and the absence of cardiac p50 was associated with increases in both c-Rel levels and cardiac hypertrophy. We report for the first time that c-Rel is highly expressed and confined to the nuclei of diseased adult human hearts but is restricted to the cytoplasm of normal cardiac tissues.

This study determines whether intrinsic differences in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) assist in explaining the enhanced cellular survival and engraftment of MRL-MSCs.\nCompared to wild type MSCs (WT-MSCs), mitochondria from intact MRL-MSCs exhibited an increase in routine respiration and maximal electron transport capacity by 2.0- and 3.5-fold, respectively. When routine oxygen utilization is expressed as a portion of maximal cellular oxygen flux, the MRL-MSCs have a greater spare respiratory capcity. Additionally, glutamate/malate succinate-supported oxygen consumption in permeabilized cells was elevated approximately 1.25- and 1.4-fold in the MRL-MSCs, respectively.\nThe results from intact and permeabilized MSCs indicate MRL-MSCs exhibit a greater reliance on and capacity for aerobic metabolism. The greater capacity for oxidative metabolism may provide a protective effect by increasing ATP synthesis per unit substrate and prevent glycolysis-mediated acidosis and subsequent cell death upon transplantation into the glucose-and oxygen-deprived environment of the infarcted heart.", "journal": "Cell regeneration (London, England)", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["Curtis CHughey", "Maria PAlfaro", "Darrell DBelke", "Jeffery NRottman", "Pampee PYoung", "David HWasserman", "JaneShearer"], "doi": "10.1186/2045-9769-1-3\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehi818\n10.1161/hc0102.101442\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.05.004\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.03.009\n10.1073/pnas.0803437105\n10.1074/jbc.M110.135335\n10.1074/jbc.M500608200\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.11.016\n10.1002/pmic.200800609\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2003.12.030\n10.1016/j.exger.2005.09.011\n10.1016/0143-4160(91)90080-X\n10.1016/j.biocel.2009.03.013\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.11.001\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01138.x\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0855\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-1072\n10.3727/096368910X539100\n10.1016/0146-2806(94)90008-6\n10.1007/s10495-007-0720-1"}

These coactivators are thought to play a key role in the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. In this study we have used a combined metabolomic and lipidomic analysis of cardiac tissue from the PGC-1\u03b2 null mouse to examine the effects of a high fat diet on this organ. Multivariate statistics readily separated tissue from PGC-1\u03b2 null mice from their wild type controls either in gender specific models or in combined datasets. This was associated with an increase in creatine and a decrease in taurine in the null mouse, and an increase in myristic acid and a reduction in long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids for both genders. The most profound changes were detected by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of intact lipids with the tissue from the null mouse having a profound increase in a number of triglycerides.

Pepino treatments also significantly reduced plasma glucose and insulin levels, HOMA-IR index, and improved oral glucose tolerance (P < 0.05). Plasma and hepatic levels of triglyceride and total cholesterol (TC) were higher in diabetic groups when compared with normal group (P < 0.05), pepino treatments at 2 and 5% decreased triglyceride and TC levels in both plasma and liver (P < 0.05). Diabetes enhanced mRNA expression of resistin and diacylglycerol acyltransferase1 (DGAT1) in epididymal fat pad (P < 0.05); however, pepino intake significantly suppressed mRNA expression of resistin and DGAT1 in epididymal fat pad (P < 0.05). Pepino intake significantly reduced reactive oxygen species level, increased glutathione level, and retained glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities in cardiac tissues (P < 0.05).

Among other adverse health effects, khat chewing has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in heavy consumers. This study was carried out to examine the direct effects of Catha edulis extract on contractility of spontaneously contracting, isolated rabbit heart and to investigate its mechanism of action. Isolated six rabbit's hearts attached to a Langendorff apparatus were perfused with extract at a constant flow rate and continuously bubbled with a 95% O2/5% CO2 gas mixture. Each heart served as its own control, as responses were recorded before and after administration of C. edulis extract. Varying concentrations of extract (50, 100 and 250\u00a0mg/ml) were loaded in the perfusate, their effects recorded and effluent fluid collected for assay of cardiac enzymes. Histological examination of the cardiac tissue was performed at the end of perfusion with 250\u00a0mg/ml extract. This study revealed that acute exposure to C. edulis extract exerted negative inotropic and chronotropic effects on isolated hearts. The extract also had a vasoconstrictor effect on coronary vessels, independent of \u03b11 adrenergic receptor stimulation. Histological examination of hearts perfused with 250\u00a0mg/ml C. edulis extract revealed the presence of histological changes unique to myocardial infarction, a finding consistent with observed increased levels of cardiac enzymes in perfusates. Thus, we have demonstrated experimentally a direct cardiac depressant- and MI inducing effects of C. edulis extract.

MI was induced by occlusion of the left coronary artery. Cardiac function was evaluated by measuring left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV fractional shortening, cardiac output, myocardial performance index and the peak early diastolic velocity/peak atrial velocity ratio using echocardiography. The myocardial oxidative stress profile was assessed by measuring the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio, H2O2 levels, peroxiredoxin-6 protein levels and activity levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Lipid peroxidation was quantified using chemiluminescence, and protein oxidation was determined by measuring protein carbonyl levels.\nLV ejection fraction and LV fractional shortening were lower in the infarcted group compared with the sham group, whereas the peak early diastolic velocity/peak atrial velocity ratio and myocardial performance index were significantly increased, indicating systolic dysfunction. Lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls and superoxide dismutase and catalase activity levels did not differ between the groups. Peroxyredoxin-6 levels were increased in the infarcted group, while H2O2 levels were reduced. The reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio and the glutathione peroxidase activity were reduced in the infarcted group compared with control.\nThese data suggest that MI-induced cardiac dysfunction and impaired redox balance may be associated with the activation of counter-regulatory responses to maintain reduced H2O2 concentrations and, thereby, prevent further oxidative damage at this early time point.", "journal": "Experimental and clinical cardiology", "date": "2012-01-01", "authors": ["Angela Maria VicenteTavares", "Alex Sanderda Rosa Araujo", "SusanaLlesuy", "NeelamKhaper", "Luis EduardoRohde", "NadineClausell", "AdrianeBell\u00f3-Klein"], "doi": null}

We postulate on numerical basis the possibility to induce a stable spiral wave in the arterial wall. Such a spiral wave can inhibit the propagation of the axial calcium wave and effectively stop the vasomotion. We also discuss the dynamics of the circumferential calcium wave in comparison to rotors in venous ostia that are a common source of supraventricular ectopy. We show that the velocity and in consequence the frequency range of the circumferential calcium wave is by orders of magnitude too small compared to that of the rotors. The mechanism of the rotor is not likely to involve the calcium-related dynamics of the smooth muscle cells. The calcium-related dynamics which is voltage-independent and hard to be reset seems to actually protect the blood vessels against the electric activity of the atria.

The topics include the advances in engineering stem cell-derived cardiac tissues, the use of natural or synthetic polymers and decellularized organs as engineering scaffolds, the scaffold-free cell sheet engineering approach, the application of perfusion and mechanical or electrical stimulation in bioreactors, the organization of cardiac cells through microfabrication techniques, and the vascularization of engineered cardiac tissues in vitro and in vivo.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition)", "date": "2011-12-29", "authors": ["Loraine L YChiu", "Rohin KIyer", "Lewis AReis", "Sara SNunes", "MilicaRadisic"], "doi": "10.2741/4002"}
{"title": "A perturbation solution of the mechanical bidomain model.", "abstract": "This research focuses on finding analytical solutions to the mechanical bidomain model for cardiac tissue. In particular, a perturbation expansion is used to analyze the equations, with the perturbation parameter being inversely proportional to the spring constant coupling the intracellular and extracellular spaces. The results indicate that the intracellular and extracellular pressures are not equal and that the two spaces can move relative to each other. This calculation is complicated enough to illustrate the implications of the mechanical bidomain model but is nevertheless simple enough to solve analytically. One application of the calculation is to the mechanical behavior of active cardiac tissue surrounding an ischemic region.", "journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "date": "2011-12-28", "authors": ["Vanessa MPunal", "Bradley JRoth"], "doi": "10.1007/s10237-011-0368-1"}
{"title": "Slow calcium waves and redox changes precede mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening in the intact heart during hypoxia and reoxygenation.", "abstract": "Opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is an important step on the pathway towards cardiomyocyte death, defining the extent of injury following cardiac ischaemia and reperfusion. In isolated mitochondria, mPTP opening is triggered by calcium overload facilitated by oxidative stress. In isolated cells, however, it has been suggested that mPTP opening occurs before calcium overload and is stimulated by oxidative stress. Our objective was to establish the events that cause mPTP opening in the intact heart.\nWe performed multiphoton imaging of Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts expressing an inducible, Ca(2+)-sensitive reporter (circularly Permuted GFP and calmodulin (CaM), version 2), to examine the spatiotemporal relationship between [Ca(2+)](c), redox state, and mPTP opening in the intact heart during hypoxia and reoxygenation at sub-myocyte resolution. We found that during reperfusion, calcium waves propagated across multiple cells at 3.3 \u00b5m/s. mPTP opening caused an abrupt loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, measured using a potentiometric dye, which was invariably preceded by a rise in [Ca(2+)](c). The probability that localized [Ca(2+)](c) waves led to mPTP opening was greater early during reoxygenation. During reoxygenation, coordinated redox changes also occurred across large regions and preceded mPTP opening on average by 122 \u00b1 38 s. Fewer [Ca(2+)] waves led to mPTP opening in the presence of mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A or mitochondrial-targeted scavenger of reactive oxygen species, MitoQ.\nThese experiments define the spatiotemporal relationship between changes in [Ca(2+)](c), redox state and mPTP opening during reoxygenation in the intact heart. Tissue oxidation coincident with localized calcium waves together conspire to cause mPTP opening and subsequent cell death.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2011-12-27", "authors": ["Sean MDavidson", "Derek MYellon", "Michael PMurphy", "Michael RDuchen"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvr349"}
{"title": "Cardioprotection by Hepc1 in cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice.", "abstract": "Hepcidin 1 (Hepc1) is a peptide hormone secreted by the liver in response to iron loading. It is expressed in the heart and is thought to play a role in the regulation of iron homeostasis in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. We have shown that expression of Hepc1 is strongly down-regulated in the heart of the cTnT(R141W) transgenic mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) at 3\u00a0months of age. Transgenic mice with heart tissue-specific Hepc1 expression alone or in combination with the cTnT(R141W) mutation were produced to study the effects of Hepc1 on DCM. Transgenic expression of Hepc1 was found to be nonlethal and resulted in decreased mortality in cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice, from 29.6 to 7.4%(n\u00a0 =\u00a027; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), through 7\u00a0months of age. Expression of Hepc1 also brought about increases in the left ventricular wall, as well as ejection fraction and fractional shortening. In addition, the expression of Hepc1 inhibited the fibrosis and ultra-structural alterations seen in cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice. Furthermore, transgenic expression of Hepc1 restored the iron level and phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the heart tissues of cTnT(R141W) transgenic mice. It was concluded that transgenic expression of Hepc1 compensated for the loss of Hepc1 expression and the release of iron and brought about a marked improvement in the pathologic phenotype of DCM, in which the ERK1/2 signal pathway might play an important role.", "journal": "Transgenic research", "date": "2011-12-27", "authors": ["LiZhang", "DanLu", "WeiZhang", "XiongzhiQuan", "WeiDong", "YanfengXu", "LianfengZhang"], "doi": "10.1007/s11248-011-9582-y"}

The histopathological changes including the pyknotic nuclei, inflammatory leukocyte infiltrations, renal necrosis, and cardiac myofiber degeneration were observed in the liver, kidney and heart tissues. Biochemical analysis of catalase and glutathione revealed significantly lesser activities of antioxidative enzymes and lipid peroxidation in tissues of phorate exposed rats. Furthermore, generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in bone marrow cells confirmed phorate-induced oxidative stress. Significant DNA damage was measured through comet assay in terms of the Olive tail moment in bone marrow cells of treated animals as compared to control. Cell cycle analysis also demonstrated the G(2)/M arrest and appearance of a distinctive SubG(1) peak, which signified induction of apoptosis. Up-regulation of tumor suppressor p53 and caspase 3 and 9 genes, determined by quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, elucidated the activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways in response to cellular stress.

Methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) is essential for the adequate remethylation of homocysteine, which is the dominant pathway for homocysteine removal during early embryonic development.\nHere, we report that the c.56+781 A>C (rs326119) variant of intron-1 of MTRR significantly increases the risk of CHD in the Han Chinese population. In 3 independent case-control studies involving a total of 2340 CHD patients and 2270 healthy control participants from different geographic areas, we observed that patients carrying the heterozygous AC and homozygous CC genotype had a 1.40-fold (odds ratio=1.40; P=2.32\u00d710(-7)) and 1.84-fold (odds ratio=1.84; P=2.3\u00d710(-11)) increased risk, respectively, of developing CHD than those carrying the wild-type AA genotype. Both in vivo quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of MTRR mRNA in cardiac tissue samples from CHD patients and in vitro luciferase assays in transfected cells demonstrated that the c.56+781 C allele profoundly decreased MTRR transcription. Further analysis demonstrated that the c.56+781 C allele manifested reduced CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 binding affinity. In addition, healthy individuals with the homozygous CC genotype had significantly elevated levels of plasma homocysteine compared with the wild-type AA carriers.\nWe have demonstrated that the MTRR c.56+781 A>C variant is an important genetic marker for increased CHD risk because this variant results in functionally reduced MTRR expression at the transcriptional level. Our results accentuate the significance of functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in noncoding regions of the homocysteine/folate metabolism pathway core genes for their potential contributions to the origin of CHD.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2011-12-20", "authors": ["Jian-YuanZhao", "Xue-YanYang", "Xiao-HongGong", "Zhuo-YaGu", "Wen-YuanDuan", "JueWang", "Zhi-ZhouYe", "Hong-BingShen", "Kai-HuShi", "JiaHou", "Guo-YingHuang", "LiJin", "BinQiao", "Hong-YanWang"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.050245"}
{"title": "Connexin43 mutation causes heterogeneous gap junction loss and sudden infant death.", "abstract": "An estimated 10% to 15% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases may stem from channelopathy-mediated lethal arrhythmias. Loss of the GJA1-encoded gap junction channel protein connexin43 is known to underlie formation of lethal arrhythmias. GJA1 mutations have been associated with cardiac diseases, including atrial fibrillation. Therefore, GJA1 is a plausible candidate gene for premature sudden death.\nGJA1 open reading frame mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and direct DNA sequencing on DNA from 292 SIDS cases. Immunofluorescence and dual whole-cell patch-clamp studies were performed to determine the functionality of mutant gap junctions. Immunostaining for gap junction proteins was performed on SIDS-associated paraffin-embedded cardiac tissue. Two rare, novel missense mutations, E42K and S272P, were detected in 2 of 292 SIDS cases, a 2-month-old white boy and a 3-month-old white girl, respectively. Analysis of the E42K victim's parental DNA demonstrated a de novo mutation. Both mutations involved highly conserved residues and were absent in >1000 ethnically matched reference alleles. Immunofluorescence demonstrated no trafficking abnormalities for either mutation, and S272P demonstrated wild-type junctional conductance. However, junctional conductance measurements for the E42K mutation demonstrated a loss of function not rescued by wild type. Moreover, the E42K victim's cardiac tissue demonstrated a mosaic immunostaining pattern for connexin43 protein.\nThis study provides the first molecular and functional evidence implicating a GJA1 mutation as a novel pathogenic substrate for SIDS.

{"title": "Biomimetic perfusion and electrical stimulation applied in concert improved the assembly of engineered cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Maintenance of normal myocardial function depends intimately on synchronous tissue contraction, driven by electrical activation and on adequate nutrient perfusion in support thereof. Bioreactors have been used to mimic aspects of these factors in vitro to engineer cardiac tissue but, due to design limitations, previous bioreactor systems have yet to simultaneously support nutrient perfusion, electrical stimulation and unconstrained (i.e. not isometric) tissue contraction. To the best of our knowledge, the bioreactor system described herein is the first to integrate these three key factors in concert. We present the design of our bioreactor and characterize its capability in integrated experimental and mathematical modelling studies. We then cultured cardiac cells obtained from neonatal rats in porous, channelled elastomer scaffolds with the simultaneous application of perfusion and electrical stimulation, with controls excluding either one or both of these two conditions. After 8 days of culture, constructs grown with simultaneous perfusion and electrical stimulation exhibited substantially improved functional properties, as evidenced by a significant increase in contraction amplitude (0.23 \u00b1 0.10% vs 0.14 \u00b1 0.05%, 0.13 \u00b1 0.08% or 0.09 \u00b1 0.02% in control constructs grown without stimulation, without perfusion, or either stimulation or perfusion, respectively). Consistently, these constructs had significantly improved DNA contents, cell distribution throughout the scaffold thickness, cardiac protein expression, cell morphology and overall tissue organization compared to control groups. Thus, the simultaneous application of medium perfusion and electrical conditioning enabled by the use of the novel bioreactor system may accelerate the generation of fully functional, clinically sized cardiac tissue constructs.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2011-12-16", "authors": ["RobertMaidhof", "NinaTandon", "Eun JungLee", "JianwenLuo", "YiDuan", "KeithYeager", "ElisaKonofagou", "GordanaVunjak-Novakovic"], "doi": "10.1002/term.525"}

Restoration of functional electrical properties of the damaged heart muscle is essential to recover from the infarction. While there are a few reports that demonstrate that fibroblasts can form junctions that transmit electrical signals, a potential alternative using the injection of stem cells has emerged as a promising cellular therapy; however, stem-cell electrical conductivity within the cardiac muscle fiber is unknown. In this study, an in vitro cardiac muscle model was established on an MEA-based biochip with multiple cardiomyocytes that mimic cardiac tissue structure. Using a laser beam, stem cells were inserted adjacent to each muscle fiber (cell bridge model) and allowed to form cell-cell contact as determined by the formation of gap junctions. The electrical conductivity of stem cells was assessed and compared with the electrical conductivities of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. Results showed that stem cell-myocyte contacts exhibited higher and more stable conduction velocities than myocyte-fibroblast contacts, which indicated that stem cells have higher electrical compatibility with native cardiac muscle fibers than cardiac fibroblasts.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2011-12-16", "authors": ["ZhenMa", "QiuyingLiu", "HonghaiLiu", "HuaxiaoYang", "Julie XYun", "CarolEisenberg", "Thomas KBorg", "MeifengXu", "Bruce ZGao"], "doi": "10.1039/c2lc20699d"}
{"title": "Cardiomyocytes rhythmically beating generated from goat embryonic stem cell.", "abstract": "The aim of present investigation was isolation, characterization and differentiation into cardiomyocytes of putative goat embryonic stem cells produced from in vitro fertilized goat embryos. Goat blastocysts were produced in vitro by standard methods of in vitro maturation (IVM), in vitro fertilization (IVF) and in vitro culture (IVC) techniques. The ICMs isolated from IVF blastocysts were cultured on 10 \u03bcl/ml mitomycin-C inactivated fetal fibroblast feeder layer with LIF. The putative ES colonies were characterized for extracellular markers like alkaline phosphatase, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA-1, SSEA-4 by immunocytochemistry and intracellular markers like Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog with reverse-transcription-PCR. The ES cells were successfully subcultured up to 22nd passage with feeder layer and LIF and up to 12th passage without feeder layer with LIF only. They exhibited normal karyotyping (20th passage) and maintained the expression of specific surface markers like alkaline phosphatase, SSEA-4, TRA-1-61, TRA-1-81 and intracellular markers Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. The embryoid bodies (EBs) were generated from goat ES cells of 20th passage and were analyzed with markers like Gata4, BMP4 and Nestin. Differentiation was induced by medium containing 100 ng/ml Activin-A, 10 ng/ml FGF-2 and 100 ng/ml BMP-4. The embryoid bodies were analyzed with markers like Gata4, BMP4 and Nestin. The rhythmic beating of cardiomyocytes was observed after 30 d and the beating was still continuing even after 160 d of culturing. Similarly, 2nd and 3rd batches of EBs were also beating and the beating continues after 75 d and on. The beating cells were observed positive for cardiac specific markers like \u03b1 Actinin, C-Troponin and \u03b1-Myosin heavy chain. Histological studies also revealed morphology similar to cardiomyocytes. Prominent contractions typical of cardiac tissue have been maintained in the differentiated cells up to 160 d and still continuing beating at the rate of 30 beats/min.

These cells constitute a promising source of material for use in drug development, toxicity testing, and regenerative medicine. To assess their utility as replacement or complement to existing models, extensive phenotypic characterization of the cells is required. In the present study, we used microarrays and analyzed the global transcription of hESC-derived cardiomyocyte clusters (CMCs) and determined similarities as well as differences compared with reference samples from fetal and adult heart tissue. In addition, we performed a focused analysis of the expression of cardiac ion channels and genes involved in the Ca(2+)-handling machinery, which in previous studies have been shown to be immature in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Our results show that hESC-derived CMCs, on a global level, have a highly similar gene expression profile compared with human heart tissue, and their transcriptional phenotype was more similar to fetal than to adult heart. Despite the high similarity to heart tissue, a number of significantly differentially expressed genes were identified, providing some clues toward understanding the molecular difference between in vivo sourced tissue and stem cell derivatives generated in vitro. Interestingly, some of the cardiac-related ion channels and Ca(2+)-handling genes showed differential expression between the CMCs and heart tissues.

{"title": "Hypoxic preconditioning enhances survival of human adipose-derived stem cells and conditions endothelial cells in vitro.", "abstract": "To grow more robust cardiac tissue for implantation in vivo, strategies to improve survival of implanted stem cells are required. Here we report the protective effects of hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) and identify mechanisms for improving survival of adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) in vitro. Human ASC were preconditioned for 24\u2009h with hypoxia and then exposed to simulated ischemia for a further 24\u2009h. HPC significantly increased ASC viability, and reduced cell injury and apoptosis compared with non-preconditioned cells under ischemic conditions, as shown by 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), lactate dehydrogenase-release, and caspase activity assays. Preconditioned ASC increased levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and secreted significantly more of the downstream target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A; 13-fold) compared with control during the 24\u2009h. Exogenous VEGF (50\u2009ng/mL) increased phosphorylation of Akt without affecting ERK1/2, JNK, or p38 MAPK protein levels. Phospho-Akt was also increased in preconditioned ASC compared with non-preconditioned ASC, an effect that may be mediated via VEGF-A. Importantly, the protective effects of HPC were abolished by a neutralizing antibody against VEGF-A and the phosphoinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, demonstrating the importance of VEGF-A and Akt in hypoxia-induced ASC survival. Importantly, we showed that media derived from hypoxic preconditioned ASC support endothelial cell survival and endothelial tube formation in vitro.

They form homo- (RXR) and hetero- (PPAR-RXR) dimers that bind DNA at various REs. The AP2\u03b12 gene is part of complex and process that transports lipids and proteins from the plasma membrane to the endosomal system.

Type 1 diabetic mellitus (T1DM) is associated with increased cardiovascular complications at an early stage of the disease. The purpose of the present study was to explore whether arjunolic acid (AA) plays any protective role against cardiovascular complications in T1DM and if so, what molecular pathways it utilizes for the mechanism of its protective action. Streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce T1DM in experimental rats. Alteration in plasma lipid profile and release of membrane bound enzymes like LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and CK (creatine kinase) established the association of hyperlipidemia and cell membrane disintegration with hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia altered the levels of oxidative stress related biomarkers, decreased the intracellular NAD and ATP concentrations. Hyperglycemia-induced enhanced levels of VEGF, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and IL-6 in the plasma of STZ treated animals indicate vascular inflammation in T1DM. Histological studies and FACS analysis revealed that hyperglycemia caused cell death mostly via the apoptotic pathway. Investigating molecular mechanism, we observed NF-\u03baB and MAPKs (p38 and ERK1/2) activations, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome C release, caspase 3 activation and PARP cleavage in apoptotic cell death in the diabetic cardiac tissue. Treatment with AA (20\u00a0mg/kg body weight) reduced hyperglycemia, membrane disintegration, oxidative stress, vascular inflammation and prevented the activation of oxidative stress induced signaling cascades leading to cell death.

{"title": "Kaempferol protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro.", "abstract": "The long-term clinical usefulness of doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline with potent antitumor activity, is limited by DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Kaempferol, one of the most common dietary flavonoids, is known to have anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties. The current study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of kaempferol against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms. Rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) treated with DOX (3 mg/kg) every other day for a cumulative dose of 9 mg/kg. After 28 days, DOX caused retarded body and heart growth, oxidative stress, apoptotic damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Bcl-2 expression disturbance. In contrast, kaempferol pretreatment (10 mg/kg i.p. before DOX administration) attenuated the DOX-induced apoptotic damage in heart tissues. In vitro studies also indicated that kaempferol may have used the mitochondrion-dependent pathway to counteract the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. This counteraction was achieved by inhibiting p53 expression and its binding to the promoter region of the Bax proapoptotic gene, but not to the Bcl-2 antiapoptotic gene. Kaempferol also effectively suppressed DOX-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation, but had no effect on p38 and JNK. Therefore, kaempferol protected against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, at least, partially, by inhibiting the activation of p53-mediated, mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic signaling, and by being involved in an ERK-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These findings elucidated the potential of kaempferol as a promising reagent for treating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, and may have implications in the long-term clinical usefulness of DOX.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2011-12-14", "authors": ["JingXiao", "Gui-BoSun", "BingSun", "YingWu", "LingHe", "XinWang", "Rong-ChangChen", "LiCao", "Xiao-YuRen", "Xiao-BoSun"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tox.2011.11.018"}
{"title": "Inhibition of heart formation by lithium is an indirect result of the disruption of tissue organization within the embryo.", "abstract": "Lithium is a commonly used drug for the treatment of bipolar disorder. At high doses, lithium becomes teratogenic, which is a property that has allowed this agent to serve as a useful tool for dissecting molecular pathways that regulate embryogenesis. This study was designed to examine the impact of lithium on heart formation in the developing frog for insights into the molecular regulation of cardiac specification. Embryos were exposed to lithium at the beginning of gastrulation, which produced severe malformations of the anterior end of the embryo. Although previous reports characterized this deformity as a posteriorized phenotype, histological analysis revealed that the defects were more comprehensive, with disfigurement and disorganization of all interior tissues along the anterior-posterior axis. Emerging tissues were poorly segregated and cavity formation was decreased within the embryo. Lithium exposure also completely ablated formation of the heart and prevented myocardial cell differentiation. Despite the complete absence of cardiac tissue in lithium treated embryos, exposure to lithium did not prevent myocardial differentiation of precardiac dorsal marginal zone explants. Moreover, precardiac tissue freed from the embryo subsequent to lithium treatment at gastrulation gave rise to cardiac tissue, as demonstrated by upregulation of cardiac gene expression, display of sarcomeric proteins, and formation of a contractile phenotype.

Among these, cardiac tissue engineering is one of the most promising. Aim of this study is to develop a 3D scaffold to treat cardiac failure. A new three-block copolymer, obtained from \u03b4-valerolactone and polyoxyethylene, was synthesised under high vacuum without catalyst. Copolymer/gelatine blends were microfabricated to obtain a ECM-like geometry. Structures were studied under morphological, mechanical, degradation and biological aspects. To prevent left ventricular remodelling, constructs were biofunctionalises with molecularly imprinted nanoparticles towards the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9. Results showed that materials are able to reproduce the ECM structure with high resolution, mechanical properties were in the order of MPa similar to those of the native myocardium and cell viability was verified. Nanoparticles showed the capability to rebind MMP-9 (specific rebinding 18.67) and to be permanently immobilised on the scaffold surface.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

This study aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms affected by blocking IL-17A responses in acute virus-induced myocarditis (AVMC) mice. The results showed that IL-17A and COX-2 proteins were significantly increased in the cardiac tissue of acute myocarditis, as were Th17 cells in the spleen. Using anti-mouse IL-17Ab to block IL-17A on day 7 of the viral myocarditis led to decreased expressions of cardiac tumor-necrosis factor alpha, IL-17A and transforming growth factor beta in AVMC mice compared to isotype control mice. COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 proteins were dramatically elevated, followed by marked reductions in CVB3 replication and myocardial injury.

MSI was conducted on cardiac tissue following a 24-h left anterior descending coronary artery ligation to analyze multiple compound classes. First, the spatial distribution of a small metabolite, creatine, was used to identify areas of infarcted myocardium. Second, multivariate data analysis and tandem mass spectrometry were used to identify phospholipid (PL) markers of MI. A number of lysophospholipids demonstrated increased ion signal in areas of infarction. In contrast, select intact PLs demonstrated decreased ion signal in the area of infarction.

Evacuation of the enucleated tissue from the bladder is usually performed by electric morcellators. Until now, a standardized evaluation of the different morcellator settings does not exist. Therefore, we developed an ex-vivo model to find the best settings for four different morcellators.\nWe morcellated pieces of a prostate adenoma after an open adenomectomy. The same speed settings were used to morcellate commercially available minced meat, fine pork sausage meat, and bovine heart, all of which had been cooked for 10 minutes using a Piranha Morcellator. We also morcellated raw pig perirenal fat tissue, raw pig liver, and raw bovine heart. The pieces were morcellated at different speed settings in an open water tank filled with saline. Because raw bovine heart showed to be the most equivalent tissue, we morcellated five pieces with four different settings of four different morcellators: The Piranha, the VersaCut, and two morcellator prototypes.\nThe median retrieval rate for the prostate adenoma was 14.02 (3.7-19.8) g/min. The retrieval rate for raw bovine heart was 13.75 (5.66-20) g/min. The maximum morcellation rates of the morcellators were: Piranha 20 (19.3-21.4) g/min, VersaCut 10.8 (8.2-13.1) g/min, Karl Storz prototype 9.8 (7.9-10.76) g/min, and Richard Wolf prototype 38.6 (35.3-42.9) g/min.\nRaw bovine heart tissue is suitable for ex-vivo testing of prostate morcellators and can replace human prostate tissue in this standardized setting.

In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of taurine in diabetes associated cardiac complications using a rat model. Rats were made diabetic by alloxan (ALX) (single i.p. dose of 120mg/kg body weight) and left untreated or treated with taurine (1% w/v, orally, in water) for three weeks either from the day of ALX exposure or after the onset of diabetes. Animals were euthanized after three weeks. ALX-induced diabetes decreased body weight, increased glucose level, decreased insulin content, enhanced the levels of cardiac damage markers and altered lipid profile in the plasma. Moreover, it increased oxidative stress (decreased antioxidant enzyme activities and GSH/GSSG ratio, increased xanthine oxidase enzyme activity, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation and ROS generation) and enhanced the proinflammatory cytokines levels, activity of myeloperoxidase and nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB in the cardiac tissue of the experimental animals. Taurine treatment could, however, result to a decrease in the elevated blood glucose and proinflammatory cytokine levels, diabetes-evoked oxidative stress, lipid profiles and NF\u03baB translocation. In addition, taurine increased GLUT 4 translocation to the cardiac membrane by enhanced phosphorylation of IR and IRS1 at tyrosine and Akt at serine residue in the heart. Results also suggest that taurine could protect cardiac tissue from ALX induced apoptosis via the regulation of Bcl2 family and caspase 9/3 proteins.

{"title": "Dramatic increase of nitrite levels in hearts of anoxia-exposed crucian carp supporting a role in cardioprotection.", "abstract": "Nitrite (NO(2)(-)) functions as an important nitric oxide (NO) donor under hypoxic conditions. Both nitrite and NO have been found to protect the mammalian heart and other tissues against ischemia (anoxia)-reoxygenation injury by interacting with mitochondrial electron transport complexes and limiting the generation of reactive oxygen species upon reoxygenation. The crucian carp naturally survives extended periods without oxygen in an active state, which has made it a model for studying how evolution has solved the problems of anoxic survival. We investigated the role of nitrite and NO in the anoxia tolerance of this fish by measuring NO metabolites in normoxic, anoxic, and reoxygenated crucian carp. We also cloned and sequenced crucian carp NO synthase variants and quantified their mRNA levels in several tissues in normoxia and anoxia. Despite falling levels of blood plasma nitrite, the crucian carp showed massive increases in nitrite, S-nitrosothiols (SNO), and iron-nitrosyl (FeNO) compounds in anoxic heart tissue. NO(2)(-) levels were maintained in anoxic brain, liver, and gill tissues, whereas SNO and FeNO increased in a tissue-specific manner. Reoxygenation reestablished normoxic values. We conclude that NO(2)(-) is shifted into the tissues where it acts as NO donor during anoxia, inducing cytoprotection under anoxia/reoxygenation. This can be especially important in the crucian carp heart, which maintains output in anoxia. NO(2)(-) is currently tested as a therapeutic drug against reperfusion damage of ischemic hearts, and the present study provides evolutionary precedent for such an approach.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

In this study we describe a novel, single-detector mapping system that utilizes two excitation and one emission band for the simultaneous recording of action potentials and calcium transients in monolayers of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Cells stained with the Ca(2+)-sensitive dye X-Rhod-1 and the voltage-sensitive dye Di-4-ANEPPS were illuminated by a programmable, multicolor LED matrix. Blue and green LED pulses were flashed 180\u00b0 out of phase at a rate of 488.3 Hz using a custom-built dual bandpass excitation filter that transmitted blue (482 \u00b1 6 nm) and green (577 \u00b1 31 nm) light. A long-pass emission filter (>605 nm) and a 504-channel photodiode array were used to record combined signals from cardiomyocytes. Green excitation yielded Ca(i) transients without significant crosstalk from V(m).

To sequence PTX3 gene in S. scrofa, the high homology between Homo sapiens and S. scrofa was exploited. Pig PTX3 mRNA was sequenced using polymerase chain reaction primers designed from human consensus sequences. The DNA, obtained from different RT-PCR reactions, was sequenced using the Sanger method. S. scrofa PTX3 mRNA, 1-336 bp, was submitted to GenBank (ID: GQ412351). The sequence obtained from pig cardiac tissue shared an 84% sequence identity with human homolog.

Isolated mitochondria and permeabilized cardiac fibers were used for swelling and mitochondrial function experiments, respectively. Mitochondrial morphology and permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening were assessed by fluorescence in isolated cardiomyocytes. ISO treatment induced cell damage, oxidative stress, and apoptosis that were prevented by curcumin. Moreover, mitochondria seem to play an important role in these effects as respiration and mitochondrial swelling were increased following ISO treatment, these effects being again prevented by curcumin. Importantly, curcumin completely prevented the ISO-induced increase in mPTP calcium susceptibility in isolated cardiomyocytes without affecting mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial network dynamic.

Direct implantation of isolated skeletal myoblasts and bone-marrow-derived cells has already been clinically performed and research on fabricating three-dimensional (3-D) cardiac grafts using tissue engineering technologies has also now been initiated. In contrast to conventional scaffold-based methods, we have proposed cell sheet-based tissue engineering, which involves stacking confluently cultured cell sheets to construct 3-D cell-dense tissues. Upon layering, individual cardiac cell sheets integrate to form a single, continuous, cell-dense tissue that resembles native cardiac tissue. The transplantation of layered cardiac cell sheets is able to repair damaged hearts. As the next step, we have attempted to promote neovascularization within bioengineered myocardial tissues to overcome the longstanding limitations of engineered tissue thickness. Finally, as a possible advanced therapy, we are now trying to fabricate functional myocardial tubes that may have a potential for circulatory support. Cell sheet-based tissue engineering technologies therefore show an enormous promise as a novel approach in the field of myocardial tissue engineering.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2011-11-19", "authors": ["HidekazuSekine", "TatsuyaShimizu", "TeruoOkano"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-011-1267-6"}
{"title": "A selective Akt inhibitor produces hypotension and bradycardia in conscious rats due to inhibition of the autonomic nervous system.", "abstract": "Akt is a serine-threonine kinase that is amplified in a variety of human cancers, and as with other anticancer agents, some Akt inhibitors have produced functional cardiovascular effects such as marked hypotension that may limit their clinical benefit. Although identified in preclinical studies, the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects are often not fully characterized; potential targets include Akt signaling disruption in cardiac tissue, vascular smooth muscle, and/or autonomic system signaling. A selective Akt inhibitor was found to produce a rapid and marked hypotension and bradycardia in conscious rats. Isolated right atrial tissue and isolated thoracic aortic rings were used to examine direct effects of Akt inhibition on cardiac and vascular tissues, respectively. In addition, rats surgically prepared with telemetry units for monitoring blood pressure and heart rate were used to investigate potential effects on the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Whereas this Akt inhibitor did not produce any significant effect on atrial tissue, it did cause vasorelaxation of aortic rings. More significantly, in conscious rats, the Akt inhibitor inhibited the neural pressor response to the known nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) agonist dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP). In fact, the response observed was comparable to the response observed with the known ganglionic blocker hexamethonium. Thus, the hypotension and bradycardia produced by the Akt inhibitor is primarily due to blockade of nAchRs in autonomic ganglia. This finding highlights the importance of evaluating the ANS for cardiovascular effects associated with new chemical entities as well as suggesting a novel direct effect of an Akt inhibitor on nAchRs.", "journal": "Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology", "date": "2011-11-19", "authors": ["Jonathan PRenninger", "Dennis JMurphy", "Diane WMorel"], "doi": "10.1093/toxsci/kfr316"}
{"title": "A microfabricated platform to measure and manipulate the mechanics of engineered cardiac microtissues.", "abstract": "Engineered myocardial tissues can be used to elucidate fundamental features of myocardial biology, develop organotypic in vitro model systems, and as engineered tissue constructs for replacing damaged heart tissue in vivo. However, a key limitation is an inability to test the wide range of parameters (cell source, mechanical, soluble and electrical stimuli) that might impact the engineered tissue in a high-throughput manner and in an environment that mimics native heart tissue. Here we used microelectromechanical systems technology to generate arrays of cardiac microtissues (CMTs) embedded within three-dimensional micropatterned matrices. Microcantilevers simultaneously constrain CMT contraction and report forces generated by the CMTs in real time. We demonstrate the ability to routinely produce ~200 CMTs per million cardiac cells (<1 neonatal rat heart) whose spontaneous contraction frequency, duration, and forces can be tracked. Independently varying the mechanical stiffness of the cantilevers and collagen matrix revealed that both the dynamic force of cardiac contraction as well as the basal static tension within the CMT increased with boundary or matrix rigidity. Cell alignment is, however, reduced within a stiff collagen matrix; therefore, despite producing higher force, CMTs constructed from higher density collagen have a lower cross-sectional stress than those constructed from lower density collagen. We also study the effect of electrical stimulation on cell alignment and force generation within CMTs and we show that the combination of electrical stimulation and auxotonic load strongly improves both the structure and the function of the CMTs. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of our technique for high-throughput monitoring of drug-induced changes in spontaneous frequency or contractility in CMTs as well as high-speed imaging of calcium dynamics using fluorescent dyes. Together, these results highlight the potential for this approach to quantitatively demonstrate the impact of physical parameters on the maturation, structure, and function of cardiac tissue and open the possibility to use high-throughput, low volume screening for studies on engineered myocardium.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Acute lung injury and sepsis were induced according to an established protocol. The sham group received only the vehicle. The sheep were studied in awake state for 24 h and mechanically ventilated. Recombinant human APC (continuous infusion 24 \u03bcg/kg per hour) and ceftazidime (3-g bolus at 1 and 13 h) were intravenously administered. The animals were fluid resuscitated with Ringer's lactate to maintain hematocrit at baseline.

This is of importance for extended understanding of cardiac function as well as development of new therapeutic drugs. Heart tissue for gene expression studies is generally hard to obtain, particularly from the ventricles. Since different parts of the heart have different functions, expression profiles should likely differ between these parts. The aim of the study was therefore to compare the global gene expression in cardiac tissue from the more accessible auricula of the right atrium to expression in tissue from the left ventricle. Tissue samples were collected from five men undergoing aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting. Global gene expression analysis identified 542 genes as differentially expressed between the samples extracted from these two locations, corresponding to ~2% of the genes covered by the microarray; 416 genes were identified as abundantly expressed in right atrium, and 126 genes were abundantly expressed in left ventricle. Further analysis of the differentially expressed genes according to available annotations, information from curated pathways and known protein interactions, showed that genes with higher expression in the ventricle were mainly associated with contractile work of the heart.

In mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet and in cultured endothelial cells (ECs) treated with high palmitate and high glucose (HPHG), there was decreased HRas palmitoylation on Cys181/184 (61\u00b124% decrease for cardiac tissue and 38\u00b17.0% in ECs). This was due to oxidation of Cys181/184, detected using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI TOF)-TOF. Decrease in HRas palmitoylation affected its compartmentalization and Ras binding domain binding activity, with a shift from plasma membrane tethering to Golgi localization. Loss of plasma membrane-bound HRas decreased growth factor-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (84\u00b18.6% decrease) and increased apoptotic signaling (24\u00b16.5-fold increase) after HPHG treatment that was prevented by overexpressing wild-type but not C181/184S HRas. The essential role of HRas in metabolic stress was made evident by the similar effects of expressing an inactive dominant negative N17-HRas or a MEK inhibitor.

Here, we sought to determine the specific intracardiac signaling activated by CST in the rat heart. Physiological analyses performed on isolated, Langendorff-perfused cardiac preparations revealed that CST-induced negative inotropism and lusitropism involve \u03b2(2)/\u03b2(3)-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2(2)/\u03b2(3)-AR), showing a higher affinity for \u03b2(2)-AR.

The most striking characteristic of HCM mutations in MYBPC3 is that many are within introns and are predicted to cause aberrant splicing leading to a frameshift and a premature chain termination, yet the truncated peptides have never been identified in human heart tissue carrying these mutations. Instead of expression of a poison peptide we consistently observe haploinsufficiency of MyBP-C in MYBPC3 mutant human heart muscle. In this review we investigate the mechanism for MyBP-C haploinsufficiency and consider how this haploinsufficiency could cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Journal of muscle research and cell motility", "date": "2011-11-08", "authors": ["StevenMarston", "O'NealCopeland", "KatjaGehmlich", "SaskiaSchlossarek", "LucieCarrier"], "doi": "10.1007/s10974-011-9268-3"}
{"title": "Age- and chamber-specific differences in oxidative stress after ischemic injury.", "abstract": "Each year, tens of thousands of children undergo cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to correct congenital heart defects. Although necessary for surgery, CPB involves stopping the heart and exposing it to ischemic conditions. On reoxygenation, the heart can experience effects similar to that of acute myocardial infarction. Although much is known about adult injury, little is known about the effects of global ischemia on newborn ventricles. We studied newborn (2 to 4 days old) and adult (>8 weeks old) rabbit hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (30 min of ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion). Our data demonstrated chamber- and age-specific changes in oxidative stress. During ischemia, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) increased in both right-ventricular (RV) and left-ventricular (LV) myocytes of the newborn, although only the RV change was significant. In contrast, there was no significant increase in H(2)O(2) in either RV or LV myocytes of adults. There was a fivefold increase in H(2)O(2) formation in newborn RV myocytes compared with adults (P = 0.006). In whole-heart tissue, superoxide dismutase activity increased from sham versus ischemia in the left ventricle of both adult and newborn hearts, but it was increased only in the right ventricle of the newborn heart. Catalase activity was significantly increased after ischemia in both adult ventricles, whereas no increase was seen in newborn compared with sham hearts. In addition, catalase levels in newborns were significantly lower, indicating less scavenging potential. Nanoparticle-encapsulated ebselen, given as an intracardiac injection into the right or left ventricle of newborn hearts, significantly increased functional recovery of developed pressure only in the right ventricle, indicating the potential for localized antioxidant therapy during and after pediatric surgical procedures.", "journal": "Pediatric cardiology", "date": "2011-11-08", "authors": ["E BernadetteCabigas", "GuoliangDing", "TaoChen", "Talib BSaafir", "Karl DPendergrass", "Mary BWagner", "Michael EDavis"], "doi": "10.1007/s00246-011-0137-z"}

Because endogenous cardiac repair mechanisms are not sufficient for meaningful tissue regeneration, MI results in loss of cardiac tissue and detrimental remodeling events. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence dependent manner. Our previous data indicate that miRNAs are dysregulated in response to ischemic injury of the heart and actively contribute to cardiac remodeling after MI.\nThis study was designed to determine whether miRNAs are dysregulated on ischemic damage in porcine cardiac tissues and whether locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified anti-miR chemistries can target cardiac expressed miRNAs to therapeutically inhibit miR-15 on ischemic injury.\nOur data indicate that the miR-15 family, which includes 6 closely related miRNAs, is regulated in the infarcted region of the heart in response to ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice and pigs. LNA-modified chemistries can effectively silence miR-15 family members in vitro and render cardiomyocytes resistant to hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte cell death. Correspondingly, systemic delivery of miR-15 anti-miRs dose-dependently represses miR-15 in cardiac tissue of both mice and pigs, whereas therapeutic targeting of miR-15 in mice reduces infarct size and cardiac remodeling and enhances cardiac function in response to MI.\nOligonucleotide-based therapies using LNA-modified chemistries for modulating cardiac miRNAs in the setting of heart disease are efficacious and validate miR-15 as a potential therapeutic target for the manipulation of cardiac remodeling and function in the setting of ischemic injury.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2011-11-05", "authors": ["Thomas GHullinger", "Rusty LMontgomery", "Anita GSeto", "Brent ADickinson", "Hillary MSemus", "Joshua MLynch", "Christina MDalby", "KathrynRobinson", "ChristiannaStack", "Paul ALatimer", "Joshua MHare", "Eric NOlson", "Evavan Rooij"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.244442"}

We investigated p53-mediated expansion of ischemic damage with a focus on mitochondrial integrity in association with autophagy and apoptosis. p53(-/-) heart showed that autophagic flux was promoted under ischemia without a change in cardiac tissue ATP content. Electron micrographs revealed that ischemic border zone in p53(-/-) mice had 5-fold greater numbers of autophagic vacuoles containing mitochondria, indicating the occurrence of mitophagy, with an apparent reduction of abnormal mitochondria compared with those in WT mice. Analysis of autophagic mediators acting downstream of p53 revealed that TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator) was exclusively up-regulated in ischemic myocardium. TIGAR(-/-) mice exhibited the promotion of mitophagy followed by decrease of abnormal mitochondria and resistance to ischemic injury, consistent with the phenotype of p53(-/-) mice. In p53(-/-) and TIGAR(-/-) ischemic myocardium, ROS production was elevated and followed by Bnip3 activation which is an initiator of mitophagy. Furthermore, the activation of Bnip3 and mitophagy due to p53/TIGAR inhibition were reversed with antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, indicating that this adaptive response requires ROS signal. Inhibition of mitophagy using chloroquine in p53(-/-) or TIGAR(-/-) mice exacerbated accumulation of damaged mitochondria to the level of wild-type mice and attenuated cardioprotective action.

In addition, changes of erythrocyte shape, T-tubule, and microvasculature in mouse heart from a variety of models (acute increase of left ventricular afterload, myocardial ischemia, and cardiac arrest) were examined by IVCT. With IVCT, flowing erythrocytes, blood flow, microvasculature, and myocyte structure could be well preserved without artificial change of erythrocyte shape and translocation of serum proteins as displayed in conventional preparation samples. Furthermore, in various pathological models prepared by IVCT, T-tubules with albumin immuno-positive staining were arranged in a disorderly way and were decreased in volume in samples of acute increase of left ventricular afterload (IVCT-LAA). This was more evident in acute regional myocardial ischemia (IVCT-IC) and less evident in heart arrest (IVCT-HA).

{"title": "Deubiquitylating enzyme USP2 counteracts Nedd4-2-mediated downregulation of KCNQ1 potassium channels.", "abstract": "KCNQ1 (Kv7.1), together with its KCNE \u03b2 subunits, plays a pivotal role both in the repolarization of cardiac tissue and in water and salt transport across epithelial membranes. Nedd4/Nedd4-like (neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4) ubiquitin-protein ligases interact with the KCNQ1 potassium channel through a PY motif located in the C terminus of KCNQ1. This interaction induces ubiquitylation of KCNQ1, resulting in a reduced surface density of the channel. It was reported recently that the epithelial sodium channel is regulated by the reverse process-deubiquitylation-mediated by USP2 (ubiquitin-specific protease 2).\nIn this article, we investigated whether deubiquitylation may regulate KCNQ1 channel complexes.\nIn this study, we used electrophysiology, biochemistry, and confocal microscopy.\nElectrophysiological investigations of KCNQ1/KCNE1 proteins coexpressed with USP2-45 or USP2-69 isoforms and Nedd4-2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes and mammalian cells revealed that both USP2 isoforms counter the Nedd4-2-specific downregulation of I(Ks). Biochemical studies showed that the total and surface-expressed KCNQ1 protein was more abundant when coexpressed with USP2 and Nedd4-2 as compared with Nedd4-2 alone. Western blotting revealed partial protection against covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties on KCNQ1 when USP2 was coexpressed with Nedd4-2. Coimmunoprecipitation assays suggested that USP2 can bind to KCNQ1 independently of the PY motif. Immunocytochemistry confirmed that USP2 restores the membrane localization of KCNQ1.\nThese results demonstrate that USP2 can be a potent regulator of KCNQ1 surface density. USP2, which is well expressed in many tissues, may therefore be important in controlling the KCNQ1 channel dynamics in vivo.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2011-10-26", "authors": ["KatarzynaKrzystanek", "Hanne BorgerRasmussen", "MortenGrunnet", "OlivierStaub", "S\u00f8ren-PeterOlesen", "HuguesAbriel", "ThomasJespersen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.10.026"}

Yet, recent studies include more immediate affects of hypoxia on gene expression and these data suggest the maintenance of mitochondrial function. To better understand the short-term physiological response to hypoxia, we quantified metabolic mRNA expression in the heart ventricles and livers of the teleost fish Fundulus grandis exposed to partial oxygen pressure of 2.8\u2009kPa (-13.5% air saturation).Twenty-eight individuals from a single population were exposed to hypoxia for 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 96\u2009 hr.

Gene expression was significantly different (ANOVA, P < 0.05) for 17 of 226 metabolic genes (7.5%) in cardiac tissue and for 20 of 256 (7.8%) metabolic genes in hepatic tissue. For the two tissues examined in this study, the maximum response occurred at different times. For cardiac tissue, using Dunnett's post hoc test, most of these significant differences occurred at 96 \u2009hr of exposure. For liver, all but one significant difference occurred at 4 \u2009hr. Surprisingly, too many (relative to random expectations) of the genes with significant increase in mRNA are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway: 44% of the significant genes at 96 \u2009hr in the heart and 33% of the significant genes at 4 \u2009hr in the liver are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. These data indicate that there are tissue-specific differences in the timing of the response to hypoxia, yet both cardiac and hepatic tissues have increases in mRNA that code for enzyme in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. If these changes in mRNA produce a similar change in protein, then these data suggest that the initial response to hypoxia involves an increase in the oxidative pathway potentially as a mechanism to maintain ATP production.", "journal": "Journal of experimental zoology.

The successful use of ESC-derived cardiomyocytes in cardiac tissue engineering requires an understanding of the important scaffold properties and culture conditions to promote cell attachment, differentiation, organization, and contractile function. The goal of this work was to investigate how scaffold architecture and coculture with fibroblasts influences the differentiated phenotype of murine ESC-derived cardiomyocytes (mESCDCs). Electrospinning was used to process an elastomeric biodegradable polyurethane (PU) into aligned or unaligned fibrous scaffolds. Bioreactor produced mESCDCs were seeded onto the PU scaffolds either on their own or after pre-seeding the scaffolds with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Viable mESCDCs attached to the PU scaffolds and were functionally contractile in all conditions tested. Importantly, the aligned scaffolds led to the anisotropic organization of rod-shaped cells, improved sarcomere organization, and increased mESCDC aspect ratio (length-to-diameter ratio) when compared to cells on the unaligned scaffolds. In addition, pre-seeding the scaffolds with MEFs improved mESCDC sarcomere formation compared to mESCDCs cultured alone. These results suggest that both fiber alignment and pre-treatment of scaffolds with fibroblasts improve the differentiation of mESCDCs and are important parameters for developing engineered myocardial tissue constructs using ESC-derived cardiac cells.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2011-10-19", "authors": ["Ian CParrag", "Peter WZandstra", "Kimberly AWoodhouse"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.23353"}

Stable isotopes of zinc can be used to identify body zinc compartments that have different turnover kinetics. Since the compartments might belong to physiological subsections of different organs, there is a need for microsampling analysis to determine isotope ratios of the trace element zinc in tissue samples. Here, we study the feasibility to use laser ablation coupled to quadrupole ICP-MS for the determination of zinc tracers given to rats at different time points with the aim to generate isotope ratio bioimages of heart tissue. A double tracer ((70)Zn and (67)Zn) experiment with rats was designed to label the exchangeable zinc pool as well as the stable zinc pool. The isotope ratios determined by laser ablation ICP-MS were evaluated by additional measurements of tissue digests. Accumulated tracers which made up more than 0.1% of total zinc could be identified in the tissues of the treated rats. It was established that at least 50 measurements from the microsampling were necessary to distinguish between controls and a tracer treated rat resulting in reduced resolution of the bioimage. With the parameters used, features in the tissue thin sections of at least 250 \u03bcm(2) in size are necessary to detect the incorporation of a tracer. When different time points have to be measured, higher precisions are required and therefore a larger area needs to be ablated (1 mm(2)).

Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3\u00a0months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-\u03b3 immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-\u03b21), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-\u03b3 protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-\u03b3 mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The expression of MMP-1 protein was not significantly different in three groups (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The expression of TIMP-1 and TGF-\u03b21 proteins was, however, higher in two irradiation groups than in the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

The most clinically promising approach to regeneration of cardiac muscle currently under investigation is that of injecting cardiogenic repair cells or implanting a preformed tissue-engineered patch. While major advances are being made in the derivation of functional human cardiomyocytes and the development of tissue-engineering modalities for cardiac repair, the host environment into which the repair cells are placed is largely overlooked. Within seconds of myocardial ischemia, hypoxia sets in in the myocardium and the inflammatory response starts, characterized by rapid deployment of circulating cells and the release of paracrine and autocrine signals. Therefore, the inflammatory conditions under which these interactions take place, the design of the scaffold material used, and the maturity of the implanted cells will determine the outcomes of any stem cell-based therapy.

In this study, we investigated cardiomyocyte innate immune response to T. cruzi infection and its role in cellular protection from apoptosis. We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2-expressing cells were strongly increased by the parasite in BALB/c neonatal mouse cardiomyocyte cultures. Using a dominant-negative system, we showed that TLR2 mediated cardiomyocyte survival and the secretion of interleukin (IL) 6, which acted as an essential anti-apoptotic factor. Moreover, IL6 released by infected cells, as well as the recombinant bioactive cytokine, induced the phosphorylation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) in cultured cardiomyocytes. In accord with the in vitro results, during the acute phase of the infection, TLR2 expression increased 2.9-fold and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 increased 4.5-fold in the cardiac tissue.

Litters of Wistar rats were either maintained at 12 pups (normal-fed group, NF), or reduced to 3 pups at birth in order to induce OF. At 6 months of age, metabolic parameters, circulating oxidative stress and aortic and coronary vasoreactivity were assessed. Cardiac susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion injury was also evaluated ex vivo as were markers of cardiac remodeling. OF led to an increase in body weight at weaning (+50%); the increase in body weight persisted throughout adult life, but was less marked (+10%). Significant increases in plasma levels of fasting glucose, insulin and leptin were found in OF rats. An increase in both plasma hydroperoxides and cardiac superoxide dismutase activity and a decrease in plasma ascorbate were found in OF rats. Vasoreactivity was not modified, but ex vivo, after 30 min of ischemia, isolated hearts from OF rats showed lower recovery of coronary flow along with a greater release of LDH. Studies on heart tissues showed an increase in collagen content and increased expression and activity of MMP-2.

Heart tissues from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC; n = 7), coronary heart disease (CHD; n = 6), and normal patients (n = 6) were analyzed by RT-PCR, SSCP, and Western blotting. In normal and IDC hearts, BK-2R expression increased with age, with a lower relative increase in IDC hearts. BK-2R mRNA and protein levels showed a positive linear correlation, suggesting transcriptional regulation. Two known BK-2R promoter polymorphisms, -58T/C and -9/+9, were found to be present in the study population. The allelic frequencies for the C-allele in -58T/C were 0.58 in normal and CHD hearts and 0.81 in IDC hearts. Furthermore, the allelic frequencies for the -9 and +9 alleles were 0.42 and 0.58 in normal hearts and 0.64 and 0.36 in IDC hearts, respectively. All analyzed CHD hearts were homozygous for the -9 allele.

{"title": "Cardiac insulin resistance and microRNA modulators.", "abstract": "Cardiac insulin resistance is a metabolic and functional disorder that is often associated with obesity and/or the cardiorenal metabolic syndrome (CRS), and this disorder may be accentuated by chronic alcohol consumption. In conditions of over-nutrition, increased insulin (INS) and angiotensin II (Ang II) activate mammalian target for rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) signaling, whereas chronic alcohol consumption inhibits mTOR/S6K1 activation in cardiac tissue. Although excessive activation of mTOR/S6K1 induces cardiac INS resistance via serine phosphorylation of INS receptor substrates (IRS-1/2), it also renders cardioprotection via increased Ang II receptor 2 (AT2R) upregulation and adaptive hypertrophy. In the INS-resistant and hyperinsulinemic Zucker obese (ZO) rat, a rodent model for CRS, activation of mTOR/S6K1signaling in cardiac tissue is regulated by protective feed-back mechanisms involving mTOR\u2194AT2R signaling loop and profile changes of microRNA that target S6K1. Such regulation may play a role in attenuating progressive heart failure.

Branched polyethylenimine (PEI; 25 kDa) was modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG; 5 kDa), thiolated and covalently attached to maleimide groups on lipid-coated microbubbles. The PEI-microbubbles demonstrated increasingly positive surface charge and DNA loading capacity with increasing maleimide content. The in vivo ultrasound contrast persistence of PEI-microbubbles was measured in the healthy mouse kidney, and a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model accounting for free and adherent microbubbles was developed to describe the anomalous time-intensity curves. The model suggested that PEI loading dramatically reduced free circulation and increased nonspecific adhesion to the vasculature. However, DNA loading to form polyplex-microbubbles increased circulation in the bloodstream and decreased nonspecific adhesion. PEI-microbubbles coupled to a luciferase bioluminescence reporter plasmid DNA were shown to transfect tumors implanted in the mouse kidney. Site-specific delivery was achieved using ultrasound applied over the tumor area following bolus injection of the DNA/PEI-microbubbles. In vivo imaging showed over 10-fold higher bioluminescence from the tumor region compared to untreated tissue.

Still, the calcium signaling pathways and intracellular calcium responses to various ligands or stress conditions have not been sufficiently explored as yet in embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells and in their differentiated offspring. This is partly due to the special culturing conditions of these cell types, the rapid morphological and functional changes in heterogeneous cell populations during early differentiation, and methodological problems in cellular calcium measurements.

Various assay methods are surveyed for obtaining reliable data both in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and in specific, stem cell-derived human tissues. In this paper, we present the modulation of calcium signaling in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and in their derivates; mesenchymal stem cell like (MSCl) cells and cardiac tissues using the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4 and confocal microscopy. LPA, trypsin and angiotensin II were effective in inducing calcium signals both in HUES9 and MSCl cells. Histamine and thrombin induced calcium signal exclusively in the MSCl cells, while ATP was effective only in HUES9 cells. There was no calcium signal evoked by GABA, even at relatively high concentrations.

Immunohistochemical staining of p21 in cardiac myocytes could be observed only in hypothermia death cases, in which the mRNA expression of the most abundant variant, p21V1, also exceeded that in other death cause groups. Cytoplasmic localization of p21 protein in vascular smooth muscle cells together with substantially increased expression of cardioprotective Pim-1 especially in chronic hypoxia, but in acute ischemia and hypothermia as well, indicate change of p21 function from cell cycle arrest to promotion of proliferation and cell survival in these cases. In chronic hypoxia deaths the expression of variant p21 alt-a was highly pronounced whereas the expression of variant p21B was low. In chronic hypoxia deaths the expression of p53 was substantially higher compared to the other groups, being a potential regulator of p21 alt-a expression.

Myocardial collagen deposition can affect cardiac compliance and contractility. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the silencing of FAK is protective against endotoxemia-induced alterations of cardiac structure and function. In male Wistar rats, endotoxemia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg). Cardiac morphometry and function were studied in vivo by left ventricular catheterization and histology. Intravenous injection of small interfering RNA targeting FAK was used to silence myocardial expression of the kinase. The hearts of lipopolysaccharide-injected rats showed collagen deposition, increased matrix metalloproteinase 2 activity, and myocyte hypertrophy, as well as reduced 24-h +dP/dt and -dP/dt, together with hypotension, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and elevated levels of FAK (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated). Focal adhesion kinase silencing reduced the expression and activation of the kinase in cardiac tissue, as well as protecting against the increased collagen deposition, greater matrix metalloproteinase 2 activity, and reduced cardiac contractility that occur during endotoxemia. In conclusion, FAK is activated in endotoxemia, playing a role in cardiac remodeling and in the impairment of cardiac function. This kinase represents a potential therapeutic target for the protection of cardiac function in patients with sepsis.", "journal": "Shock (Augusta, Ga.)", "date": "2011-09-17", "authors": ["Maria CGuido", "Carolina FClemente", "Ana IMoretti", "Hermes VBarbeiro", "VictorDebbas", "Elia GCaldini", "Kleber GFranchini", "Francisco GSoriano"], "doi": "10.1097/SHK.0b013e31823532ec"}
{"title": "The cardioprotective effect of mildronate is diminished after co-treatment with L-carnitine.", "abstract": "Mildronate, an inhibitor of L-carnitine biosynthesis and uptake, is a cardioprotective drug whose mechanism of action is thought to rely on the changes in concentration of L-carnitine in heart tissue. In the present study, we compared the cardioprotective effect of mildronate (100 mg/kg) and a combination of mildronate and L-carnitine (100 + 100 mg/kg) administered for 14 days with respect to the observed changes in l-carnitine level and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I)-dependent fatty acid metabolism in the heart tissues. Concentrations of L-carnitine and its precursor \u03b3-butyrobetaine (GBB) were measured by ultraperformance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, mitochondrial respiration, activity of CPT-I, and expression of CPT-IA/B messenger RNA (mRNA) were measured. Isolated rat hearts were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Administration of mildronate induced a 69% decrease in L-carnitine concentration and a 6-fold increase in GBB concentration in the heart tissue as well as a 27% decrease in CPT-I-dependent mitochondrial respiration on palmitoyl-coenzyme A. In addition, mildronate treatment induced a significant reduction in infarct size and also diminished the ischemia-induced respiration stimulation by exogenous cytochrome c. Treatment with a combination had no significant impact on L-carnitine concentration, CPT-I-dependent mitochondrial respiration, and infarct size. Our results demonstrated that the mildronate-induced decrease in L-carnitine concentration, concomitant decrease in fatty acid transport, and maintenance of the intactness of outer mitochondrial membrane in heart mitochondria are the key mechanisms of action for the anti-infarction activity of mildronate.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics", "date": "2011-09-10", "authors": ["JanisKuka", "ReinisVilskersts", "HelenaCirule", "MarinaMakrecka", "OsvaldsPugovics", "IvarsKalvinsh", "MaijaDambrova", "EdgarsLiepinsh"], "doi": "10.1177/1074248411419502"}
{"title": "Proteomic studies on protective effects of salvianolic acids, notoginsengnosides and combination of salvianolic acids and notoginsengnosides against cardiac ischemic-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Salvia miltiorrhiza and Panax notoginseng are popularly used traditional Chinese medicine for cardiovascular disorders and they are often used in the form of combination. However, mechanisms of their cardioprotective effects were still not clear. In the present study, the protective effects of salvianolic acids (SA), notoginsengnosides (NG) and combination of SA and NG (CSN) against rat cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury were checked and the protein expression profiles of heart tissues were examined to search their possible protein targets.\nThe cardioprotective effects of SA, NG and CSN were checked in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) by temporarily occluding coronary artery for 20 min followed by reperfusion. Rats were grouped into sham-operation group, IR group, IR+SA group, IR+NG group and IR+CSN group. The plasma creatine kinase (CK) activities were measured using commercial kit and the percentages of infarcted area in total ventricle tissue were calculated after nitroblue-tetrazolium (N-BT) staining of heart tissue slices. Two-dimensional protein electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to check the protein expression profiles of heart tissues. Then, proteins differentially expressed between IR group and sham-operation group were identified using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS/MS). The regulative effects of SA, NG and CSN on these IR-related proteins were analyzed.\nTreatments including SA, NG and CSN all showed cardioprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury and CSN exhibited to be the best. Eighteen proteins involved in IR injury were found. These proteins are involved in pathways including energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, muscle contraction, heat shock stress, cell survival and proliferation. The regulation of these proteins by SA, NG or CSN suggested possible protein targets in their cardioprotective effects.\nSA and NG showed both similarity and difference in their protein targets involved in cardioprotective effects. The capability of CSN to regulate both protein targets of SA and NG might be the basis of CSN to show cardioprotective effects better than that of SA or NG.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2011-09-10", "authors": ["Qing-XiYue", "Fu-BoXie", "Xiao-YiSong", "Wan-YingWu", "Bao-HongJiang", "Shu-HongGuan", "MinYang", "XuanLiu", "De-AnGuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2011.08.044"}
{"title": "Biomaterial strategies for alleviation of myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "World Health Organization estimated that heart failure initiated by coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (MI) leads to 29 per cent of deaths worldwide. Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in industrialized countries and is expected to become a global epidemic within the twenty-first century. MI, the main cause of heart failure, leads to a loss of cardiac tissue impairment of left ventricular function. The damaged left ventricle undergoes progressive 'remodelling' and chamber dilation, with myocyte slippage and fibroblast proliferation. Repair of diseased myocardium with in vitro-engineered cardiac muscle patch/injectable biopolymers with cells may become a viable option for heart failure patients. These events reflect an apparent lack of effective intrinsic mechanism for myocardial repair and regeneration. Motivated by the desire to develop minimally invasive procedures, the last 10 years observed growing efforts to develop injectable biomaterials with and without cells to treat cardiac failure. Biomaterials evaluated include alginate, fibrin, collagen, chitosan, self-assembling peptides, biopolymers and a range of synthetic hydrogels. The ultimate goal in therapeutic cardiac tissue engineering is to generate biocompatible, non-immunogenic heart muscle with morphological and functional properties similar to natural myocardium to repair MI. This review summarizes the properties of biomaterial substrates having sufficient mechanical stability, which stimulates the native collagen fibril structure for differentiating pluripotent stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells into cardiomyocytes for cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of the Royal Society, Interface", "date": "2011-09-09", "authors": ["Jayarama ReddyVenugopal",

{"title": "Hypokalemic paralysis in a professional bodybuilder.", "abstract": "Severe hypokalemia is a potentially life-threatening disorder and is associated with variable degrees of skeletal muscle weakness, even to the point of paralysis. On rare occasions, diaphragmatic paralysis from hypokalemia can lead to respiratory arrest. There may also be decreased motility of smooth muscle, manifesting with ileus or urinary retention. Rarely, severe hypokalemia may result in rhabdomyolysis. Other manifestations of severe hypokalemia include alteration of cardiac tissue excitability and conduction. Hypokalemia can produce electrocardiographic changes such as U waves, T-wave flattening, and arrhythmias, especially if the patient is taking digoxin. Common causes of hypokalemia include extrarenal potassium losses (vomiting and diarrhea) and renal potassium losses (eg, hyperaldosteronism, renal tubular acidosis, severe hyperglycemia, potassium-depleting diuretics) as well as hypokalemia due to potassium shifts (eg, insulin administration, catecholamine excess, familial periodic hypokalemic paralysis, thyrotoxic hypokalemic paralysis). Although the extent of diuretic misuse in professional bodybuilding is unknown, it may be regarded as substantial. Hence, diuretics must always be considered as a cause of hypokalemic paralysis in bodybuilders.", "journal": "The American journal of emergency medicine", "date": "2011-08-30", "authors": ["Florian BMayr", "HansDomanovits", "Anton NLaggner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajem.2011.06.029"}
{"title": "Elevated cardiac oxidative stress in newborn rats from mothers treated with atosiban.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cardiac and cerebral oxidative stress in the offspings of pregnant rats treated with oxytocin antagonist atosiban.\nExperimentally naive, adult female Wistar-albino rats (200-250 g) were mated with adult male rats for copulation. After confirming pregnancy, eight gravid rats were then randomly assigned into two equal groups. The animals were treated from days 15 to 20 of gestation. One group acted as a control group, and received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of saline in a daily dose volume of 6 mg/kg/day. The second group received 6 mg/kg/day i.p. atosiban.

{"title": "Derivatization of the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and analysis by online solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with positive-ion electrospray ionization.", "abstract": "The analysis of cellular metabolic processes is of fundamental biological interest. Cellular metabolites, such as the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, provide essential information about the metabolic state of the cell. Not only is the TCA cycle a key factor in the energy regulation within aerobic cells, it possibly also plays a role in cell signaling. This paper describes a novel derivatization strategy, using the empirically selected N-methyl-2-phenylethanamine as derivatization reagent with a carbodiimide as co-reagent, for the selective derivatization of carboxylic acids, such as the di- and tri-carboxylic acids of the TCA cycle. Optimization of the derivatization protocol is described. This procedure enables analysis of the derivatives using on-line solid-phase extraction and reversed-phase liquid chromatography in combination with sensitive positive-ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The complete procedure, involving the use of core-shell silica column material, allows the rapid analysis of TCA cycle intermediates in sample matrices, here shown for pig heart tissue extracts, with a good linearity over 3-4 orders of magnitude.

Using the left coronary artery ligation model of acute myocardial infarction, we studied the cardiac function of female adult offspring rats exposed to cadmium (30\u00a0ppm) during gestation. The cardiac ischemic zone in the control and cadmium-exposed groups was measured 72\u00a0h post-ligation using the TPT staining technique. Offspring from cadmium-treated dams showed a significantly smaller infarcted area compared with the control group (7.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 vs. 19.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8%, P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). We also performed echocardiographic and biochemical studies, which positively correlated with the differences observed previously. To evaluate whether the effects were associated to pre-infarct tissue damage and/or angiogenic molecules, we performed histological studies and measured the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet endothelial cellular adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). Results revealed a higher heart vascularization in the exposed offspring that was associated with an increase in PECAM and a decrease in VEGF expression.

Therefore, we investigated the expression of soluble Sdc1 in the serum of rats after MI. Anterior descending coronary arteries of Sprague-Dawley rats were ligated, and MI was confirmed by morphologic and physiologic methods. Rats that underwent surgery without ligation served as the control group. We analyzed the expression of Sdc1 mRNA by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and that of Sdc1 protein by western blot in heart tissue from the MI border and compared it to the expression of soluble Sdc1 in serum. The myocardial levels of expression of Sdc1 mRNA and protein were very low in the sham group but increased significantly in the MI group (P<0.01). The expression of myocardial Sdc1 reached a peak at day 3 and declined gradually thereafter, although the levels at 14 days remained significantly higher than those in the sham group. The expression of soluble Sdc1 in the sera of the rats in the MI group followed a similar pattern and was linearly correlated with the expression of Sdc1 protein in the MI border zone (r=0.952, P<0.01).

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of SW application on cardiac function and structure. Four-month-old Fisher 344 rats were subjected to ECSW therapy. Echocardiographic measurements of cardiac function were performed at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after treatment. Signs of inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the control and treated hearts. ECSW application did not provoke arrhythmia or increase the troponin-I level. At all time points, the left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening remained stable. Histological analysis revealed neither differences in the extracellular matrix collagen content nor the presence of fibrosis; similarly, there were no signs of inflammation. Moreover, a population of cardiac cells that responded eagerly to ECSW application in the adult heart was identified; c-kit-positive, Ki67-positive, orthochromatic cells, corresponding to cardiac primitive cells, were 2.65-fold more numerous in the treated myocardium. In conclusion, non-invasive ECSW therapy is a safe and effective way of activating cardiac stem cells and myocardial regeneration.

{"title": "Reorganized PKA-AKAP associations in the failing human heart.", "abstract": "Here we reveal that the characterization of large-scale re-arrangements of signaling scaffolds induced by heart failure can serve as a novel concept to identify more specific therapeutic targets. In the mammalian heart, the cAMP pathway, with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in a central role, acts directly downstream of adrenergic receptors to mediate cardiac contractility and rhythm. Heart failure, characterized by severe alterations in adrenergic stimulation is, amongst other interventions, often treated with \u03b2-blockers. Contrasting results, however, have shown both beneficial and detrimental effects of decreased cAMP levels in failing hearts. We hypothesize that the origin of this behavior lies in the complex spatiotemporal organization of the regulatory subunit of PKA (PKA-R), which associates tightly with various A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) to specifically localize PKA's activity. Using chemical proteomics directly applied to human patient and control heart tissue we demonstrate that the association profile of PKA-R with several AKAPs is severely altered in the failing heart, for instance effecting the interaction between PKA and the novel AKAP SPHKAP was 6-fold upregulated upon failing heart conditions. Also a significant increase in captured cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) was observed. The observed altered profiles can already explain many aspects of the aberrant cAMP-response in the failing human heart, validating that this dataset may provide a resource for several novel, more specific, treatment options.

The omission of exon 2 caused a frame shift and an immediate stop codon in exon 3 leading to translation of a 5.6-kDa peptide that comprises the N-terminal extracellular domain and the first transmembrane helix of SUR1. Based on a weak first splice acceptor site in the human SUR1 gene (ABCC8), RT-PCR revealed a concurrent expression of SUR1\u03942 and SUR1. The SUR1\u03942/(SUR1\u00a0+\u00a0SUR1\u03942) mRNA ratio differed between tissues, and was lowest in pancreas (46%), highest in heart (88%) and negatively correlated with alternative splice factor/splicing factor 2 (ASF/SF2) expression. In COS-7 cells triple transfected with SUR1\u03942/SUR1/Kir6.2, the SUR1\u03942 peptide co-immunoprecipitated with Kir6.2, thereby displacing two of four SUR1 subunits on the cell surface. The ATP sensitivity of these hybrid ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP)) channels was reduced by about sixfold, as shown with single-channel recordings. RINm5f rat insulinoma cells, which genuinely express SUR1 but not SUR1\u03942, exhibited a strongly increased K(ATP) channel current upon transfection with SUR1\u03942.

The whole heart and the left and right ventricles were retrospectively delineated, and dose-volume histograms were analyzed. Multiple dosimetrics were reported, such as mean dose (D(mean)); relative volume receiving 1.7, 5, 10, and 20 Gy (V1.7, V5, V10, and V20, respectively); dose to 1 cc (D(1cc)); and maximum point dose (D(max)). Biologic metrics, biologically effective dose and generalized equivalent uniform dose were computed. The impact of lumpectomy cavity location on cardiac dose was investigated.\nThe average \u00b1 standard deviation of D(mean) was 2.45 \u00b1 0.94 Gy (range, 0.56-4.68) and 3.29 \u00b1 1.28 Gy (range, 0.77-6.35) for the heart and the ventricles, respectively. The average whole heart V5 and V10 values were 10.2% and 1.3%, respectively, and the heart D(max) was >20 Gy in 7 of 60 (11.7%) patients and >25 Gy in 3 of 60 (5%) patients. No cardiac tissue received \u226530 Gy. The V1.7, V5, V10, V20, and D(mean) values were all higher for the ventricles than for the whole heart. For balloons located in the upper inner quadrant of the breast, the average whole heart D(mean) was highest. The D(mean), biologically effective dose, and generalized equivalent uniform dose values for heart and ventricles decreased with increasing minimal distance from the surface of the balloon.\nOn the basis of these comprehensive cardiac dosimetric data, we recommend that cardiac dose be\u00a0routinely reported and kept as low as possible in balloon-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment planning for patients with left-sided breast cancer so the correlation with future cardiac toxicity data can be investigated.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2011-05-24", "authors": ["VladimirValakh", "YongbokKim", "E DayWerts", "Mark GTrombetta"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.02.058"}
{"title": "An efficient method for modeling kinetic behavior of channel proteins in cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Characterization of the kinetic and conformational properties of channel proteins is a crucial element in the integrative study of congenital cardiac diseases. The proteins of the ion channels of cardiomyocytes represent an important family of biological components determining the physiology of the heart. Some computational studies aiming to understand the mechanisms of the ion channels of cardiomyocytes have concentrated on Markovian stochastic approaches. Mathematically, these approaches employ Chapman-Kolmogorov equations coupled with partial differential equations. As the scale and complexity of such subcellular and cellular models increases, the balance between efficiency and accuracy of algorithms becomes critical. We have developed a novel two-stage splitting algorithm to address efficiency and accuracy issues arising in such modeling and simulation scenarios. Numerical experiments were performed based on the incorporation of our newly developed conformational kinetic model for the rapid delayed rectifier potassium channel into the dynamic models of human ventricular myocytes. Our results show that the new algorithm significantly outperforms commonly adopted adaptive Runge-Kutta methods. Furthermore, our parallel simulations with coupled algorithms for multicellular cardiac tissue demonstrate a high linearity in the speedup of large-scale cardiac simulations.", "journal": "IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics", "date": "2011-05-18", "authors": ["ChongWang", "PeterBeyerlein", "HeikePospisil", "AntjeKrause", "ChrisNugent", "WernerDubitzky"], "doi": "10.1109/TCBB.2011.84"}

We compared the effects of lipid, epinephrine, and the combination of the two in reversing bupivacaine-induced asystole in the isolated rat heart model. We also measured the effects of lipid, epinephrine, and the combination of the two on bupivacaine content in cardiac tissue.\nHearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats were excised and retrograde-perfused in a nonrecirculating Langendorff preparation. Bupivacaine 100 \u03bcmol/L was perfused until 3 minutes after asystole. Two percent lipid and 30 \u03bcmol/L bupivacaine mixture was then perfused in the lipid group; 0.15 \u03bcg/mL epinephrine and 30 \u03bcmol/L bupivacaine mixture in the epinephrine group; 2% lipid combined with 0.15 \u03bcg/mL epinephrine and 30 \u03bcmol/L bupivacaine in the combination group; and 30 \u03bcmol/L bupivacaine alone in the control group. Recovery of heartbeat was defined as unassisted regular rhythm with a rate-pressure product (RPP) >10% of baseline for >1 minute. We compared the time from the end of 100 \u03bcmol/L bupivacaine infusion to recovery of heartbeat (T(recovery)) for each group. The variables of cardiac function were recorded for 40 minutes after recovery of heartbeat. The cardiac apex of each heart was taken for measurement of the bupivacaine content by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at the end of the experiment.\nTime to recovery (T(recovery)) in the lipid and combination groups was significantly shorter than that in the epinephrine and control groups (P < 0.001), and T(recovery) in the epinephrine group was shorter than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The rank order of the mean RPP during the 40 minutes after recovery of heartbeat from highest to lowest was the combination group > the lipid and epinephrine groups > the control group (P < 0.01).

{"title": "Mechanisms for progenitor cell-mediated repair for ischemic heart injury.", "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that treatments involving injection of stem cells into animals with damaged cardiac tissue result in improved cardiac functionality. Clinical trials have reported conflicting results concerning the recellularization of post-infarct collagen scars. No clear mechanism has so far emerged to fully explain how injected stem cells, specifically the commonly used mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and endothelial precursor cells (EPC), help heal a damaged heart. Clearly, these injected stem cells must survive and thrive in the hypoxic environment that results after injury for any significant repair to occur. Here we discuss how ischemic preconditioning may lead to increased tolerance of stem cells to these harsh conditions and increase their survival and clinical potential after injection. As injected cells must reach the site in numbers large enough for repair to be functionally significant, homing mechanisms involved in stem cell migration are also discussed. We review the mechanisms of action stem cells may employ once they arrive at their target destination. These possible mechanisms include that the injected stem cells (1) secrete growth factors, (2) differentiate into cardiomyocytes to recellularize damaged tissue and strengthen the post-infarct scar, (3) transdifferentiate the host cells into cardiomyocytes, and (4) induce neovascularization. Finally, we discuss that tissue engineering may provide a standardized platform technology to produce clinically applicable stem cell products with these desired mechanistic capacities.", "journal": "Current stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2011-04-07", "authors": ["Shengwen CalvinLi", "JulyanaAcevedo", "LangWang", "HongJiang", "JaneLuo", "Richard GPestell", "William GLoudon", "Anthony CChang"], "doi": "10.2174/157488812798483449"}

Plasma oxidative stress was determined by hydroperoxides (ROOH) and the ascorbyl radical/ascorbate ratio. One and two months later, the functional parameters of the hearts were determined in vivo by catheterization and cardiac oxidative stress was assessed by malonedialdehyde (MDA) and O\u2082*\u207b (dihydroethidium fluorescence) content in tissue. After two months, body weight was higher in the DOX-AL group than in DOX (+16%), but this was due to ascites. Histological liver alterations were observed in both the DOX and DOX-AL groups. Plasma ROOH concentrations decreased after 10 days of AL treatment, but were greater in both the DOX and DOX-AL groups. After two months, a decrease in the cardiac contractility index (-27% and -29%, respectively) and cardiac hypertrophy were observed in DOX and DOX-AL. These dysfunctions were associated with 1) a reduction in plasma ascorbate levels and an increase in the ascorbyl/ascorbate ratio and 2) an increase MDA and O\u2082*\u207b content in cardiac tissue.

However, little is known about the role of IL-6 in \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor induced autoimmune cardiomyopathy.\nTwenty IL-6-deficient (IL-6(-/-)) mice and fifty-one wild type C57BL/6J (WT) mice were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the \u03b2(1) (\u03b2(1)AR ECII) at 0, 1, 5, 9, 13 weeks and observed until 25 weeks. Another forty-one WT mice and twenty IL-6(-/-) mice were used as controls receiving vehicle in the same manner.\nAs compared with IL-6(-/-) immunized and control mice, WT immunized mice showed increased end-systolic left ventricular dimension and end-diastolic left ventricular dimension as well as decreased fractional shortening and circumferential fiber shortening in the end of the experiment, which was accompanied by significantly increased antibody level. Moreover, mRNAs encoding for \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor kinase (GRK2), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and \u03b2(1) adrenergic receptor (Adrb1) in heart tissues from WT immunized group were increased.

Autoimmune response and autoreactive autoantibodies have been found in dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, rheumatic fever, myocarditis, atherosclerosis, and other diseases. Autoantibodies may appear due to tissue injury and exposure of autoantigens, in addition to molecular mimicry and cross-reactivity with antigens found in infectious agents in predisposed individuals. In the early 1990s, autoantibodies reacting with the M2 muscarinic receptor were found in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and subsequently, in patients with Chagas heart disease and arrhythmic disorders. Immunization of animals with the corresponding antigen triggered cardiac abnormalities also appearing in dilated cardiomyopathy of humans. It has been suggested that antibodies against M2 muscarinic receptors play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiac diseases and may also alter the electrophysiological properties of cardiac tissue.

Exposed animals were compared with five control animals shot with blank ammunition. Physiological parameters and levels of potassium, glucose, haemoglobin, calcium, lactate and pH were monitored for two hours after the shot.\nThe impact induced severe pulmonary contusion with apnoea, desaturation and hypotension in all exposed animals. Increased haemoglobin, glucose and severe hyperkalaemia were seen shortly after impact. Seven of twelve animals died due to the trauma. Dense cardiac tissue was observed during post mortem examination in six of the animals that died during the experimental course.\nIn conclusion, this study has shown that life-threatening hyperkalaemia occurs early after severe lung contusion.

Its use is hampered by the cardiotoxicity of bufadienolides derived from Toad Venom. Bezoar Bovis is another frequently used drug in Toad Venom preparations for the treatment of inflammatory or cardiovascular diseases in Asia. We explored whether Bezoar Bovis could protect against CS-induced acute toxicity in mice. Toxicity was assessed by the general features of poisoning, electrocardiography (ECG), and levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and calcium ions (Ca(2+)) in cardiac tissues. Toad Venom (90 mg/kg) caused opisthotonus, ventricular arrhythmias, and increases in cardiac levels of Ca(2+), CK and LDH. Pretreatment with Bezoar Bovis (120, 240 and 480 mg/kg) significantly reduced the prevalence of opisthotonus and mortality, and prevented cardiotoxicity in CS-treated mice as evidenced by decreases in the scores of arrhythmias and cardiac levels of CK, LDH and Ca(2+). Furthermore, the bilirubin, and taurine derived from Bezoar Bovis offered marked protection against the arrhythmias induced by CS or bufalin in vivo and in vitro. An anti-inflammatory study showed that Bezoar Bovis did not compromise the anti-inflammatory activity of Toad Venom on concanavalin-A (ConA)-stimulated proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
