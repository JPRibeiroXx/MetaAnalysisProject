{"title": "Effects of valsartan on diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus.", "abstract": "The development of diabetic cardiomyopathy is multifactorial. Insulin resistance (IR) and excessive activity of the renin-angiotensin system are confirmed reasons for diabetic cardiomyopathy. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors can reduce tissue Ang II levels, with beneficial effects on cardiovascular function. Therefore, in type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), blockade of the RAS may have the function of protecting against diabetic cardiomyopathy through increasing insulin sensitivity and inhibiting excessive activity of RAS. However, this has not been confirmed.\nThe effect of valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), on diabetic cardiomyopathy in the presence of T2DM was studied. Wistar rats with T2DM and T2DM treated with valsartan were studied. Glucose infusion rates (GIR), index of IR, heart weight, the heart weight-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW), myocardial apoptotic index, cardiac hydroxyprolin content, and cardiac tissue collagen type I and collagen type III content were measured.\nGIR in T2DM rats and T2DM rats treated with valsartan decreased (P < 0.01). In T2DM rats treated with valsartan, heart weight, myocardial apoptotic index, cardiac hydroxyprolin content, and cardiac tissue collagen type I and collagen type III content were higher than in control rats, but lower than in T2DM rats. In rats with T2DM, GIR was negatively and significantly correlated with all the variables. However, in T2DM rats treated with valsartan or normal control rats, none of the correlations was significant.\nIn the presence of T2DM, diabetic cardiomyopathy is related with IR. Valsartan can not alleviate IR, but can protect against diabetic cardiomyopathy and remove the correlation between IR and diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Chinese medical journal", "date": "2011-12-15", "authors": ["Zhong-HuaYang", "Xiao-DongPeng"], "doi": null}

Different groups of mice were fed squalene at the doses of 1 and 4 mmol g(-1) body weight (100 or 400 \u03bcl as squalene oil) either at 4 h before or 1 h after Dox (20 mg kg(-1)) treatment. 24 h after the Dox treatment, bone marrow erythrocytes were evaluated for the incidence of micronuclei, and the induced DNA strand breaks were examined in heart tissue by the alkaline comet assay. As expected, Dox significantly induced micronuclei in polychromatic (immature) erythrocytes, as well as in total erythrocytes. The frequency of Dox-induced micronucleated erythrocytes was significantly reduced in the mice treated with squalene both before and after Dox administration. Squalene itself obviously did not induce any micronuclei in bone marrow erythrocytes. The comet assay also demonstrated a significant increase in DNA damage, especially DNA single strand breaks in the Dox-treated group of mice as compared to the control. The Dox-induced DNA damage was also effectively reduced by squalene when it was administered either before or after the Dox treatment. Squalene did not induce any significant DNA damage by itself. Compared to the pre-treatment of squalene, post treatment gave rise to more effective prevention against Dox-induced DNA damage. The data suggest that the complimentary use of squalene with Dox will be beneficial to reduce the adverse effect of Dox in cancer chemotherapy, such as the increased incidence of undesirable mutagenic side effects.", "journal": "Food & function", "date": "2011-07-22", "authors": ["Bhilwade HariNarayan", "NaotoTatewaki", "Vijayasree VayalanelloreGiridharan", "HiroshiNishida", "TetsuyaKonishi"], "doi": "10.1039/c0fo00102c"}

{"title": "Role of matricellular proteins in cardiac tissue remodeling after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "After onset of myocardial infarction (MI), the left ventricle (LV) undergoes a continuum of molecular, cellular, and extracellular responses that result in LV wall thinning, dilatation, and dysfunction. These dynamic changes in LV shape, size, and function are termed cardiac remodeling. If the cardiac healing after MI does not proceed properly, it could lead to cardiac rupture or maladaptive cardiac remodeling, such as further LV dilatation and dysfunction, and ultimately death. Although the precise molecular mechanisms in this cardiac healing process have not been fully elucidated, this process is strictly coordinated by the interaction of cells with their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The components of ECM include basic structural proteins such as collagen, elastin and specialized proteins such as fibronectin, proteoglycans and matricellular proteins. Matricellular proteins are a class of non-structural and secreted proteins that probably exert regulatory functions through direct binding to cell surface receptors, other matrix proteins, and soluble extracellular factors such as growth factors and cytokines. This small group of proteins, which includes osteopontin, thrombospondin-1/2, tenascin, periostin, and secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine, shows a low level of expression in normal adult tissue, but is markedly upregulated during wound healing and tissue remodeling, including MI.

The binding of (99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V to apoptosis was validated in vitro using camptothecin-induced Jurkat cells. In vivo biodistribution was determined in mice by the dissection method. Ischemia of 20-30 min was induced by balloon occlusion of the epicardial coronary artery of the porcine model (n=14). Adenosine was infused intravenously in six pigs before coronary occlusion. (99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V (n=12) was injected intravenously at 1 h after reperfusion. SPECT/CT was acquired at 3 h postinjection. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with (99m)Tc-MIBI was also performed 1 day after His(10)-annexin V imaging. Cardiac tissues were analyzed postmortem using hematoxylin-and-eosin and TUNEL staining. Caspase-3 activity was measured to confirm the presence of apoptosis.\n(99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V had a RCP >98% and high stability 2 h after radiolabeling; it could bind to apoptotic cells with high affinity. Biodistribution of (99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V showed a predominant uptake in the kidney and relatively low uptake in the myocardium, liver and gastrointestinal tract; rapid clearance from blood and kidney was observed. In the untreated group, intense uptake of His(10)-annexin V was visualized in the defect which was shown in MPI, whereas in the adenosine group a mild uptake of (99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin was found in the risk area which showed no defects in the (99m)Tc-MIBI image. TUNEL staining and activated caspase-3 confirmed the ongoing apoptosis in RI. Adenosine preconditioning significantly diminished the level of apoptosis. Uptake of His(10)-annexin V in RI correlated with TUNEL-positive nuclei.\nThis study addresses the feasibility of imaging of myocardial cell death in acute ischemia and RI in pigs with (99m)Tc-His(10)-annexin V; it holds prospect for the detection of myocardial cell death in clinical practice. Adenosine preconditioning could attenuate the myocardial apoptosis; its cardioprotective effect might partially be fulfilled by suppressing the ongoing apoptosis in ischemia and reperfusion.

The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) protection against LPS-induced cardiac stress. Rats were allocated into three groups; group 1 served as a normal control group, group 2 (LPS) received a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10 mg/kg), group 3 (LPS + CAPE) was injected intraperitoneally with CAPE (10 mg/kg/day; solubilized in saline containing 20% tween 20) throughout a period of 10 days prior to LPS injection. Rats were maintained 4 h before sacrifice. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester pretreatment normalized LPS-enhanced activities of serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in cardiac tissue. A significant reduction of the elevated levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) as well as serum and cardiac nitrite/nitrate (NOx) ) was achieved after CAPE pretreatment. CAPE also restored malondialdelyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and cytosolic calcium (Ca2+ ) levels in the heart. A marked induction of cardiac heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein level was detected in CAPE-pretreated group. Whereas, LPS-induced reduction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) levels was insignificantly changed. Conclusively, the early treatment with CAPE maintained antioxidant defences, reduced oxidative injury, cytokine damage, and inflammation but did not markedly improve energy status in cardiac tissue.

Mutations in lamin A/C and LAP2\u03b1 cause late onset striated muscle diseases, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We have recently reported on the striated muscle phenotype of LAP2\u03b1-deficient mice, revealing new unexpected roles of LAP2\u03b1. Loss of LAP2\u03b1 in skeletal muscle caused an upregulated stem cell-type gene expression in muscle satellite cell progeny and their delayed myogenic differentiation in vitro. In vivo, the myofiber-associated muscle stem cell pool was increased. In addition, absence of LAP2\u03b1 promoted muscle remodeling towards fast myofiber types in the soleus muscle of old animals. In cardiac tissue, deletion of LAP2\u03b1 caused systolic dysfunction in young mice with an increased susceptibility for fibrosis in old animals. The functional impairment in the heart was accompanied by a deregulation of major cardiac transcription factors, GATA4 and MEF2c and activation of compensatory pathways, including the downregulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor signaling.Here we discuss potential functions of LAP2\u03b1 in striated muscle at molecular level and how loss of these functions may cause the diverse muscle phenotypes.

The transcription factor NF-\u03baB is known to play an important role after MI.\nTo investigate if NF-\u03baB is involved in the protective effects of BNP against adverse post-MI remodelling.\nRats were randomly assigned to five groups: sham-operation; MI by coronary ligation; MI treated with chronic BNP infusion; MI treated with enalapril; MI treated with BNP+enalapril. Rats were closely monitored for survival rate analysis. Rats from each group were sacrificed on days 3, 7 and 28 postoperation.\nThe results showed that chronic continuous BNP infusion achieved similar effects to enalapril therapy, as evidenced by improved survival rate within the 28-day observation period compared with MI group rats; this effect was closely associated with preserved cardiac geometry and performance. The treatment combination did not offer extra benefits in terms of survival rate. Both BNP and enalapril therapy produced higher heart tissue concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and lower expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. These benefits were associated with lower phosphorylation levels of NF-\u03baB subunits I\u03baB\u03b1, p50 and p65. While enalapril significantly inhibited extracellular matrix remodelling via regulation of the protein expression ratio of matrix metalloproteinase/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase and the activity of matrix metalloproteinase, these variables were not affected by BNP, indicating that the two therapies involve different mechanisms.\nChronic BNP infusion can provide beneficial effects against adverse post-MI remodelling.", "journal": "Archives of cardiovascular diseases", "date": "2011-02-01", "authors": ["YeshengPan", "WeiZhu", "JianMa", "PingXin", "BeibeiHan", "YapingHe", "YanpengWang", "TianqingPeng", "MengWei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.acvd.2010.09.006"}

However, the action of various members of NAE on voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSC) in cardiac tissue is still not fully elucidated. Here using patch-clamp technique we have studied the modulation of biophysical properties of VGSC of neonatal cardiomyocytes by saturated N-stearoylethanolamine (NSE) and monounsaturated N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA). NSE in 1-200 tM concentration range did not significantly alter the amplitude of inward Na+ current (I(Na)), but 100 microM NSE shifted its steady-state activation and inactivation curves in hyperpolarization direction by 2.4 mV and 10.6 mV, respectively. Activation kinetics of the current was not changed by NSE, but its inactivation was accelerated by about 1.2-fold in the -60 - -30 mV range of membrane potentials. Unlike NSE, OEA dose-dependently inhibited I(Na) with kappa(D) = 11.4 +/- 1.6 microM and maximal block at saturating concentration of 30 +/- 3%. It also stronger than NSE shifted current's steady-state activation and inactivation curves (-6.4 mV and -14.0 mV, respectively, at 100 microM) in hyperpolarization direction. The effect of OEA on I(Na) activation kinetics was negligible, but it more pronouncedly than NSE accelerated inactivation of the current. Thus, both members of NAE influence the voltage-dependence of activation, inactivation and kinetics of I(Na).

By 8 days post-injection, ESCs were spatially segregated from the cardiac cell population; however, ESC injection increased survival of CMs. The presence of ESCs blocked electrical conduction through the tissue, resulting in a 46% increase in the excitation threshold. Expression of mouse cardiac troponin I, was markedly increased in CP injected constructs compared to ESC injected constructs at all time points and cell doses tested. As early as 2 weeks, epithelial and ganglion-like structures were observed in ESC injected constructs. By 4 weeks of ESC injection, teratoma-like structures containing neural, epithelial, and connective tissue were observed in the constructs. Non-cardiac structures were observed in the CP injected constructs only after extended culture (4 weeks) and only at high cell doses, suggesting that these cells require further enrichment or differentiation prior to transplantation.

Previous mathematical models regarding period-2 spiral waves are mostly based on a coupled system of period-2 oscillators, but these are inappropriate for the description of a large class of systems that are composed of (nonoscillatory) excitable elements--a good example being the heart.

{"title": "Sex-specific modification of progesterone receptor expression by 17\u03b2-oestradiol in human cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "Although circulating levels of sexual hormones in elderly men and women are low and quite similar, the adaptation of the elderly heart to stress differs between the sexes. We have hypothesized that the effects of sexual hormones in the heart may differ in men and women. Here, we assessed whether 17\u03b2-oestradiol regulates gene expression in the human heart in a sex-dependent manner. We selected the progesterone receptor as a well studied 17\u03b2-oestradiol target that may be pathologically linked to cardiac remodelling.\nIn order to assess the ex vivo effects of 17\u03b2-oestradiol in intact human cardiac tissues, we developed a 24-h model for the culture of human atrial myocardium. We verified tissue viability after 24 h in culture with two standard assays to determine the degree of apoptosis and metabolic activity of cardiac tissues. Progesterone receptor mRNA and protein level were measured after 24-h treatment of tissues with 17\u03b2-oestradiol. Statistical analysis was performed by the Mann-Whitney U test and two-way ANOVA.\nWe established a tissue culture model that allows for the study of viable human cardiac tissue over a 24-h period. After 24 h, cultured cardiac tissues revealed low apoptosis, retained their metabolic activity and, therefore, remained viable. Treatment with 17\u03b2-oestradiol led to an induction of the progesterone receptor mRNA level in female (P = 0.001) but not in male tissues. Similarly, there was an increase in the level of progesterone receptor protein in female tissues (P = 0.03), while a decreasing trend was observed in male tissues (P = 0.079) exposed to 17\u03b2-oestradiol.\nOur novel finding may offer a molecular explanation for the sex-specific differences observed in cardiac remodelling.

{"title": "The influence of fibrous elastomer structure and porosity on matrix organization.", "abstract": "Fibrous scaffolds are finding wide use in the field of tissue engineering, as they can be designed to mimic many native tissue properties and structures (e.g., cardiac tissue, meniscus). The influence of fiber alignment and scaffold architecture on cellular interactions and matrix organization was the focus of this study. Three scaffolds were fabricated from the photocrosslinkable elastomer poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS), with changes in fiber alignment (non-aligned (NA) versus aligned (AL)) and the introduction of a PEO sacrificial polymer population to the AL scaffold (composite (CO)). PEO removal led to an increase in scaffold porosity and maintenance of scaffold anisotropy, as evident through visualization, mechanical testing, and mass loss studies. Hydrated scaffolds possessed moduli that ranged between \u223c3-240 kPa, failing within the range of properties (<300 kPa) appropriate for soft tissue engineering. CO scaffolds were completely degraded as early as 16 days, whereas NA and AL scaffolds had \u223c90% mass loss after 21 days when monitored in vitro. Neonatal cardiomyocytes, used as a representative cell type, that were seeded onto the scaffolds maintained their viability and aligned along the surface of the AL and CO fibers. When implanted subcutaneously in rats, a model that is commonly used to investigate in vivo tissue responses to biomaterials, CO scaffolds were completely integrated at 2 weeks, whereas \u223c13% and \u223c16% of the NA and AL scaffolds, respectively remained acellular. However, all scaffolds were completely populated with cells at 4 weeks post-implantation. Polarized light microscopy was used to evaluate the collagen elaboration and orientation within the scaffold. An increase in the amount of collagen was observed for CO scaffolds and enhanced alignment of the nascent collagen was observed for AL and CO scaffolds compared to NA scaffolds.

Current treatment guidelines recommend the use of HAART regimens containing two NRTIs for initial therapy of HIV-1 positive individuals; however, potential cardiotoxicity resulting from treatment with multiple NRTIs has not been addressed.\nWe examined myocardial tissue from twelve CD8 lymphocyte-depleted adult rhesus macaques, including eight animals infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, four of which received combined antiretroviral therapy (CART) consisting of two NRTIs [(9-R-2-Phosphonomethoxypropyl Adenine) (PMPA) and (+/-)-beta-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine (RCV)] for 28 days. Multifocal infiltrates of mononuclear inflammatory cells were present in the myocardium of all macaques that received CART, but not untreated SIV-positive animals or SIV-negative controls. Macrophages were the predominant inflammatory cells within lesions, as shown by immunoreactivity for the macrophage markers Iba1 and CD68. Heart specimens from monkeys that received CART had significantly lower virus burdens than untreated animals (p<0.05), but significantly greater quantities of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA than either SIV-positive untreated animals or uninfected controls (p<0.05). Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), IL-1\u03b2 and CXCL11 mRNA were upregulated in heart tissue from SIV-positive monkeys, independent of antiretroviral treatment, but CXCL9 mRNA was only upregulated in heart tissue from macaques that received CART.\nThese results suggest that short-term treatment with multiple NRTIs may be associated with myocarditis, and demonstrate that the CD8-depleted SIV-positive rhesus monkey is a useful model for studying the cardiotoxic effects of combined antiretroviral therapy in the setting of immunodeficiency virus infection.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2011-01-05", "authors": ["LakshmananAnnamalai", "Susan VWestmoreland", "Heber GDomingues", "Dennis GWalsh", "R GilbertoGonzalez", "Shawn PO'Neil"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0014429"}

We have previously shown that HA synthesis is up-regulated in a rat model of experimental cardiac hypertrophy and that cardiac tissue utilizes two different HA synthases in the hypertrophic process. Cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts are two major cell types in heart tissue. The fibroblasts are known to produce HA, but it has been unclear if cardiomyocytes share the same feature, and whether or not the different HA synthases are activated in the different cell types.\nThis study shows, for the first time that cardiomyocytes can produce HA. Cardiomyocytes (HL-1) and fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) were cultivated in absence or presence of the growth factors FGF2, PDGF-BB and TGFB2. HA concentration was quantified by ELISA, and the size of HA was estimated using dynamic light scattering. Cardiomyocytes synthesized HA but only when stimulated by PDGF-BB, whereas fibroblasts synthesized HA without addition of growth factors as well as when stimulated by any of the three growth factors. When fibroblasts were stimulated by the growth factors, reverse dose dependence was observed, where the highest dose induced the least amount of HA. With the exception of TGFB2, a trend of reverse dose dependence of HA size was also observed.\nCo-cultivation of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts (80%/20%) increased HA concentration far more that can be explained by HA synthesis by the two cell types separately, revealing a crosstalk between cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts that induces HA synthesis.

This study examined telomere biology in heart/muscle-specific manganese superoxide dismutase-deficient mice (H/M-SOD2(-/-)), which develop progressive congestive heart failure and exhibit pathology typical of dilated cardiomyopathy. EUK-8 (25mg/kg/day), a superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic, was administered to H/M-SOD2(-/-) mice for four weeks beginning at 8 weeks of age. Telomere length, telomerase activity, telomere-associated proteins, and cell death signals were assessed in hearts from control wild-type mice (H/M-Sod2 (lox/ lox)) and H/M-SOD2(-/-) mice either treated or untreated with EUK-8. While cardiac function was unchanged in these experimental mice, the end-diastolic dimension in H/M-SOD2(-/-) mice was notably dilated and could be significantly reduced by EUK-8 treatment. At the end of the study, no shortening of telomere length was observed in heart tissues from all mice tested, but telomerase activity was decreased in heart tissue from H/M-SOD2(-/-) mice compared to control mice. Protein expression for telomerase reverse transcriptase and telomere repeat binding factor 2 was also downregulated in H/M-SOD2(-/-) heart tissue as was expression of phospho-Akt, insulin-like growth factor, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Expression levels of Sirt1, a lifespan modulator, were enhanced while FoxO3a was depressed in H/M-SOD2(-/-) hearts. All of the changes seen in H/M-SOD2(-/-) heart tissue could be inhibited by EUK-8 treatment.

NDRG2 increases in response to hypoxia-induced stress and is involved in hypoxia-induced radioresistance. However, little is known about the expression changes and possible roles of NDRG2 in the heart under hypoxia condition. Here, the authors show that NDRG2, mainly localized in cardiomyocyte cytoplasm, was significantly reduced in myocardial tissue after acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Meanwhile, c-Myc was up-regulated following acute I/R injury, and the expression of c-Myc was significantly inversely correlated with that of NDRG2. In addition, overexpression of c-Myc in primary cultured cardiomyocyte repressed NDRG2 expression. Furthermore, the increase of cardiomyocyte apoptosis was correlated with the decrease of NDRG2 protein during the acute phase of reperfusion. These data suggested for the first time that I/R injury-induced up-regulation of pro-apoptotic c-Myc expression may contribute to the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic NDRG2.

{"title": "Three-dimensional microfabricated scaffolds with cardiac extracellular matrix-like architecture.", "abstract": "In recent years, research in the field of myocardial tissue engineering has advanced thanks to the development of new biomaterials and a more clear understanding of processes that are at the basis of cardiac tissue growth. However, classical porous scaffolds developed during these years to try to reconstruct and mimic heart function have proven to be inadequate because they are not able to reproduce the typical myocardial environment. One approach to increase functionality of tissue-engineered constructs relies on attempts to mimic the microarchitecture of natural tissues, since it is well known that topology is one of the principal stimuli that cells need to activate their functions. The aim of this work was the realization of three-dimensional microfabricated scaffolds, with cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM)-like architecture. For this purpose, samples of pig myocardium were decellularized, embedded in paraffin wax and analyzed under an optical microscope, in order to evaluate the geometrical features of the cardiac ECM. On the basis of these data, a simplified model of the cardiac ECM microarchitecture was designed. Microfabricated scaffolds were realized with Soft Lithography technique, using a bioartificial blend, based on alginate, gelatin and a novel poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based copolymer, which we synthesized. The scaffolds were characterized in terms of topological and mechanical properties. Moreover, cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation tests were performed.

Results of the OSL-group showed a reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in liver (42.7%) and heart tissue (8%) compared with the control group. An increase was observed in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, catalase (34.6% in liver and 33.3% in heart) and glutathione peroxidase (50.5% in liver and 34.7% in heart).

Group IV was fed with pellet chow and treated with 250 \u00b5g/kg CrCl(3) 6H(2)O and 100 mg/kg niacin for 45 days. On the 60th day, the heart tissue and blood samples were taken from animals. As a result, heart LPO, serum GGT activity and serum PCC were increased; serum PON activity and heart GSH levels were decreased in hyperlipidemic rats.

{"title": "A small nonerythropoietic helix B surface peptide based upon erythropoietin structure is cardioprotective against ischemic myocardial damage.", "abstract": "Strong cardioprotective properties of erythropoietin (EPO) reported over the last 10 years have been difficult to translate to clinical applications for ischemic cardioprotection owing to undesirable parallel activation of erythropoiesis and thrombogenesis. A pyroglutamate helix B surface peptide (pHBP), recently engineered to include only a part of the EPO molecule that does not bind to EPO receptor and thus, is not erythropoietic, retains tissue protective properties of EPO. Here we compared the ability of pHBP and EPO to protect cardiac myocytes from oxidative stress in vitro and cardiac tissue from ischemic damage in vivo. HBP, similar to EPO, increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) threshold for induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition by 40%. In an experimental model of myocardial infarction induced by permanent ligation of a coronary artery in rats, a single bolus injection of 60 \u03bcg/kg of pHBP immediately after coronary ligation, similar to EPO, reduced apoptosis in the myocardial area at risk, examined 24 h later, by 80% and inflammation by 34%. Myocardial infarction (MI) measured 24 h after coronary ligation was similarly reduced by 50% in both pHBP- and EPO-treated rats. Two wks after surgery, left ventricular remodeling (ventricular dilation) and functional decline (fall in ejection fraction) assessed by echocardiography were significantly and similarly attenuated in pHBP- and EPO-treated rats, and MI size was reduced by 25%. The effect was retained during the 6-wk follow-up. A single bolus injection of pHBP immediately after coronary ligation was effective in reduction of MI size in a dose as low as 1 \u03bcg/kg, but was ineffective at a 60 \u03bcg/kg dose if administered 24 h after MI induction. We conclude that pHBP is equally cardioprotective with EPO and deserves further consideration as a safer alternative to rhEPO in the search for therapeutic options to reduce myocardial damage following blockade of the coronary circulation.", "journal": "Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)", "date": "2010-12-21", "authors": ["IsmayilAhmet", "Hyun-JinTae", "MagdalenaJuhaszova", "Daniel RRiordon", "Kenneth RBoheler", "Steven JSollott", "MichaelBrines", "AnthonyCerami", "Edward GLakatta", "Mark ITalan"], "doi": "10.2119/molmed.2010.00235"}

Cypermethrin administered at repeated oral doses of 5 and 20 mg/kg/day for 30 days produced varying degree of mild to moderate toxic symptoms and behavioral changes in both male and female rats. The lower dose produced very mild toxicosis characterized by intermittent diarrhea, decreased feed intake, and thick eye discharge, whereas higher dose displayed mild to moderate toxicosis with diarrhea, decreased feed intake, loss of body weight, dyspnoea, ataxia, eye discharge, and salivation. Two female and one male albino rats died between 23 to 28 days after displaying signs of incoordination and tremors. Repeated oral doses of cypermethrin for 30 days enhanced the relative weight of liver and heart, but significantly decreased that of brain, kidneys, and testes. Microscopically, cypermethrin produced neuronal degeneration and increase in glial cells in brain, and disorganization of hepatic laminae, increase in sinusoid, and necrosis of hepatocytes in liver. Section of kidney displayed hemorrhage and sloughing off renal epithelial cell in the convoluted tubules, shrinkage of glomeruli, and necrosis of renal tubules. Repeated administration of cypermethrin also produced hemorrhages within myocardium, disruption of branching structure, and loss of striation of cardiac tissue; thickening of alveolar septa in lungs, partial to extensive loss of various stages of spermatogenesis in testes, and loss of follicular cells and oocytes in ovaries.

Chickens were given either a diet without Mn supplementation [control (C)] or diets supplemented with 100 (optimal) or 200 (high) mg Mn/kg diet from inorganic Mn sulfate (I) or 3 organic complexes of Mn and amino acids with weak (W), moderate (M), or strong (S) chelation strength up to 21 d of age. Compared with C chicks, chicks fed Mn-supplemented diets had higher (P < 0.01) Mn concentrations, specificity protein 1 (Sp1) DNA-binding activities, MnSOD mRNA levels, MnSOD mRNA-binding protein (MnSOD-BP) RNA-binding activities, MnSOD protein concentrations, and MnSOD activities within heart tissue, but lower (P < 0.01) heart activating protein-2 (AP-2) DNA-binding activities.

These results suggest that dietary Mn could modulate the expression of the MnSOD gene in broilers by altering Sp1 and AP-2 DNA-binding activities at the transcriptional level and enhancing MnSOD-BP RNA-binding activity at the translational level.

The reactivity of mAbs with native viral nucleocapsids was also confirmed by their reactivity in immunohistochemistry assays with kidney tissue specimens from experimentally SNV-infected rodents and human heart tissue specimens from hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome patients.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling triggers cell apoptosis through multiple mechanisms. Up-regulation of TLR4 expression has been shown in diabetic mice. This study aimed to delineate the role of TLR4 in myocardial apoptosis, and to block this process through gene silencing of TLR4 in the myocardia of diabetic mice.\nDiabetes was induced in C57/BL6 mice by the injection of streptozotocin. Diabetic mice were treated with 50 \u03bcg of TLR4 siRNA or scrambled siRNA as control. Myocardial apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay.\nAfter 7 days of hyperglycemia, the level of TLR4 mRNA in myocardial tissue was significantly elevated. Treatment of TLR4 siRNA knocked down gene expression as well as diminished its elevation in diabetic mice. Apoptosis was evident in cardiac tissues of diabetic mice as detected by a TUNEL assay. In contrast, treatment with TLR4 siRNA minimized apoptosis in myocardial tissues. Mechanistically, caspase-3 activation was significantly inhibited in mice that were treated with TLR4 siRNA, but not in mice treated with control siRNA. Additionally, gene silencing of TLR4 resulted in suppression of apoptotic cascades, such as Fas and caspase-3 gene expression. TLR4 deficiency resulted in inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and NADPH oxidase activity, suggesting suppression of hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis by TLR4 is associated with attenuation of oxidative stress to the cardiomyocytes.\nIn summary, we present novel evidence that TLR4 plays a critical role in cardiac apoptosis.

By cultures of telocytes in two- and three-dimensional environment we aimed to study the typical morphological features as well as functionality of telocytes, which will provide important support to understand their in vivo roles. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured as seeding cells in vitro in two-dimensional environment. Furthermore, engineered myocardium tissue was constructed from isolated cells in three-dimensional collagen/Matrigel scaffolds. The identification of telocytes was performed by using histological and immunohistochemical methods. The results showed that typical telocytes are distributed among cardiomyocytes, connecting them by long telopodes. Telocytes have a typical fusiform cell body with two or three long moniliform telopodes, as main characteristics. The vital methylene blue staining showed the existence of telocytes in primary culture. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that some c-kit or CD34 immuno-positive cells in engineered heart tissue had the morphology of telocytes, with a typical fusiform cell body and long moniliform telopodes. Also, a significant number of vimentin+ telocytes were present within engineered heart tissue. We suggest that the model of three-dimensional engineered heart tissue could be useful for the ongoing research on the functional relationships of telocytes with cardiomyocytes.

One strategy of tissue engineering is to replace lost tissues or organs with polymeric scaffolds that contain specialized populations of living cells, with the goal of regenerating tissues to restore normal function. Typical constructs for tissue engineering employ biocompatible and degradable polymers, along with organ-specific and tissue-specific cells. Once implanted, the construct guides the growth and development of new tissues; the polymer scaffold degrades away to be replaced by healthy functioning tissue. The ideal biomaterial for tissue engineering not only defends against disease and supports weakened tissues or organs, it also provides the elements required for healing and repair, stimulates the body's intrinsic immunological and regenerative capacities, and seamlessly interacts with the living body.

Heart tissue specific transgenic mice of human LMNA E82K, a mutation causing dilated cardiomyopathy, were generated. Lmna(E82K) transgenic mouse lines exhibited thin-walled, dilated left and right ventricles, a progressive decrease of contractile function assessed by echocardiography. Abnormalities of the conduction system, myocytes disarray, collagen accumulation and increased levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), procollagen type III \u03b11 (Col3\u03b11) and skeletal muscle actin \u03b11 (Act\u03b11) were detected in the hearts of Lmna(E82K) transgenic mice.

Probucol, cholesterol-lowering drug, acts as potential inhibitor of DNA damage and shows to protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy by enhancing the endogenous antioxidant system including glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase. This study examined the possible protective effects of probucol, a lipid-lowering compound with strong antioxidant properties, against CP-induced cardiotoxicity. This objective could be achieved through studying the gene expression-based on the possible protective effects of probucol against CP-induced cardiac failure in rats. Adult male Wistar albino rats were assigned into 4 treatment groups: Animals in the first (control) and second (probucol) groups were injected intraperitoneally with corn oil and probucol (61 mg/kg/day), respectively, for two weeks. Animals in the third (CP) and fourth (probucol plus CP) groups were injected with the same doses of corn oil and probucol (61 mg/kg/day), respectively, for one week before and one week after a single dose of CP (200 mg/kg, I.P.). The p53, Bax, Bcl2 and oxidative genes signal expression were measured by real time PCR. CP-induced cardiotoxicity was clearly observed by a significant increase in serum creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) (117%), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (64%), free (69%) and esterified cholesterol (42%) and triglyceride (69%) compared to control group. In cardiac tissues, CP significantly increases the mRNA expression levels of apoptotic genes, p53 with 2 folds and Bax with 1.6 fold, and decreases the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2 with 0.5 fold. Moreover, CP caused down-regulation of antioxidant genes, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase and increased the lipid peroxidation and decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (40%) and ATP/ADP (44%) in cardiac tissues. Probucol pretreatment not only counteracted significantly the CP-induced increase in cardiac enzymes and apoptosis but also it induced a significant increase in mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes and improved ATP, ATP/ADP, glutathione (GSH) in cardiac tissues. In conclusion, data from the present study suggest that probucol prevents the development of CP-induced cardiotoxicity by a mechanism related, at least in part, to its ability to increase mRNA expression of antioxidant genes and to decrease apoptosis in cardiac tissues with the consequent improvement in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and energy production.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2010-12-15", "authors": ["Yosef AAsiri"], "doi": "10.4161/oxim.3.5.13107"}

Cooling in these models has been produced by various means including whole-body hypothermia, synchronized hypothermic coronary venous retro-perfusion, heat exchangers, and regional hypothermia targeting the heart alone. However, in humans, the most widely used techniques are surface cooling and cooling by endovascular heat-exchange catheters. The reduction in temperature necessary to produce cardioprotection is mild (32-34\u00b0C), appears to have no detrimental effects on left ventricular function or regional myocardial blood flow, and may improve microvascular reflow to previously ischemic heart tissue. It has been shown in experimental and clinical studies that for therapeutic hypothermia to be effective it must be (1) initiated as early as possible after the onset of ischemia and (2) initiated before reperfusion. This may require initiation of hypothermia in the ambulance, well before mechanical reperfusion occurs.

Therefore, some tissues are rendered ischemic during a dive; with the first breath after a dive, blood flow to all tissues is reestablished. In terrestrial mammals, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production increases in response to ischemia/reperfusion and oxidative damage can occur. The capacity of marine mammals to tolerate repeated ischemia/reperfusion cycles associated with diving appears to be due to an enhanced antioxidant system. However, it is not known if diving depth and/or duration elicit differences in tissue capacity to produce ROS and antioxidant defenses in marine mammals.

{"title": "Iron chelation with salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone protects against catecholamine autoxidation and cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Elevated catecholamine levels are known to induce damage of the cardiac tissue. This catecholamine cardiotoxicity may stem from their ability to undergo oxidative conversion to aminochromes and concomitant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage cardiomyocytes via the iron-catalyzed Fenton-type reaction. This suggests the possibility of cardioprotection by iron chelation. Our in vitro experiments have demonstrated a spontaneous decrease in the concentration of the catecholamines epinephrine and isoprenaline during their 24-h preincubation in buffered solution as well as their gradual conversion to oxidation products. These changes were significantly augmented by addition of iron ions and reduced by the iron-chelating agent salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (SIH). Oxidized catecholamines were shown to form complexes with iron that had significant redox activity, which could be suppressed by SIH. Experiments using the H9c2 cardiomyoblast cell line revealed higher cytotoxicity of oxidized catecholamines than of the parent compounds, apparently through the induction of caspase-independent cell death, whereas co-incubation of cells with SIH was able to significantly preserve cell viability. A significant increase in intracellular ROS formation was observed after the incubation of cells with catecholamine oxidation products; this could be significantly reduced by SIH. In contrast, parent catecholamines did not increase, but rather decreased, cellular ROS production. Hence, our results demonstrate an important role for redox-active iron in catecholamine autoxidation and subsequent toxicity. The iron chelator SIH has shown considerable potential to protect cardiac cells by both inhibition of deleterious catecholamine oxidation to reactive intermediates and prevention of ROS-mediated cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2010-12-15", "authors": ["Pavl\u00ednaHa\u0161kov\u00e1", "PetraKova\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1", "LucieKoubkov\u00e1", "AnnaV\u00e1vrov\u00e1", "Eli\u0161kaMackov\u00e1", "Tom\u00e1\u0161Sim\u016fnek"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.12.004"}

{"title": "Molecular characterization of the MuRF genes in rainbow trout: Potential role in muscle degradation.", "abstract": "Muscle growth is determined primarily by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. When rates of protein synthesis are similar between individuals, protein degradation is critical in explaining differences in growth efficiency. Studies in mammals showed that muscle atrophy results from increased protein breakdown, and is associated with activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, including induction of the muscle-specific ubiquitin protein ligase, MuRF1. Animals lacking MuRF1 are resistant to muscle atrophy. In fish, little is known about the role of the proteasome/MuRF pathway in muscle degradation. The objectives of this study were to: 1) clone and characterize MuRF genes in rainbow trout; and 2) determine expression of MuRF genes in association with starvation- and vitellogenesis-induced muscle atrophy in rainbow trout. We have identified full-length cDNA sequences for three MuRF genes (MuRF1, MuRF2, and MuRF3). These genes encode proteins with typical MuRF structural domains, including a RING-finger, a B-box and a Leucine-rich coiled-coil domain. RT-PCR analysis showed that MuRF genes are predominantly expressed in muscle and heart tissues. Real time PCR analysis revealed that expression of all MuRF genes is up-regulated during starvation and MuRF3 is up-regulated in vitellogenesis-associated muscle degradation. These results suggest that MuRF genes have an important role in fish muscle protein degradation. Further studies are warranted to assess the potential use of MuRF genes as tools to monitor fish muscle growth and degradation.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

{"title": "Detection of salmonid alphavirus RNA in wild marine fish: implications for the origins of salmon pancreas disease in aquaculture.", "abstract": "Salmonid alphaviruses (SAVs), which include the aetiological agents of salmon pancreas disease (SPD) in farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. and sleeping disease (SD) in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), are significant viral pathogens of European salmonid aquaculture. SAV is horizontally transmitted and the virus can survive for extended periods in seawater. A lack of convincing evidence for vertical transmission coupled to the fact that the SPD virus (SPDV) occurs in historically infected sites irrespective of fallow period duration suggests that a substantial reservoir of infection exists in the marine environment. We used a highly sensitive real-time PCR (qPCR) assay targeting a region of the SAV nsP1 gene to screen wild marine fish species for the presence of SAV in an attempt to identify such a potential reservoir. Screened fish species were caught in the vicinity of aquaculture activity in an area with a previous history of SAV infection (Shetland Isles, Scotland). SAV RNA was detected in internal organs (kidney and heart) from the flatfish species common dab Limanda limanda, long rough dab Hippoglossoides platessoides, and plaice Pleuronectes platessa. Based on these findings, sampling was extended to an area remote from aquaculture activity (Stonehaven Bay, NE coast of Scotland) from where heart tissues obtained from common dab also tested positive. While no virus could be cultivated from these samples, qPCR detections were shown to be SAV-specific by sequencing of an alternative gene region (E2) to that targeted by the qPCR assay.

We have recently shown that the NIMA-specific regulatory T cells were directly correlated with level of maternal microchimerism (MMc) in adult mice, indicating a causative link between the two, and that both Tregs and multi-lineage MMc were dependent on ingestion of milk from a NIMA(+) mother during nursing. Yet how maternal cells obtained in fetal and neonatal life are maintained in adult life remains unclear. Since stem cells are deficient in MHC class I & II expression, we hypothesized that maternally derived stem cells that replenish MMc remain throughout life without eliciting immunity, but differentiated maternal cells can either be deleted by alloreactive T and B effector cells or persist, inducing NIMA-specific tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found maternally-derived lineage(neg) c-kit(+) cells in the bone marrow of most of adult offspring by quantitative PCR; however, only 50% had detectable MMc in lineage(+) bone marrow cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (lineage(neg) and plate-adherent cells) propagated from the bone marrow also contained maternally-derived cells, albeit in 10-fold lower frequency compared with MMc in myeloid lineage (CD11b(+) and CD11c(+)) cells. Maternally-derived cardiac stem cells were also detected in lineage(neg) c-kit(+) cells purified from heart tissue of NIMA-exposed mice, indicating a local pool of stem cells sustaining MMc in a non-lymphoid tissue. Cardiac stem cell MMc correlated with the presence of maternally derived cardiomyocytes. Lastly, liver MMc increased after nursing suggesting a seeding of maternal cells into the liver via breast milk. Whether orally-derived liver MMc also included maternal stem cells, was not determined. Maternal stem cells in bone marrow and tissues of NIMA-exposed mice are likely responsible for sustaining MMc in adult mice, but their presence alone does not guarantee multi-lineage MMc and tolerance.", "journal": "Chimerism", "date": "2010-12-07", "authors": ["ParthaDutta", "William JBurlingham"], "doi": "10.4161/chim.1.1.12667"}

Hypertension (HT) increases the incidence of cardiac events, but its effect on cardiac adaptation to coexisting coronary artery stenosis (CAS) is unclear. We hypothesized that concurrent HT modulates microvascular function in chronic CAS and aggravates microvascular remodeling and myocardial injury. Four groups of pigs (n=6 each) were studied: normal, CAS, HT, and CAS+HT. CAS and HT were induced by placing local irritant coils in the left circumflex coronary artery and renal artery, respectively. Six weeks later multidetector computerized tomography (CT) was used to assess systolic and diastolic function, microvascular permeability, myocardial perfusion, and responses to adenosine in the \"area at risk.\" Microvascular architecture, inflammation, and fibrosis were then explored in cardiac tissue. Basal myocardial perfusion was similarly decreased in CAS and CAS+HT, but its response to adenosine was significantly more attenuated in CAS. Microvascular permeability in CAS+HT was greater than in CAS and was accompanied by amplified myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and microvascular remodeling, as well as cardiac systolic and diastolic dysfunction. On the other hand, compared with normal, micro-CT-derived microvascular (20-200 \u03bcm) transmural density decreased in CAS but not in HT or CAS+HT. We conclude that the coexistence of early renovascular HT exacerbated myocardial fibrosis and vascular remodeling distal to CAS.

The percentage of total liver lipids was about 32% lower and serum triglyceride levels were 71% higher in the O-BMS group compared to the O-Ctrl group. Serum glucose levels were significantly lowered partly because of the increase in the serum insulin levels in the BMS-based diet groups. BMS supplementation increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) in the white adipose tissue of the obese rats significantly (P\u2009<\u2009.05) and down-regulated the expression of PPAR-\u03b3, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and interferon-\u03b3 mRNA in heart tissue of the obese rats.

Although genetic deletion of all ERK1/2 from the mouse heart did not block the cardiac hypertrophic response per se, meaning that the heart still increased in weight with both aging and pathological stress stimulation, it did dramatically alter how the heart grew. For example, adult myocytes from hearts of Erk1(-/-) Erk2(fl/fl-Cre) mice showed preferential eccentric growth (lengthening), whereas myocytes from Mek1 transgenic hearts showed concentric growth (width increase). Isolated adult myocytes acutely inhibited for ERK1/2 signaling by adenoviral gene transfer showed spontaneous lengthening, whereas infection with an activated Mek1 adenovirus promoted constitutive ERK1/2 signaling and increased myocyte thickness. A similar effect was observed in engineered heart tissue under cyclic stretching, where ERK1/2 inhibition led to preferential lengthening.\nTaken together, these data demonstrate that the ERK1/2 signaling pathway uniquely regulates the balance between eccentric and concentric growth of the heart.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2010-12-04", "authors": ["IzhakKehat", "JenniferDavis", "MalteTiburcy", "FedericaAccornero", "Marc KSaba-El-Leil", "MarjorieMaillet", "Allen JYork", "John NLorenz", "Wolfram HZimmermann", "SylvainMeloche", "Jeffery DMolkentin"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.231514"}

{"title": "Glucocorticoid signaling in cardiac disease.", "abstract": "As major mediators of stress regulation, glucocorticoids have an essential role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis under both physiological and pathological conditions. The release of glucocorticoids into the peripheral circulation is adjusted by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in response to various pathological challenges such as sepsis, starvation, and psychological stress. Clinically, dysregulation of the glucocorticoid-mediated signaling as a result of either excess ligand or receptor hypersensitivity is connected with the progression of unfavorable cardiovascular events such as cardiac hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. The direct effects of glucocorticoids on cardiac tissues are mediated by two steroid receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor, which are both expressed by cardiomyocytes. Although each receptor has some shared responses to glucocorticoids, each receptor also has unique effects on cardiac functions. Elucidating the selective actions of each receptor is critical for determining the proper pharmaceutical targets in cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation", "date": "2010-12-01", "authors": ["RongqinRen", "John ACidlowski"], "doi": "10.1515/HMBCI.2010.051"}

Neonatal rat cardiac cells were seeded into unmodified, single peptide or double peptide-attached alginate scaffolds, all having the same physical features of porosity, hydrogel forming and matrix stiffness.

{"title": "Variation in amount of wild-type transthyretin in different fibril and tissue types in ATTR amyloidosis.", "abstract": "Familial transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is caused by a mutation in the TTR gene, although wild-type (wt) TTR is also incorporated into the amyloid fibrils. Liver transplantation (LT) is the prevailing treatment of the disease and is performed in order to eliminate the mutant TTR from plasma. The outcome of the procedure is varied; especially problematic is a progressive cardiomyopathy seen in some patients, presumably caused by continued incorporation of wtTTR. What determines the discrepancy in outcome is not clear. We have previously shown that two structurally distinct amyloid fibrils (with or without fragmented ATTR) are found among ATTRV30M patients. In this study, we investigated the proportion of wtATTR in cardiac and adipose amyloid from patients having either fibril type. It was found that cardiac amyloid more easily incorporates wtTTR than adipose amyloid, offering a potential explanation for the vulnerability of cardiac tissue for continued amyloidosis after LT. In cardiac tissue, fibrils with fragmented ATTR contained a higher wt proportion than fibrils without, suggesting that continued incorporation of wtTTR after LT, perhaps, can take place more easily in these patients. In adipose tissue, a rapid increase in wt proportion after LT indicates that a rather fast turnover of the deposits must occur. A difference in wt proportion between the fibril types was seen post-LT but not pre-LT, possibly caused by differences in turnover rate. Conclusively, this study further establishes the basic dissimilarities between the two fibril types and demonstrates that their role in LT outcome needs to be further investigated.", "journal": "Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2010-11-26", "authors": ["ElisabetIhse", "Ole BSuhr", "UlfHellman", "PerWestermark"], "doi": "10.1007/s00109-010-0695-1\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.3203\n10.1002/lt.21395\n10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181ea15d4\n10.1073/pnas.87.7.2843\n10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01173.x\n10.1080/13506120701460923\n10.1002/path.1759\n10.1073/pnas.80.2.539\n10.1080/13506120600877003\n10.1002/path.2411\n10.1111/j.1399-0004.1991.tb03085.x\n10.1097/01.TP.0000092307.98347.CB\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2007.01969.x\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2006.01585.x\n10.1080/13506120701614032\n10.1097/00007890-199707150-00014\n10.1097/00007890-199807270-00016\n10.1097/00007890-200203150-00015\n10.1097/01.md.0000232559.22098.c3\n10.1080/13506120701461368\n10.2169/internalmedicine.47.1399\n10.1016/S0076-6879(99)09007-2\n10.1016/j.acthis.2006.03.011\n10.1016/0003-2697(87)90587-2\n10.1038/labinvest.3700124\n10.1016/j.jns.2009.07.028\n10.1073/pnas.81.3.694\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.12.095\n10.1111/j.1365-3083.1989.tb02468.x\n10.1016/j.jmb.2005.09.100"}

We investigated the relationships between plasma HCII activity and surrogate markers of cardiac geometry, including left atrial volume index (LAVI), relative wall thickness (RWT) and left ventricular mass index, and deceleration time (DcT) and the ratio of peak E velocity to early diastolic mitral annulus velocity (E/e' ratio) as surrogate markers of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction measured using echocardiography in 304 Japanese elderly individuals without systolic heart failure (169 men and 135 women; mean age: 65.4 \u00b1 11.8 years). Mean plasma HCII activity in all participants was 95.8 \u00b1 17.0% and there was no difference between the mean plasma HCII activities in males and females. Multiple regression analysis revealed that there were significant inverse relationships between plasma HCII activity and LAVI (coefficient: -0.2302, P<0.001), between HCII activity and RWT (coefficient: -0.0007, P<0.05), between HCII activity and DcT (coefficient: -0.5189, P<0.05) and between HCII activity and E/e' ratio (coefficient: -0.0558, P<0.01).

It is based on the monodomain equations and digitized histographs from tissue slices obtained post-experimentum. It could be shown that excitation spread in densely coupled regions produces uniform and anisotropic conduction. In contrast, zones with parallel fibers separated by uncoupling interstitial space or connective tissue may show uniform or complex signals depending on pacing site.

Eight animals were surface cooled to 25\u00b0C, while four animals were kept as normothermic time-matched controls.\nDuring progressive cooling and steady state severe hypothermia (25\u00b0C) cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), mean arterial pressure (MAP), maximal deceleration of pressure in the cardiac cycle (dP/dt(min)), indexes of LV contractility (preload recruitable stroke work, PRSW, and maximal acceleration of pressure in the cardiac cycle, dP/dt(max)) and LV end diastolic and systolic volumes (EDV and ESV) were significantly reduced. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR), isovolumetric relaxation time (Tau), and oxygen content in arterial and mixed venous blood increased significantly. LV end diastolic pressure (EDP) remained constant. After rewarming all the above mentioned hemodynamic variables that were depressed during 25\u00b0C remained reduced, except for CO that returned to pre-hypothermic values due to an increase in heart rate. Likewise, SVR and EDP were significantly reduced after rewarming, while Tau, EDV, ESV and blood oxygen content normalized. Serum levels of cardiac troponin T (TnT) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were significantly increased.\nProgressive cooling to 25\u00b0C followed by rewarming resulted in a reduced systolic, but not diastolic left ventricular function.

{"title": "Perspectives in microvascular fluid handling: does the distribution of coagulation factors in human myocardium comply with plasma extravasation in venular coronary segments?", "abstract": "Heterogeneity of vascular permeability has been suggested for the coronary system. Whereas arteriolar and capillary segments are tight, plasma proteins pass readily into the interstitial space at venular sites. Fittingly, lymphatic fluid is able to coagulate. However, heart tissue contains high concentrations of tissue factor, presumably enabling bleeding to be stopped immediately in this vital organ. The distribution of pro- and anti-coagulatively active factors in human heart tissue has now been determined in relation to the types of microvessels.\nSamples of healthy explanted hearts and dilated cardiomyopathic hearts were immunohistochemically stained. Albumin was found throughout the interstitial space. Tissue factor was packed tightly around arterioles and capillaries, whereas the tissue surrounding venules and small veins was practically free of this starter of coagulation. Thrombomodulin was present at the luminal surface of all vessel segments and especially at venular endothelial cell junctions. Its product, the anticoagulant protein C, appeared only at discrete extravascular sites, mainly next to capillaries. These distribution patterns were basically identical in the healthy and diseased hearts, suggesting a general principle.\nVenular extravasation of plasma proteins probably would not bring prothrombin into intimate contact with tissue factor, avoiding interstitial coagulation in the absence of injury. Generation of activated protein C via thrombomodulin is favored in the vicinity of venular gaps, should thrombin occur inside coronary vessels. This regionalization of distribution supports the proposed physiological heterogeneity of the vascular barrier and complies with the passage of plasma proteins into the lymphatic system of the heart.", "journal": "Journal of vascular research", "date": "2010-11-23", "authors": ["MatthiasJacob", "DanielChappell", "MechthildStoeckelhuber", "UlrichWelsch", "MarkusRehm", "DirkBruegger", "IngoKaczmarek", "PeterConzen", "Bernhard FBecker"], "doi": "10.1159/000318795"}

Its use is hampered by the cardiotoxicity of bufadienolides derived from Toad Venom. Bezoar Bovis is another frequently used drug in Toad Venom preparations for the treatment of inflammatory or cardiovascular diseases in Asia. We explored whether Bezoar Bovis could protect against CS-induced acute toxicity in mice. Toxicity was assessed by the general features of poisoning, electrocardiography (ECG), and levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and calcium ions (Ca(2+)) in cardiac tissues. Toad Venom (90 mg/kg) caused opisthotonus, ventricular arrhythmias, and increases in cardiac levels of Ca(2+), CK and LDH. Pretreatment with Bezoar Bovis (120, 240 and 480 mg/kg) significantly reduced the prevalence of opisthotonus and mortality, and prevented cardiotoxicity in CS-treated mice as evidenced by decreases in the scores of arrhythmias and cardiac levels of CK, LDH and Ca(2+). Furthermore, the bilirubin, and taurine derived from Bezoar Bovis offered marked protection against the arrhythmias induced by CS or bufalin in vivo and in vitro. An anti-inflammatory study showed that Bezoar Bovis did not compromise the anti-inflammatory activity of Toad Venom on concanavalin-A (ConA)-stimulated proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results suggested that Bezoar Bovis elicited protective and anti-arrhythmic effects against Toad Venom intoxication in mice, and is a novel antidote in combination with Toad Venom therapy.", "journal": "Experimental and toxicologic pathology : official journal of the Gesellschaft fur Toxikologische Pathologie", "date": "2010-11-19", "authors": ["HongyueMa", "JingZhou", "JiejunJiang", "JinaoDuan", "HuiqinXu", "YupingTang", "GaohongLv", "JunfengZhang", "ZhenZhan", "AnweiDing"], "doi": "10.1016/j.etp.2010.10.007"}
{"title": "Subthreshold parameters of cardiac tissue in a bi-layer computer model of heart failure.", "abstract": "Current density threshold and liminal area are subthreshold parameters of the cardiac tissue that indicate its susceptibility to external and internal stimulations. Extensive experimental and theoretical research has been conducted to quantify these two parameters in normal conditions for both animal and human models. Here we employed a 2D numerical model of human cardiac tissue to assess these subthreshold parameters under the pathological conditions of heart failure and fibrosis. Stimuli were applied over an area ranging from 0.04 to 1 mm\u00b2 using various pulse durations. The current density threshold decreased with increasing stimulation area or pulse duration. No significant changes were found in both parameters between control conditions and heart failure in the atrial tissue, while in the ventricular tissue, heart failure resulted in significantly reduced excitability with higher stimulation current magnitudes needed for excitation and larger liminal areas. This results from the specific ionic remodeling in ventricular heart failure that affects both subthreshold active currents such as I(K\u2081) and connexin 43 conductance. In fibrosis, increased fibroblast to myocyte coupling coefficient had a non-linear influence on current density thresholds, with an initial increase of current magnitude followed by a relaxation phase down to the current magnitude threshold for the control condition with no fibrosis. The results show that subthreshold excitation properties of the myocardium are influenced in a complex, non-linear manner by cardiac pathologies.

The cardiac apex has a complex spiral fiber architecture that plays an important role in the development and propagation of action currents during stimulation at the apex. This spiral fiber orientation contains both radial electric currents that contribute to the electrocardiogram and electrically silent circular currents that cannot be detected by the electrocardiogram but are detectable by their magnetic field, B(z). In our experiments, the transmembrane potential, V(m), was first measured optically and then B(z) was measured with a superconducting quantum interference device microscope. Based on a simple model of the spiral structure of the apex, V(m) was expected to exhibit circular wave front patterns and B(z) to reflect the circular component of the action currents. Although the circular V(m) wave fronts were detected, the B(z) maps were not as simple as expected. However, we observed a pattern consistent with a tilted axis for the apex spiral fiber geometry. We were able to simulate similar patterns in both a monodomain model of a tilted stack of rings of dipole current and a bidomain model of a tilted stack of spiraled cardiac tissue that was stimulated at the apex. The fact that the spatial pattern of the magnetic data was more complex than the simple circles observed for V(m) suggests that the magnetic data contain information that cannot be found electrically.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2010-11-18", "authors": ["Krista KayMcBride", "Bradley JRoth", "V YSidorov", "John PWikswo", "Franz JBaudenbacher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2010.08.040"}

E-4031 (an I(Kr) blocker) combined with reduced extracellular K ([K(+)](o)) and Mg ([Mg(2+)](o)) prolonged action potential duration heterogeneously and induced phase 2 and phase 3 EADs. Whereas phase 2 EADs were Ca(i)-dependent, phase 3 EADs were not. The origins of 47 triggered activity episodes were attributed to phase 2 EADs in 12 episodes (26%) and phase 3 EADs in 35 episodes (74%). When phase 2 EADs accompanied phase 3 EADs, they accentuated action potential duration heterogeneity, creating a large V(m) gradient across the boundary between long and short action potential duration regions from which triggered activity emerged. The amplitude of phase 3 EADs correlated with the V(m) gradient (r=0.898, P<0.001). Computer simulation studies showed that coupling of cells with heterogeneous repolarization could extrinsically generate phase 3 EADs via electrotonic current flow. Alternatively, reduced I(K1) caused by low [K(+)](o) could generate intrinsic phase 3 EADs capable of inducing triggered activity at the boundary zone.\nPhase 3 EADs can be extrinsic as the result of electrotonic current across steep repolarization gradients or intrinsic as the result of low I(K1) and do not require spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release.

Hexokinase (HK)II is a HK isoform that is expressed in the heart and can bind to the mitochondrial outer membrane.\nWe sought to define how HKII and its binding to mitochondria play a role in cardiac response and remodeling after I/R.\nWe first showed that HKII levels and its binding to mitochondria are reduced 2 days after I/R. We then subjected the hearts of wild-type and heterozygote HKII knockout (HKII(+/)\u207b) mice to I/R by coronary ligation. At baseline, HKII(+/)\u207b mice have normal cardiac function; however, they display lower systolic function after I/R compared to wild-type animals. The mechanism appears to be through an increase in cardiomyocyte death and fibrosis and a reduction in angiogenesis; the latter is through a decrease in hypoxia-inducible factor-dependent pathway signaling in cardiomyocytes. HKII mitochondrial binding is also critical for cardiomyocyte survival, because its displacement in tissue culture with a synthetic peptide increases cell death. Our results also suggest that HKII may be important for the remodeling of the viable cardiac tissue because its modulation in vitro alters cellular energy levels, O\u2082 consumption, and contractility.\nThese results suggest that reduction in HKII levels causes altered remodeling of the heart in I/R by increasing cell death and fibrosis and reducing angiogenesis and that mitochondrial binding is needed for protection of cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2010-11-13", "authors": ["RongxueWu", "Kirsten MSmeele", "EugeneWyatt", "YoshihikoIchikawa", "OttoEerbeek", "LinSun", "KusumChawla", "Markus WHollmann", "VarunNagpal", "SamiHeikkinen", "MarkkuLaakso", "KentaroJujo", "J AndrewWasserstrom", "Coert JZuurbier", "HosseinArdehali"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223115"}

Moreover, telmisartan reduced the myocardial apoptosis induced by daunorubicin.\nThe present study indicates that telmisartan may improve cardiac function by inhibiting the action of Ang II via AT-1R, which reverses oxidative stress and myocardial apoptosis. This suggests a beneficial effect of telmisartan treatment in the prevention of daunorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology", "date": "2010-11-09", "authors": ["WawaimuliArozal", "KenichiWatanabe", "Punniyakoti TVeeraveedu", "Rajarajan AThandavarayan", "MeileiHarima", "VijayakumarSukumaran", "KenjiSuzuki", "MakotoKodama", "YoshifusaAizawa"], "doi": "10.1111/j.2042-7158.2010.01196.x"}

Deconvolution microscopy on immunolabeled proteins revealed the presence of Chga, Chgb, and Scg2 in murine cardiac secretory granules. The presence of low plasma catestatin (CST: mChga(364-384)) in older mice indicates diminished processing of Chga to CST with advancement of age, which is comparable to that found in humans. We have previously shown that CST (hCHGA(352-372)) exerts potent cardio-suppressive effects on frog and rat heart, but the source of CST for such action has remained elusive. In the present study, we found CST-related peptides in cardiomyocytes and in heart, which establishes an autocrine/paracrine function of CST in cardiac tissue.

{"title": "In vivo and in vitro assessment of the role of glutathione antioxidant system in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "The clinical usefulness of anthracycline antineoplastic drugs is limited by their cardiotoxicity. Its mechanisms have not been fully understood, although the induction of oxidative stress is widely believed to play the principal role. Glutathione is the dominant cellular antioxidant, while glutathione peroxidase (GPx) together with glutathione reductase (GR) constitutes the major enzymatic system protecting the cardiac cells from oxidative damage. Therefore, this study aimed to assess their roles in anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Ten-week intravenous administration of daunorubicin (DAU, 3\u00a0mg/kg weekly) to rabbits induced heart failure, which was evident from decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and release of cardiac troponins to circulation. However, no significant changes in either total or oxidized glutathione contents or GR activity were detected in left ventricular tissue of DAU-treated rabbits when compared with control animals. GPx activity in the cardiac tissue significantly increased. In H9c2 rat cardiac cells, 24-h DAU exposure (0.1-10\u00a0\u03bcM) induced significant dose-dependent toxicity. Cellular content of reduced glutathione was insignificantly decreased, oxidized glutathione and GR activity were unaffected, and GPx activity was significantly increased. Neither buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, glutathione biosynthesis inhibitor) nor 2-oxo-4-thiazolidine-carboxylic acid (OTC, glutathione biosynthetic precursor) had significant effects on DAU cytotoxicity. This contrasted with model oxidative injury induced by hydrogen peroxide, which cytotoxicity was increased by BSO and decreased by OTC.

{"title": "A simulation study of cellular hypertrophy and connexin lateralization in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Many cardiac diseases coincide with changes in cell size and shape. One example of such a disease is cardiac hypertrophy. It is established that cardiac impulse propagation depends on the cell size, as well as other factors, but interrelations between conduction velocity (CV), cell size, and gap junction (GJ) conductance (g(GJ)) are complex. Furthermore, cardiac diseases are often accompanied by connexin (Cx) lateralization. To analyze the effects of cell size and Cx lateralization in cardiac disease, a two-dimensional computer simulation of ventricular myocytes based on the Luo-Rudy model was used. Control cells (80 \u03bcm/20 \u03bcm (length/diameter)), long cells (160 \u03bcm/20 \u03bcm), and wide cells (80 \u03bcm/40 \u03bcm) were simulated as was a redistribution of lateral GJs (constant lateral g(GJ) and increased lateral g(GJ)). CV in long cells showed high stability, i.e., it declined very slowly when g(GJ) was gradually reduced. Wide cells, however, were more affected by reduced g(GJ), resulting in early transition to discontinuous propagation and low CV. Conduction block occurred earlier in enlarged cells than in control cells due to increased cell capacitance. Increased lateral g(GJ) stabilized longitudinal CV, which was a result of two-dimensional effects during planar wave propagation. Therefore, Cx lateralization may compensate for cardiac inhomogeneities. High lateral g(GJ) and enhanced cell diameter increased the susceptibility to conduction block at tissue expansion, providing a substrate for arrhythmia.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2010-11-04", "authors": ["ThomasSeidel", "AidaSalameh", "StefanDhein"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2010.09.010"}

The receptors binding APN to cardiac tissue, however, have remained elusive. Here, we report that the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol\u2013anchored cell surface glycoprotein T-cadherin (encoded by Cdh13) protects against cardiac stress through its association with APN in mice. We observed extensive colocalization of T-cadherin and APN on cardiomyocytes in vivo. In T-cadherin-deficient mice, APN failed to associate with cardiac tissue, and its levels dramatically increased in the circulation. Pressure overload stress resulted in exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy in T-cadherin-null mice and paralleled corresponding defects in mice lacking APN. During ischemia-reperfusion injury, the absence of T-cadherin increased infarct size similar to that in APN-null mice. Myocardial AMPK is a major downstream protective signaling target of APN. In both cardiac hypertrophy and ischemia-reperfusion models, T-cadherin was necessary for APN-dependent AMPK phosphorylation. In APN-null mice, recombinant adenovirus-expressed APN reduced exaggerated hypertrophy and infarct size and restored AMPK phosphorylation as previously reported. In contrast, rescue was ineffective in mice lacking T-cadherin in addition to APN.

However, detailed experimental investigations into the spatial dynamics of alternans control have been restricted to Purkinje fiber studies. A complete understanding of alternans control in the more clinically relevant ventricular tissue is needed. In this paper, we study the spatial dynamics of alternans and alternans control in arterially perfused canine right ventricular preparations using an optical mapping system capable of high-resolution fluorescence imaging.

We created 1-dimensional multicellular fiber models with and without a resistive barrier in various fiber regions and paced each model to induce cellular alternans. The models demonstrate that a resistive barrier in one fiber region substantially alters cellular repolarization alternans throughout the fiber. A midmyocardial or subepicardial barrier increase both TWA amplitude and maximum cellular alternans magnitude, relative to a fiber without a barrier. In addition, a direct relationship exists between TWA amplitude and maximum cellular alternans magnitude, which was highly dependent on barrier location.

{"title": "Carnitine deficiency and oxidative stress provoke cardiotoxicity in an ifosfamide-induced Fanconi Syndrome rat model.", "abstract": "In addition to hemorrhagic cystitis, Fanconi Syndrome is a serious clinical side effect during ifosfamide (IFO) therapy. Fanconi syndrome is a generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubule which is characterized by excessive urinary excretion of glucose, phosphate, bicarbonate, amino acids and other solutes excreted by this segment of the nephron including L-carnitine. Carnitine is essential cofactor for \u03b2-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in the myocardium. IFO therapy is associated with increased urinary carnitine excretion with subsequent secondary deficiency of the molecule. Cardiac abnormalities in IFO-treated cancer patients were reported as isolated clinical cases. This study examined whether carnitine deficiency and oxidative stress, secondary to Fanconi Syndrome, provoke IFO-induced cardiomyopathy as well as exploring if carnitine supplementation using Propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC) could offer protection against this toxicity. In the current study, an animal model of carnitine deficiency was developed in rats by D-carnitine-mildronate treatment Adult male Wistar albino rats were assigned to one of six treatment groups: the first three groups were injected intraperitoneally with normal saline, D-carnitine (DC, 250 mg/kg/day) combined with mildronate (MD, 200 mg/kg/day) and PLC (250 mg/kg/day), respectively, for 10 successive days. The 4(th), 5(th) and 6(th) groups were injected with the same doses of normal saline, DC-MD and PLC, respectively for 5 successive days before and 5 days concomitant with IFO (50 mg/kg/day). IFO significantly increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary carnitine excretion and clearance, creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), intramitochondrial acetyl-CoA/CoA-SH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in cardiac tissues and significantly decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and total carnitine and reduced glutathione (GSH) content in cardiac tissues. In carnitine-depleted rats, IFO induced dramatic increase in serum creatinine, BUN, CK-MB, LDH, carnitine clearance and intramitochondrial acetyl-CoA/CoA-SH, as well as progressive reduction in total carnitine and ATP in cardiac tissues. Interestingly, PLC supplementation completely reversed the biochemical changes-induced by IFO to the control values. In conclusion, data from the present study suggest that: Carnitine deficiency and oxidative stress, secondary to Fanconi Syndrome, constitute risk factors and should be viewed as mechanisms during development of IFO-induced cardiotoxicity.

{"title": "Circadian profiles in the embryonic chick heart: L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and signaling pathways.", "abstract": "Circadian clocks exist in the heart tissue and modulate multiple physiological events, from cardiac metabolism to contractile function and expression of circadian oscillator and metabolic-related genes. Ample evidence has demonstrated that there are endogenous circadian oscillators in adult mammalian cardiomyocytes. However, mammalian embryos cannot be entrained independently to light-dark (LD) cycles in vivo without any maternal influence, but circadian genes are well expressed and able to oscillate in embryonic stages. The authors took advantage of using chick embryos that are independent of maternal influences to investigate whether embryonic hearts could be entrained under LD cycles in ovo. The authors found circadian regulation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs), the ion channels responsible for the production of cardiac muscle contraction in embryonic chick hearts. The mRNA levels and protein expression of VGCC\u03b11C and VGCC\u03b11D are under circadian control, and the average L-VGCC current density is significantly larger when cardiomyocytes are recorded during the night than day. The phosphorylation states of several kinases involved in insulin signaling and cardiac metabolism, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), stress-activated protein kinase (p38), protein kinase B (Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), are also under circadian control. Both Erk and p38 have been implicated in regulating cardiac contractility and in the development of various pathological states, such as cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Even though both Erk and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathways participate in complex cellular processes regarding physiological or pathological states of cardiomyocytes, the circadian oscillators in the heart regulate these pathways independently, and both pathways contribute to the circadian regulation of L-VGCCs.", "journal": "Chronobiology international", "date": "2010-10-26", "authors": ["Michael LKo", "LihengShi", "KirillGrushin", "FikruNigussie", "Gladys Y-PKo"], "doi": "10.3109/07420528.2010.514631"}

The dysfunction of this timing system can result in cardiac pathology. The neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is crucial for circadian rhythms in a number of biological processes including SCN electrical activity and wheel running behavior. Anatomic evidence indicates that SCN neurons expressing VIP are well positioned to drive circadian regulation of cardiac function through interactions with the autonomic centers. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that loss of VIP would result in circadian deficits in heart rate (HR) and clock gene expression in cardiac tissue. We implanted radiotelemetry devices into VIP-deficient mice and wild-type (WT) controls and continuously recorded HR, body temperature, and cage activity in freely moving mice. Under light-dark conditions, VIP-deficient mice displayed weak rhythms in HR, body temperature, and cage activity, with onsets that were advanced in phase compared with WT mice. Similarly, clock gene expression in cardiac tissue was rhythmic but phase advanced in mutant mice. In constant darkness, the normal circadian rhythms in HR were lost in VIP-deficient mice; however, most mutant mice continued to exhibit circadian rhythms of body temperature with shortened free-running period. The loss of VIP altered, but did not abolish, autonomic regulation of HR. Analysis of the echocardiograms did not find any evidence for a loss of cardiac function in VIP-deficient mice, and the size of the hearts did not differ between genotypes.

LG pretreatment exhibited cardioprotective activity as evidenced by decreased activity of cardiac markers in serum and increased the same in heart homogenate (p < 0.05). LG administration decreased the toxic events of lipid peroxidation (TBARS) in both serum and heart tissue, by increasing the level of enzymatic antioxidants and non-enzymatic antioxidants significantly in both heart homogenate and serum sample (p < 0.05). The histopathological observations also revealed that the cardioprotective effect of LG extract was observed at a dose of 200 mg/kg b.wt.

{"title": "Iron-induced cardiac damage: role of apoptosis and deferasirox intervention.", "abstract": "Excess cardiac iron levels are associated with cardiac damage and can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Here, we hypothesize that elevations in tissue iron can activate caspase-dependent signaling, which leads to increased cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis, and that these alterations can be attenuated by iron chelation. Using an iron-overloaded gerbil model, we show that increased cardiac iron is associated with reduced activation of Akt (Ser473 and Thr308), diminished phosphorylation of the proapoptotic regulator Bad (Ser136), and an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. These iron-overload-induced alterations in Akt/Bad phosphorylation and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were coupled with increased activation of the downstream caspase-9 (40/38- and 17-kDa fragments) and apoptosis executioner caspase-3 (19- and 17-kDa fragments), which were accompanied by evidence of elevated cytoskeletal \u03b1-fodrin cleavage (150- and 120-kDa fragments), discontinuity of myocardial membrane dystrophin immunoreactivity, increases in the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells (nucleic DNA fragmentation), and cardiac fibrosis. We demonstrate that the administration of deferasirox, a tridentate iron chelator, is associated with diminished tissue iron deposition, attenuated activation of caspases, reduced \u03b1-fodrin cleavage, improved membrane integrity, decreased TUNEL reactivity, and attenuated cardiac fibrosis. These results suggest that the activation of caspase-dependent signaling may play a role in the development of iron-induced cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis, and deferasirox, via a reduction in cardiac tissue iron levels, may be useful for decreasing the extent of iron-induced cardiac damage.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2010-10-16", "authors": ["YelingWang", "MiaozongWu", "RabaaAl-Rousan", "HuaLiu", "JacquelineFannin", "SatyanarayanaPaturi", "Ravi KumarArvapalli", "AnjaiahKatta", "Sunil KKakarla", "Kevin MRice", "William ETriest", "Eric RBlough"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.110.172668"}

Cells cultured on PA substrates with elasticity comparable to that of the native myocardium (18 kPa) exhibited the highest beating rate during the first few days of culture. The initial beating rate of individual cells on all the substrates varied significantly but began to converge within 5 days. We also examined the focal adhesions (FAs) and cytoskeletal structure on different substrates via confocal microscopy and found a higher percentage of FAs on tissue culture (TC) plastic dishes compared with the softer PA gels. Furthermore, highly aligned sarcomeric striations were clearly visible on 18 kPa, 50 kPa, and TC dish, whereas cells on 1 kPa only showed nonaligned diffused striations. The force of contraction on these substrates was measured using a micro-electromechanical system force sensor, which showed that the force of contraction for the cells on TC dishes (F = 71.30 \u00b1 6.38 nN) was significantly larger than those cultured on the 18-kPa PA gel (F = 30.16 \u00b1 3.83 nN).

Effects of methionine administration were examined by histological analysis with Sirius red staining, histomorphometric analysis, zymography, and immunoblotting. Hyperhomocysteinemia due to methionine administration produces an interstitial myocardial fibrosis and a ventricular cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which were associated with increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF\u03b21), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 2, and JNK activation.

Moreover, the TIMP1 protein expression was decreased, and the TIMP1-MMP1 balance was shifted.

Radio-telemetric analysis was performed to investigate the cardiovascular responses following instillation of particles at the highest dosage based on the inflammatory response observed.\nExposure to 1000 \u03bcg of PM\u2082(.)\u2085-AB was associated with a delayed increase in delta mean blood pressure (\u0394mBP) during 2(nd)-4(th) day after instillation (10.0 \u00b1 4.0 vs. -3.9 \u00b1 2.6 mmHg) and reduced heart rate (HR) on the 3rd day post instillation (325.1 \u00b1 8.8 vs. 348.9 \u00b1 12.5 bpm).

The presence of a T cell-rich mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and the relative scarcity of parasites in the heart suggested that chronic inflammation secondary to the autoimmune recognition of cardiac proteins could be a major pathogenetic mechanism. Sera from CCC patients crossreactively recognize cardiac myosin and T. cruzi protein B13. T cell clones elicited from peripheral blood with T. cruzi B13 protein or its peptides could crossreactively recognize epitopes from cardiac myosin heavy chain. Likewise, CD4+ T cell clones infiltrating CCC myocardium crossreactively recognize cardiac myosin and T. cruzi protein B13, and intralesional T cell lines produce the inflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. Conversely, IFN-\u03b3-induced genes and chemokines were found to be upregulated in CCC heart samples, and IFN-\u03b3 is able to induce cardiomyocyte expression of atrial natriuretic factor, a key member of the hypertrophy/heart failure signature.

{"title": "CMV promoter is inadequate for expression of mutant human RyR2 in transgenic rabbits.", "abstract": "Fundamental differences in Ca\u00b2+ homeostasis between mice and larger mammals require the validation of the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis before translation into human pathophysiology. The purpose of this study was to create transgenic rabbits that express defective human cardiac ryanodine receptor (hRyR2) with a mutation (R4497C) causing a clinically relevant arrhythmogenic syndrome.\nThe construct pcDNA3-EGFP-hRyR2-R4497C with the CMV promoter was used to generate transgenic rabbits. The founder animals were created by microinjection and identified by PCR with specific primers for the EGFP sequence. The copy number of the transgene was quantified by real-time PCR using genomic DNA from blood cells. mRNA expression of EGFP-hRyR2-R4497C was quantified using RT-PCR with specific primers for the RyR2 and EGFP sequence. Protein expression of the transgene in heart and non-cardiac tissues was determined using immunoblots with antibodies directed against EGFP and RyR2.\nReal-time PCR in peripheral blood cells identified several rabbit lines with the construct integrated into their genome. Transcription levels of the transgene were low (Ct>30). On the protein level, neither EGFP nor hRyR2 R4497C was detected in either cardiac or non-cardiac tissue. A truncated gene product (3' end and central part of hRyR2 R4497C, but not EGFP) could be detected at the mRNA level in the heart.\nLack of significant protein expression of the EGFP-RyR2 R4497C gene construct despite successful incorporation into the genomic DNA is due to combination of at least two factors: low mRNA expression, and truncation of the transgene on the mRNA level. Our results suggest that the CMV promoter may not be well suited for creating transgenic rabbits.", "journal": "Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods", "date": "2010-10-05", "authors": ["PaulinaWakula", "EgbertBisping", "JensKocksk\u00e4mper", "HeinerPost", "SabineBrauer", "MarionDeuter", "RalphOehlmann", "UrbanBesenfelder", "F AnthonyLai", "GottfriedBrem", "BurkertPieske"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vascn.2010.09.007"}

CNTs and ENTs transport anti-cancer and anti-viral nucleoside analog drugs and ENTs are also targets of drugs used to treat cardiac pathologies. Levels of some NT profiles have been shown to relate to clinical outcomes in the use of nucleoside analog drugs. However, currently, patient NT profile is not assessed prior to pharmacological administration of analog drugs. Here we describe a reliable method to determine a complete individual NT expression profile from human tissue using quantitative real-time PCR. We developed this assay on tissue (right atrial appendage, left internal mammary, aorta) from individuals undergoing cardiac surgery and compared these findings to the NT expression profiles in pooled whole heart tissue (normal and diseased). Data show that hENT1 is the most abundantly expressed NT, with highest expression levels in the aorta. However, NT expression profiles are highly variable among individuals and changes in NT expression between normal and diseased tissues were observed. These data are the first to describe the RNA expression patterns of all seven NT isoforms in the human heart.

{"title": "Middle age aggravates myocardial ischemia through surprising upholding of complex II activity, oxidative stress, and reduced coronary perfusion.", "abstract": "Aging compromises restoration of the cardiac mechanical function during reperfusion. We hypothesized that this was due to an ampler release of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study aimed at characterising ex vivo the mitochondrial ROS release during reperfusion in isolated perfused hearts of middle-aged rats. Causes and consequences on myocardial function of the observed changes were then evaluated. The hearts of rats aged 10- or 52-week old were subjected to global ischemia followed by reperfusion. Mechanical function was monitored throughout the entire procedure. Activities of the respiratory chain complexes and the ratio of aconitase to fumarase activities were determined before ischemia and at the end of reperfusion. H(2)O(2) release was also evaluated in isolated mitochondria. During ischemia, middle-aged hearts displayed a delayed contracture, suggesting a maintained ATP production but also an increased metabolic proton production. Restoration of the mechanical function during reperfusion was however reduced in the middle-aged hearts, due to lower recovery of the coronary flow associated with higher mitochondrial oxidative stress indicated by the aconitase to fumarase ratio in the cardiac tissues. Surprisingly, activity of the respiratory chain complex II was better maintained in the hearts of middle-aged animals, probably because of an enhanced preservation of its membrane lipid environment. This can explain the higher mitochondrial oxidative stress observed in these conditions, since cardiac mitochondria produce much more H(2)O(2) when they oxidize FADH(2)-linked substrates than when they use NADH-linked substrates. In conclusion, the lower restoration of the cardiac mechanical activity during reperfusion in the middle-aged hearts was due to an impaired recovery of the coronary flow and an insufficient oxygen supply. The deterioration of the coronary perfusion was explained by an increased mitochondrial ROS release related to the preservation of complex II activity during reperfusion.", "journal": "Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)", "date": "2010-09-30", "authors": ["EvangeliaMourmoura", "MarieLeguen", "Herv\u00e9Dubouchaud", "KarineCouturier", "DamienVitiello", "Jean-LucLafond", "MelanieRichardson", "XavierLeverve", "LucDemaison"], "doi": "10.1007/s11357-010-9186-0\n10.1016/S0022-5223(96)70421-X\n10.1016/S0531-5565(99)00031-5\n10.1074/jbc.M310329200\n10.1016/S0014-2999(01)01417-0\n10.1016/j.exger.2004.06.006\n10.1152/ajpheart.01071.2006\n10.1016/j.mad.2004.11.001\n10.1074/jbc.M702294200\n10.1074/jbc.M802691200\n10.1074/jbc.M805403200\n10.1006/jsre.2001.6324\n10.1023/A:1011934603667\n10.1021/bi00839a041\n10.1006/abbi.1999.1508\n10.1073/pnas.91.25.12248\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00253-3\n10.1006/jmcc.1998.0710\n10.1023/A:1015251212039\n10.1089/rej.2007.0609\n10.1016/S0047-6374(01)00242-1\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.12.020\n10.1080/10715760500315118\n10.1016/0009-8981(94)90270-4\n10.1373/clinchem.2005.050146\n10.1038/sj.ijo.0803779\n10.1002/0470868694.ch15\n10.1016/S0047-6374(00)00253-0\n10.1016/j.abb.2003.09.046\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2008.05.444\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1273\n10.1006/abbi.2000.2066\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.03.007\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2007.00271.x\n10.1007/s002280050589\n10.1016/0167-4943(96)00700-5\n10.1159/000063396\n10.1016/S1010-7940(03)00022-8\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.02.020\n10.1161/01.RES.0000109416.56608.64\n10.1007/s10863-006-9016-3\n10.1016/0047-6374(96)01732-0\n10.1093/cvr/cvm062\n10.1023/A:1007074330569\n10.1016/j.exger.2008.04.017\n10.1097/00000542-200403000-00019\n10.1006/jmcc.1997.0533\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00256-9\n10.1016/S0022-5223(96)70194-0\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.12.012\n10.1007/s11095-007-9334-0\n10.1074/jbc.M601320200\n10.1016/j.exger.2003.08.003\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2004.09.014\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2008.03.025\n10.1016/S0008-6363(03)00351-1\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00409-6\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2006.02.061\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2006.04.029"}

{"title": "Migration and proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells is stimulated by different regions of the mechano-growth factor prohormone.", "abstract": "Stem cell function is thought to be tightly regulated by growth factor concentration in the confines of the microenvironmental niche. Therefore, the response of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was studied in culture with mechano-growth factor (MGF), an isoform of IGF-1 known to be expressed in the heart following injury. Chemotactic migration of hMSCs increased in response to a peptide analog corresponding to the E-domain region of the MGF prohormone, which was greater than the IGF-1 polypeptide after 20 h of culture. Compared to control without growth factor, migration was significantly less with a scrambled peptide (p=0.025) or a peptide harboring a serine to alanine substitution near the carboxy end (p=0.002). The IGF-1 polypeptide increased proliferation of small (5-9 \u03bcm) but not large (>13 \u03bcm) hMSCs, whereas the E-domain peptide (MGF-E) had no effect on proliferation. Thus, there are complex biological responses of hMSCs to the prehormone of IGF with respect to migration and proliferation. Since neonatal myocytes but not hMSCs express MGF when strained cyclically at 20%, overloading of the heart may trigger immigration of stem cells. It seems possible that regions of the IGF prohormone may act differentially, or in a combinatorial manner, to benefit cardiac tissue recovery after injury.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2010-09-30", "authors": ["John MCollins", "Paul HGoldspink", "BrendaRussell"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.09.017"}

The dODNs-DEN conjugates formed stable complexes with Dox (~184 Dox molecules per conjugate) and the resulting Dox-loaded conjugate exhibited a sustained drug release pattern both in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that Dox-loaded dODNs-DEN conjugates were cleared from plasma much more slowly (up to 5.3h) than was free Dox (0.65h). Furthermore, tumors retained a higher amount of Dox in mice treated with the conjugate group compared to that of free Dox-treated group at the same dosage. In mice bearing 4T1 murine breast tumor allografts, the dendrimer conjugate, at a Dox concentration of 1mg/kg, was more effective than the equivalent concentration of free Dox and tumor size reduction was equivalent to that seen using 4mg/kg free Dox. We observed no severe systemic toxicity or cardiotoxicity in mice treated with the conjugate, as indicated by body weight change and heart tissue histology. These findings indicate that dODNs-DEN conjugates can be used to administer Dox with improved pharmacokinetics, lower toxicity, and an increased ability to concentrate drugs in tumors, compared with free drug, and that such conjugates are effective against tumors in vivo.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2010-09-22", "authors": ["In-HyunLee", "Mi KyungYu", "In HwaKim", "Jae-HyukLee", "Tae GwanPark", "SangyongJon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.09.008"}
{"title": "Hsp20 protects neuroblastoma cells from ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibition of apoptosis via a mechanism that involves the mitochondrial pathways.", "abstract": "Hsp20 is chaperone protein that is highly and constitutively expressed in the brain, cardiac tissue and many other organs. Recently, it is well established that Hsp20 can enhance cardiac function and render cardioprotection. However, the potential benefits of Hsp20 and its phosphorylation form action on ischemic stroke and its underlying mechanism(s) are largely unknown.To investigate whether Hsp20 exerts protective effects in vitro ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, mouse neuroblastoma cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and reoxygenation. Expression mRNA and protein levels of Hsp20 were strongly downregulated in mouse N2A cells at the 0-hour and 6-hour recovery time points following 4 hours of OGD, and returned to basal level 12 and 24 hours after OGD treatment. The ratio of phosphorylated to total Hsp20 protein was not significantly affected by OGD treatment at the 0-hour and 6-hour recovery time points following 4 hours of OGD. However, markedly higher serine phosphorylation of Hsp20 was observed 12 and 24 hours after OGD treatment. Furthermore, overexpression of Hsp20 reduced OGD-induced apoptosis by reducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. However, blockade of Hsp20 phosphorylation at Ser16 abrogated this anti-apoptotic effect.Our data demonstrate that increased Hsp20 expression in mouse N2A neuroblastoma cells protects against I/R injury, resulting in reduced apoptosis, which is by reducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. Phosphorylation of Ser16 plays an important role in its protective effect. Thus, Hsp20 may constitute a new therapeutic target for cerebral ischemic diseases.", "journal": "Current neurovascular research", "date": "2010-09-22", "authors": ["LiuwangZeng", "JieqiongTan", "ZhipingHu", "WeiLu", "BinbinYang"], "doi": "10.2174/156720210793180783"}

We tested here a new DNA vaccine encoding a combination of two leading parasite antigens, TSA-1 and Tc24, for the prevention and therapy of T. cruzi infection. Immunized Balb/c mice challenged by T. cruzi presented a significantly lower parasitemia and inflammatory cell density in the heart compared to control mice. Similarly, the therapeutic administration of the DNA vaccine was able to significantly reduce the parasitemia and inflammatory reaction in acutely infected Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice, and reduced cardiac tissue inflammation in chronically infected ICR mice. Therapeutic vaccination induced a marked increase in parasite-specific IFN\u03b3 producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the spleen as well as an increase in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the infected cardiac tissue. In addition, some effect of the DNA vaccine could still be observed in CD4-knockout C57BL/6 mice, which presented a lower parasitemia and inflammatory cell density, but not in CD8-deficient mice, in which the vaccine had no effect. These results indicate that the activation of CD8(+) T cells plays a major role in the control of the infection by the therapeutic DNA vaccine, and to a somewhat lesser extent CD4(+) T cells.

{"title": "Analysis of cardiac myosin binding protein-C phosphorylation in human heart muscle.", "abstract": "A unique feature of MyBP-C in cardiac muscle is that it has multiple phosphorylation sites. MyBP-C phosphorylation, predominantly by PKA, plays an essential role in modulating contractility as part of the cellular response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. In vitro studies indicate MyBP-C can be phosphorylated at Serine 273, 282, 302 and 307 (mouse sequence) but little is known about the level of MyBP-C phosphorylation or the sites phosphorylated in heart muscle. Since current methodologies are limited in specificity and are not quantitative we have investigated the use of phosphate affinity SDS-PAGE together with a total anti MyBP-C antibody and a range of phosphorylation site-specific antibodies for the main sites (Ser-273, -282 and -302). With these newly developed methods we have been able to make a detailed quantitative analysis of MyBP-C phosphorylation in heart tissue in situ. We have found that MyBP-C is highly phosphorylated in non-failing human (donor) heart or mouse heart; tris and tetra-phosphorylated species predominate and less than 10% of MyBP-C is unphosphorylated (0, 9.3 \u00b1 1%: 1P, 13.4 \u00b1 2.7%: 2P, 10.5 \u00b1 3.3%: 3P, 28.7 \u00b1 3.7%: 4P, 36.4 \u00b1 2.7%, n=21). Total phosphorylation was 2.7 \u00b1 0.07 mol Pi/mol MyBP-C. In contrast in failing heart and in myectomy samples from HCM patients the majority of MyBP-C was unphosphorylated. Total phosphorylation levels were 23% of normal in failing heart myofibrils (0, 60.1 \u00b1 2.8%: 1P, 27.8 \u00b1 2.8%: 2P, 4.8 \u00b1 2.0%: 3P, 3.7 \u00b1 1.2%: 4P, 2.8 \u00b1 1.3%, n=19) and 39% of normal in myectomy samples. The site-specific antibodies showed a distinctive distribution pattern of phosphorylation sites in the multiple phosphorylation level species. We found that phosphorylated Ser-273, Ser-282 and Ser-302 were all present in the 4P band of MyBP-C but none of them were significant in the 1P band, indicating that there must be at least one other site of MyBP-C phosphorylation in human heart. The pattern of phosphorylation at the three sites was not random, but indicated positive and negative interactions between the three sites. Phosphorylation at Ser-282 was not proportional to the number of sites available.

In contrast to other sarcomeric structures, eg, the Z-disc, only few M-band-specific proteins have been identified to date, and its exact molecular composition remains unclear.\nUsing a bioinformatic approach to identify novel heart- and muscle-specific genes, we found a leucine rich protein, myomasp (Myosin-interacting, M-band-associated stress-responsive protein)/LRRC39. RT-PCR and Northern and Western blot analyses confirmed a cardiac-enriched expression pattern, and immunolocalization of myomasp revealed a strong and specific signal at the sarcomeric M-band. Yeast 2-hybrid screens, as well as coimmunoprecipitation experiments, identified the C terminus of myosin heavy chain (MYH)7 as an interaction partner for myomasp. Knockdown of myomasp in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVCMs) led to a significant upregulation of the stretch-sensitive genes GDF-15 and BNP. Conversely, the expression of MYH7 and the M-band proteins myomesin-1 and -2 was found to be markedly reduced. Mechanistically, knockdown of myomasp in NRVCM led to a dose-dependent suppression of serum response factor-dependent gene expression, consistent with earlier observations linking the M-band to serum response factor-mediated signaling. Finally, downregulation of myomasp/LRRC39 in spontaneously beating engineered heart tissue constructs resulted in significantly lower force generation and reduced fractional shortening. Likewise, knockdown of the myomasp/LRRC39 ortholog in zebrafish resulted in severely impaired heart function and cardiomyopathy in vivo.\nThese findings reveal myomasp as a previously unrecognized component of an M-band-associated signaling pathway that regulates cardiomyocyte gene expression in response to biomechanical stress.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2010-09-18", "authors": ["Rainer DWill", "MatthiasEden", "SteffenJust", "ArneHansen", "AlexandraEder", "DerkFrank", "ChristianKuhn", "Thalia SSeeger", "UlrikeOehl", "StefanWiemann", "BernhardKorn", "ManfredKoegl", "WolfgangRottbauer", "ThomasEschenhagen", "Hugo AKatus", "NorbertFrey"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.222372"}

Preceding cardiogenic induction, a surge in CXCR4 chemokine receptor expression in the early stages of stem cell lineage specification coincides with the acquisition of pre-cardiac profiles. Accordingly, CXCR4 selection, in conjunction with mesoderm-specific VEGF type II receptor FLK-1 co-expression, segregates cardiogenic populations. To assess the functionality of the CXCR4 biomarker, targeted activation and disruption were here exploited in the context of embryonic stem cell-derived cardiogenesis. Implicated as a cardiogenic hub through unbiased bioinformatics analysis, induction of the CXCR4/SDF-1 receptor-ligand axis triggered enhanced beating activity in stem cell progeny. Gene expression knockdown of CXCR4 disrupted spontaneous embryoid body differentiation and blunted the expression of cardiogenic markers MEF2C, Nkx2.5, MLC2a, MLC2v, and cardiac-MHC. Exogenous SDF-1 treatment failed to rescue cardiogenic-deficient phenotype, demonstrating a requirement for CXCR4 expression in mediating SDF-1 effects.

{"title": "Mesenchymal stem cells stimulate protective genetic reprogramming of injured cardiac ventricular myocytes.", "abstract": "Since massive irreversible loss of cardiac myocytes occurs following myocardial injury, injection of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) has emerged as a promising therapeutic intervention. Despite the growing enthusiasm for this approach, the understanding of how hMSCs evoke cardiac improvement is ever more controversial. The present study critically tests hypothesis that hMSCs provide specific benefit directly to damaged ventricular myocytes. Cultures of neonatal mouse ventricular cardiac myocytes (nMCM) were subjected to two distinct acute stress protocols; incubations with either endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or toxic cytokine, IL-1\u03b2. Myocyte injury was assessed in intracellular Ca(2+) signaling assays in fluo-3-loaded nMCMs that were imaged with high temporal resolution by fluorescent microscopy. Following LPS or IL-1\u03b2 treatment there was profound myocyte injury, manifest by chaotic [Ca(2+)](i) handling, quantified as a 3- to 5-fold increase in spontaneous [Ca(2+)](i) transients. Antibody neutralization experiments reveal such damage is mediated in part by interleukin-18 and not by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Importantly, normal [Ca(2+)](i) signaling was preserved when cardiomyocytes were co-cultured with hMSCs. Since normal [Ca(2+)](i) handling was maintained in transwell cultures, where nMCMs and hMSCs were separated by a permeable membrane, a protective paracrine signaling cascade is operable. hMSCs provoke a genetic reprogramming of cardiomyocytes. LPS provokes release of TNF\u03b1 from nMCMs which is blocked by hMSCs grown in co- or transwell cultures. Consistent with cytokine release, flow cytometry analyses reveal that hMSCs also block the LPS- and IL-1\u03b2-dependent activation of cardiac transcription factor, NF-\u03baB. Importantly, hMSC-conditioned medium restores normal Ca(2+) signaling in LPS- and IL-1\u03b2-damaged nMCMs. These results reveal new evidence that hMSCs elicit protective and reparative effects on cardiac tissue through molecular reprogramming of the cardiac myocytes themselves. Thus these studies provide novel new insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic benefit of hMSCs in the setting of heart failure.

Eotaxin, which has been shown to be involved in fibrogenesis, has been demonstrated to be increased in production in cardiac macrophages. The aim of our study was to correlate myocardial fibrosis during heart transplant rejection in the rat with eotaxin/chemokine [c-c motif] ligand 11 (CCL11) expression, and with various subtypes of infiltrating cardiac MC, namely connective-type MC (CTMC) and mucosa-type MC (MMC).\nWe used tissues from 2 previous studies of ongoing acute rejection in allogeneic Brown-Norway to Lewis rat and an isogeneic Brown-Norway to Brown-Norway heterotopic heart transplantation models under cyclosporin/prednisolone immunosuppression. Collagen fibrils were stained with Masson's trichrome with myocardial fibrosis expressed as percent fibrotic area per total section area.

We investigated whether the response to verapamil is altered in experimental acute myocardial injury (AMI). Two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (230-280 g) were divided into control (n = 8) and post-AMI (n = 13). Myocardial injury was induced by 2 daily doses of 150 mg\u00b7kg(-1) isoproterenol (ISP). Subcutaneous ECG leads were implanted, and 2 days following the second injection, each rat was dosed with 25 mg\u00b7kg(-1) verapamil per os, and an ECG was recorded over 4 h after dosing. The animals were euthanized and blood samples collected for analysis of inflammatory mediators and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Cardiac L-type calcium channel (Ca(v)1.2) protein levels and mRNA were determined by Western blot and real-time PCR, respectively. ISP treatment caused a 170% increase in serum cTnI, J point elevation, R wave amplitude reduction and Q wave development. Cardiac injury caused a 75% reduction in verapamil potency by prolonging the PR interval and reducing the heart rate. Cardiac tissue injury also caused a significant reduction in the Ca(v)1.2 protein level. Verapamil response was significantly correlated with cTnI. The reduced potency of verapamil in myocardial injury appears to result from a reduction in the drug target protein Ca(v)1.2.

Recently, a new theory has been proposed, suggesting that the reverse rate-dependent mode of drug-action may be a common property of canine, rabbit, guinea pig and human cardiac tissues, and this phenomenon is based on the dependence of drug-action on baseline APD. The aim of the present work was to examine the limitations of this hypothesis by studying the APD lengthening effect of K(+) channel blockers and the APD shortening effect of Ca(2+) channel blockers during the electrical restitution process of rat ventricular action potentials. Rat ventricular muscle was chosen because it has a set of ion currents markedly different from those of other species, its APD is shorter by one order of magnitude than that of the \"plateau-forming\" larger mammals, and most importantly, its APD increases at higher heart rates - opposite to many other species. The restitution of APD was studied as a function of the diastolic interval, a parameter indicating the proximity of action potentials. It was found that drug-induced APD changes in rat myocardium are proportional with the pre-drug value of APD but not with the diastolic interval, indicating that not the proximity of consecutive action potentials, but the baseline APD itself may determine the magnitude of drug-induced APD changes.", "journal": "General physiology and biophysics", "date": "2010-09-08", "authors": ["L\u00e1szl\u00f3B\u00e1r\u00e1ndi", "G\u00e1borHarmati", "Bal\u00e1zsHorv\u00e1th", "NorbertSzentandr\u00e1ssy", "J\u00e1nosMagyar", "Andr\u00e1sVarr\u00f3", "P\u00e9ter PN\u00e1n\u00e1si", "Tam\u00e1sB\u00e1ny\u00e1sz"], "doi": "10.4149/gpb_2010_03_309"}

To study this question, we used a rabbit ventricular action potential model to simulate tissues in which a central area of contiguous myocytes susceptible to EADs or DADs was surrounded by unsusceptible tissue. In 1D tissue with normal longitudinal conduction velocity (0.55 m/s), the numbers of contiguous susceptible myocytes required for an EAD and a barely suprathreshold DAD to trigger a propagating action potential were 70 and 80, respectively. In 2D tissue, these numbers increased to 6940 and 7854, and in 3D tissue to 696,910 and 817,280. These numbers were significantly decreased by reduced gap junction conductance, simulated fibrosis, reduced repolarization reserve and heart failure electrical remodeling. In conclusion, the source-sink mismatch in well-coupled cardiac tissue powerfully protects the heart from arrhythmias due to sporadic afterdepolarizations. Structural and electrophysiological remodeling decrease these numbers significantly but still require synchronization mechanisms for EADs and DADs to overcome the robust protective effects of source-sink mismatch.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2010-09-08", "authors": ["YuanfangXie", "DaisukeSato", "AlanGarfinkel", "ZhilinQu", "James NWeiss"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2010.06.042"}

Following production of a MRL mouse ear hole, 2mm in diameter, a structure rapidly forms at the injury site that resembles the amphibian blastema at a limb amputation site during limb regeneration. We have isolated MRL blastemal cells (MRL-B) from this structure and adapted them to culture. We demonstrate by RT-PCR that even after continuous culturing of these cells they maintain expression of several progenitor cell markers, including DLK (Pref-1), and Msx-1. We have isolated the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by these MRL-B cells using a new non-proteolytic method and studied the biological activities of this cell-free ECM. Multiplex microELISA analysis of MRL-B cell-free ECM vs. cells revealed selective enrichment of growth factors such as bFGF, HGF and KGF in the matrix compartment.

{"title": "Potential of garlic and its active constituent, S-allyl cysteine, as antihypertensive and cardioprotective in presence of captopril.", "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of fresh garlic homogenate (FGH) and its bioactive sulphur compound S-allyl cysteine sulphoxide (SACS) in potentiating antihypertensive and cardioprotective activities of captopril in rats. SACS was extracted from the fresh garlic using ion exchange resins with yield of 890 mg/kg garlic. The dose of SACS was calculated based on the amount of SACS extracted from 125 to 250 mg of FGH. Albino rats weighing 150-200 g were fed with 10% fructose in fluid for 3 weeks for induction of hypertension and subsequently administered FGH (125 and 250 mg/kg, p.o.) or SACS (0.111 and 0.222 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for the next 3 weeks in their respective groups. In CAP alone and interactive groups (GH+CAP; SACS+CAP), captopril 30 mg/kg was given during sixth week of 10% fructose in fluid. At the end of drug treatment, animals were given isoproterenol 175 mg/kg subcutaneously for two consecutive days. Additionally, varying concentrations of SACS (4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 ng), CAP (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 ng) and their combination (4:1) were checked for fall in blood pressure in hypertensive rats (10% fructose in fluid without pretreatment) as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting activity using guinea pig ileum. An isobolographic analysis was used to characterise the interaction between SACS and CAP for fall in blood pressure and ACE inhibiting evaluations. Administration of captopril, low and high doses of FGH (125, 250 mg/kg), either alone or together showed fall in fluid intake and body weight. The combined therapy of FGH 250 mg/kg and CAP was more effective in reducing systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose. The SOD and catalase activities in heart tissue were significantly elevated in groups treated with FGH, SACS, CAP, FGH+CAP and SACS+CAP. Further, combined therapy of FGH 250 mg/kg and CAP caused significant fall in LDH and CK-MB activities in serum and elevation in heart tissue homogenate. SACS in low dose was less effective than low dose of FGH; similarly, high dose of FGH was more efficacious than high dose of SACS. Corroborating with this, combined therapy of garlic (250 mg/kg) with CAP demonstrated higher synergistic action than combination of SACS (0.222 mg/kg) with CAP suggesting the role of additional bioactive constituents apart from SACS, responsible for therapeutic efficacy of garlic. Moreover, combination of SACS and CAP exerted super-additive (synergistic) interaction with respect to fall in blood pressure and ACE inhibition.

{"title": "Paracrine mechanisms of stem cell reparative and regenerative actions in the heart.", "abstract": "Stem cells play an important role in restoring cardiac function in the damaged heart. In order to mediate repair, stem cells need to replace injured tissue by differentiating into specialized cardiac cell lineages and/or manipulating the cell and molecular mechanisms governing repair. Despite early reports describing engraftment and successful regeneration of cardiac tissue in animal models of heart failure, these events appear to be infrequent and yield too few new cardiomyocytes to account for the degree of improved cardiac function observed. Instead, mounting evidence suggests that stem cell mediated repair takes place via the release of paracrine factors into the surrounding tissue that subsequently direct a number of restorative processes including myocardial protection, neovascularization, cardiac remodeling, and differentiation. The potential for diverse stem cell populations to moderate many of the same processes as well as key paracrine factors and molecular pathways involved in stem cell-mediated cardiac repair will be discussed in this review.

{"title": "\u03b1-Galactosylceramide protects mice from lethal Coxsackievirus B3 infection and subsequent myocarditis.", "abstract": "Myocarditis is an inflammation of the myocardium which often follows virus infections. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), as a marker of the enterovirus group, is one of the most important infectious agents of virus-induced myocarditis. Using a CVB3-induced myocarditis model, we show that injection \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer), a ligand for invariant natural killer (NK) T (iNK T) cells, can protect the mice from viral myocarditis. After the systemic administration of \u03b1-GalCer in CVB3 infected mice, viral transcription and titres in mouse heart, sera and spleen were reduced, and the damage to the heart was ameliorated. This is accompanied by a better disease course with an improved weight loss profile. Compared with untreated mice, \u03b1-GalCer-treated mice showed high levels of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-4, and reduced proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their cardiac tissue. Anti-viral immune response was up-regulated by \u03b1-GalCer. Three days after CVB3 infection, \u03b1-GalCer-administered mice had larger spleens. Besides NK\u2003T cells, more macrophages and CD8(+) T cells were found in these spleens. Upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin, splenocytes from \u03b1-GalCer-treated mice produced significantly more cytokines [including IFN-\u03b3, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-4 and IL-10] than those from untreated mice. These data suggest that administration of \u03b1-GalCer during acute CVB3 infection is able to protect the mice from lethal myocarditis by local changes in inflammatory cytokine patterns and enhancement of anti-viral immune response at the early stage. \u03b1-GalCer is a potential candidate for viral myocarditis treatment.

Yet, current pre-clinical concepts have not reached translational applicability, and successes are only episodic. This review will provide a brief overview of the latest concepts and breakthroughs in the emerging field of cardiac adult stem cell-based tissue engineering, and discuses the challenges that this field needs to overcome to achieve realistic therapeutic translation into the clinical arena.

{"title": "Analysis of mRNA from human heart tissue and putative applications in forensic molecular pathology.", "abstract": "The usefulness of post-mortem mRNA analysis and its potential applications in forensic casework is currently of interest, especially because of several factors affecting the quality of RNA samples that are not practically predictable. In fact, post-mortem RNA degradation is a complex process that has not been studied systematically. The purpose of this work is to establish whether RNA analysis from post-mortem heart tissue could be used as a forensic tool to investigate the cause of death, with special regard to those cases where a cardiac disease is suspected as the manner of death. We analysed heart tissue from 16 individuals with normal cardiac function, 9 with long post-mortem intervals (L-PMI) and 7 from organ donors with very short PMIs (S-PMIs). Right ventricle tissue was homogenised, and the RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed. The resulting cDNA was used in real-time PCR reactions to quantify the gene expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUSB), Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 (NOS3), Collagen 1 (COL1A1) and Collagen 3 (COL3A1). The percentage of samples with high-quality RNA was higher in samples with S-PMI (7 out of 7) than in samples with L-PMI (4 out of 9, p<0.05). No differences in PMI time or cause of exitus were found between samples with degraded or non-degraded RNA in the L-PMI group. When comparing mRNA levels in samples with non-degraded RNA, we found similar values between the L-PMI and S-PMI groups for GUSB, COL1A1 and COL3A1. The NOS3 gene expression in the L-PMI subgroup was less than half that in the S-PMI. These results suggest that high-quality mRNA can be extracted from post-mortem human hearts only in some cases. Moreover, our data show that mRNA levels are independent from the PMI, even though there are mRNAs in which the expression levels are very susceptible to ischemia times. Clear knowledge about the relationship between mRNA integrity and expression and PMI could allow the use of several mRNAs as forensic tools to contribute to the determination of the cause of death with special regard to cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "Forensic science international", "date": "2010-08-14", "authors": ["SaraPartemi", "Paola MBerne", "MontserratBatlle", "AntonioBerruezo", "LuisMont", "HelenaRiur\u00f3", "Jos\u00e9 TOrtiz", "EulaliaRoig", "Vincenzo LPascali", "RamonBrugada", "JosepBrugada", "AntonioOliva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.forsciint.2010.07.005"}

Functionally distinct T-type Ca channel isoforms can be generated by alternative splicing from each of three different T-type genes (Ca(V)3.1, Ca(V)3.2,Ca(V)3.3), although it remains to be described whether specific splice variants are associated with developmental states and pathological conditions. We aimed to identify and functionally characterize Ca(V)3.2 T-type Ca channel alternatively spliced variants from newborn animals and to compare with adult normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). DNA sequence analysis of full-length Ca(V)3.2 cDNA generated from newborn heart tissue identified ten major regions of alternative splicing, the more common variants of which were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and also subject to functional examination by whole-cell patch clamp. The main findings are that: (1) cardiac Ca(V)3.2 T-type Ca channels are subject to considerable alternative splicing, (2) there is preferential expression of Ca(V)3.2(-25) splice variant channels in newborn rat heart with a developmental shift in adult heart that results in approximately equal levels of expression of both (+25) and (-25) exon variants, (3) in the adult stage of hypertensive rats there is a both an increase in overall Ca(V)3.2 expression and a shift towards expression of Ca(V)3.2(+25) containing channels as the predominant form, and (4) alternative splicing confers a variant-specific voltage-dependent facilitation of Ca(V)3.2 channels.

{"title": "A macro finite-element formulation for cardiac electrophysiology simulations using hybrid unstructured grids.", "abstract": "Electrical activity in cardiac tissue can be described by the bidomain equations whose solution for large-scale simulations still remains a computational challenge. Therefore, improvements in the discrete formulation of the problem, which decrease computational and/or memory demands are highly desirable. In this study, we propose a novel technique for computing shape functions of finite elements (FEs). The technique generates macro FEs (MFEs) based on the local decomposition of elements into tetrahedral subelements with linear shape functions. Such an approach necessitates the direct use of hybrid meshes (HMs) composed of different types of elements. MFEs are compared to classic standard FEs with respect to accuracy and RAM memory usage under different scenarios of cardiac modeling, including bidomain and monodomain simulations in 2-D and 3-D for simple and complex tissue geometries. In problems with analytical solutions, MFEs displayed the same numerical accuracy of standard linear triangular and tetrahedral elements. In propagation simulations, conduction velocity and activation times agreed very well with those computed with standard FEs. However, MFEs offer a significant decrease in memory requirements. We conclude that HMs composed of MFEs are well suited for solving problems in cardiac computational electrophysiology.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2010-08-12", "authors": ["Bernardo MRocha", "FerdinandKickinger", "Anton JPrassl", "GundolfHaase", "Edward JVigmond", "Rodrigo Weberdos Santos", "SabineZaglmayr", "GernotPlank"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2010.2064167"}
{"title": "Anisotropy of wave propagation in the heart can be modeled by a Riemannian electrophysiological metric.", "abstract": "It is well established that wave propagation in the heart is anisotropic and that the ratio of velocities in the three principal directions may be as large as v(f)v(s)v(n) approximately 4(fibers)2(sheets)1(normal). We develop an alternative view of the heart based on this fact by considering it as a non-Euclidean manifold with an electrophysiological(el-) metric based on wave velocity. This metric is more natural than the Euclidean metric for some applications, because el-distances directly encode wave propagation. We develop a model of wave propagation based on this metric; this model ignores higher-order effects like the curvature of wavefronts and the effect of the boundary, but still gives good predictions of local activation times and replicates many of the observed features of isochrones. We characterize this model for the important case of the rotational orthotropic anisotropy seen in cardiac tissue and perform numerical simulations for a slab of cardiac tissue with rotational orthotropic anisotropy and for a model of the ventricles based on diffusion tensor MRI scans of the canine heart. Even though the metric has many slow directions, we show that the rotation of the fibers leads to fast global activation. In the diffusion tensor MRI-based model, with principal velocities 0.25051 m/s, we find examples of wavefronts that eventually reach speeds up to 0.9 m/s and average velocities of 0.7 m/s.

SMA is the most common inherited motor neuron disease and occurs in approximately 1:6000 live births. The gene responsible for SMA is called Survival Motor Neuron-1 (SMN1). Interestingly, a human-specific copy gene is present on the same region of chromosome 5q, called SMN2. Motor neurons are the primary tissue affected in SMA. Although it is clear that SMA is a neurodegenerative disease, there are clinical reports that suggest that other tissues contribute to the overall phenotype, especially in the most severe forms of the disease. In severe SMA cases, a growing number of congenital heart defects have been identified upon autopsy. The most common defect is a developmental defect referred to as hypoplastic left heart. The purpose of this report is to determine whether cardiac tissue is altered in SMA models and whether this could contribute to SMA pathogenesis. Here we identified early-stage developmental defects in a severe model of SMA. Additionally, pathological responses including fibrosis and oxidative stress markers were observed shortly after birth in a less severe model of disease. Similarly, functional differences were detected between wild-type and early-stage SMA animals.

In the untreated rats, the GFP-positive cells were not seen after day 7. In drug-treated rats, GFP-positive vessels matured over time, accumulated erythrocytes, were supported by host smooth muscle cells, and formed chimeric vessels that survived until day 60. This resulted in the formation of a densely vascularized, perfusable network by day 60.

Myocardial sections with 2-mm thickness were decellularized using 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and then reseeded with differentiated bone marrow mononuclear cells. We found that thorough decellularization could be achieved after 2.5 weeks of treatment. Reseeded cells were found to infiltrate and proliferate in the tissue constructs. Immunohistological staining studies showed that the reseeded cells maintained cardiomyocyte-like phenotype and possible endothelialization was found in locations close to vasculature channels, indicating angiogenesis potential. Both biaxial and uniaxial mechanical testing showed a stiffer mechanical response of the acellular myocardial scaffolds; however, tissue extensibility and tensile modulus were found to recover in the constructs along with the culture time, as expected from increased cellular content.

These limitations include the limited number of electrodes and unstable recordings. Optical mapping was developed to increase the temporal and spatial resolution over traditional electrode recordings and ultimately the accuracy of the data analysis.

The fluorescence changes of the dye have a linear relationship to the action potential changes of the cell membrane. These fluorescent changes can then be detected by a photodiode array, a CCD camera or a CMOS camera.

{"title": "In vitro electrophysiological mapping of stem cells.", "abstract": "The use of stem cells for cardiac regeneration is a revolutionary, emerging research area. For proper function as replacement tissue, stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (SC-CMs) must electrically couple with the host cardiac tissue. Electrophysiological mapping techniques, including microelectrode array (MEA) and optical mapping, have been developed to study cardiomyocytes and cardiac cell monolayers, and these can be applied to study stem cells and SC-CMs. MEA recordings take extracellular measurements at numerous points across a small area of cell cultures and are used to assess electrical propagation during cell culture. Optical mapping uses fluorescent dyes to monitor electrophysiological changes in cells, most commonly transmembrane potential and intracellular calcium, and can be easily scaled to areas of different sizes. The materials and methods for MEA and optical mapping are presented here, together with detailed notes on their use, design, and fabrication. We also provide examples of voltage and calcium maps of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (mESC-CMs), obtained in our laboratory using optical mapping techniques.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2010-08-04", "authors": ["SethWeinberg", "Elizabeth ALipke", "LeslieTung"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-60761-705-1_14"}

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess unique properties that may make them a better option for cardiac repair than other cell types. Unlike other adult stem cells, they appear to escape allorecognition by the immune system and they have immune-modulating properties, thus making it possible to consider them for use as an allogeneic cell therapy product.

{"title": "Umbilical cord blood stem cells for myocardial repair and regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality with substantial economic cost. There remains a need for therapeutic improvement for patients refractory to revascularization and those who redevelop occlusions following revascularization. Early evidence linked age-associated reductions in the levels of circulating marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), characterized by expression of early HSC markers CD133 and CD34, with the occurrence of cardiovascular events and associated death. Heart tissue has the endogenous ability to regenerate through the activation of resident cardiac stem cells or through recruitment of a stem cell population from other tissues, such as bone marrow. A number of clinical trials have utilized patient-derived autologous bone marrow-derived cells or whole BM uncultured mononuclear cells (MNC) infused or injected locally to augment angiogenesis. In most cases of treating animal models with human cells, the frequency of stem cell engraftment, the subsequent number of newly generated cardiomyocytes and vascular cells, and the augmentation of endogenous microvascular collateralization, either by deposition, transdifferentiation, and/or by cell fusion, appear to be too low to explain the significant cardiac improvement. Initially, it was hypothesized that cell therapy may work by cell replacement mechanisms, but recent evidence suggests alternatively that cell therapy works by providing trophic support to the injured tissues. An alternative hypothesis is that the transplanted stem cells release soluble cytokines and growth factors (i.e., paracrine factors) that function in a paracrine fashion, contributing to cardiac repair and regeneration by inducing cytoprotection and neovascularization. Another hypothesis which may also be operative is that cell therapy may mediate endogenous regeneration by the activation of resident cardiac stem cell. Well-established clinical trials have used cord blood for the treatment of hematological malignances (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma) and nonmalignancies (e.g., in born errors of metabolism, sickle cells anemia, autoimmune diseases), but further advances in other areas of regenerative medicine (e.g., cardiac repair) will directly benefit with the use of cord blood. These clinical outcomes demonstrate that effector cells may be delivered by an allogeneic approach, where strict tissue matching may not be necessary and treatment may be achieved by making use of the trophic support capability of cell therapy and not by a cell replacement mechanism.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2010-08-04", "authors": ["NicholasGreco", "Mary JLaughlin"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-60761-705-1_3"}

Inhibition of downstream transcription factors and gene modifiers of these components are key mediators of hypertensive response. Histone acetylases/deacetylases can modulate the gene expression of these hypertrophic and hypertensive components. Therefore, we hypothesized that long-term inhibition of histone deacetylase with valproic acid might attenuate hypertrophic and hypertensive responses by modulating reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines in SHR rats. Seven-week-old SHR and WKY rats were used in this study. Following baseline blood pressure measurement, rats were administered valproic acid in drinking water (0.71% wt/vol) or vehicle, with pressure measured weekly thereafter. Another set of rats were treated with hydralazine (25 mg/kg per day orally) to determine the pressure-independent effects of HDAC inhibition on hypertension. Following 20 weeks of treatment, heart function was measured using echocardiography, rats were euthanized, and heart tissue was collected for measurement of total reactive oxygen species, as well as proinflammatory cytokine, cardiac hypertrophic, and oxidative stress gene and protein expressions. Blood pressure, proinflammatory cytokines, hypertrophic markers, and reactive oxygen species were increased in SHR versus WKY rats. These changes were decreased in valproic acid-treated SHR rats, whereas hydralazine treatment only reduced blood pressure. These data indicate that long-term histone deacetylase inhibition, independent of the blood pressure response, reduces hypertrophic, proinflammatory, and hypertensive responses by decreasing reactive oxygen species and angiotensin II type1 receptor expression in the heart, demonstrating the importance of uncontrolled histone deacetylase activity in hypertension.", "journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "date": "2010-08-04", "authors": ["Jeffrey PCardinale", "SrinivasSriramula", "RomainPariaut", "AnuradhaGuggilam", "NithyaMariappan", "Carrie MElks", "JosephFrancis"], "doi": "10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.154567"}

Samples from four native hearts coming from young brain-dead donors, which for technical reason were not used for transplants, were studied. Dopamine receptors were revealed by immunochemistry technique and immunoblot analysis. Morphometrical quantification of the density of each receptor subtype was performed by an image analyzer. Our results demonstrate that only four subtypes of dopamine receptors can be found in cardiac tissues: D1, D2, D4, and D5. These dopamine receptors have been detected in endocardium, myocardium, and epicardium. D1 receptors were stored primarily in the epicardial layer. Dopamine receptors are distributed in the wall of both atria and ventricles, and its transmural gradient can be described in the wall of the human heart. Sections of atria and ventricles exposed to antidopamine receptor antibodies showed fluorescent-positive reaction in the epicardium, myocardium and endocardium. D4 receptor immune reactivity was remarkably less intense than D2 receptor immune reactivity. All the subtypes of dopamine receptors are in close relationships with all cardiac structures.

{"title": "Severe, short-term food restriction improves cardiac function following ischemia/reperfusion in perfused rat hearts.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to clarify the characteristics of improved ischemic tolerance induced by severe, short-term food restriction in isolated, perfused rat hearts. Male Wistar (8 week-old) rats were given a food intake equivalent to a 70% reduction on the food intake of ad-libitum fed rats for 11 days (FR group and AL group, respectively). After this period, hearts were isolated and perfused in the Langendorff mode, and subjected to 20 min of global ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Although the coronary flow rate in the FR group (63.0 +/- 3.1 ml/min/g dry weight) was higher than that in the AL group (47.1 +/- 1.3 ml/min/g dry weight) during preischemic perfusion, the lactate release into the coronary effluent and absolute values of +dP/dt and -dP/dt in the FR group (2422 +/- 161 and -1282 +/- 51) were inversely lower than in the AL group (2971 +/- 156 and -1538 +/- 74, respectively). An increase in ischemic contracture was suppressed in the FR group. Following reperfusion, cardiac function, high-energy phosphate content, and intracellular pH, as measured by 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, had recovered to a much greater degree in the FR group than in the AL group. The serum T3 level was significantly lower in the FR group (2.7 +/- 0.1 pg/ml) than in the AL group (3.6 +/- 0.1 pg/ml), and the levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, insulin, and glucose were also significantly lower in the FR group than in the AL group. The protein expressions of myocyte enhancer factor 2A, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase, and phospholamban in the cardiac tissue were higher in the FR group than in the AL group.

{"title": "Resveratrol improves left ventricular diastolic relaxation in type 2 diabetes by inhibiting oxidative/nitrative stress: in vivo demonstration with magnetic resonance imaging.", "abstract": "Resveratrol is a natural phytophenol that exhibits cardioprotective effects. This study was designed to elucidate the mechanisms by which resveratrol protects against diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction. Normal control (m-Lepr(db)) mice and type 2 diabetic (Lepr(db)) mice were treated with resveratrol orally for 4 wk. In vivo MRI showed that resveratrol improved cardiac function by increasing the left ventricular diastolic peak filling rate in Lepr(db) mice. This protective role is partially explained by resveratrol's effects in improving nitric oxide (NO) production and inhibiting oxidative/nitrative stress in cardiac tissue. Resveratrol increased NO production by enhancing endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression and reduced O(2)(\u00b7-) production by inhibiting NAD(P)H oxidase activity and gp91(phox) mRNA and protein expression. The increased nitrotyrosine (N-Tyr) protein expression in Lepr(db) mice was prevented by the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) inhibitor 1400W. Resveratrol reduced both N-Tyr and iNOS expression in Lepr(db) mice. Furthermore, TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and protein expression, as well as NF-\u03baB activation, were reduced in resveratrol-treated Lepr(db) mice. Both Lepr(db) mice null for TNF-\u03b1 (db(TNF-)/db(TNF-) mice) and Lepr(db) mice treated with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor MG-132 showed decreased NAD(P)H oxidase activity and iNOS expression as well as elevated eNOS expression, whereas m-Lepr(db) mice treated with TNF-\u03b1 showed the opposite effects. Thus, resveratrol protects against cardiac dysfunction by inhibiting oxidative/nitrative stress and improving NO availability. This improvement is due to the role of resveratrol in inhibiting TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation, therefore subsequently inhibiting the expression and activation of NAD(P)H oxidase and iNOS as well as increasing eNOS expression in type 2 diabetes.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Nature Materials 7 (12), 1003-1010] was analyzed. Specifically, 2D finite element (FE) models of the ALH unit cell (periodic boundary conditions) and tessellations (kinematic uniform boundary conditions) were utilized to determine a representative volume element (RVE) and to retrospectively predict the elastic effective stiffnesses. An RVE of 90 ALH unit cells (\u22433.18\u00d74.03mm) was found, indicating that previous experimental uni-axial test samples were mechanically representative. For ALH scaffolds microfabricated from PGS cured 7.5h at 160\u00b0C, FE predicted effective stiffnesses in the two orthogonal material directions (0.081\u00b10.012 and 0.033\u00b10.005MPa) matched published experimental data (0.083\u00b10.004 and 0.031\u00b10.002MPa) within 2.4% and 6.4%. Of potential use as a design criterion, model predicted global strain amplifications were lower in ALH (0.54 and 0.34) versus rectangular honeycomb (1.19 and 0.74) scaffolds, appearing to be inversely correlated with previously measured strains-to-failure. Important in matching the anisotropic mechanical properties of native cardiac muscle, FE predicted ALH scaffolds with 50\u03bcm wide PGS struts to be maximally anisotropic.

Recent studies have shown that EPO has cytoprotective effects in a wide variety of tissues, including the heart, by preventing apoptosis. However, EPO also has undesirable effects, such as thrombogenesis. In the present study, we investigated whether a helix B-surface peptide (HBSP), a nonerythropoietic, tissue-protective peptide mimicking the 3D structure of erythropoietin, protects cardiomyocytes from apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, HBSP clearly inhibited apoptosis (approximately 80%) induced by TNF-alpha, which was comparable with the effect of EPO, and activated critical signaling pathways of cell survival, including Akt, ERK1/2, and STAT3. Among these pathways, Akt was shown to play an essential role in HBSP-induced prevention of apoptosis, as assessed by using a small interfering RNA approach. In the dilated cardiomyopathic hamster (J2N-k), whose cardiac tissues diffusely expressed TNF-alpha, HBSP also inhibited apoptosis (approximately 70%) and activated Akt in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the levels of serum creatine kinase activity and of cardiac expression of atrial natriuretic peptide, a marker of chronic heart failure, were down-regulated in animals treated with HBSP. These data demonstrate that HBSP protects cardiomyocytes from apoptosis and leads to a favorable outcome in failing hearts through an Akt-dependent pathway.

The mice in CVMC model group were infected with coxsackievirus B(3) (CVB(3)) on days 0, 14 and 28 to establish CVMC model. The volume of CVB(3) suspension was 0.20 ml, 0.25 ml and 0.30 ml, whose 50% tissue culture infection dose was 10(9) respectively. The mice in the normal control group 1 and 2 were given normal saline of volumes equal to those of viral suspension given to the model group at the same time points. Echocardiography and collagen specific picrosirius red staining were performed to evaluate the CVMC model on day 42 for the mice of the normal control group 1 and 8 mice of CVMC model group. The remaining mice in CVMC model group were randomly divided into CVMC control group, captopril group and oxymatrine group on day 42. From then on, the mice in captopril group and oxymatrine group were treated with captopril or oxymatrine at the dose of 100 mg/kg, by gavage once a day for 28 days, and meanwhile the mice in CVMC control group and the normal control group were given equal-volume normal saline by gastric gavage every day, for 28 days successively. All these mice were sacrificed on day 70. Heart tissue slices were stained with collagen specific picrosirius red and the collagen volume fraction (CVF) was calculated with image analysis software. The expressions of AngII and TGF-beta1 were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.\nCompared with normal group 1, the left ventricular end-diastolic internal diameters, left ventricular end-systolic internal diameters and heart rates were significantly increased in CVMC model group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively), ejection fractions, fractional shortenings and peak velocity of aorta were all significantly decreased in CVMC model group (P < 0.01 for all comparisons), and CVF levels were significantly increased in CVMC group (P < 0.01) on day 42.

Multidimensional chromatography techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for the large-scale analysis of such complex samples as biological samples. In order to evaluate these separation techniques, microgram quantities of protein extracted from mouse heart tissue were fractionated by four different chromatographic methods. Regarding peptide-level fractionation, the first dimension of separation was performed with high-pH reversed-phase chromatography (pH-RP) and strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX). Regarding protein-level fractionation, C(8) protein reversed-phase (C(8) -RP Prot) and high-recovery protein reversed-phase (hr-RP Prot) were used instead. The second dimension consisted of a reversed-phase nano-HPLC on-Chip coupled to an electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer for tandem mass spectrometric analysis. The performance and relative fractionation efficiencies of each technique were assessed by comparing the total number of proteins identified by each method. The peptide-level pH-RP and the hr-RP Prot protein-level separations were the best methods, identifying 1338 and 1303 proteins, respectively.

{"title": "Caffeine-induced Ca(2+) signaling as an index of cardiac progenitor cells differentiation.", "abstract": "Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), migrating from heart tissue, in culture aggregate to form cardiospheres (CSs) in which replication and cardiogenic differentiation occur. However, the frequency of functional differentiation in CSs and the role of cell clustering in supporting it remain to be established. The aim of our study is to quantify differentiation of a muscle-type Ca(2+) release mechanism in CS-derived cells, correlate it with cardiac differentiation markers and test its dependency on CS formation. CPCs migrating from murine cardiac explants were studied prior and after CSs formation (Pre-CS and Post-CS). Inducibility of RyR- and IP3-R-mediated Ca(2+) transients in individual cells was tested by exposure to caffeine and ATP, respectively; expression of cardiac and non-cardiac lineage markers was assessed. Caffeine responsiveness was negligible in Pre-CS cells and increased by 7.5 fold in Post-CS cells (3.6 vs. 26.9%; p < 0.05), and was closely correlated with activation of the cardiac TnI gene promoter. ATP-induced responses, frequent in Pre-CS (86%), were slightly increased in Post-CS cells (94%; p < 0.05). Expression of cardiac-specific Ca(2+)-handling proteins (Cav1.2, NCX1, RyR2, SERCA2a) was either limited to the Post-CS stage, or markedly enhanced. CS beating was infrequent, but its pharmacology was compatible with cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Expression of non-cardiac lineage was low in general, and similar between Pre- and Post-CS cells. Culture conditions inhibiting CSs formation prevented the increase in caffeine responders. In conclusion, clustering in CSs leads to the induction of a muscle-specific functional response in about 30% of CPCs; this is accompanied by development of a cardiac-specific expression pattern.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2010-07-24", "authors": ["CAltomare", "LBarile", "SMarangoni", "MRocchetti", "MAlemanni", "GMostacciuolo", "AGiacomello", "EMessina", "AntonioZaza"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-010-0111-6"}

The adverse microenvironment in acute myocardial infarction, however, is considered a deleterious factor for MSC transplantation and cell survival. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is an inflammatory mediator produced during ischemia that may affect the survival of MSCs. In this study, we investigated the enhancement of MSC survival by transfecting cells with the TNF receptor (TNFR) gene, leading to the overproduction of TNFR and the binding of TNF-alpha. Rats with acute myocardial infarction, induced by the occlusion of the left coronary artery, were transplanted with MSC or MSC-TNFR. After 2 weeks of acute myocardial infarction, cardiac function was assessed. Engrafted MSC survival and localization of TNF-alpha protein in infarction myocardium were evaluated. The levels of TNF-alpha and TNFR in the infarction zone were assessed. The results indicate that MSC-TNFR transplantation (1) improved left ventricular function; (2) enhanced engrafted MSC survival in the infarcted myocardium; (3) attenuated the level of TNF-alpha in serum and cardiac tissue; and (4) increased TNFR protein production in the infarcted myocardium. Our results showed that MSC modified by the TNFR gene improved cell viability and thereby has the potential to improve the efficiency of MSC transplantation therapy in the ischemic heart.", "journal": "Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire", "date": "2010-07-24", "authors": ["CuiyuBao", "JunGuo", "MinZheng", "YanChen", "GuoshengLin", "MingYanHu"], "doi": "10.1139/O10-018"}

There are various treatment options available, but the growing field of regenerative therapy offers promise to restore or replace tissue lost in those with either congenital or acquired cardiac defects. Stem cells have many potential properties, but they need multiple discussed qualities to succeed in this field such as ease of harvest and multiplication, and most importantly minimal ethical concerns. There are multiple cell types available and one of the challenges will be to find the most appropriate cell type for cardiac regeneration. Cardiac tissue engineering is being explored using both in vitro and in vivo techniques. In vitro methods are primarily limited in terms of the vascularisation and size of the construct. In vivo engineered constructs overcome these limitations in early models, but they are still not ready for human trials.

Localization of apelin and its receptor in coronary artery was determined using immunohistochemistry.\nApelin receptor density was significantly decreased in left ventricle from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or ischaemic heart disease compared with controls, but apelin peptide levels remained unchanged. Apelin was up-regulated in human atherosclerotic coronary artery and this additional peptide localized to the plaque, colocalizing with markers for macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Apelin potently constricted human coronary artery.\nWe have detected changes in the apelin/APJ system in human diseased cardiac and vascular tissue. The decrease in receptor density in heart failure may limit the positive inotropic actions of apelin, contributing to contractile dysfunction.

{"title": "Regulator of G protein signaling 5 protects against cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis during biomechanical stress of pressure overload.", "abstract": "The development of cardiac hypertrophy in response to increased hemodynamic load and neurohormonal stress is initially a compensatory response that may eventually lead to ventricular dilation and heart failure. Regulator of G protein signaling 5 (Rgs5) is a negative regulator of G protein-mediated signaling by inactivating Galphaq and Galphai, which mediate actions of most known vasoconstrictors. Previous studies have demonstrated that Rgs5 expresses among various cell types within mature heart and showed high levels of Rgs5 mRNA in monkey and human heart tissue by Northern blot analysis. However, the critical role of Rgs5 on cardiac remodeling remains unclear. To specifically determine the role of Rgs5 in pathological cardiac remodeling, we used transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of human Rgs5 gene and Rgs5-/- mice. Our results demonstrated that the transgenic mice were resistant to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis through inhibition of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling, whereas the Rgs5-/- mice displayed the opposite phenotype in response to pressure overload. These studies indicate that Rgs5 protein is a crucial component of the signaling pathway involved in cardiac remodeling and heart failure.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2010-07-21", "authors": ["HongliangLi", "ChengweiHe", "JinhuaFeng", "YanZhang", "QizhuTang", "ZhouyanBian", "XueBai", "HengZhou", "HongJiang", "Scott PHeximer", "MuQin", "HeHuang", "Peter PLiu", "CongxinHuang"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1008397107"}

Current models range from single ion channels, through very complex models of individual cardiac cells, to geometrically and anatomically detailed models of the electrical activity in whole ventricles. A critical issue for model developers is how to choose parameters that allow the model to faithfully reproduce observed physiological effects without over-fitting. In this paper, we discuss the use of a parametric modelling toolkit, called Nimrod, that makes it possible both to explore model behaviour as parameters are changed and also to tune parameters by optimizing model output. Importantly, Nimrod leverages computers on the Grid, accelerating experiments by using available high-performance platforms.

{"title": "Probe Reports from the NIH Molecular Libraries Program", "abstract": "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets that serves to influence heart rate, coronary artery caliber, endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity and lymphocyte recirculation through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. S1P3 receptor couples promiscuously to Gi, Gq, and G12/13 proteins, and its tissue distribution is widespread. Bradycardia and hypertension are clearly associated with S1P3 activation and its expression patterns in cardiac tissue. S1P3 on dendritic cells has been identified as a major exacerbating factor for mortality during sepsis by playing a role in the critical linkage of inflammation and coagulation pathways downstream of the thrombin cascade. Understanding the contributions of the individual S1P receptors has been limited by the unavailability of selective modulators for the 5 receptor subtypes. In the pilot phase of the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network (MLPCN), The Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (SRIMSC) reported four low micromolar agonist probes for S1P3: ML003, ML004, ML005 and ML006. The current report describes the development of ML249, a submicromolar allosteric agonist probe for S1P3. ML249 resulted from high-throughput screening using a cell-based assay employing a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P3 receptor, nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct, and the G\u03b116 pathway coupling protein, followed by medicinal chemistry efforts. ML249 activates S1P3 receptor with an EC50 of 72.3 nM\u2013132 nM, and is inactive as an agonist against other members of the receptor family S1P1 (EC50 >10 \u03bcM), S1P2 (EC50 >50 \u03bcM), S1P4 (EC50 >50 \u03bcM), and S1P5 (EC50 >25 \u03bcM). Evidence is presented showing that ML249 is an allosteric agonist; it does not compete with physiological ligand S1P for binding to S1P3. In addition, ML249 is nontoxic to U2OS cells, with a CC50 >10 \u03bcM. ML249 was submitted to Ricerca Biosciences, LLC for target profiling against a panel of receptors, transporters, and ion channels; the data suggest that compound ML249 is generally inactive against a broad array of off-targets and does not likely exert unwanted effects.

{"title": "Injectable materials for the treatment of myocardial infarction and heart failure: the promise of decellularized matrices.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death, suggesting that new therapies are needed to treat the progression of heart failure post-myocardial infarction. As cardiac tissue has a limited ability to regenerate itself, experimental biomaterial therapies have focused on the replacement of necrotic cardiomyocytes and repair of the damaged extracellular matrix. While acellular and cellular cardiac patches are applied surgically to the epicardial surface of the heart, injectable materials offer the prospective advantage of minimally invasive delivery directly into the myocardium to either replace the damaged extracellular matrix or to act as a scaffold for cell delivery. Cardiac-specific decellularized matrices offer the further advantage of being biomimetic of the native biochemical and structural matrix composition, as well as the potential to be autologous therapies. This review will focus on the requirements of an ideal scaffold for catheter-based delivery as well as highlight the promise of decellularized matrices as injectable materials for cardiac repair.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular translational research", "date": "2010-07-16", "authors": ["Jennifer MSingelyn", "Karen LChristman"], "doi": "10.1007/s12265-010-9202-x\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00413-3\n10.1056/NEJM199610173351603\n10.1007/BF00714328\n10.1016/0002-9149(78)90869-X\n10.1016/S0735-1097(87)80298-X\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.191259\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000070596.30552.8B\n10.1583/1545-1550(2002)009<0313:ETOASM>2.0.CO;2\n10.1016/j.vascn.2005.12.002\n10.1016/j.jacc.2003.06.017\n10.1056/NEJMoa055706\n10.1161/01.RES.0000173376.39447.01\n10.1038/nbt1327\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.1678\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.050\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0143\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.010\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.727420\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.04.056\n10.1089/107632704323061762\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.06.005\n10.1002/term.46\n10.1038/nbt1055\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2004.10.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.09.059\n10.1089/scd.2008.0410\n10.1089/scd.2007.0085\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.03.013\n10.1039/b401791a\n10.1163/156856204774196117\n10.1016/S0735-1097(98)00342-8\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000118496.44135.A7\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.547810\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0289\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.04.040\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.04.107\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfn009\n10.1159/000281840\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.04.055\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2009.03.003\n10.1021/cr000108x\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.1860\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00397-8\n10.1177/088532829300700402\n10.1016/S0049-3848(99)00202-9\n10.1002/path.1711680109\n10.1046/j.1460-9592.2003.00080.x\n10.1002/ijc.2910520214\n10.1016/0960-0760(93)90278-5\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000153847.47301.80\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00026-7\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.03.028\n10.1073/pnas.0602877103\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.852285\n10.1172/JCI25878\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.639831\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.718718\n10.1002/jbm.b.31099\n10.1111/j.1525-1594.2006.00186.x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.04.043\n10.1089/ten.tec.2008.0309\n10.1111/j.1525-1594.2007.00334.x\n10.1152/ajpheart.00443.2005\n10.1021/bi00291a023\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.09.013\n10.1038/nm1684\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.10.049\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.045\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0768\n10.1016/S0022-5223(95)70248-2\n10.1089/ten.2006.0306"}
{"title": "[Heart valve and myocardial tissue engineering].", "abstract": "Cardiac function, including the heart muscle and valves, can be severely altered by congenital and acquired heart diseases. Several graft materials are currently used to replace diseased cardiac tissue and valvular segments. Implantable grafts are either non-vital or can trigger an immune response which leads to graft calcification and degeneration. None of the existing grafts have the ability to remodel and grow in tandem with the physiological growth of a child and therefore require re-operation. Novel approaches such as tissue engineering have emerged as possible alternatives for cardiac reconstruction. The main concept of tissue engineering includes the use of biological and artificial scaffolds that form the shape of the organ structures for subsequent tissue replacement, which will provide absolute biocompatibility, no thrombogenicity, no teratogenicity, long-term durability and growth.Heart valve tissue engineering represents an important field especially in pediatric patients with valve pathologies. In order to create an autologous valve equivalent myofibroblasts and/or endothelial cells are seeded on specially designed scaffolds. Here we describe the different types of cell sources and different types of matrices currently used in heart valve tissue engineering. Valve manufacture is carried out in specially designed bioreactors providing physiological conditions. The number of clinical studies using tissue engineered valves is still limited; however, several promising results have already demonstrated their durability and ability to grow.Myocardial tissue engineering aims to repair, replace and regenerate damaged cardiac tissue using tissue constructs created ex vivo. Conceivable indications for clinical application of tissue engineered myocardial-implant substitutes include ischemic cardiomyopathies, as well as right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction in patients with congenital heart diseases. Therapeutic application of functional (contractile) tissue engineered heart muscle appears feasible once key issues such as identification of the suitable human cell source, large scale expansion and suitable scaffolds are solved. In addition, the present article discusses the importance of vascularization as an important prerequisite for successful bio-artificial myocardial tissue.Further experimental and clinical research on cardiovascular tissue engineering is felt to be of great importance for others as well as for us in order to create an ideal heart valve/myocardial substitute and help our patients with advanced cardiac pathologies.", "journal": "Herz", "date": "2010-07-16", "authors": ["SergheiCebotari", "IgorTudorache", "TobiasSchilling", "AxelHaverich"], "doi": "10.1007/s00059-010-3355-x"}

The method involves mapping the propagation of the electrical activation of cardiac tissue, initiated by point stimulation, via extracellular electrodes. A time-dependent bidomain model is used to simulate the electrical phenomena. The optimum set of conductivity values is achieved by minimizing the difference between the bidomain model output and the measured extracellular potential, by means of inverse techniques in parameter estimation least-squares and singular value decomposition. The method is validated with synthetic data with added random noise. Other parameters in the model such as membrane capacitance and fiber angle can also be estimated.

{"title": "Doxorubicin downregulates cell surface B7-H1 expression and upregulates its nuclear expression in breast cancer cells: role of B7-H1 as an anti-apoptotic molecule.", "abstract": "B7-H1 (PD-L1, CD274) is a T cell inhibitory molecule expressed in many types of cancer, leading to immune escape of tumor cells. Indeed, in previous reports we have shown an association of B7-H1 expression with high-risk breast cancer patients.\nIn the current study, we used immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blot techniques to investigate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the expression of B7-H1 in breast cancer cells.\nAmong tested chemotherapeutic agents, doxorubicin was the most effective in downregulating cell surface expression of B7-H1 in vitro. These results were validated in vivo in a xenograft mouse model, as well as in murine heart tissue known to constitutively express B7-H1. The doxorubicin-dependent cell surface downregulation of B7-H1 was accompanied by an upregulation of B7-H1 in the nucleus. This re-distribution of B7-H1 was concurrent with a similar translocation of phosphorylated AKT to the nucleus. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway abrogated the doxorubicin-mediated nuclear up-regulation of B7-H1, suggesting an involvement of PI3K/AKT pathway in the nuclear up-regulation of B7-H1. Interestingly, siRNA knock down of B7-H1 lead to an increase in spontaneous apoptosis, as well as doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, which indicates an anti-apoptotic role for B7-H1 in breast cancer cells. The novel discovery of B7-H1 expression in the nuclei of breast cancer cells suggests that B7-H1 has functions other than inhibition of T cells.\nOur findings explain the previously reported immunomodulatory effect of anthracyclines on cancer cells, and provide a link between immunoresistance and chemoresistance.

In this study, we measured prolidase enzyme activity in patients with idiopathic or ischemic DCM and in healthy controls, making this, to our knowledge, the first study to do so. What we found is that serumprolidase activity was significantly lower in both DCM groups relative to healthy volunteers and lower in ischemic DCM than idiopathic.

Oxytocin is reported to stimulate cardiomyogenesis of embryonic stem cells and endothelial cell proliferation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used for cardiac repair, and we elucidated the effect of oxytocin on umbilical cord derived-MSCs (UCB-MSCs). UCB-MSCs were pretreated with oxytocin (100 nM) and washed with saline prior to experiments. To evaluate their angiogenic potential and migration activity, tube formation assay and Boyden chamber assay were performed. For in vivo study, ischemia-reperfusion was induced in rats, and UCB-MSCs with or without oxytocin pretreatment were injected into the infarcted myocardium to evaluate the engraftment of injected cells. Histological and hemodynamic studies were performed. Oxytocin-treated UCB-MSCs showed a decrease in tube formation but a drastic increase in transwell migration activity. The transcription level of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 was increased in oxytocin-treated UCB-MSCs. Knock-down of MMP-2 by use of siRNA restored the tube formation, while reducing transmigration activity. In rats injected with oxytocin-treated UCB-MSCs, cardiac fibrosis and CD68 infiltration in the peri-infarct zone were reduced, whereas cell engraftment and connexin43 expression were greater than in rats injected with untreated UCB-MSCs. By contrast, angiogenesis did not differ significantly between the two groups. Cardiac contractility was higher in the group injected with oxytocin-treated UCB-MSCs than in the group injected with phosphate-buffered saline alone.

We used NMR to trace TPT dynamics, tautomerism and solvolysis products in various solvents and conditions. Chemical stability was assessed in methanol and DMSO as compared to water, and the regioselectivity of the N- and O-methylation was studied using various alkylating agents. The reaction products of quaternization of the nitrogen atom and methylation of the oxygen atom were characterized by means of ESI MS, (1)H/(13)C-HMBC and -HSQCAD NMR.

{"title": "Two-pore channels: Regulation by NAADP and customized roles in triggering calcium signals.", "abstract": "NAADP is a potent regulator of cytosolic calcium levels. Much evidence suggests that NAADP activates a novel channel located on an acidic (lysosomal-like) calcium store, the mobilisation of which results in further calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we discuss the recent identification of a family of poorly characterized ion channels (the two-pore channels) as endo-lysosomal NAADP receptors. The generation of calcium signals by these channels is likened to those evoked by depolarisation during excitation-contraction coupling in muscle. We discuss the idea that two-pore channels can mediate a trigger release of calcium which is then amplified by calcium-induced calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This is similar to the activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels and subsequent mobilisation of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium stores in cardiac tissue. We suggest that two-pore channels may physically interact with ryanodine receptors to account for more direct release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum in analogy with the conformational coupling of voltage-sensitive calcium channels and ryanodine receptors in skeletal muscle. Interaction of two-pore channels with other calcium release channels likely occurs between stores \"trans-chatter\" and possibly within the same store \"cis-chatter\". We also speculate that trafficking of two-pore channels through the endo-lysosomal system facilitates interactions with calcium entry channels. Strategic placing of two-pore channels thus provides a versatile means of generating spatiotemporally complex cellular calcium signals.", "journal": "Cell calcium", "date": "2010-07-14", "authors": ["SandipPatel", "Jonathan SMarchant", "EugenBrailoiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ceca.2010.05.001"}

Eleven specimens with hypoplastic left heart syndrome were evaluated and compared with 6 normal hearts from subjects matched for age and weight. All underwent Norwood procedure with the right ventricle becoming a systemic one, with pressure and volume overload leading to right ventricle remodeling. Transmural cardiac tissue samples from the right ventricle were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and morphometry. This is the first study to demonstrate that c-Kit-positive progenitor cells and tissue-committed stem cells (CXCR4+/CD45-) are higher in children with systemic right ventricle remodeling. We also show that the localization of cardiac progenitor and recruited CXCR4+ stem cells in the myocardium is site specific in hearts with right ventricle hypertrophy. These cells are mainly scattered in the interstitium of the epicardial layer. In contrast, myocyte proliferation is not a key process in right ventricular hypertrophy.

No statistically significant changes in mitochondrial or cytosolic superoxide dismutase levels or activities, or glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase or catalase activities were associated with estivation in any tissue, however. In contrast, during arousal from estivation, activities of several antioxidant enzymes increased in heart, hepatopancreas and foot. In heart, a rapid increase in MnSOD protein levels was observed that peaked at 2h post arousal, but no such change was observed in CuZnSOD protein levels. Glutathione peroxidase activity was upregulated at 1h post arousal and remained elevated until 8h post arousal in heart tissue. Glutathione peroxidase was also upregulated at 24h post arousal in foot tissue. Glutathione reductase activity was upregulated at 4h post arousal in heart and foot tissues whereas catalase activity showed no changes.

{"title": "Assessment of human MAPCs for stem cell transplantation and cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction in SCID mice.", "abstract": "Clinical studies suggest that transplantation of total bone marrow (BM) after myocardial infarction (MI) is feasible and potentially effective. However, focusing on a defined BM-derived stem cell type may enable a more specific and optimized treatment. Multilineage differentiation potential makes BM-derived multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) a promising stem cell pool for regenerative purposes. We analyzed the cardioregenerative potential of human MAPCs in a murine model of myocardial infarction.\nHuman MAPCs were selected by negative depletion of CD45(+)/glycophorin(+) BM cells and plated on fibronectin-coated dishes. In vitro, stem cells were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In vivo, we transplanted human MAPCs (5 \u00d7 10(5)) by intramyocardial injection after MI in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) beige mice. Six and 30 days after the surgical procedure, pressure-volume relationships were investigated in vivo. Heart tissues were analyzed immunohistochemically.\nReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments on early human MAPC passages evidenced an expression of Oct-4, a stem cell marker indicating pluripotency. In later passages, cardiac markers (Nkx2.5, GATA4, MLC-2v, MLC-2a, ANP, cTnT, cTnI,) and smooth muscle cell markers (SMA, SM22\u03b1) were expressed. Transplantation of human MAPCs into the ischemic border zone after MI resulted in an improved cardiac function at day 6 (ejection fraction, 26% vs 20%) and day 30 (ejection fraction, 30% vs 23%). Confirmation of human MAPC marker vimentin in immunohistochemistry demonstrated that human MAPC integrated in the peri-infarct region. The proliferation marker Ki67 was absent in immunohistochemistry and teratoma formation was not found, indicating no tumorous potential of transplanted human MAPCs in the tumor-sensitive SCID model.\nTransplantation of human MAPCs after MI ameliorates myocardial function, which may be explained by trophic effects of human MAPCs.

{"title": "PBSH: a new improved cardiac preservation solution in comparison with three clinically proven solutions.", "abstract": "A solution under development at our institute, based on phosphate-buffered sucrose, has shown good preservation for kidneys and livers. This work used a refined version of this solution (PBSH-phosphate-buffered sucrose for the heart) in heart preservation, comparing it to solutions already widely used (University of Wisconsin, St. Thomas's, and Celsior solutions).\nFollowing an initial washout phase and control working mode on a Langendorff system, hearts were flushed with preservation solution and after 6 hours at 4 degrees C were then reperfused for 15 minutes followed by working heart mode for a further 30 minutes. Hemodynamic parameters were measured and compared with their preischemic values and expressed as percentage recovery. Enzyme measurement came from the collection of the initial 1.5 mL of the coronary effluent after the storage period. This was to test for creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Hearts were then placed immediately into liquid nitrogen for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), lactate, and creatine phosphate (CP) testing. Spectrophotometric analysis was used to assess both the release of CPK and LDH into the coronary effluent, and the level of ATP, lactate, and CP in the frozen heart tissue.\nThese results show that hearts that are preserved in PBSH are hemodynamically as well preserved as the hearts preserved in other solutions tested and their enzyme and lactate content is lower while having higher levels of energy compounds in these hearts.\nOverall these results show that PBSH is at least as effective in cardiac preservation in the rat model of 6 hours of cold ischemia as these other widely used solutions tested.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2010-07-14", "authors": ["C LCorps", "M SAttia", "DPotts", "J P ALodge"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.02.089"}

Recently, it has been reported that chemokine receptors CXC (CXCR3) and CC (CCR5) were preferentially expressed on Th1 cells while CCR3 and CCR4 were preferentially expressed on Th2 cells. This study evaluated the mRNA expression of type 1 and type 2 chemokine and chemokine receptors in the cardiac tissue of Beagle dogs infected with distinct genetic groups of Trypanosoma cruzi (Y, Berenice-78 and ABC strains) during acute and chronic phases. To analyze the correlation between chemokine and chemokine receptors expression and the development of heart pathology, the chronic infected animals were divided into groups, according to the parasite strain and based on the degree of heart damage: cardiac and indeterminate form of Chagas disease. Our results indicated that cardiac type1/2 chemokines and their receptors were partially dependent on the genetic diversity of parasites as well as the polarization of clinical forms. Also, dogs presenting cardiac form showed lower heart tissue mRNA expression of CCL24 (type 2) and higher expression of CCL5, CCL4 and CXCR3 (type 1) when compared with those with indeterminate form of disease. Together, these data reinforce a close-relation between T. cruzi genetic population and the host specific type 1 immune response and, for the first time, we show the distribution of type 1/2 chemokines associated with the development of cardiac pathology using dogs, a well similar model to study human Chagas disease.", "journal": "Veterinary immunology and immunopathology", "date": "2010-07-14", "authors": ["Paulo M MGuedes", "Vanja MVeloso", "Andr\u00e9Talvani", "Livia FDiniz", "Ivo SCaldas", "Maria ADo-Valle-Matta", "JulianaSantiago-Silva", "EglerChiari", "Lucia M CGalv\u00e3o", "Jo\u00e3o SSilva", "Maria TBahia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.06.010"}

The aim of the study was to demonstrate cryogel scaffold potential in the field of skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue engineering. Poly-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (pHEMA)-gelatin cryogel scaffold was synthesized using cryogelation technique and such a designed material is being reported first time. Rheology study of the pHEMA-gelatin (HG) suggested that the cryogel scaffolds were stable at different temperatures and phase angle remained constant in both dry and wet state. HG cryogel was able to bear increased stress without leading to deformation. Monitoring the hydration of HG scaffold showed shift from a stiff to a more pliable material and upon continuing hydration, shear modulus remained constant with no further change observed. However, the change in phase angle <0.24 masculine indicates a gradual increase in stiffness of the material over time. Scaffold synthesised using such polymer combinations gave cells a native environment for proliferation and surface stiffness have shown to help in differentiation of the cells. Myoskeletal cell lines were cultured on these scaffolds to check the biocompatibility and cell proliferation. Alamar blue assay performed over a period of 3 weeks analysed the metabolic activity of cells which showed more than 60% increase in the total cellular activity. DNA content of cells was found to be directly related to number of cells present at a given time point and this was found to have increased by more than 50% in 3 weeks. Since in 3-D scaffold the surface area is more in comparison to 2-D, hence better cell proliferation is observed. Hoechst and DAPI staining showed tubular structure and alignment of the cells during formation of the tubules shows promising cellular response to the cryogel matrix.

The French expert review board of Nice-Saint-Paul de Vence was asked firstly to conduct a qualitative evidence-based systematic review and then to establish clinical practice guidelines for the use of post operative RT in invasive BC.\nA search to identify eligible studies was undertaken using the Medline\u00ae database. All phase III randomized trials and systematic reviews evaluating the role and modalities of RT in invasive BC were included, together with some noncontrolled studies if no randomized trials were identified. The quality and clinical relevance of the studies were evaluated to determine the level of evidence.\nThe maximum delay between surgery and RT should \u22648 weeks when chemotherapy (CT) is not indicated. This should not exceed 24 weeks when adjuvant CT is administered. Whole breast RT delivering 50 Gy in 25 fractions followed by a boost of 10-16 Gy remains the standard of care after conservative surgery (CS). In the elderly population, for certain cases presenting comorbidities associated with a limited life expectancy, RT indication (even hypofractioned) and boost delivery may be unnecessary in the light of an unfavourable risk/benefit ratio. RT technique and indications should not vary in case of neoadjuvant CT followed by CS. After total mastectomy, RT should be indicated in N+ and in N- patients with high risk of local recurrence. The experts recommend to initiate tamoxifen at the end of RT, while aromatase inhibitors could be administered either concomitantly or sequentially with RT. There is no consistent data to delay (or suspend) trastuzumab administration during RT. As for all patients, in case of concurrent RT-trastuzumab administration, reduction of cardiac tissues exposure is highly recommended. After breast reconstruction, RT should be delivered as after standard CS without boost.\nDue to significant variations in practice in the treatment of patients with BC, our group aimed to provide guidelines for clinical practice. The systematic review of the literature formed the basis of our evidence-based recommendations; however expert agreements were necessary on those subjects that are still under debate.

An animal study is conducted using rats with surgically induced myocaridal infarction (MI). In vivo fluorescence spectra at 337-nm excitation and diffuse reflectance between 400 and 900 nm are measured from the heart. Spectral acquisition is performed: 1. for normal heart tissue; 2. for the area immediately surrounding the infarct; and 3. for the infarcted tissue itself, one, two, three, and four weeks into MI development. Histological and statistical analyses are used to identify unique pathohistological features and spectral alterations associated with the investigated regions. The main alterations (p<0.05) in diffuse reflectance spectra are identified primarily between 450 and 600 nm. The dominant fluorescence alterations are increases in peak fluorescence intensity at 400 and 460 nm. The extent of these spectral alterations is related to the duration of the infarction.

The present study was designated to assess if ELF-MF applied in the magnetotherapy, affects generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in heart tissue and antioxidant capacity of plasma according to its working time. The experiments were performed on 3 groups of animals: group I - control; group II - exposed to 40 Hz, 7 mT, 30 min/day for 14 days (this field is commonly applied in magnetotherapy); group III - exposed to 40 Hz, 7 mT, 60 min/day for 14 days. Control rats were housed in a separate room without exposure to ELF-MF. Immediately after the last exposure, blood was taken from the tail vein and hearts were removed under anesthesia. The effect of the exposure to ELF-MF on oxidative stress was assessed on the basis of the measurements of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), total free sulphydryl groups (-SH groups) and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations in heart homogenates. The total antioxidant capacity of plasma was measured using ferric reducing ability method (FRAP). Exposure to ELF-MF (40 Hz, 7 mT, 30 min/day for 2 weeks) did not significantly alter tissue TBARS, H(2)O(2), total free -SH groups, reduced glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant capacity of plasma. By contrast, ELF-MF with the same frequency and induction but used for 60 min/day for 14 days caused significant increase in TBARS and H(2)O(2) concentration (P<0.01) and decrease in the concentration of GSH (P<0.05) and total free -SH groups in heart homogenates. Moreover, exposure of rats to ELF-MF (40 Hz, 7 mT, 60 min/day for 2 weeks) resulted in the decrease of plasma antioxidant capacity.

In the second group of experiments without I/R, rats were divided into two treatment groups: control group and FLNT group. The results indicated that myocardial infarct size and the levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in the sera of the I/R FLNT group were significantly lower and the level of nitric oxide molecule and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase were significantly elevated in the heart tissue compared with I/R control group. The protein expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in heart tissue was significantly elevated in the I/R FLNT group.

There is much controversy about the cardiovascular safety of a nonselective NSAID naproxen (NAP) and its possible cardioprotective effect.\nThe study was undertaken to determine the cardiovascular effects of NAP on doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in rats.\nMale albino rats received a single i.p. injection of normal saline (normal control group) and doxorubicin (DOX) 15 mg/kg (toxic control group). Naproxen was administered alone (50 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and in combination with DOX and DOX + trimetazidine (TMZ) (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 5 days after 24 h of DOX treatment. DOX-induced cardiomyopathy was assessed in terms of increased activities of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and decreased activities of myocardial glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase, followed by transmission electron microscopy of the cardiac tissue.\nDoxorubicin significantly increased oxidative stress as evidenced by increased levels of LDH and TBARS and decreased antioxidant enzymes levels. Both biochemical and electron microscopic studies revealed that NAP itself was cardiotoxic and aggravated DOX-induced cardiomyopathy and abolished the protective effect of TMZ in rats.\nThis study indicates that NAP has the potential to worsen the situation in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Furthermore, plasma levels of BNPsp in patients with documented acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (n=25) rise to peak values ( approximately 3 times higher than the 99th percentile of the normal range) significantly earlier than the currently used biomarkers myoglobin, creatine kinase-MB, and troponin. Preliminary receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis comparing BNPsp concentrations in ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients and other patient groups was positive (area under the curve=0.97; P<0.001), suggesting that further, more rigorous studies in heterogeneous chest pain patient cohorts are warranted.\nOur results demonstrate for the first time that BNPsp exists as a distinct entity in the human circulation and could serve as a new class of circulating biomarker with the potential to accelerate the clinical diagnosis of cardiac ischemia and myocardial infarction.

{"title": "Oxygen and oxygenation in stem-cell therapy for myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is caused by deprivation of oxygen and nutrients to the cardiac tissue due to blockade of coronary artery. It is a major contributor to chronic heart disease, a leading cause of mortality in the modern world. Oxygen is required to meet the constant energy demands for heart contractility, and also plays an important role in the regulation of heart function. However, reoxygenation of the ischemic myocardium upon restoration of blood flow may lead to further injury. Controlled oxygen delivery during reperfusion has been advocated to prevent this consequence. Monitoring the myocardial oxygen concentration would play a vital role in understanding the pathological changes in the ischemic heart following myocardial infarction. During the last two decades, several new techniques have become available to monitor myocardial oxygen concentration in vivo. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry would appear to be the most promising and reliable of these techniques. EPR utilizes crystalline probes which yield a single sharp line, the width of which is highly sensitive to oxygen tension. Decreased oxygen tension results in a sharpening of the EPR spectrum, while an increase results in widening. In our recent studies, we have used EPR oximetry as a valuable tool to monitor myocardial oxygenation for several applications like ischemia-reperfusion injury, stem-cell therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The results obtained from these studies have demonstrated the importance of tissue oxygen in the application of stem-cell therapy to treat ischemic heart tissues.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the absence of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO)-derived leukotrienes on levels of cytokines, nitric oxide (NO) and iNOS expression in cardiac tissue of mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas' disease. NO is a key mediator of parasite killing in mice experimentally infected with T. cruzi, and previous studies have suggested that leukotrienes, such as LTB(4), induces NO synthesis in T. cruzi-infected macrophages and plays a relevant role in the killing of parasite in a NO-dependent manner. We therefore investigated whether leukotrienes would have a similar role in vivo in controlling the parasite burden by regulating NO activity. We have made the striking observation that absence of 5-LO-derived leukotrienes results in increased NO and IL-6 production in the plasma with a concomitant decrease in the expression of iNOS in the cardiac tissue on day 12 after T. cruzi infection. These findings indicate that endogenous leukotrienes are important regulators of NO activity in the heart and therefore influence the cardiac parasite burden without exerting a direct action on IL-6 production in the acute phase of infection with T. cruzi.", "journal": "Experimental parasitology", "date": "2010-07-06", "authors": ["CarolinaPanis", "T\u00e2nia LongoMazzuco", "Cau\u00ea Zort\u00e9a FernandesCosta", "Vanessa JacobVictorino", "Vera L\u00facia HidekoTatakihara", "Lucy MegumiYamauchi", "Sueli FumieYamada-Ogatta", "RubensCecchini", "Luiz VicenteRizzo", "PhilenoPinge-Filho"], "doi": "10.1016/j.exppara.2010.06.030"}

Sub-fractionation experiments further showed that sphingolipids are a constituent part of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, inner membrane ceramide levels were 32% lower versus whole mitochondria (45 pmol/mg protein). Three ceramide isotypes (C20-, C22-, and C24-ceramide) accounted for the lower amounts.

When d4T, 3TC or ddC were given with AZT, only ddC caused a significant further decrease in thymidine phosphorylation.\nThese results indicate that with the exception of the competition between AZT and thymidine, there was little competition for phosphorylation among and between these other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the naturally occurring deoxynucleosides in cardiac tissue and isolated heart mitochondria.", "journal": "Antiviral therapy", "date": "2010-07-01", "authors": ["Gerald WMorris", "Darcy DLaclair", "Edward EMcKee"], "doi": "10.3851/IMP1567"}
{"title": "Engineered heart tissue graft derived from somatic cell nuclear transferred embryonic stem cells improve myocardial performance in infarcted rat heart.", "abstract": "The concept of regenerating diseased myocardium by implanting engineered heart tissue (EHT) is intriguing. Yet it was limited by immune rejection and difficulties to be generated at a size with contractile properties. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is proposed as a practical strategy for generating autologous histocompatible stem (nuclear transferred embryonic stem [NT-ES]) cells to treat diseases. Nevertheless, it is controversial as NT-ES cells may pose risks in their therapeutic application. EHT from NT-ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes was generated through a series of improved techniques in a self-made mould to keep the EHTs from contraction and provide static stretch simultaneously. After 7 days of static and mechanical stretching, respectively, the EHTs were implanted to the infarcted rat heart. Four weeks after transplantation, the suitability of EHT in heart muscle repair after myocardial infarction was evaluated by histological examination, echocardiography and multielectrode array measurement. The results showed that large (thickness/diameter, 2-4 mm/10 mm) spontaneously contracting EHTs was generated successfully. The EHTs, which were derived from NT-ES cells, inte grated and electrically coupled to host myocardium and exerted beneficial effects on the left ventricular function of infarcted rat heart. No teratoma formation was observed in the rat heart implanted with EHTs for 4 weeks. NT-ES cells can be used as a source of seeding cells for cardiac tissue engineering. Large contractile EHT grafts can be constructed in vitro with the ability to survive after implantation and improve myocardial performance of infarcted rat hearts.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2010-07-01", "authors": ["ShuanghongL\u00fc", "YingLi", "ShaorongGao", "ShengLiu", "HaibinWang", "WenjunHe", "JinZhou", "ZhiqiangLiu", "YeZhang", "QiuxiaLin", "CumiDuan", "Xiangzhong JerryYang", "ChangyongWang"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01112.x"}

We sought to evaluate whether neonatal Ex-4 can exert the same effect in the normal rat heart, as well as whether Ex-4 could affect susceptibility to cardiac reperfusion injury.\nAfter birth, Sprague Dawley rat pups were given either Ex-4 (1 nmole/kg body weight) or vehicle (1% BSA in 0.9% saline) subcutaneously for 6 days. Animals were studied at juvenile (4-6 weeks) and adult (8-9 months) ages. Using the Langendorff isolated perfused heart, cardiovascular function was assessed at baseline and following ischemia-reperfusion. Mitochondria were isolated from fresh heart tissue, and oxidative phosphorylation and calcium sequestration were analyzed. TBARS, MnSOD activity, and non-enzymatic anti-oxidant capacity were measured to assess the degree of oxidative stress present in the two groups.\nBoth at the juvenile and adult age, Ex-4 treated rats demonstrated improved recovery from an ischemic insult. Rates of oxidative phosphorylation were globally reduced in adult, but not juvenile Ex-4 treated animals. Furthermore, mitochondria isolated from adult Ex-4 treated rats sequestered less calcium before undergoing the mitochondrial permeability transition.

This observation supports the disposable soma theory of aging, which suggests that the investment made in cellular maintenance will be proportional to selective pressures to extend lifespan. Maintenance of protein homeostasis is a critical component of cellular maintenance and stress resistance. To test the hypothesis that enhanced protein repair and recycling activities underlie longevity, we measured the activities of the 20S/26S proteasome and two protein repair enzymes in liver, heart and brain tissues of 15 different mammalian and avian species with maximum lifespans (MLSP) ranging from 3 to 30\u00a0years. The data set included Snell dwarf mice, in which lifespan is increased by \u223c50% compared to their normal littermates. None of these activities in any of the three tissues correlated positively with MLSP. In liver, 20S/26S proteasome and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activities correlated negatively with body mass. In brain tissue, TrxR was also negatively correlated with body mass. Glutaredoxin (Grx) activity in brain was negatively correlated with MLSP and this correlation remained after residual analysis to remove the effects of body mass, but was lost when the data were analysed using Felsenstein's independent contrasts. Snell dwarf mice had marginally lower 20S proteasome, TrxR and Grx activities than normal controls in brain, but not heart tissue.

In the present study of the mouse heart, we show for the first time, using immunohistochemistry and cryoimmunoelectron microscopy, that P2X7R is expressed in atrial cardiomyocytes and in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, but not in the ventricle cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, biochemical data indicate the presence of two forms of P2X7R, the classical glycosylated 80 kDa isoform and a protein with the molecular weight of 56 kDa, in both cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells of the mouse heart. The functionality of both proteins in heart cells is still unclear.

Thirty adult male rats were randomly assigned to three groups: control (C), HP, or PHT. HP rats were continuously subjected to atmospheres containing 100% O2 for 48 h, whereas PHT animals breathed 100% O2 for 30-min periods three times daily over a 3-week period. Ultrastructural examination of isolated myocytes from the HP rats showed that swelled mitochondria with constricted and proliferated cristae of the inner membrane were associated with disarrangement of myofibrils as well as the loss of I-banding. Heart tissue supernatant analyses also provided evidence of significantly higher FR levels in samples from the HP rats as compared with values noted with materials from control and PHT rats. In contrast, BAP was significantly higher in the samples from rats in the PHT group as compared levels associated with the control or the HP hosts. As HP resulted in mitochondrial pathological alterations in the cristae, this implied the induction of a myocardium oxidative stress (MOS). As PHT enhanced BAP, it may be concluded that PHT likely enhances an apparent antioxidant response that did not permit FR to build up. Because PHT elevations would be expected to help lower FR levels, it would seem that periodic hyperoxia training might induce an adaptive resistance in the heart against the formation of potentially toxicologically deleterious reactive metabolite species.", "journal": "Inhalation toxicology", "date": "2010-06-22", "authors": ["Al-Said AHaffor", "Omar SAlttas"], "doi": "10.3109/08958370903456629"}

For this mechanism to work effectively, the cellular ratio of Complexes I/II and STAT3 must approach one. However, using three different proteomic approaches in cardiac tissue, we determined the ratio of Complexes I/II and STAT3 to be approximately 10(5). This finding suggests that direct protein interaction between Complexes I/II and STAT3 cannot be required for optimal ATP production, nor can it dramatically modulate oxidative phosphorylation in vivo. Thus, STAT3 is likely altering mitochondrial function via transcriptional regulation or indirect signaling pathways that warrant further investigation.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2010-06-19", "authors": ["DarciPhillips", "Matthew JReilley", "Angel MAponte", "GuanghuiWang", "EmilyBoja", "MarjanGucek", "Robert SBalaban"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.C110.152652"}

They have potentially important roles in cardiovascular physiology in health and disease, and show promise as therapeutics for congestive heart failure. Analysis of canine heart tissue showed mRNA expression of Ucn 1, Ucn 3 and CRFR2 in all heart chambers. Immunohistochemistry also demonstrated Ucns 1 and 3 expression in cardiomyocytes. To assess the potential usefulness of circulating Ucns as markers of heart disease, plasma samples from 45 dogs with cardiac disease and 15 controls were analysed by radioimmunoassay. Both Ucns 1 and 3 were measurable but the presence of cardiac disease did not alter their concentrations. Therefore, whilst Ucns are expressed in canine myocardium (where they may play a role in the endogenous neurohumoral response to cardiac disease or failure) they do not appear to be sensitive biomarkers of cardiac disease in our canine patient population.", "journal": "Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)", "date": "2010-06-18", "authors": ["Gemma FragaVeloso", "Dan GOhad", "Andrew JFrancis", "Joan MVaughan", "David GBrownstein", "Geoffrey JCulshaw", "Wylie WVale", "Anne TFrench", "Pauline MJamieson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.05.019"}

The micronucleus (MN) test in erythrocytes and the chromosome aberration (CA) test in bone marrow cells were used. Also, levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation as malondialdehyde (MDA) in heart homogenates were measured, and in addition the changes in heart histology were investigated. The mice were randomly divided into six groups. Group I (negative control) received intraperitoneal injections of isotonic saline (0.02 mL/g) for 6 consecutive days, Group II received intraperitoneal injections of DOX (2.5 mg/kg of body weight, six doses every other day; cumulative dosage, 15 mg/kg of body weight) for 6 consecutive days, Group III received GSE (50 mg/kg of body weight, 21 doses every other day; cumulative dosage, 1,050 mg/kg of body weight) for 21 consecutive days, Group IV received GSE (150 mg/kg of body weight, 21 doses every other day; cumulative dosage, 3,150 mg/kg of body weight) for 21 consecutive days, Group V received GSE (50 mg/kg of body weight, 28 doses every other day; cumulative dosage, 1,400 mg/kg of body weight) for 28 consecutive days plus DOX (2.5 mg/kg of body weight, six doses every other day; cumulative dosage, 15 mg/kg of body weight) for 6 consecutive days, and Group VI received GSE (150 mg/kg of body weight, 28 doses every other day; cumulative dosage, 4,200 mg/kg of body weight) for 28 consecutive days plus DOX (2.5 mg/kg of body weight, six doses every other day; cumulative dosage, 15 mg/kg of body weight) for 6 consecutive days. DOX induced heart damage as indicated from a pronounced change in heart histology. In the DOX-treated group, there was a significant increase in MDA content in the heart homogenate, and the level of GSH was significantly decreased. DOX induced genotoxicity by increasing the number of aberrant metaphases (AMNs), MNs, and structural chromosomal aberrations (CAs) such as chromatid breaks, dicentrics, acentric fragments, and gaps and showed a detractive effect on the mitotic index (MI) of cells. Pretreatment with GSE before treatment with DOX significantly protected the heart tissue by ameliorating its antioxidant activity. In Groups V and VI, the MDA level of heart tissue was significantly decreased, and the GSH level was increased compared to the DOX-treated group. Moreover, GSE significantly protected bone marrow chromosomes from DOX-induced genotoxicity by reducing the total AMNs and the frequency of structural CAs. GSE treatment also decreased the frequency of MNs and increased the MI values. It could be concluded that GSE acts as a potent antioxidant to prevent heart damage and genotoxicity of bone marrow cells.", "journal": "Journal of medicinal food", "date": "2010-06-18", "authors": ["EmineYal\u00e7in", "ErtanOru\u00e7", "K\u00fclti\u011finCavu\u015fo\u011flu", "K\u00fcr\u015fadYapar"], "doi": "10.1089/jmf.2009.0162"}

{"title": "Role of iNOS and peroxynitrite-matrix metalloproteinase-2 signaling in myocardial late preconditioning in rats.", "abstract": "We have previously shown that the inhibition of myocardial nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) signaling by early preconditioning (PC) is involved in its cardioprotective effect. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the role of NO and peroxynitrite-MMP signaling in the development of late PC. PC was performed by five consecutive cycles of 4-min coronary occlusion and 4-min reperfusion in anesthetized rats in vivo. Twenty-four hours later, hearts were subjected to a 30-min coronary occlusion followed by 180-min reperfusion to measure infarct size. In separate experiments, heart tissue was sampled to measure biochemical parameters before and 3, 6, 12, or 24 h after the PC protocol, respectively. Late PC decreased infarct size, increased cardiac inducible NO synthase (iNOS) activity and gene expression, and decreased SOD activity at 24 h significantly compared with sham-operated controls. Late PC increased cardiac superoxide levels significantly at 24 h; however, it did not change cardiac NO levels. Cardiac peroxynitrite levels were significantly decreased. Downstream cellular targets of peroxynitrite, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were decreased in the late PC group at 24 h compared with the sham-operated group. To verify if PC-induced inhibition of MMPs had a causative role in the reduction of infarct size, in separate experiments, we measured infarct size after the pharmacological inhibition of MMPs by ilomastat and found a significant reduction of infarct size compared with the vehicle-treated group. In conclusion, this is the first demonstration that the inhibition of cardiac peroxynitrite-MMP signaling contributes to cardioprotection by late PC and that pharmacological inhibition of MMPs is able to reduce infarct size in vivo. Furthermore, increased expression of iNOS may play a role in the development of late PC; however, increased iNOS activity does not lead to increased NO production in late PC.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Bidomain theory explains this phenomena through the existence of intramural virtual electrodes (VEs), caused by discontinuities in myocardial tissue structure. In this study, we assess the modeling components essential in constructing a finite-element cardiac tissue model including blood vessels from high-resolution magnetic resonance data and investigate the specific role played by coronary vasculature in VE formation, which currently remains largely unknown. We use a novel method for assigning histologically based fiber architecture around intramural structures and include an experimentally derived vessel lumen wall conductance within the model. Shock-tissue interaction in the presence of vessels is assessed through comparison with a simplified model lacking intramural structures. Results indicate that VEs form around blood vessels for shocks > 8 V/cm. The magnitude of induced polarizations is attenuated by realistic representation of fiber negotiation around vessel cavities, as well as the insulating effects of the vessel lumen wall. Furthermore, VEs formed around large subepicardial vessels reduce epicardial polarization levels.

{"title": "An introduction to functional and molecular imaging with MRI.", "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been applied to many aspects of functional and molecular imaging. Many of the parameters used to produce image contrast in MRI are influenced by the local chemical environment around the atoms being imaged; these parameters can be exploited to probe the molecular content of tissues and this has been shown to have many applications in radiology. Diffusion-weighted imaging is a well-established method for measuring small changes in the molecular movement of water that occurs following the onset of ischaemia and in the presence of tumours. Exogenous contrast agents containing gadolinium or iron oxide have been used to image tissue vascularity, cell migration, and specific biological processes, such as cell death. MR spectroscopy is a technique for measuring the concentrations of tissue metabolites and this has been used to probe metabolic pathways in cancer, in cardiac tissue, and in the brain. Several groups are developing positron-emission tomography (PET)-MRI systems that combine the spatial resolution of MRI with the metabolic sensitivity of PET. However, the application of MRI to functional and molecular imaging is limited by its intrinsic low sensitivity. A number of techniques have been developed to overcome this which utilize a phenomenon termed hyperpolarization; these have been used to image tissue pH, cellular necrosis, and to image the lungs. Although most of these applications have been developed in animal models, they are increasingly being translated into human imaging and some are used routinely in many radiology departments.", "journal": "Clinical radiology", "date": "2010-06-15", "authors": ["F AGallagher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.crad.2010.04.006"}

To assess links between increased ROS levels and mutations, we examined in situ levels of ROS and cII mutation frequency, pattern and spectrum in the heart of harlequin (hq)/Big Blue mice. The hq mouse is a model of premature aging with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased risk of oxidative stress-induced heart disease with the means for in vivo mutation detection. The hq mutation produces a significant downregulation in the X-linked apoptosis-inducing factor gene (Aif) impairing both the antioxidant and oxidative phosphorylation functions of AIF. Brain and skin of hq disease mice have elevated frequencies of point mutations in nuclear DNA and histopathology characterized by cell loss. Reports of associated elevations in ROS in brain and skin have mixed results. Herein, heart in situ ROS levels were elevated in hq disease compared to AIF-proficient mice (p<0.0001) yet, mutation frequency and pattern were similar in hq disease, hq carrier and AIF-proficient mice. Heart cII mutations were also assessed 15 days following an acute exposure to an exogenous ROS inducer (10 mg paraquat/kg). Acute paraquat exposure with a short mutant manifestation period was insufficient to elevate mutation frequency or alter mutation pattern in the post-mitotic heart tissue of AIF-proficient mice. Paraquat induction of ROS requires mitochondrial complex I and thus is likely compromised in hq mice.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been used as an alternative cell source for cardiac repair; however, dissociated ESCs show poor viability in the scaffold and do not form the embryoid body (EB)-like structures. In this study, a strategy intended for cultivating EB-derived cells (EBDCs) uniformly in a porous 3D tissue scaffold was developed. This strategy employed techniques of formation of spherically symmetric EBs in a thermo-responsive hydrogel system, production of cell sheets of EBDCs in a similar hydrogel system coated with collagen and fabrication of sliced porous tissue scaffolds. The prepared EBs were collected and plated evenly in the cell-sheet culture system. After 8 days in culture, a continuous sheet of EBDCs with cell beating was obtained; our qPCR and flow cytometric analyses showed that the collagen-coated on the cell-sheet culture system can significantly enhance the population of cardiac-lineage cells. The produced EBDC sheets were then sandwiched into the sliced porous tissue scaffold. After reculture, the seeded EBDCs were redistributed uniformly throughout the scaffold, with a significant increase in mechanical strength. Cardiac-specific myosin heavy chain and alpha-actinin were expressed for some cells grown in the scaffold, while connexin 43 was clearly expressed at the cell borders.

Serum samples were collected to measure the lithium concentrations as well as cardiac troponin T level (cTNT, a biomarker of cardiac injury). In addition, heart weight was measured and the cardiac tissues were evaluated both macroscopically and microscopically. The results of the present study indicate that lithium might diminish mortality rate, general toxicity (edema, alopecia and cachexia), improve S(alpha)-T segment and QT interval prolongations as well as heart contractility force. Application of lithium could inhibit the increase of cardiac troponin T and formation of myocardial lesions.

Activation of HHMC in vitro with anti-IgE or anti-FcepsilonRI induced the release of preformed mediators (histamine, tryptase, chymase, and renin) and the de novo synthesis of LTC(4) (approximately =18 ng/l0(6) cells) and PGD(2) (approximately =18 ng/l0(6) cells). Complement is activated and anaphylatoxin forms during anaphylaxis. C5a causes rapid release of histamine and tryptase from HHMC. These cells are activated in vitro by therapeutic (general anesthetics, protamine, etc.) and diagnostic agents (radiocontrast media, etc.) which can cause anaphylactoid reactions. Low concentrations of histamine and cysteinyl leukotrienes given to subjects undergoing diagnostic catheterization caused significant systemic and coronary hemodynamic effects. These results indicate that HHMC probably have a role in anaphylactic reactions.", "journal": "Chemical immunology and allergy", "date": "2010-06-04", "authors": ["ArturoGenovese", "Francesca WRossi", "GiuseppeSpadaro", "Maria RosariaGaldiero", "GianniMarone"], "doi": "10.1159/000315945"}
{"title": "A G-CSF functionalized scaffold for stem cells seeding: a differentiating device for cardiac purposes.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction and its consequences represent one of the most demanding challenges in cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Transfer of skeletal myoblasts into decompensated hearts has been performed through intramyocardial injection. However, the achievements of both cardiomyocyte differentiation and precise integration of the injected cells into the myocardial wall, in order to augment synchronized contractility and avoid potentially life-threatening alterations in the electrical conduction of the heart, still remain a major target to be pursued. Recently, granulocytes colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) fuelled the interest of researchers for its direct effect on cardiomyocytes, inhibiting both apoptosis and remodelling in the failing heart and protecting from ventricular arrhythmias through the up-regulation of connexin 43 (Cx43). We propose a tissue engineering approach concerning the fabrication of an electrospun cardiac graft functionalized with G-CSF, in order to provide the correct signalling sequence to orientate myoblast differentiation and exert important systemic and local effects, positively modulating the infarction microenvironment. Poly-(L-lactide) electrospun scaffolds were seeded with C2C12 murine skeletal myoblast for 48 hrs. Biological assays demonstrated the induction of Cx43 expression along with morphostructural changes resulting in cell elongation and appearance of cellular junctions resembling the usual cardiomyocyte arrangement at the ultrastructural level. The possibility of fabricating extracellular matrix-mimicking scaffolds able to promote myoblast pre-commitment towards myocardiocyte lineage and mitigate the hazardous environment of the damaged myocardium represents an interesting strategy in cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2010-06-04", "authors": ["CristianoSpadaccio", "AlbertoRainer", "MarcellaTrombetta", "MatteoCentola", "MarioLusini", "MassimoChello", "ElvioCovino", "FedericoDe Marco", "RaffaellaCoccia", "YoshiyaToyoda", "Jorge AGenovese"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01100.x"}

{"title": "What is the role of lidocaine or phenytoin in tricyclic antidepressant-induced cardiotoxicity?", "abstract": "Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) poisoning is a relatively common occurrence and remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. Deaths from TCA toxicity are typically due to cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias and hypotension. Cardiovascular toxicity may be multifactorial. However, the primary mechanism is a TCA-induced membrane-depressant or \"quinidine-like\" effect on the myocardium resulting in slowing down of phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac action potential and subsequent impairment of conduction through the His-Purkinje system and myocardium. This effect is manifest as QRS prolongation on the EKG, atrioventricular (AV) block, and impairment in automaticity leading to hypotension and ventricular dysrhythmia. Primary treatment strategies include sodium bicarbonate, hypertonic saline, and correction of any conditions that may aggravate this toxicity such as acidosis, hyperthermia, and hypotension. In cases of severe TCA toxicity, administration of sodium bicarbonate may be insufficient to correct the cardiac conduction defects. Use of lidocaine or phenytoin, both Vaughan Williams Class IB antiarrhythmic agents, has been reported as an effective adjunctive therapy in cases of severe cardiotoxicity.\nThirty articles of interest were identified by searching PubMed, abstracts from meetings, and the reference sections of related primary and review articles and toxicological texts. ROLE OF LIDOCAINE AND PHENYTOIN: Lidocaine and phenytoin also cause sodium channel blockade, but unlike Class IA or IC agents do not depress phase 0 depolarization in healthy cardiac tissue. Lidocaine and phenytoin dissociate relatively quickly from cardiac sodium channels. Sodium channels have faster recovery times after exposure to lidocaine (1-2 s) and phenytoin (0.71 s), than with some TCAs such as amitriptyline (13.6 s), but not others (e.g., imipramine at 1.6 s). In experimental models of amitriptyline poisoning, lidocaine co-administration resulted in decreased sodium channel blockade compared to amitriptyline alone. This correlated with clinical improvement, including normalization of QRS interval, improved hypotension, and decreased mortality. It is postulated that lidocaine's rapid binding to the sodium channel may directly displace slower acting agents from the channel, leaving more channels unbound, and therefore be able to facilitate cardiac conduction. Phenytoin may act through a similar mechanism as lidocaine, although experimental studies suggest that it does not compete directly for the same sodium channel binding site as TCAs. Allosteric modulation of the TCA binding site may occur in the setting of phenytoin use. The evidence for using phenytoin in treating TCA-induced sodium channel blockade is less convincing than that for lidocaine. Human trials are limited to case series and, in most human exposures in which there appeared to be efficacy, the toxicity was not severe.\nAlthough there appears to be more evidence for the use of lidocaine than phenytoin as adjunctive treatment for TCA-associated cardiotoxicity, specific clinical indications and dosing recommendations remain to be defined. We recommend the use of lidocaine in cases in which cardiotoxicity (arrhythmias, hypotension) is refractory to treatment with sodium bicarbonate or hypertonic saline, or in which physiological derangement (e.g., severe alkalosis or hypernatremia) limits effective use of these primary strategies.", "journal": "Clinical toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "date": "2010-05-29", "authors": ["AnthonyFoianini", "TimothyJoseph Wiegand", "NealBenowitz"], "doi": "10.3109/15563650.2010.487050"}

Since their discovery and functional characterization in the late 1960s and early 1970s, MSCs or MSC-like cells have been obtained from various mesodermal and non-mesodermal tissues, although majority of the therapeutic applications involved bone marrow-derived MSCs. Based on its mesenchymal origin, it was predicted earlier that MSCs only can differentiate into mesengenic lineages like bone, cartilage, fat or muscle. However, varied isolation and cell culturing methods identified subsets of MSCs in the bone marrow which not only differentiated into mesenchymal lineages, but also into ectodermal and endodermal derivatives. Although, true pluripotent status is yet to be established, MSCs have been successfully used in bone and cartilage regeneration in osteoporotic fracture and arthritis, respectively, and in the repair of cardiac tissue following myocardial infarction. Immunosuppressive properties of MSCs extend utility of MSCs to reduce complications of graft versus host disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Homing of MSCs to sites of tissue injury, including tumor, is well established. In addition to their ability in tissue regeneration, MSCs can be genetically engineered ex vivo for delivery of therapeutic molecule(s) to the sites of injury or tumorigenesis as cell therapy vehicles. MSCs tend to lose surface receptors for trafficking and have been reported to develop sarcoma in long-term culture.

The effects of natakalim, a SUR2B/Kir6.1 selective channel opener, on progression of cardiac remodeling were investigated. Pressure overload-induced heart failure was induced in Wistar rats by abdominal aortic banding. The effects of natakalim (1, 3, and 9 mg\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9 for 10 weeks) on myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure, cardiac histology, vasoactive compounds, and gene expression were assessed. Ten weeks after the onset of pressure overload, natakalim treatment potently inhibited cardiac hypertrophy and prevented heart failure. Natakalim remarkably inhibited the changes of left ventricular hemodynamic parameters and reversed the increase of heart mass index, left ventricular weight index, and lung weight index. Histological examination demonstrated that there was no significant hypertrophy or fibrosis in pressure-overloaded hearts of natakalim-treated rats. Ultrastructural examination of hearts revealed well-organized myofibrils with mitochondria grouped along the periphery of longitudinally oriented fibers in rats from the natakalim group. The content of serum nitric oxide and plasma prostacyclin was increased, whereas that of plasma endothelin-1 and cardiac tissue hydroxyproline and atrial and B-type natriuretic peptide messenger RNA was downregulated in natakalim-treated rats. Natakalim at 0.01-100 \u00b5M had no effects on isolated working hearts derived from Wistar rats; however, natakalim had endothelium-dependent vasodilatory effects on the isolated tail artery helical strips precontracted with norepinephrine.

Modules (without RAEC) cultured in 10% bovine serum (BS) were more contractile and responsive to external stimulus (lower excitation threshold, higher maximum capture rate, and greater en face fractional area changes) than modules cultured in 10% fetal BS. Incorporating 25% Matrigel in the matrix reduced the excitation threshold and increased the fractional area change relative to collagen only modules (without RAEC). A coculture medium, containing 10% BS, low Mg2+ (0.814mM), and normal glucose (5.5mM), was used to maintain RAEC junction morphology (VE-cadherin) and CM contractility, although the responsiveness of CM was attenuated with RAEC on the modules. Macroporous, sheet-like module constructs were assembled by partially immobilizing a layer of modules in alginate gel until day 8, with or without RAEC. RAEC/CM module sheets were electrically responsive; however, like modules with RAEC this responsiveness was attenuated relative to CM-only sheets.

{"title": "Transmural ultrasound-based visualization of patterns of action potential wave propagation in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "The pattern of action potential propagation during various tachyarrhythmias is strongly suspected to be composed of multiple re-entrant waves, but has never been imaged in detail deep within myocardial tissue. An understanding of the nature and dynamics of these waves is important in the development of appropriate electrical or pharmacological treatments for these pathological conditions. We propose a new imaging modality that uses ultrasound to visualize the patterns of propagation of these waves through the mechanical deformations they induce. The new method would have the distinct advantage of being able to visualize these waves deep within cardiac tissue. In this article, we describe one step that would be necessary in this imaging process-the conversion of these deformations into the action potential induced active stresses that produced them. We demonstrate that, because the active stress induced by an action potential is, to a good approximation, only nonzero along the local fiber direction, the problem in our case is actually overdetermined, allowing us to obtain a complete solution. Use of two- rather than three-dimensional displacement data, noise in these displacements, and/or errors in the measurements of the fiber orientations all produce substantial but acceptable errors in the solution.

In this study, a new computational model has been constructed that incorporates the major membrane currents that have been isolated in recent experiments using Purkinje fibre cells. The model, which integrates mathematical models of human ion channels based on detailed biophysical studies of their kinetic and voltage-dependent properties, recapitulates distinct electrophysiological characteristics unique to Purkinje fibre cells compared to neighbouring ventricular myocytes. These characteristics include automaticity, hyperpolarized voltage range of the action potential plateau potential, and prolonged action potential duration. Simulations of selective ion channel blockade reproduce responses to pharmacological challenges characteristic of isolated Purkinje fibres in vitro, and importantly, the model predicts that Purkinje fibre cells are prone to severe arrhythmogenic activity in patients harbouring long QT syndrome 3 but much less so for other common forms of long QT.

We aimed to develop a highly sensitive, low-tech assay suitable to determine the activity of DYRK family kinases in tissues or cells from diverse sources.\nPhosphorylation-site specific antibodies can be used to monitor the accumulation of the phosphorylated product in kinase assays. We present a modified configuration of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based kinase assay by using the phosphospecific antibody as the capture antibody.

Consequently, low substrate turnover rates can be determined. We applied this method to the measurement of endogenous DYRK1A activity in mouse heart tissue by immunocomplex kinase assay.

This study examined the role of Se on the development of hypertension and subsequent progression to chronic heart failure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Three dietary groups were studied: (i) Se-free; (ii) normal Se (50 \u03bcg Se/kg food); and (iii) high Se (1000 \u03bcg Se/kg food). Systolic blood pressure and echocardiography were used to detect cardiac changes in vivo.

The major finding of this study was the high heart failure-related mortality rate in SHRs fed an Se-free diet (70%). Normal and high levels of dietary Se resulted in higher survival rates of 78 and 100%, respectively. Furthermore, high dietary Se was clearly associated with lower levels of cardiac oxidative damage and increased antioxidant expression, as well as a reduction in disease severity and mortality in the SHR.", "journal": "Molecular nutrition & food research", "date": "2010-05-21", "authors": ["Robyn SLymbury", "Matthew JMarino", "Anthony VPerkins"], "doi": "10.1002/mnfr.201000012"}
{"title": "Extracellular heat shock cognate protein 70 induces cardiac functional tolerance to endotoxin: differential effect on TNF-alpha and ICAM-1 levels in heart tissue.", "abstract": "Endotoxin provokes cardiac dysfunction, and induction of tolerance to endotoxin has therapeutic potential. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) can induce endotoxin tolerance in macrophages. We recently found that heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) induces pro-inflammatory cytokines via activation of TLR4 in macrophages and the myocardium. We hypothesize that HSC70 preconditioning induces cardiac tolerance to endotoxin. Pretreatment of peritoneal macrophages with HSC70 for 24h reduced TNF-alpha levels following endotoxin stimulation. Preconditioning of mice with HSC70 24h prior to endotoxin attenuated endotoxemic cardiac dysfunction. HSC70 preconditioning reduced TNF-alpha levels in plasma and heart tissue by 33.3% and 35.4%, respectively, and decreased ICAM-1 levels in heart tissue by 63.5% following endotoxin challenge. The effect of HSC70 on TNF-alpha was less robust than endotoxin preconditioning (79.7% and 75.0% reduction in TNF-alpha levels in plasma and heart tissue, respectively); however, HSC70 and endotoxin preconditioning had comparable effects on ICAM-1 levels in heart tissue. While HSC70 preconditioning had no effect on myocardial TLR4 protein levels, it suppressed NF-kappaB activation induced by endotoxin. We conclude that HSC70 preconditioning (1) attenuates the TNF-alpha response to endotoxin in macrophages in vitro, (2) induces cardiac functional tolerance to endotoxin and (3) reduces NF-kappaB activity, and TNF-alpha and ICAM-1 levels in heart tissue. Thus, the mechanism of HSC70-induced cardiac tolerance to endotoxin appears to involve down-regulation of myocardial TLR4 signaling and inflammatory responses.", "journal": "Cytokine", "date": "2010-05-19", "authors": ["XinSu", "Joshua BSykes", "LihuaAo", "Christopher DRaeburn", "David AFullerton", "XianzhongMeng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cyto.2010.04.014"}

Male Wistar albino rats were divided into six groups: group 1 rats were given daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of normal saline for 10 consecutive days; groups 2, 3 and 4 rats were injected every other day with doxorubicin (3 mg/kg, i.p.), to obtain treatments with cumulative doses of 6, 12, and 18 mg/kg. Rats in the fifth group were injected with L-carnitine (200 mg/kg, i.p.) for 10 consecutive days. Animals in the sixth group received doxorubicin (18 mg/kg) and L-carnitine (200 mg/kg). Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in a significant and dose-dependent decrease in H-FABP and OCTN2 mRNA expression, total carnitine and ATP in cardiac tissues and a significant increase in cardiac enzymes. Moreover, doxorubicin treatment showed significant and dose-dependent increase in the expression of apoptotic genes namely P53 and CD95. Interestingly, carnitine supplementation restored doxorubicin-induced inhibition of gene expression of H-FABP and OCTN2, decrease in myocardial carnitine and ATP to the control values. In conclusion, data from this study suggest that: chronic doxorubicin therapy decreased the expression of H-FABP and OCTN2 mRNA expression in cardiac tissues. The progressive increase in cardiotoxicity enzymatic indices and the decrease in H-FABP and OCTN2 expression may point to the possible contribution of H-FABP and OCTN2 as a mechanism during development of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2010-05-18", "authors": ["Mohamed MSayed-Ahmed", "Othman AAl-Shabanah", "Mohamed MHafez", "Abdulaziz MAleisa", "Salem SAl-Rejaie"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.05.002"}

The goal of this work is to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of the arylimidamide (AIA) DB766 against T. cruzi. This arylimidamide exhibits strong trypanocidal activity and excellent selectivity for bloodstream trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigotes (Y strain), giving IC(50)s (drug concentrations that reduce 50% of the number of the treated parasites) of 60 and 25 nM, respectively. DB766 also exerts striking effects upon different parasite stocks, including those naturally resistant to benznidazole, and displays higher activity in vitro than the reference drugs. By fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy analyses, we found that this AIA localizes in DNA-enriched compartments and induces considerable damage to the mitochondria. DB766 effectively reduces the parasite load in the blood and cardiac tissue and presents efficacy similar to that of benznidazole in mouse models of T. cruzi infection employing the Y and Colombian strains, using oral and intraperitoneal doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day that were given after the establishment of parasite infection. This AIA ameliorates electrocardiographic alterations, reduces hepatic and heart lesions induced by the infection, and provides 90 to 100% protection against mortality, which is similar to that provided by benznidazole.

The aim of this study was to identify cellular processes in mouse heart tissue affected by different ADR/DOC dosing protocols using a toxicoproteomic approach. We applied fluorogenic derivatization-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (FD-LC-MS/MS) - which consists of fluorogenic derivatization, separation and fluorescence detection by LC, and identification by LC-tandem mass spectrometry - to the proteomic analysis of heart tissue from control, intermittent-dosing (DOC-ADR), and simultaneous-dosing (ADR&DOC) groups. In DOC-ADR group, ADR was administered 12h after DOC injection; in ADR&DOC group, both drugs were administered simultaneously; in control group, saline was administered at the same timing as ADR injection of other groups. Heart samples were isolated from all mice 1 week after the treatment. The highly reproducible and sensitive method (FD-LC-MS/MS) identified nine proteins that were differentially expressed in heart tissue of control and the two treatment groups; seven of these nine proteins participate in cellular energy production pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Significantly higher expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was observed in the DOC-ADR group, the group with the fewer cardiotoxic deaths, than in the ADR&DOC group.

However, because non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, are taken during the infarction, it becomes critical to know whether the NSAIDs have negative impacts on heart tissue regeneration when using hESCs.\nMass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were used to analyze the functional presence of the elaborate prostanoids' biosynthesis and signaling systems in hESCs. The detected endogenous arachidonic acid (AA) released in the hESC membranes reflects the activity of phospholipase which directly controls the biosyntheses of the prostanoids.\nThe complete inhibition of the endogenous prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) biosynthesis by the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, NS398, confirmed that the major prostanoids synthesized in the hESCs are mediated by the COX-2 enzyme. We also found that PGE(2) and the prostacyclin (PGI(2)) metabolite, 6-keto-PGF(1\u03b1), are present in the undifferentiated hESCs.\nThis indicated different cyclooxygenase (COX)-downstream synthases and metabolizing enzymes are involved in the AA products' signaling through the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways.

Isolated rat hearts perfused at the constant flow were exposed to global ischemia for 60 min followed by 30 min of reperfusion. In control hearts, ischemia/reperfusion markedly decreased left ventricular developed pressure and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and caused lactate dehydrogenase release and infarction. 44Bu (0.1, 0.3 and 1 microM) or lidocaine (1 and 200 microM) was administrated during the last 10 min before ischemia and the first 5 min of the reperfusion period. A significant post-ischemic functional recovery in the same degree was elicited by 0.3 and 1 microM 44Bu or 200 microM lidocaine. These effects of 44Bu and lidocaine closely correlated with the reduction in the infarct size and lactate dehydrogenase release. In contrast, 44Bu (0.1 microM) or lidocaine (1 microM) treatment did not result in a significant recovery in any of the examined parameters.

We investigated whether human bone marrow CD133(+)-derived cells (BM-CD133(+) cells) might be used for cell therapy of heart injury in combination with tissue engineering. We examined these cells for: 1) their in vitro capacity to be converted into cardiomyocytes (CMs), and 2) their potential for in vivo differentiation when delivered to a tissue-engineered type I collagen patch placed on injured hearts (group II). To ensure a microvascular network ready for use by the transplanted cells, cardiac injury and patching were scheduled 2 weeks before cell injection. The cardiovascular potential of the BM-CD133(+) cells was compared with that of a direct injection (group I) of the same cells in heart tissue damaged according to the same schedule as for group II. While a small fraction (2 \u00b1 0.5%) of BM-CD133(+)cells cocultured with rat CMs switched in vitro to a CM-like cell phenotype, in vivo-and in both groups of nude rats transplanted with BM-CD133(+)--there was no evidence of any CM differentiation (as detected by cardiac troponin I expression), but there were signs instead of new capillaries and small arterioles. While capillaries prevailed over arterioles in group II, the opposite occurred in group I. The transplanted cells further contributed to the formation of new microvessels induced by the patch (group II) but the number of vessels did not appear superior to the one developed after directly injecting the BM-CD133(+)cells into the injured heart. Although chimeric human-rat microvessels were consistently found in the hearts of both groups I and II, they represented a minority (1.5-2.3%) compared with those of rat origin. Smooth muscle myosin isoform expression suggested that the arterioles achieved complete differentiation irrespective of the presence or absence of the collagen patch. These findings suggest that: 1) BM-CD133(+) cells display a limited propensity for in vitro conversion to CMs; 2) the preliminarily vascularized bioscaffold did not confer a selective homing and differentiation advantage for the phenotypic conversion of BM-CD133(+) cells into CMs; and 3) combined patching and cell transplantation is suitable for angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, but it does not produce better results, in terms of endothelial and smooth muscle cell differentiation, than the \"traditional\" method of cell injection into the myocardium.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2010-05-08", "authors": ["MPozzobon", "SBollini", "LIop", "PDe Gaspari", "AChiavegato", "C ARossi", "SGiuliani", "FFascetti Leon", "NElvassore", "SSartore", "PDe Coppi"], "doi": "10.3727/096368910X505864"}
{"title": "A computer model of engineered cardiac monolayers.", "abstract": "Engineered monolayers created using microabrasion and micropatterning methods have provided a simplified in vitro system to study the effects of anisotropy and fiber direction on electrical propagation. Interpreting the behavior in these culture systems has often been performed using classical computer models with continuous properties. However, such models do not account for the effects of random cell shapes, cell orientations, and cleft spaces inherent in these monolayers on the resulting wavefront conduction. This work presents a novel methodology for modeling a monolayer of cardiac tissue in which the factors governing cell shape, cell-to-cell coupling, and degree of cleft space are not constant but rather are treated as spatially random with assigned distributions. This modeling approach makes it possible to simulate wavefront propagation in a manner analogous to performing experiments on engineered monolayer tissues. Simulated results are compared to previously published measured data from monolayers used to investigate the role of cellular architecture on conduction velocities and anisotropy ratios. We also present an estimate for obtaining the electrical properties from these networks and demonstrate how variations in the discrete cellular architecture affect the macroscopic conductivities. The simulations support the common assumption that under normal ranges of coupling strength, tissues with relatively uniform distributions of cell shapes and connectivity can be represented using continuous models with conductivities derived from random discrete cellular architecture using either global or local estimates. The results also reveal that in the presence of abrupt changes in cell orientation, local estimates of tissue properties predict smoother changes in conductivity that may not adequately predict the discrete nature of propagation at the transition sites.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2010-05-06", "authors": ["Jong MKim", "NenadBursac", "Craig SHenriquez"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2010.01.008"}

These findings support the hypothesis that increased levels of cTnI and cTnT are an index of cardiac tissue damage, even in patients with extracardiac diseases, thus enabling appropriate diagnosis and, when necessary and available, specific treatment.", "journal": "Clinical science (London, England : 1979)", "date": "2010-05-06", "authors": ["AldoClerico", "AlbertoGiannoni"], "doi": "10.1042/CS20100234"}
{"title": "Different gene expression in human heart tissue and progenitor cells from control and diabetic subjects: relevance to the pathogenesis of human diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "The The aim of our study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy through the identification of remarkable genes for the myocardial function that are expressed differently between diabetic and normal subjects. Moreover, we intend to characterize both in human myocardial tissue and in the related cardiac progenitor cells the pattern of gene expression and the levels of expression and protein activation of molecular effectors involved in the regulation of the myocardial function and differentiation to clarify whether in specific human pathological conditions (type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiac failure, coronary artery disease) specific alterations of the aforementioned factors could take place. Thirty-five patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or for aortic or mitral valve replacement were recruited into the study. There were 13 men and 22 women with a mean age of 64.8 +/- 13.4 years. A list of anamnestic, anthropometric, clinical, and instrumental data required for an optimal phenotypical characterization of the patients is reported. The small cardiac biopsy specimens were placed in the nourishing buffer, in a sterile tube provided the day of the procedure, to maintain the stability of the sample for several hours at room temperature. The cells were isolated by a dedicated protocol and then cultured in vitro. The sample was processed for total RNA extraction and levels of gene expression and protein activation of molecular effectors involved in the regulation of function and differentiation of human myocardium was analyzed. In particular, cardiac genes that modulate the oxidative stress response or the stress induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines (p66Shc, SOCS-1, SOCS-3) were analyzed. From a small sample of myocardium cardiac stem cells and cardiomyoblasts were also isolated and characterized. These cells showed a considerable proliferative capacity due to the fact that they demonstrate stability up to the eleventh passage. Analysis of gene expression in a subgroup of subjects showed the trend of a decrease in levels of expression of cardiac-specific transcription genes and oxidative stress-related proteins in tissues of diabetic patients compared with controls subjects. This trend is not confirmed in isolated cells. As for the coronary artery disease, diabetic cardiomyopathy could be associated with a reduction of the cardiac stem and progenitor cells pool. The expansion of the cardiac resident cells pool could be associated with a preservation of cardiac performance, suggesting that a preserved stamina compartment can counteract the impact of diabetes on the myocardium.", "journal": "Surgical technology international", "date": "2010-05-04", "authors": ["Emanuelade Cillis", "AnnaLeonardini", "LuigiLaviola", "FrancescoGiorgino", "Luigi de LucaTupputi Schinosa", "Alessandro SantoBortone"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Alteration of heart tissue protein profiles in acute cadmium-treated scallops Patinopecten yessoensis.", "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is an extremely toxic metal that induces a wide spectrum of toxic responses in organisms in the environment. In the present study, scallops (Patinopecten yessoensis), after acclimation for 1 week in the laboratory, were subjected to acute Cd chloride (CdCl\u2082) toxicity, and ultramorphological and proteomic changes in their heart tissues were analyzed and compared with those of the nonexposed control group. Electron microscopy showed that ultrastructures of the cytoplasm and mitochondria in scallop hearts were badly damaged, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed 32 protein spots that were differentially expressed after exposure to 10 mg/l CdCl\u2082 for 24 h. Of these spots, 8 were upregulated, 16 were downregulated, and 8 showed low expression. Proteins from these spots were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and database searching. The results indicated that these proteins are involved in the regulation of cell structure, transport, signal transduction, and metabolism. Among other things, four proteins-identified as amino acid adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase, and ATPase-were demonstrated to be especially associated with Cd toxicity. Some of the other proteins observed in this work are of particular interest in terms of their responses to Cd, which have not been reported previously.

Given that characteristics of dilated cardiomyopathy closely associate with atherosclerosis and are mediated by an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and TIMPs, we hypothesized that PARP-1 gene deletion may protect against HF-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dilatations by altering TIMP-2/MMPs balance in favor of a maintenance of tissue homeostasis.\nHemodynamic parameters determined by echocardiography were similar in ApoE(-/-) mice and PARP-1-deficient ApoE(-/-) mice (DKO) fed a regular diet (RD). However, histological analysis revealed that cardiomyocytes of ApoE(-/-) mice on RD were hypertrophied, displaying an enlarged cell body and nucleus, traits that were absent in DKO animals. HF diet-fed ApoE(-/-) mice exhibited increased interventricular septum, left ventricular (LV) internal dimension, LV volume, and LV mass in addition to a separation of myocardial fibers suggestive of dilated cardiomyopathy. PARP-1 gene deletion protected against these degenerative changes. MMP activity was dramatically increased in hearts of ApoE(-/-) mice on HF diet and was accompanied by increased collagen degradation, mast cell degranulation, and increased myocyte cell death. PARP-1 gene knockout was associated with increased TIMP-2 expression antagonizing, as a result, the damaging effects of active MMPs.\nThe present study demonstrates that PARP-1 gene deletion exerts protective effects against HF diet-induced dilated cardiomyopathy by maintaining increased expression of TIMP-2.

{"title": "MicroRNA regulation in cardiovascular disease.", "abstract": "The molecular biology dogma that DNA replicates its genetic information within nucleotide sequences and transcribes it to RNA where it codes for the generation of mRNA, failed to consider a significant part of the genetic code. Although it has been generally assumed that most genetic information is executed by proteins, recent evidence suggests that the majority of the genomes of mammals and other complex organisms is transcribed into non-coding RNA (ncRNA), many of which are alternatively spliced and/or processed into smaller functional RNA molecules. ncRNAs are predominantly involved in processes that require highly specific nucleic acid recognition, revealing a, so far hidden, layer of internal signals that control various levels of gene expression in developmental and (patho)physiological processes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large class of evolutionary conserved, small ncRNAs, typically 18 to 24 nucleotides in length, that primarily function at the posttranscriptional level by interacting with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of specific target mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner. Despite the advances in miRNA discovery, the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological processes is just rising, revealing their cellular functions in proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, the stress response and tumorgenesis. MiRNA expression profiling and the manipulation of their expression in cardiac tissue has led to the discovery of regulatory roles for these small ncRNAs during cardiac development and disease, implicating them in regulation of cardiac gene expression.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathogenic mechanisms that underlie atherosclerosis and AMI are undefined at present. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a member of the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors. It has been demonstrated previously that the expression of CaSR is increased in atherosclerotic cardiac tissue of rats. It has also been suggested that CaSR has a crucial role in cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion injury, apoptosis and hypertrophy. However, it remains to be determined whether an increase in the expression of CaSR influences the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to AMI. 2. The present study used cultured ventricular cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats to investigate the effect of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), ischaemia-reperfusion, GdCl(3) (an agonist of CaSR) and NPS-2390 (an antagonist of CaSR) on the expression of CaSR. The amount of apoptosis, alterations in the morphology of the cells, the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and components of critical mitochondrial pathways were also analysed. 3.

Application of GdCl(3) augmented these effects, and NPS-2390 decreased the expression of CaSR and reduced apoptosis. 4.

{"title": "New insights into application of cardiac monophasic action potential.", "abstract": "Monophasic action potential (MAP) recording plays an important role in a more direct view of human myocardial electrophysiology under both physiological and pathological conditions. The procedure of MAP measuring can be simply performed using the Seldinger technique, when MAP catheter is inserted through femoral vein into the right ventricle or through femoral artery to the left ventricle. The MAP method represents a very useful tool for electrophysiological research in cardiology. Its crucial importance is based upon the fact that it enables the study of the action potential (AP) of myocardial cell in vivo and, therefore, the study of the dynamic relation of this potential with all the organism variables. This can be particularly helpful in the case of arrhythmias. There are no doubts that physiological MAP recording accuracy is almost the same as transmembrane AP as was recently confirmed by anisotropic bidomain model of the cardiac tissue. MAP recording devices provide precise information not only on the local activation time but also on the entire local repolarization time course. Although the MAP does not reflect the absolute amplitude or upstroke velocity of transmembrane APs, it delivers highly accurate information on AP duration and configuration, including early afterdepolarizations as well as relative changes in transmembrane diastolic and systolic potential changes. Based on available data, the MAP probably reflects the transmembrane voltage of cells within a few millimeters of the exploring electrode. Thus MAP recordings offer the opportunity to study a variety of electrophysiological phenomena in the in situ heart (including effects of cycle length changes and antiarrhythmic drugs on AP duration).", "journal": "Physiological research", "date": "2010-04-22", "authors": ["S-GYang", "OKittnar"], "doi": "10.33549/physiolres.931864"}
{"title": "Effects of ravuconazole treatment on parasite load and immune response in dogs experimentally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi.", "abstract": "In this work, we investigated the in vivo activity of ravuconazole against the Y and Berenice-78 Trypanosoma cruzi strains using acutely infected dogs as hosts. Ravuconazole was well tolerated, as no significant side effects were observed during the treatment using 6.0 mg/kg twice a day (12 mg/kg/day) for up to 90 days. In all treated animals, parasitemia was permanently suppressed by the first day of treatment, independently of the parasite strain. Cultures of blood obtained posttreatment were negative for 90% of the animals, confirming that the drug induced a marked reduction in the parasite load. The results of PCR tests for T. cruzi in blood performed 1 month posttreatment were consistently negative for three of five and two of five animals infected with the Y and Berenice-78 strains, respectively. All ravuconazole-treated dogs consistently had negative serological test results during and until 30 days after treatment, regardless of the therapeutic scheme used. However, after the end of treatment, an increase in specific antibody levels was observed in all treated animals, although the antibody levels were always significantly lower than those of the nontreated control dogs. Despite being unable to induce a parasitological cure, ravuconazole treatment led to significant reductions in the levels of gamma interferon expression and lesions in cardiac tissues in animals infected with the Y strain, while the level of interleukin-10 mRNA expression increased. We conclude that ravuconazole has potent suppressive but not curative activity in the canine model of acute Chagas' disease, probably due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties (half-life, 8.8 h). The longer half-life of ravuconazole in humans (4 to 8 days) makes it a promising drug for assessment for use as chemotherapy in human Chagas' disease.", "journal": "Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy", "date": "2010-04-21", "authors": ["L\u00edvia de FigueiredoDiniz", "Ivo SantanaCaldas", "Paulo Marcos da MattaGuedes", "GeovamCrepalde", "Martade Lana", "Cl\u00e1udia MartinsCarneiro", "Andr\u00e9Talvani", "Julio AlbertoUrbina", "Maria TerezinhaBahia"], "doi": "10.1128/AAC.01742-09"}

However, the pathogenic link with other aspects of the disease is less clear. To assess the potential role of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) overactivity in driving these cardiovascular abnormalities, we studied a novel transgenic mouse model characterized by ligand-dependent activation of TGF-beta signaling in fibroblasts.\nThe transgenic mouse strain Tbeta RIIDeltak-fib is characterized by balanced ligand-dependent upregulation of TGF-beta signaling. Aortic and cardiac tissues were examined with histologic, biochemical, and isolated organ bath studies. Vascular and perivascular architecture was examined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and special stains including immunostaining for TGF-beta1 and phospho-Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3). Confirmatory aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation, phenotype, and functional assays, including signaling responses to exogenous TGF-beta and endothelin-1, were performed. Aortic ring contractile responses to direct and receptor-mediated stimulation were assessed.\nAortic ring contractility and relaxation were diminished compared with wild-type controls, and this was associated with aortic adventitial fibrosis confirmed histologically and with Sircol assay. TGF-beta1 and pSmad 2/3 expression was increased in the adventitia and smooth muscle layer of the aorta. Aortic smooth muscle cells from transgenic animals showed significant upregulation of TGF-beta- responsive genes important for cytoskeletal function, such as transgelin and smoothelin, which were then resistant to further stimulation with exogenous TGF-beta1. These cells promoted significantly more contraction of free floating type I collagen lattices when compared with the wild-type, but were again resistant to exogenous TGF-beta1 stimulation. Aortic ring responses to receptor-mediated contraction were reduced in the transgenic animals. Specifically, bosentan reduced endothelin-mediated contraction in wild-type animals, but had no effect in transgenic animals, and endothelin axis gene expression was altered in transgenic animals. Transgenic mice developed cardiac fibrosis.\nThe histologic, biochemical, and functional phenotype of this transgenic mouse model of scleroderma offers insight into the altered biomechanical properties previously reported for large elastic arteries in human SSc and suggests a role for perturbed TGF-beta and endothelin activity in this process.", "journal": "Arthritis research & therapy", "date": "2010-04-20", "authors": ["Emma CDerrett-Smith", "AudreyDooley", "KorsaKhan", "XuShi-wen", "DavidAbraham", "Christopher PDenton"], "doi": "10.1186/ar2986\n10.1016/j.rdc.2008.01.001\n10.1093/rheumatology/keg371\n10.1053/ejvs.2002.1845\n10.1002/art.22634\n10.1093/rheumatology/keh478\n10.1093/rheumatology/kel120\n10.1038/nm0195-74\n10.1186/ar1976\n10.1038/ng1116\n10.1038/ng1511\n10.1074/jbc.M413134200\n10.1074/jbc.M101397200\n10.1002/1529-0131(200103)44:3<712::AID-ANR121>3.0.CO;2-1\n10.1074/jbc.M300636200\n10.1038/jid.2008.171\n10.1073/pnas.1735526100\n10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-research0034\n10.1002/art.23379\n10.1091/mbc.E03-12-0902\n10.1002/art.23134\n10.1083/jcb.134.2.401\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.05016.x\n10.1074/jbc.M008340200\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.02.275\n10.1002/art.22328\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.2002.19614.x\n10.1136/ard.59.1.39\n10.1159/000113603\n10.1097/00002281-200111000-00008"}

{"title": "Sphingosine kinase interacting protein is an A-kinase anchoring protein specific for type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase.", "abstract": "The compartmentalization of kinases and phosphatases plays an important role in the specificity of second-messenger-mediated signaling events. Localization of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is mediated by interaction of its regulatory subunit (PKA-R) with the versatile family of A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Most AKAPs bind avidly to PKA-RII, while some have dual specificity for both PKA-RI and PKA-RII; however, no mammalian PKA-RI-specific AKAPs have thus far been assigned. This has mainly been attributed to the observation that PKA-RI is more cytosolic than the more heavily compartmentalized PKA-RII. Chemical proteomics screens of the cAMP interactome in mammalian heart tissue recently identified sphingosine kinase type 1-interacting protein (SKIP, SPHKAP) as a putative novel AKAP. Biochemical characterization now shows that SPHKAP can be considered as the first mammalian AKAP that preferentially binds to PKA-RIalpha. Recombinant human SPHKAP functions as an RI-specific AKAP that utilizes the characteristic AKAP amphipathic helix for interaction. Further chemical proteomic screening utilizing differential binding characteristics of specific cAMP resins confirms SPHKAPs endogenous specificity for PKA-RI directly in mammalian heart and spleen tissue. Immunolocalization studies revealed that recombinant SPHKAP is expressed in the cytoplasm, where PKA-RIalpha also mainly resides. Alignment of SPHKAPs' amphipathic helix with peptide models of PKA-RI- or PKA-RII-specific anchoring domains shows that it has largely only PKA-RIalpha characteristics. Being the first mammalian PKA-RI-specific AKAP with cytosolic localization, SPHKAP is a very promising model for studying the function of the less explored cytosolic PKA-RI signaling nodes.", "journal": "Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology", "date": "2010-04-16", "authors": ["DuangnapaKovanich", "Marcel A Gvan der Heyden", "Thin ThinAye", "Toon A Bvan Veen", "Albert J RHeck", "ArjenScholten"], "doi": "10.1002/cbic.201000058"}

Using real-time PCR, spectrophotometric and western blotting techniques, we sought to determine the presence, abundance and activity level of Nnt in human heart tissues and to discern whether these are altered in chronic severe heart failure. Left ventricular levels of the NNT gene and protein expression did not differ significantly between the non-failing donor (NF) and heart failure (HF) group. Notably, compared to NF, Nnt activity rates in the HF group were 18% lower, which coincided with significantly higher levels of oxidized glutathione, lower glutathione reductase activity, lower NADPH and a lower GSH/GSSG ratio. In the failing human heart a partial loss of Nnt activity adversely impacts NADPH-dependent enzymes and the capacity to maintain membrane potential, thus contributing to a decline in bioenergetic capacity, redox regulation and antioxidant defense, exacerbating oxidative damage to cellular proteins.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2010-04-15", "authors": ["Freya LSheeran", "JanRydstr\u00f6m", "Mikhail IShakhparonov", "Nikolay BPestov", "SalvatorePepe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.04.002"}

An amino acid alignment with other mammalian GYS1 showed that the phosphorylation sites in eGYS1 are completely conserved.

The myocyte nucleus is mechanically connected to the cell membrane via cytoskeletal elements, making it a target for the cellular response to perturbation of the ECM. However, the role of ECM spatial configuration and myocyte shape on nuclear location and morphology is unknown. In this study, printed ECM proteins were used to configure the geometry of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Engineered one- and two-dimensional tissue constructs and single myocyte islands were assayed using live fluorescence imaging to examine nuclear position, morphology and motion as a function of the imposed ECM geometry during diastolic relaxation and systolic contraction. Image analysis showed that anisotropic tissue constructs cultured on microfabricated ECM lines possessed a high degree of nuclear alignment similar to that found in vivo; nuclei in isotropic tissues were polymorphic in shape with an apparently random orientation. Nuclear eccentricity was also increased for the anisotropic tissues, suggesting that intracellular forces deform the nucleus as the cell is spatially confined. During systole, nuclei experienced increasing spatial confinement in magnitude and direction of displacement as tissue anisotropy increased, yielding anisotropic deformation. Thus, the nature of nuclear displacement and deformation during systole appears to rely on a combination of the passive myofibril spatial organization and the active stress fields induced by contraction.

A systemic review.", "abstract": "Although Chagas disease was only discovered in 1909, it began millions of years ago as an enzootic disease among wild animals. Its transmission to man began accidentally as an anthropozoonosis when mankind invaded wild ecotopes. Endemic Chagas disease became established as a zoonosis over the last 200-300 years through deforestation for agriculture and livestock rearing and adaptation of triatomines to dwellings and to humans and domestic animals as food sources. When T. cruzi is transmitted to man, it invades the bloodstream and lymphatic system and lodges in muscle and heart tissue, the digestive system and phagocytic cells. Through this, it causes inflammatory lesions and an immune response, particularly mediated by CD4(+), CD8(+), IL2 and IL4, with cell and neuron destruction and fibrosis. These processes lead to blockage of the heart's conductive system, arrhythmias, heart failure, aperistalsis and dilatation of hollow viscera, especially the esophagus and colons. Chagas disease is characterized by an acute phase with or without symptoms, with (or more often without) T. cruzi penetration signs (inoculation chagoma or Roma\u00f1a's sign), fever, adenomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly and patent parasitemia; and a chronic phase: indeterminate (asymptomatic, with normal electrocardiogram and heart, esophagus and colon X-rays) or cardiac, digestive or cardiac/digestive forms.

Interbeat intervals (IBIs) were analyzed as a function of distance during S1S2 protocols and during pacing at alternating cycle lengths. Supernormal conduction was induced by decreasing [K(+)](o).

During alternant pacing, the amplitude of IBI alternans converged with a shorter length constant, determined also by the action potential duration restitution slope.

To assure a precise coordination of both temporally and spatially transduction of intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations to downstream signaling networks and target operations, Ca(2+) cycling regulation in muscle tissue is conducted by a plethora of diverse molecules. Ca(2+) S100A1 is a member of the Ca(2+)-binding S100 protein family and represents the most abundant S100 isoform in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Early studies revealed distinct expression patterns of S100A1 in healthy and diseased cardiac tissue from animal models and humans. Further elaborate investigations uncovered S100A1 protein as a basic requirement for striated muscle Ca(2+) handling integrity. S100A1 is a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) cycling and contractile performance. S100A1-mediated inotropy unfolds independent and on top of beta AR-stimulated contractility with unchanged beta AR downstream signaling. S100A1 has further been detected at different sites within the cardiac sarcomere indicating potential roles in myofilament function. More recently, a study reported a mitochondrial location of S100A1 in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, normalizing the level of S100A1 protein by means of viral cardiac gene transfer in animal heart failure models resulted in a disrupted progression towards cardiac failure and enhanced survival.

{"title": "Electric field stimulation integrated into perfusion bioreactor for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "We describe herein the features of a novel cultivation system, combining electrical stimulation with medium perfusion for producing thick, functional cardiac patches. A custom-made electrical stimulator was integrated via inserting two carbon rod electrodes into a perfusion bioreactor, housing multiple neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat cardiac cell constructs between two 96% open-pore-area fixing nets. The stimulator produced adjustable stimulation waveform (i.e., duty cycle, number of stimulating channels, maximum stimulation amplitude, etc.), specially designed for cardiac cell stimulation. The cell constructs were subjected to a homogenous fluid flow regime and electrical stimulation under conditions optimal for cell excitation. The stimulation threshold in the bioreactor was set by first determining its value in a Petri dish under a microscope, and then matching the current density in the two cultivation systems by constructing electric field models. The models were built by Comsol Multiphysics software using the exact three-dimensional geometry of the two cultivation systems. These models illustrate, for the first time, the local electric conditions required for cardiomyocyte field excitation and they confirmed the uniformity of the electrical field around the cell constructs. Bioreactor cultivation for only 4 days under perfusion and continuous electrical stimulus (74.4 mA/cm\u00b2, 2 ms, bipolar, 1 Hz) promoted cell elongation and striation in the cell constructs and enhanced the expression level of Connexin-43, the gap junction protein responsible for cell-cell coupling. These results thus confirm the validity of the electrical field model in predicting the optimal electrical stimulation in a rather complex cultivation system, a perfusion bioreactor.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Akt1 genetic deficiency limits hypothermia cardioprotection following murine cardiac arrest.", "abstract": "Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) cardioprotection has recently been associated with increased Akt signaling in a rat model of cardiac arrest. However, it is not known whether Akt is required for this beneficial effect of TH. We used a mouse model of cardiac arrest demonstrating TH cardioprotection to study the response of mice deficient in an Akt1 allele. We hypothesized that Akt1 mediates TH cardioprotection and that decreases in Akt1 content would diminish such protection. Adult C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice underwent an 8-min cardiac arrest. After 6 min, the mice were randomized to normothermia (WT(NT), 37 degrees C) or TH (WT(TH), 30 degrees C). Following cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the animals were hemodynamically monitored for 240 min (R240). At R240, cardiac tissue Akt content and phosphorylation were assayed. Studies were repeated in Akt1 heterozygous (Akt1(+/-)) mice. As a result, baseline characteristics and ROSC rates were equivalent across groups. At R240, WT(TH) mice exhibited lower heart rate, larger stroke volume, and higher cardiac output than WT(NT) animals (P < 0.05). Cardioprotection in WT(TH) at R240 was associated with increased cardiac Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 compared with that in WT(NT) (P < 0.05). TH-associated alterations in Akt phosphorylation, stroke volume, heart rate, and cardiac output were abrogated in Akt1(+/-) animals. In conclusion, TH improves post-ROSC cardiac function and increases Akt phosphorylation in WT, but not Akt1(+/-), mice. The Akt1 isoform appears necessary for TH-mediated cardioprotection.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The present report documents such a plan, which involves interstitial multisite stimulation at a subcellular to cellular size scale, and verifies the performance of the method through biophysical modeling. Although elements of the plan have been analyzed previously, their performance as a whole is considered here in a comprehensive way. Our analyses take advantage of a three-dimensional structural framework in which interstitial, intracellular, and membrane components are coupled to one another on the fine size scale, and electrodes are separated from one another as in arrays we fabricate routinely. With this arrangement, determination of passive tissue resistances can be made from measurements taken on top of the currents flowing in active tissue. In particular, our results show that measurements taken at multiple frequencies and electrode separations provide powerful predictions of the underlying tissue resistances in all geometric dimensions. Because of the small electrode size, separation of interstitial from intracellular compartment contributions is readily achieved.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

LQT2-linked missense mutations have been extensively studied in noncardiac heterologous expression systems, where biogenic (protein trafficking) and biophysical (gating and permeation) abnormalities have been postulated to underlie the loss-of-function phenotype associated with LQT2 channels. Little is known about the properties of LQT2-linked hERG channel proteins in native cardiomyocyte systems. In this study, we expressed wild-type (WT) hERG and three LQT2-linked mutations in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes and studied their electrophysiological and biochemical properties. Compared with WT hERG channels, the LQT2 missense mutations G601S and N470D hERG exhibited altered protein trafficking and underwent pharmacological correction, and N470D hERG channels gated at more negative voltages. The DeltaY475 hERG deletion mutation trafficked similar to WT hERG channels, gated at more negative voltages, and had rapid deactivation kinetics, and these properties were confirmed in both neonatal mouse cardiomyocyte and human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell expression systems. Differences between the cardiomyocytes and HEK-293 cell expression systems were that hERG current densities were reduced 10-fold and deactivation kinetics were accelerated 1.5- to 2-fold in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. An important finding of this work is that pharmacological correction of trafficking-deficient LQT2 mutations, as a potential innovative approach to therapy, is possible in native cardiac tissue.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

In addition, liver and cardiac histoarchitecture changes were also studied. Curcumin treatment inhibited carrageenin and albumin induced edema, cotton pellet granuloma formation. The increased relative weight of liver and heart in CCl(4) induced liver injury and isoproterenol induced cardiac necrosis were also reduced by curcumin treatment. Elevated serum marker enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased lipid peroxidation, decreased gluthione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in edematous, granulomatus, liver and heart tissues during inflammation, liver injury and cardiac necrosis, respectively. Curcumin treatment reversed all these above mentioned biochemical changes significantly in all animal models studied. Even histoarchitecture alterations observed in liver injury and cardiac necrosis observed were partially reversed (improved) by curcumin treatments. In in vitro experiments too curcumin inhibited iron catalyzed lipid peroxidation in liver homogenates, scavenged nitric oxide spontaneously generated from nitroprusside and inhibited heat induced hemolysis of rat erythrocytes.

TRB3 has been reported to inhibit the activity of Akt protein kinases. TRB3 gene expression is highly regulated in many cell types, and amino acid starvation, hypoxia, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress promotes TRB3 expression in noncardiac cells.\nThe objective of this work was to examine TRB3 expression and function in cultured cardiac myocytes and in mouse heart.\nAgents that induced ER stress increased TRB3 expression in cultured cardiac myocytes while blocking insulin-stimulated Akt activation in these cells. Knockdown of TRB3 in cultured cardiac myocytes reversed the effects of ER stress on insulin signaling. Experimental myocardial infarction led to increased TRB3 expression in murine heart tissue in the infarct border zone suggesting that ER stress may play a role in pathological cardiac remodeling. Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of TRB3 were generated and they exhibited normal contractile function but altered cardiac signal transduction and metabolism with reduced cardiac glucose oxidation rates. Transgenic TRB3 mice were also sensitized to infarct expansion and cardiac myocyte apoptosis in the infarct border zone after myocardial infarction.\nThese results demonstrate that TRB3 induction is a significant aspect of the ER stress response in cardiac myocytes and that TRB3 antagonizes cardiac glucose metabolism and cardiac myocyte survival.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2010-04-03", "authors": ["JoanAvery", "SharonEtzion", "Brian JDeBosch", "XiaohuaJin", "Traian SLupu", "BasselBeitinjaneh", "JacobGrand", "AttilaKovacs", "NandakumarSambandam", "Anthony JMuslin"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211920"}

To investigate GH effects on obesity, initially 32 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups (n=16): control (C) was fed standard-chow and water and hypercaloric (H) was fed hypercaloric chow and 30% sucrose in its drinking water. After 45 days, both C and H groups were divided into two subgroups (n=8): C+PL was fed standard-chow, water and received saline subcutaneously; C+GH was fed standard-chow, water, and received 2 mg/kg/day GH subcutaneously; H+PL was fed hypercaloric diet, 30% sucrose in its drinking water, and received saline subcutaneously; and H+GH was fed hypercaloric diet, 30% sucrose in its drinking water, and received GH subcutaneously. After 75 days of total experimental period, H+PL rats were considered obese, having higher body weight, body mass index, Lee-index, and atherogenic index (AI) compared to C+PL. Obesity was accompanied by enhanced myocardial lipid hydroperoxide (LH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well of depressed energy expenditure (RMR) and oxygen consumption(VO (2))/body weight. H+GH rats had higher fasting RMR, as well as lower AI and myocardial LH than H+PL. Comparing C+GH with C+PL, despite no effects on morphometric parameters, lipid profile, myocardial LH, and LDH activity, GH enhanced fed RMR and myocardial pyruvate dehydrogenase. In conclusion, the present study brought new insights into the GH effects on obesity related cardiovascular damage demonstrating, for the first time, that GH regulated cardiac metabolic pathways, enhanced energy expenditure and improved the lipid profile in obesity condition.

However, the actual localization and cellular sources of pentraxin 3 in ischemic and infectious cardiac pathology have not been carefully defined.\nIn this study, using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed pentraxin 3 expression in the heart tissues of patients with acute myocardial infarction at different time points after the ischemic event. In addition, we studied the heart tissues of patients with infectious myocarditis (fungi, bacteria, and protozoa) and patients who died of noncardiac events with normal heart histology.\nIn acute myocardial infarction cases, we observed pentraxin 3 localized within and around ischemic lesions. On the contrary, no pentraxin 3 was observed in normal heart areas. In early ischemic lesions, pentraxin 3 was localized primarily in granulocytes; in more advanced acute myocardial infarction, pentraxin 3 positivity was found in the interstitium and in the cytoplasm of macrophages and the endothelium, whereas most granulocytes did not express pentraxin 3, presumably as a consequence of degranulation. In infectious myocarditis, pentraxin 3 was present and localized within and around histological lesions, associated with macrophage, endothelial cell, and, more rarely, myocardiocyte and granulocyte positivities. As observed in acute myocardial infarction patients, no pentraxin 3 staining was found in normal heart areas.\nThus, neutrophils are an early source of pentraxin 3 in acute myocardial infarction and presumably other inflammatory heart disorders.

Our goal was to get insights into this mechanism by analyzing the survival kinetics of allogeneic and syngeneic cell transplants under different tissue conditions. Two MSC cell banks, stably and equally expressing the luciferase reporter construct, were developed for these studies and injected directly to the myocardium of Lewis rat recipients under syngeneic or allogeneic transplantation conditions. Cell survival was monitored by real-time fashion for up to 2 weeks, using optical imaging device (IVIS, Xenogen Corp.). We found that both syngeneic and allogeneic grafts reduced significantly in size during the first week of transplantation, either in the normal or in the late infarcted heart (5 days after MI) and allotransplants became always smaller than syngeneic grafts during this period. Low dose of cyclosporine A treatment had a benefit on both allo- and syngeneic graft sizes, suggesting that multiple mechanisms play a role in early graft reduction. The MSC characteristic factors IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and VEGF were well above the control level in the heart tissue at 4 days after cell injection, suggesting that the peak therapeutic effect of MSC can be expected during the first week of the administration. Although allogeneic cells induced immunoglobulin production, their biological effects (cell survival, factor productions) are very similar to the syngeneic transplants and therefore they could deliver the same therapeutic effect as the syngeneic cells.

The polyphenol resveratrol has been reported to regress PO-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats. Our aim in this study was to assess the effectiveness of resveratrol on VO-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to aortocaval shunt and abdominal aortic banding surgeries to create VO and PO, respectively; sham-operated rats served as controls. To arrest the development of cardiac hypertrophy, daily resveratrol treatment (2.5 mg/kg body weight) was started 2 d postsurgery for 26 d and assessed by echocardiography at 2, 14, and 28 d postsurgery. Similarly, to regress cardiac hypertrophy resveratrol treatment was started after structural and functional abnormalities developed (14 d postsurgery) for 14 d and assessed by echocardiography at 14 and 28 d postsurgery. VO surgeries induced eccentric hypertrophy characterized by increased left ventricle internal dimensions (LVID) without wall thickening. Conversely, PO induced concentric hypertrophy with increased wall thickness without change in LVID. Lipid peroxidation, a marker for oxidative stress, was significantly elevated in both PO and VO rats.

{"title": "Engineering a novel three-dimensional contractile myocardial patch with cell sheets and decellularised matrix.", "abstract": "A persistent problem in generating a functional myocardial patch is maintaining contractions in a thicker construct. Thus far, we have successfully created contracting constructs with a defined directionality by seeding neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CMs) on decellularised porcine small-intestinal submucosa (SIS). Here, we report our efforts in generating a thicker contracting construct by combining CM cell sheets with CM-seeded SIS.\nPorcine SIS was decellularised, opened along the longitudinal axis, fixed in a metal frame (45 mm \u00d7 25 mm) and seeded onto the submucosal side with neonatal rat CMs at a density of 1.8 \u00d7 10(5) cells cm(-2). CM sheets were prepared using temperature-responsive dishes by seeding CMs at a density of 4.0 \u00d7 10(5)cells cm(-2). Three days after CM seeding, one- or three-layered CMs sheet(s) were stacked onto seeded SIS. Construct contraction was observed for an additional 10 days followed by histological analysis.\nStacked CM sheets contracted spontaneously and synchronously with seeded SIS after adherence. A large portion of analysed constructs showed a defined contraction direction, parallel to the longitudinal axis (seeded SIS: 83%, seeded SIS+1 sheet: 70%, seeded SIS+3 layered sheets: 71%). This finding was in agreement to the histological finding of aligned CMs parallel to the longitudinal axis. The thickness of seeded SIS with and without three-layered sheets was approximately 800 \u03bcm and 500 \u03bcm, respectively.\nBy combining layered CM sheets with CM-seeded SIS, a three-dimensional myocardial patch with contraction in a defined direction was successfully generated.

Nevertheless, these drugs are later applied in diseased humans with a reduced repolarization reserve. It would be optimal to set up a preclinical screening tool to estimate the proarrhythmic potential of drugs in human cardiac tissue with a reduced repolarization reserve in vitro.\nIn our study spontaneously beating human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes clusters (hESCM) and murine ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes (mESCMs) were plated onto micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) to record the extracelluar field potentials (FPs) as well as effects of several antiarrhythmic drugs. In line with clinical observations the class III antiarrhythmic drugs (+/-)-sotalol, E4031 and class I antiarrhythmic drug quinidine led to a prolongation of the cardiac repolarization phase (FP duration, FPdur) and a decrease of the FP frequency. Verapamil (a class IV antiarrhythmic drug) decreased the FP frequency and shortened FPdur. Both, quinidine and verapamil, but not (+/-)-sotalol or E4031 decreased conduction velocities in hESCM clusters. Moreover, (+/-)-sotalol exerted stronger effects on FPdur in early developmental stages of hESCMs, as proof for a reduced repolarization reserve. The EC(50) of the (+/-)-sotalol-induced prolongation of the FPdur was higher in mESCMs than in hESCMs implying species-dependent differences in cardiac repolarization. Likewise, the incidence of drug-induced early recurrent depolarization (ERDs) was higher in mESCMs than hESCMs.\nThe combined measurement of drug effects on FP parameters in hESCMs and mESCMs serves as a reliable in vitro model for preclinical studies of drug safety.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2010-03-25", "authors": ["HuaminLiang", "MatthiasMatzkies", "HeribertSchunkert", "MingTang", "HendrikBonnemeier", "J\u00fcrgenHescheler", "MichaelReppel"], "doi": "10.1159/000303051"}

Cardiac muscle engineering is compromised by a particularly high rate of cardiomyocyte death. Here we hypothesized that PDGF-BB stimulation can (1) protect cardiomyocytes from apoptosis, (2) enhance myocyte content in and (3) consequently optimize contractile performance of engineered heart tissue (EHT). We investigated the effects of PDGF-receptor activation in neonatal rat heart monolayer- and EHT-cultures by isometric contraction experiments, cytomorphometry, (3)H-thymidine and (3)H-phenylalanine incorporation assays, quantitative PCR (calsequestrin 2, alpha-cardiac and skeletal actin, atrial natriuretic factor, alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain), immunoblotting (activated caspase 3, Akt-phosphorylation), and ELISA (cell death detection). PDGF-BB did not induce hypertrophy or proliferation in cardiomyocytes, but enhanced contractile performance of EHT. This effect was concentration-dependent (E(max) 10 ng/ml) and maximal only after transient PDGF-BB stimulation (culture days 0-7; total culture duration: 12 days). Improvement of contractile function was associated with higher cardiomyocyte content, as a consequence of PDGF-BB mediated protection from apoptosis (lower caspase-3 activity particularly in cardiomyocytes in PDGF-BB treated vs. untreated EHTs). We confirmed the anti-apoptotic effect of PDGF-BB in monolayer cultures and observed that PI3-kinase inhibition with LY294002 attenuated PDGF-BB-mediated cardiomyocyte protection. We conclude that PDGF-BB does not induce hypertrophy or proliferation, but confers an anti-apoptotic effect on cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Calcium-sensing receptor activation contributed to apoptosis stimulates TRPC6 channel in rat neonatal ventricular myocytes.", "abstract": "Capacitative calcium entry (CCE) refers to the influx of calcium through plasma membrane channels activated on depletion of endoplasmic sarcoplasmic/reticulum (ER/SR) Ca(2+) stores, which is performed mainly by the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. TRP channels are expressed in cardiomyocytes. Calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is also expressed in rat cardiac tissue and plays an important role in mediating cardiomyocyte apoptosis. However, there are no data regarding the link between CaR and TRP channels in rat heart. In this study, in rat neonatal myocytes, by Ca(2+) imaging, we found that the depletion of ER/SR Ca(2+) stores by thapsigargin (TG) elicited a transient rise in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)), followed by sustained increase depending on extracellular Ca(2+). But, TRP channels inhibitor (SKF96365), not L-type channels or the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger inhibitors, inhibited [Ca(2+)](i) relatively high. Then, we found that the stimulation of CaR with its activator gadolinium chloride (GdCl(3)) or by an increased extracellular Ca(2+)([Ca(2+)](o)) increased the concentration of intracelluar Ca(2+), whereas, the sustained elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) was reduced in the presence of SKF96365. Similarly, the duration of [Ca(2+)](i) increase was also shortened in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+). Western blot analysis showed that GdCl(3) increased the expression of TRPC6, which was reversed by SKF96365. Additionally, SKF96365 reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by GdCl(3). Our results suggested that CCE exhibited in rat neonatal myocytes and CaR activation induced Ca(2+)-permeable cationic channels TRPCs to gate the CCE, for which TRPC6 was one of the most likely candidates.

Cardiac tissue kallikrein may play a greater cardioprotective role in type 2 diabetic than in non-diabetic patients and contribute to the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy in type 2 diabetic patients.

{"title": "Deciphering modifications in swine cardiac troponin I by top-down high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry.", "abstract": "Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle, and its modification represents a key mechanism in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation. cTnI is often referred to as the \"gold-standard\" serum biomarker for diagnosing patients with acute cardiac injury since it is unique to the heart and released into the circulation following necrotic death of cardiac tissue. The swine (Sus scrofa) heart model is extremely valuable for cardiovascular research since the heart anatomy and coronary artery distribution of swine are almost identical to those of humans. Herein, we report a comprehensive characterization of the modifications in swine cTnI using top-down high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry in conjugation with immunoaffinity chromatography purification. High-resolution high accuracy mass spectrometry revealed that swine cTnI affinity purified from domestic pig hearts was N-terminally acetylated and phosphorylated. Electron capture disassociation is uniquely suited for localization of labile phosphorylations, which unambiguously identified Ser22/Ser23 as the only basally phosphorylated sites that are well-known to be regulated by protein kinase A and protein kinase C. Moreover, a combination of tandem mass spectrometry with sequence homology alignment effectively localized a single amino acid polymorphism, V116A, representing a novel genetic variant of swine cTnI. Overall, our studies demonstrated the unique power of top-down high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry in the characterization of protein modifications, including labile phosphorylation and unexpected sequence variants.", "journal": "Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry", "date": "2010-03-13", "authors": ["JiangZhang", "XintongDong", "Timothy AHacker", "YingGe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jasms.2010.02.005"}

This study is designed to examine the effects of Y-27632, a selective Rho-kinase inhibitor, on organophosphate-induced cardiac toxicity and mortality in rats. Rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control (corn oil), dichlorvos (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally), and 1- and 10-mg/kg Y-27632 + dichlorvos groups. After 6 hours of intraperitoneal injection, venous blood and cardiac samples were obtained, biochemical or immunohistochemical analyses were performed, and the intensity of muscle fasciculation was recorded. Serum cholinesterase activities were suppressed with dichlorvos, and these reductions were inhibited with Y-27632 pretreatment. Serum creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB activities, and myoglobin and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide concentrations were not markedly affected with poisoning or Y-27632. Although serum nitric oxide concentrations did not change with dichlorvos, cardiac nitric oxide levels were markedly increased with Y-27632 pretreatment. Cardiac glutathione levels also increased with 1 mg/kg Y-27632. There was no staining for apoptosis, and immunohistochemical analyses of inducible nitric oxide synthase showed no change in cardiac tissue for all of the groups. Both doses of Y-27632 abolished mortality in rats with acute dichlorvos exposure (100% survival). These results show that administration of Rho-kinase inhibitor can produce protective effects against dichlorvos intoxication in rats.

Astemizole causes torsades de pointes, which is a type of ventricular tachycardia. We administered astemizole (dosage: 20, 60 mg/kg) to male Sprague-Dawley rats, using an oral gavage. Cardiac tissue and PBMCs were collected from the rats 4 h after treatment. Gene expression profiles were obtained using an Affymetrix GeneChip. The most deregulated genes were associated with energy metabolism pathways and calcium ion homeostasis in the heart of astemizole-treated rats. The most altered genes in the PBMCs were those involved in developmental processes and cardiotoxicity. Genes related to the response to oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, heat shock proteins, hypoxia, immunity, and inflammation were also deregulated in the heart and PBMCs. These data provide further insight into the genetic pathways affected by astemizole. In addition, the simultaneously deregulated genes identified herein may be further studied.

In this way, authentic cardiomyocytes have been obtained from iPS and recently demonstrated in proof-of-principle studies to repair infarcted heart. Optimizing the cardiogenic potential of iPS progeny would ensure a maximized yield of bioengineered cardiac tissue. Here, we reprogrammed fibroblasts in the presence or absence of c-MYC to determine if the acquired cardiogenicity is sensitive to the method of nuclear reprogramming. Using lentiviral constructs that expressed stemness factors SOX2, OCT4, and KLF4 with or without c-MYC, iPS clones generated through fibroblast reprogramming demonstrated indistinguishable characteristics for 5 days of differentiation with similar cell morphology, growth rates, and chimeric embryo integration. However, 4-factor c-MYC dependent nuclear reprogramming produced iPS progeny that consistently prolonged the expression of pluripotent Oct-4 and Fgf4 genes and repressed cardiac differentiation. In contrast, 3-factor c-MYC-less iPS clones efficiently up-regulated pre-cardiac (CXCR4, Flk-1, and Mesp1/2) and cardiac (Nkx2.5, Mef2c, and Myocardin) gene expression patterns. In fact, 3-factor iPS progeny demonstrated early and robust cardiogenesis during in vitro differentiation with consistent beating activity, sarcomere maturation, and rhythmical intracellular calcium dynamics.

The question arises whether damage of endothelial or other cells could be observed in intact animals fed with a trioleate-enriched diet.\nDunkin-Hartley guinea pigs were fed with a trioleate-enriched diet for 5 months. Advanced atherosclerotic changes of the aorta and the coronary arteries could not be seen but the arteries appeared in a pre-atherosclerotic stage of vascular remodelling. However, the weight and size of the hearts were lower than in controls and the number of apoptotic myocytes increased in the hearts of trioleate-fed animals. To confirm the idea that oleic acid may have caused this apoptosis by activation of PP2C, cultured cardiomyocytes from guinea pigs and mice were treated with various lipids. It was demonstrable that oleic acid dose-dependently caused apoptosis of cardiomyocytes from both species, yet, similar to previous experiments with cultured neurons and endothelial cells, stearic acid, elaidic acid and oleic acid methylester did not. The apoptotic effect caused by oleic acid was diminished when PP2C alpha and beta were downregulated by siRNA showing that PP2C was causally involved in apoptosis caused by oleic acid.\nThe glycerol trioleate diet given to guinea pigs for 5 months did not cause marked atherosclerosis but clearly damaged the hearts by activating PP2C alpha and beta. The diet used with 24% (wt/wt) glycerol trioleate is not comparable to human diets. The detrimental role of MUFAs for guinea pig heart tissue in vivo is shown for the first time.

Verapamil, a phenyalkylamine, belongs to the group of calcium channel antagonists (class IV antiarrhythmic drugs) and is frequently used for the management of supraventricular tachycardia and for ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Verapamil heart tissue and plasma levels after intraperitoneal dosing of spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats were investigated. Transcript expression of various ion channels, ion transporters, calcium handling, and cytoskeletal proteins by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were further investigated. There was no difference in plasma pharmacokinetics when hypertensive and normotensive animals were compared. Strikingly, the tissue clearance of verapamil was highly significantly impaired in heart tissue of hypertensive animals. Gene expression analysis showed the repression of many cardiac-specific genes in spontaneously hypertensive but not in normotensive rats, therefore providing evidence for different modes of action in healthy and hypertrophic hearts. Verapamil heart tissue levels differed dramatically between normotensive and hypertensive rats and resulted in repression of many cardiac ion channels, ion transporters, and calcium handling proteins. A disturbed ion homeostasis induced by critical tissue levels of verapamil is therefore proposed as a molecular rational for its pro-arrhythmogenic activity.

Both MI and CHF are characterized by cardiac muscle damage caused by massive cardiomyocyte death and reduced cardiac function. Cellular therapy aimed at using cells to improve cardiac function and/or regenerate new myocardium, has been extensively investigated for cardiac repair. Two strategies have been currently taken for cellular transplantation, including in situ cellular cardiomyoplasty and cardiac tissue engineering. The in situ cellular cardiomyoplasty strategy delivers cells directly into the infarcted myocardium. A variety of cell types has been shown to be beneficial in cardiac repair. However, this strategy is limited in terms of cell retention, survival of the engrafted cells, cell differentiation, and integration of transplanted cells with host tissue. Cardiac tissue engineering is an alternate strategy to in situ cellular cardiomyoplasty, which is designed to repair infarcted myocardium using cells, biomaterials and regulative factors (for example growth factors). There are currently various approaches for cardiac tissue engineering, such as, in situ delivering cells with injectable biomaterials into the infarcted myocardium, in vitro engineering of contractile tissue constructs followed by in vivo implantation, in vitro engineering of stem cell loaded tissue constructs for in vivo myocardium regeneration, and cell sheet tissue engineering.

While these antigenically-purified cells are promising candidates for autologous cell therapy, clinical application is hampered by their limited abundance and tedious isolation methods. Methods that involve an intermediate cardiosphere-forming step have proven successful and are being tested clinically, but it is unclear whether the cardiosphere step is necessary. Accordingly, we investigated the molecular profile and functional benefit of cells that spontaneously emigrate from cardiac tissue in primary culture. Adult Wistar-Kyoto rat hearts were minced, digested and cultured as separate anatomical regions. Loosely-adherent cells that surround the plated tissue were harvested weekly for a total of five harvests. Genetic lineage tracing demonstrated that a small proportion of the direct outgrowth from cardiac samples originates from myocardial cells. This outgrowth contains sub-populations of cells expressing embryonic (SSEA-1) and stem cell-related antigens (c-Kit, abcg2) that varied with time in culture but not with the cardiac chamber of origin. This direct outgrowth, and its expanded progeny, underwent marked in vitro angiogenic/cardiogenic differentiation and cytokine secretion (IGF-1, VGEF). In vivo effects included long-term functional benefits as gauged by MRI following cell injection in a rat model of myocardial infarction.

Pretreatment of ISO-injected rats with melatonin at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight, i.p. prevented these changes. Additionally, melatonin also restored the activities and the levels of antioxidant enzymes which were found to be altered by ISO treatment. Treatment of rats with ISO resulted into an increased generation of hydroxyl radicals with melatonin pretreatment significantly reducing their production. Finally, treatment of rats with ISO caused a lowering of systolic pressure with reduced cardiac output and diastolic dysfunction whereas melatonin pretreatment significantly restored many of these parameters to normal.

Heart to body weight ratios as well as left ventricular wall thickness and left chamber volume measurements were similar between dt and wild-type control mice. Hearts from dt mice also displayed no signs of fibrosis or calcification.

{"title": "Asymptotics of conduction velocity restitution in models of electrical excitation in the heart.", "abstract": "We extend a non-Tikhonov asymptotic embedding, proposed earlier, for calculation of conduction velocity restitution curves in ionic models of cardiac excitability. Conduction velocity restitution is the simplest non-trivial spatially extended problem in excitable media, and in the case of cardiac tissue it is an important tool for prediction of cardiac arrhythmias and fibrillation. An idealized conduction velocity restitution curve requires solving a non-linear eigenvalue problem with periodic boundary conditions, which in the cardiac case is very stiff and calls for the use of asymptotic methods. We compare asymptotics of restitution curves in four examples, two generic excitable media models, and two ionic cardiac models. The generic models include the classical FitzHugh-Nagumo model and its variation by Barkley. They are treated with standard singular perturbation techniques. The ionic models include a simplified \"caricature\" of Noble (J. Physiol. Lond. 160:317-352, 1962) model and Beeler and Reuter (J. Physiol. Lond. 268:177-210, 1977) model, which lead to non-Tikhonov problems where known asymptotic results do not apply. The Caricature Noble model is considered with particular care to demonstrate the well-posedness of the corresponding boundary-value problem. The developed method for calculation of conduction velocity restitution is then applied to the Beeler-Reuter model.

However, the additive effect of the agents when used in combination remains unclear. Thus, the goal of the present review was to analyse available data to explain the mechanistic actions of the ARB-thiazide diuretic combination. Although the circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been well characterised in the context of cardiovascular disease, recent attention has also focused on the role of the tissue RAAS. For example, both angiotensin II and aldosterone are produced in small amounts within cardiac tissue, and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor is widely distributed and activated within cardiovascular tissues. Recent reports also suggest that the mineralocorticoid receptor is activated through Rac1 GTP-ase in high salt-intake rats. Thus, many components of the RAAS are activated in cardiovascular tissues under high salt-intake conditions, and a low salt diet or use of diuretics likely suppresses the tissue RAAS. Since ARBs can block the effect of both tissue angiotensin II and circulating angiotensin II, it follows that the combination of an ARB and a thiazide diuretic results in synergistic inhibition of the tissue RAAS.", "journal": "Journal of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system : JRAAS", "date": "2010-03-03", "authors": ["MichihiroYoshimura", "MakotoKawai"], "doi": "10.1177/1470320310361832"}

To evaluate such novel devices, a large-animal model of chronic heart failure is critical in carrying out preclinical animal studies.\nWe evaluated the efficacy of oral monensin in inducing stable heart failure in five Jersey calves. Various doses of monensin were administered. Hemodynamics, pressure-volume loops, echocardiographic measurements, extent of tissue perfusion, and histopathologic data were recorded before and after induction of heart failure.\nResponses were variable in the animals. One experiment showed a significant decrease in cardiac output within one week, associated with simultaneous increases in left atrial pressure, central venous pressure, and mean pulmonary artery pressure. Left ventricular pressure-volume loops showed that the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation decreased markedly between the baseline and terminal study, suggesting a decrease in contractility.

{"title": "Technological advances in minimally invasive radiofrequency ablation of cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "Ablative techniques have been sought in many circumstances as alternatives to surgical resection/incision. Besides being minimally invasive, potential benefits of ablation include greater speed and improved access to target tissue compared with other surgical techniques. There is a wide variety of ablation technologies currently in use for medical treatment. These include but are not limited to tissue heating by radiofrequency (RF) current, microwaves, laser, and high intensity ultrasound. RF is among the most heavily used because of its relatively low complexity and cost. Ablative techniques have proven to be viable alternatives to surgical resection/incision of tissue. Although there are other means of tissue heating besides RF, RF is the most commonly used technique in operating rooms because of the reliability of transmural lesions and the low complexity of the system. Optimal systems account for the heterogeneous nature of tissue and variations in tissue property through the ablation cycle. It is important to monitor and assure adequate energy delivery by selecting the appropriate configuration of devices.

Here, we report the development of a methodology to apply MALDI tissue imaging to chick heart tissue sections acquired from fixed and paraffin-embedded samples. This protocol produces molecular images that can be related to the high-quality histological tissue sections. Perfused term chick hearts were fixed in acidic ethanol and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections (15 microm) were collected onto conductive slides, deparaffinized with xylene, and transitioned into water with graded ethanol washes and allowed to air dry. In separate experiments, three different MALDI matrices were applied to chick heart tissue sections through repeated cycles from a glass nebulizer. Tissue sections were then analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry using a raster step-size of 75-100 microm, and molecular images for specific m/z ratios reconstituted. MALDI tissue imaging revealed spatially resolved protein signals within single heart sections that are specific to structures or regions of the heart, for example, vessels, valves, endocardium, myocardium, or septa. Moreover, no prior knowledge of protein expression is required as is the case for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization methodologies. The ability to simultaneously localize a large number of unique protein signals within a single tissue section, with good preservation of histological features, provides cardiovascular researchers a new tool to give insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying normal and pathological conditions.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2010-02-27", "authors": ["Angus CGrey", "Andrew KGelasco", "JarrenSection", "Ricardo AMoreno-Rodriguez", "Edward LKrug", "Kevin LSchey"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.21103"}

GATA factors play important roles in transducing the IL-3 survival signal and transactivating the downstream survival gene, E4BP4. In heart, GATA sites are essential for proper transcription of several cardiac genes, and GATA-4 is a mediator of cardiomyocyte survival. However, the role E4BP4 plays in heart is still poorly understood. In this study, Dot-blot hybridization assays using Dig-labeled RNA probes revealed that the E4BP4 gene was expressed in cardiac tissue from several species including, monkey, dog, rabbit, and human. Western blot analysis showed that the E4BP4 protein was consistently present in all of these four species. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry revealed that the E4BP4 protein was overexpressed in diseased heart tissue in comparison with normal heart tissue. In addition, the overexpression of E4BP4 in vitro activated cell survival signaling pathway of cardiomyocytes. At last, siRNA-mediated knock down of E4BP4 in zebrafish resulted in malformed looping of the embryonic heart tube and decreased heart beating.

It has been suggested that, unlike the HCN1 and HCN2 channels, the slower HCN4 channel may not exhibit voltage-dependent hysteresis. We studied the electrophysiological properties of human HCN4 (hHCN4) channels and its modulation by cAMP to determine whether hHCN4 exhibits hysteresis, by using single-cell patch-clamp in HEK293 cells stably transfected with hHCN4. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was also used to determine levels of expression of HCNs in human cardiac tissue. Voltage-clamp analysis revealed that hHCN4 current (I(h)) activation shifted in the depolarizing direction with more hyperpolarized holding potentials. Triangular ramp and action potential clamp protocols also revealed hHCN4 hysteresis. cAMP enhanced I(h) and shifted activation in the depolarizing direction, thus modifying the intrinsic hHCN4 hysteresis behavior. Quantitative PCR analysis of human sinoatrial node (SAN) tissue showed that HCN4 accounts for 75% of the HCNs in human SAN while HCN1 (21%), HCN2 (3%), and HCN3 (0.7%) constitute the remainder. Our data suggest that HCN4 is the predominant HCN subtype in the human SAN and that I(h) exhibits voltage-dependent hysteresis behavior that can be modified by cAMP.

Aldosterone decreased coronary flow, whereas corticosterone increased it. All corticosterone effects were blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, and unaltered by the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, canrenoate, or the 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD11B)2 inhibitor, carbenoxolone. Unlike mineralocorticoid receptor blockade, RU486 did not ameliorate postischemia infarct size and arrhythmias. Corticosterone, when added to the perfusion buffer, rapidly accumulated at cardiac tissue sites, reaching steady-state levels that were identical to those in coronary effluent, independently of the presence of aldosterone, RU486 or canrenoate. After stopping the perfusion, cardiac corticosterone fully washed away with a half-life of less than 1 min. Measurements of steroid-synthesizing enzyme gene expression levels in human ventricular and atrial tissue pieces from heart-beating organ donors, patients with end-stage heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients revealed that under no condition, the human heart was capable of synthesizing aldosterone or cortisol de novo.

As IL-17 is involved in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune, inflammatory and infectious diseases, we investigated its role during the infection with T. cruzi.\nFirst, we detected significant amounts of CD4, CD8 and NK cells producing IL-17 after incubating live parasites with spleen cells from normal BALB/c mice. IL-17 is also produced in vivo by CD4(+), CD8(+) and NK cells from BALB/c mice on the early acute phase of infection. Treatment of infected mice with anti-mouse IL-17 mAb resulted in increased myocarditis, premature mortality, and decreased parasite load in the heart. IL-17 neutralization resulted in increased production of IL-12, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha and enhanced specific type 1 chemokine and chemokine receptors expression.

The CB(1) receptor influence on memory and learning is well recognized, and disease states associated with CB(1) receptors are observed in addiction disorders, motor dysfunction, schizophrenia, and in bipolar, depression, and anxiety disorders. Beyond the brain, CB(1) receptors also function in liver and adipose tissues, vascular as well as cardiac tissue, reproductive tissues and bone. Signal transduction by CB(1) receptors occurs through interaction with Gi/o proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), inhibit voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, activate K(+) currents (K(ir)), and influence Nitric Oxide (NO) signaling. CB(1) receptors are observed in internal organelles as well as plasma membrane. beta-Arrestins, adaptor protein AP-3, and G-protein receptor-associated sorting protein 1 (GASP1) modulate cellular trafficking. Cannabinoid Receptor Interacting Protein1a (CRIP1a) is an accessory protein whose function has not been delineated. Factor Associated with Neutral sphingomyelinase (FAN) regulates ceramide signaling.

Serum total cholesterol, LDL-C, total WBC count, CRP level, TBARS, atherogenic index, activities of COX, 15 LOX in monocyte and serum myeloperoxidase were increased in cholesterol fed rats. Activities of antioxidant enzymes and the concentration reduced glutathione in liver and heart tissue and serum HDL-C were decreased in cholesterol fed rats. The results showed that level of total cholesterol, LDL-C, atherogenic index was decreased and HDL-C was increased in MER treated rats. Activities of antioxidant enzymes were found to be increased and the activity of MPO, COX and 15 LOX were decreased on supplementation with MER. Concentration of TBARS and total WBC count were decreased and GSH was increased on supplementation with MER. Histopathology of aorta of cholesterol fed rat showed marked alterations whereas the aorta of MER administrated rat showed no significant changes. These results suggested that MER reduces oxidative stress, inflammation and aortic pathology in hypercholesteremic rats.

{"title": "Ac-SDKP inhibits transforming growth factor-beta1-induced differentiation of human cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts.", "abstract": "N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) inhibits collagen production and cell proliferation in cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts, but its effect on differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts is not known. High amounts of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) have been found in fibrotic cardiac tissue. TGF-beta1 converts fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which produce more extracellular matrix proteins than fibroblasts. We hypothesized that 1) Ac-SDKP inhibits TGF-beta1-induced differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts; and 2) this effect is mediated in part by blocking phosphorylation of small-mothers-against-decapentaplegic (Smad) 2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. For this study, we used human fetal cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs), which do not spontaneously become myofibroblasts when cultured at low passages. We investigated the effect of Ac-SDKP on TGF-beta1-induced HCF transformation into myofibroblasts, Smad2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, Smad7 expression, cell proliferation, and collagen production. We also investigated TGF-beta1 production by HCFs stimulated with endothelin-1 (ET-1). As expected, HCFs treated with TGF-beta1 transformed into myofibroblasts as indicated by increased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and a higher proportion of the embryonic isoform of smooth muscle myosin compared with untreated cells. TGF-beta1 also increased Smad2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation but did not affect Smad7 expression. In addition, TGF-beta1 stimulated HCF proliferation as indicated by an increase in mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and collagen production (hydroxyproline assay). Ac-SDKP significantly inhibited all of the effects of TGF-beta1. It also inhibited ET-1-stimulated TGF-beta1 production. We concluded that Ac-SDKP markedly suppresses differentiation of human cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, probably by inhibiting the TGF-beta/Smad/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and thus mediating its anti-fibrotic effects.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

However, because cardiac muscle is perfused during dives, it may rely less heavily on Mb, beta and anaerobic pathways to support contractile activity. In addition, because cardiac tissue must sustain contractile activity even before birth, it may be more physiologically mature at birth and/or develop faster than skeletal muscles. To test these hypotheses, we measured Mb levels, beta and the activities of citrate synthase (CS), beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in cardiac and skeletal muscle samples from 72 harp and hooded seals, ranging in age from fetuses to adults. Results indicate that in adults cardiac muscle had lower Mb levels (14.7%), beta (55.5%) and LDH activity (36.2%) but higher CS (459.6%) and HOAD (371.3%) activities (all P<0.05) than skeletal muscle. In addition, while the cardiac muscle of young seals had significantly lower [Mb] (44.7%) beta (80.7%) and LDH activity (89.5%) than adults (all P<0.05), it was relatively more mature at birth and weaning than skeletal muscle.

In this study, we describe a hybrid heart patch engineered from a synthetic elastomer, poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS), supplemented with cardiomyocytes differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). In line with two therapeutically relevant considerations, i.e. biocompatibility and cell delivery efficiency, the PGS was (a) pre-conditioned in culture medium for 6 days, and (b) prepared without gelatin coatings to facilitate detachment and delivery of cardiomyocytes following patch implantation. Following pre-conditioning under physiological conditions, the PGS patch material without gelatin coating was found to satisfactorily support cardiomyocyte viability and attachment, with active cell beating for periods of longer than 3 months until interrupted. Dynamic culture studies revealed that cells detached more efficiently from the uncoated surface of PGS than from gelatin-coated PGS. No significant differences were detected between the beating rates of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes on tissue culture plate and the pre-conditioned and gelatin-uncoated PGS. PGS patches sutured over the left ventricle of rats in vivo remained intact over a 2 week period without any deleterious effects on ventricular function.

The reductions of cardiac activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase (GR) were significantly mitigated. Elevation of cardiac myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in response to DOX treatment was significantly hampered. Pretreatment of CRAN significantly guarded against DOX-induced rise of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) as well as troponin I level.

Fundamental to the cardiac failure is an interference with mitochondrial respiration and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. Global gene expression arrays in cardiac tissue indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by doxorubicin (DOX) is accompanied by a decreased expression of genes related to aerobic fatty acid oxidation and a corresponding increase in expression of genes involved in anaerobic glycolysis, possibly as an alternate source for ATP production. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether this is also manifest at the metabonomic level as a switch in metabolic flux in cardiac tissue, and whether this can be averted by co-administering the cardioprotective drug, dexrazoxane (DZR). (13)C-isotopomer analysis of isolated perfused hearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats receiving 6 weekly s.c. injections of 2mg/kg DOX demonstrated a shift from the preferential oxidation of fatty acids to enhanced oxidation of glucose and lactate plus pyruvate, indicative of a compensatory shift towards increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Substrate-selective isotopomer analysis combined with western blots indicate an inhibition of long-chain fatty acid oxidation and not MCAD activity or fatty acyl-carnitine transport. Co-administering DZR averted many treatment-related changes in cardiac substrate metabolism, consistent with DZR being an effective cardioprotective agent against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.

This effect of doxorubicin was significantly suppressed by the antioxidants alpha-tocopherol, dexrazoxane, and epigallocatechin gallate. Carbachol produced a concentration-dependent negative inotropic effect in our atrial preparations. Doxorubicin caused a seemingly parallel rightward shift of the concentration-response curve for carbachol. Neither alpha-tocopherol, dexrazoxane, nor epigallocatechin gallate reversed this effect of doxorubicin.

Previous U wave modeling studies have generally been restricted to 1-D or 2-D geometries, and it is not clear whether the U waves generated by these models would match clinically observed U wave body surface potential distributions (BSPDs). We investigated the role of M cells and transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) in a 2-D, fully ionic heart tissue slice model and a realistic 3-D heart/torso model. In the 2-D model, while a U wave was present in the ECG with dynamic gap junction conductivity, the ECG with static gap junctions did not exhibit a U wave. In the 3-D model, TDR was necessary to account for the clinically observed potential minimum in the right shoulder area during the U wave peak. Peak T wave simulations were also run. Consistent with at least some clinical findings, the U wave body surface maximum was shifted to the right compared to the T wave maximum. We conclude that TDR can account for the clinically observed U wave BSPD, and that dynamic gap junction conductivity can result in realistic U waves generated by M cells.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2010-02-04", "authors": ["BruceHopenfeld", "HiroshiAshikaga"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-010-9941-5"}
{"title": "Insulin attenuates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury via reducing oxidative/nitrative stress.", "abstract": "It is well known that insulin possesses a cardioprotective effect and that insulin resistance is closely related to cardiovascular diseases. Peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) formation may trigger oxidative/nitrative stress and represent a major cytotoxic effect in heart diseases. This study was designed to investigate whether insulin attenuates ONOO(-) generation and oxidative/nitrative stress in acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R). Adult male rats were subjected to 30 min of myocardial ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion. Rats randomly received vehicle, insulin, or insulin plus wortmannin. Arterial blood pressure and left ventricular pressure were monitored throughout the experiment. Insulin significantly improved cardiac functions and reduced myocardial infarction, apoptotic cell death, and blood creatine kinase/lactate dehydrogenase levels following MI/R. Myocardial ONOO(-) formation was significantly attenuated after insulin treatment. Moreover, insulin resulted in a significant increase in Akt and endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation, NO production, and antioxidant capacity in ischemic/reperfused myocardial tissue. On the other hand, insulin markedly reduced MI/R-induced inducible NOS (iNOS) and gp91(phox) expression in cardiac tissue. Inhibition of insulin signaling with wortmannin not only blocked the cardioprotection of insulin but also markedly attenuated insulin-induced antioxidative/antinitrative effect. Furthermore, the suppression on ONOO(-) formation by either insulin or an ONOO(-) scavenger uric acid reduced myocardial infarct size in rats subjected to MI/R. We concluded that insulin exerts a cardioprotective effect against MI/R injury by blocking ONOO(-) formation. Increased physiological NO production (via eNOS phosphorylation) and superoxide anion reduction contribute to the antioxidative/antinitrative effect of insulin, which can be reversed by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase. These results provide important novel information on the mechanisms of cardiovascular actions of insulin.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Among these modifications, elevations in levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), a major product of hydroxyl radical addition to tyrosine, has been observed in a number of pathologies. Here we report the first proteome survey of endogenous site-specific modifications, i.e. DOPA and its further oxidation product dopaquinone in mouse brain and heart tissues. Results from LC-MS/MS analyses included 50 and 14 DOPA-modified tyrosine sites identified from brain and heart, respectively, whereas only a few nitrotyrosine-containing peptides, a more commonly studied marker of oxidative stress, were detectable, suggesting the much higher abundance for DOPA modification as compared with tyrosine nitration. Moreover, 20 and 12 dopaquinone-modified peptides were observed from brain and heart, respectively; nearly one-fourth of these peptides were also observed with DOPA modification on the same sites. For both tissues, these modifications are preferentially found in mitochondrial proteins with metal binding properties, consistent with metal-catalyzed hydroxyl radical formation from mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. These modifications also link to a number of mitochondrially associated and other signaling pathways. Furthermore, many of the modification sites were common sites of previously reported tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting potential disruption of signaling pathways. Collectively, the results suggest that these modifications are linked with mitochondrially derived oxidative stress and may serve as sensitive markers for disease pathologies.", "journal": "Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP", "date": "2010-02-04", "authors": ["XuZhang", "Matthew EMonroe", "BaoweiChen", "Mark HChin", "Tyler HHeibeck", "Athena ASchepmoes", "FengYang", "Brianne OPetritis", "David GCamp", "Joel GPounds", "Jon MJacobs", "Desmond JSmith", "Diana JBigelow", "Richard DSmith", "Wei-JunQian"], "doi": "10.1074/mcp.M900321-MCP200"}

Therefore, cells from human cardiac atrial biopsies were analyzed regarding progenitor properties. Expression of stem cell markers was analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. This identified a small population of C-kit+ cells, which could be further subdivided based on expression of CD45. The C-kit+ CD45+ population was determined to be of mast cell identity, while the C-kit+ CD45- population expressed mRNA of the endothelial lineage. Since the number of cells obtainable from biopsies was limited, a comparison between directly isolated and monolayer and explant cultured cells, respectively, was carried out. While both cultures retained a small population of mast cells, only monolayer culture produced a stable and relatively high percentage of C-kit+ CD45- cells. This population was found to co-express endothelial progenitor cell markers such as CD31, CD34, CXCR4, and FLK-1. The mRNA expression profile was similar to the one from directly isolated cells. When sorted cells were cultured in endothelial differentiation medium, the C-kit+ CD45- population retained its expression of endothelial markers to a large extent, but downregulated progenitor markers, indicating further differentiation into endothelial cells. We have confirmed that the human cardiac atrium contains a small C-kit+ CD45- population expressing markers commonly found on endothelial progenitor cells.

We compared the ability of recombinant clonal cell lines to express LUC before and after induction of cardiac differentiation in vitro. In particular, one of the clonal cell lines (Ncx-1-43LUC mES cells) showed markedly enhanced LUC expression (45-fold increase) upon induction of cardiac differentiation in vitro. Further, cardiac differentiation in these cells was perpetuated over a period of 2-4 weeks after transplantation in a neonatal mouse heart model, as monitored by noninvasive bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and confirmed via postmortem immunofluorescence and histological assessments. In contrast, transplantation of undifferentiated pluripotent Ncx-1-43LUC mES cells in neonatal hearts did not result in detectable levels of cardiac differentiation in these cells in vivo. These results suggest that prior induction of cardiac differentiation in vitro enhances development and maintenance of a cardiomyocyte-like phenotype for mES cells following transplantation into neonatal mouse hearts in vivo.

No experimental evidences support the anti-hyperlipidemic and antioxidative actions against hypercholesterolemia. Moreover the identity of the specific chemical ingredients in OS leaves responsible for these pharmacological effects are unknown. Since OS leaves are rich in essential oil (EO). Therefore the present study was conducted to investigate the anti-hyperlipidemic and antioxidative activities of EO extracted from OS leaves in rats fed with high cholesterol (HC) diet. EO was extracted by the hydrodistillation method and the chemical constituents were then identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The experiment was performed in Male Wistar rats fed with 2.5 g%(w/w) of cholesterol diet for seven weeks. During the last 3 weeks, rats were daily fed with EO. The results showed that phenyl propanoid compounds including eugenol and methyl eugenol were the major constituents of EO. EO suppressed the high serum lipid profile and atherogenic index as well as serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase MB subunit without significant effect on high serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase in rats fed with HC diet. In addition, EO was found to decrease the high levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) without impacting catalase (CAT) in the cardiac tissue while in the liver, it decreased high level of TBARS without significantly effecting GPx, SOD and CAT.

In this study, the pericardial ECM, a commonly used biomaterial, was investigated for use as an injectable scaffold for cardiac repair. It was determined that a solubilized form of decellularized porcine pericardium could be injected and induced to gel in vivo, prompting investigation with human pericardium, which has the decided advantage of offering an autologous therapy. Characterization showed that the matrix gels retained components of the native pericardial ECM, with extant protein and glycosaminoglycan content identified. The results of an in vitro migration assay indicate that the porcine pericardial matrix is a stronger chemoattractant for relevant cell types, but in vivo results showed that the two materials caused statistically similar amounts of neovascularization, demonstrating feasibility as injectable treatments.

In this study, we used one-dimensional microstructural computer models of interconnected ventricular myocytes to systematically investigate how increasing the effective interstitial resistivity (rho(oeff)) influences action potential propagation in fibers with variations in intracellular properties such as cell coupling and cell length. Changes in rho(oeff) were incorporated into a monodomain model using a correction to the intracellular properties that was based on bidomain simulations. The results showed that increasing rho(oeff) in poorly coupled one-dimensional fibers alters the distribution of electrical load at the microscale and causes propagation to become more continuous. In the poorly coupled fiber, this continuous state is characterized by decreased gap junction delay, sustained conduction velocity, increased sodium current, reduced maximum upstroke velocity, and increased safety factor. Long, poorly coupled cells experience greater loading effects than short cells and show the greatest initial response to changes in rho(oeff). In inhomogeneous fibers with adjacent well-coupled and poorly coupled regions, increasing rho(oeff) in the poorly coupled region also reduces source-load mismatch, which delays the onset of conduction block and reduces the dispersion of repolarization at the transition between the two regions. Increasing the rho(oeff) minimizes the effect of cell-to-cell variations and may influence the pattern of activation in critical regimes characterized by low intercellular coupling, microstructural heterogeneity, and reduced or abnormal membrane excitability.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Recently, the ID has been recognized to be a hot spot of cardiac disease, in particular inherited cardiomyopathy.\nGiven its complex structure and function we hypothesized that important molecular constituents of the ID still remain unknown.\nUsing a bioinformatics screen, we discovered and cloned a previously uncharacterized 54 kDa cardiac protein which we termed Myozap (Myocardium-enriched zonula occludens-1-associated protein). Myozap is strongly expressed in the heart and lung. In cardiac tissue it localized to the ID and directly binds to desmoplakin and zonula occludens-1. In a yeast 2-hybrid screen for additional binding partners of Myozap we identified myosin phosphatase-RhoA interacting protein (MRIP), a negative regulator of Rho activity. Myozap, in turn, strongly activates SRF-dependent transcription through its ERM (Ezrin/radixin/moesin)-like domain in a Rho-dependent fashion. Finally, in vivo knockdown of the Myozap ortholog in zebrafish led to severe contractile dysfunction and cardiomyopathy.\nTaken together, these findings reveal Myozap as a previously unrecognized component of a Rho-dependent signaling pathway that links the intercalated disc to cardiac gene regulation.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, through its promise of repair and regeneration of cardiac tissue, represents an exciting avenue of treatment for a range of cardiovascular diseases. MSCs are relatively immunoprivileged, lacking both major histocompatibility II and T-cell co-stimulatory signal expression, and possess the unique ability to home into sites of myocardial damage when delivered systemically. Additionally, they have been shown to provide therapeutic benefit via several distinct mechanisms, the most important of which appears to be the abundant secretion of paracrine factors that promote local regeneration. In light of this, several groups have sought to precondition MSCs, using various molecular and genetic means, in order to enhance viability and growth factor secretion in the heart, following transplantation. Here, we analyze and integrate information from recent MSC studies, focusing on underlying mechanisms of MSC-associated repair in animal models of cardiac disease. Additionally, MSC pretreatment studies are organized here to examine their relative effectiveness and potential for clinical use.

{"title": "Nicotinamide-rich diet protects the heart against ischaemia-reperfusion in mice: a crucial role for cardiac SUR2A.", "abstract": "It is a consensus view that a strategy to increase heart resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion is a warranted. Here, based on our previous study, we have hypothesized that a nicotinamide-rich diet could increase myocardial resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether nicotinamide-rich diet would increase heart resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion and what is the underlying mechanism. Experiments have been done on mice on control and nicotinamide-rich diet (mice were a week on nicotinamide-rich diet) as well as on transgenic mice overexpressing SUR2A (SUR2A mice), a regulatory subunit of cardioprotective ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels and their littermate controls (WT). The levels of mRNA in heart tissue were measured by real-time RT-PCR, whole heart and single cell resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion and severe hypoxia was measured by TTC staining and laser confocal microscopy, respectively. Nicotinamide-rich diet significantly decreased the size of myocardial infarction induced by ischaemia-reperfusion (from 42.5+/-4.6% of the area at risk zone in mice on control diet to 26.8+/-1.8% in mice on nicotinamide-rich diet, n=6-12, P=0.031). The cardioprotective effect of nicotinamide-rich diet was associated with 11.46+/-1.22 times (n=6) increased mRNA levels of SUR2A in the heart. HMR1098, a selective inhibitor of the sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels opening, abolished cardioprotection afforded by nicotinamide-rich diet. Transgenic mice with a sole increase in SUR2A expression had also increased cardiac resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion. We conclude that nicotinamide-rich diet up-regulate SUR2A and increases heart resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2010-01-20", "authors": ["AndriySukhodub", "QingyouDu", "SofijaJovanovi\u0107", "AleksandarJovanovi\u0107"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2010.01.008"}

This surgery-related inflammatory reaction appears to be of extreme complexity with regard to its molecular, cellular and tissue mechanisms and many studies have been performed on animal models. However, finding retrieved from animal studies were only partially confirmed in humans. To investigate this phenomenon and to evaluate possible therapies in vitro, adequate human cardiomyocyte models are required. We established a tissue model of human cardiomyocytes preserving the complex tissue environment. To our knowledge human cardiac tissue has not been investigated in an experimental setup mimicking extracorporeal circulation just in accordance to clinical routine, yet.\nCardiac biopsies were retrieved from the right auricle of patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting before cardiopulmonary bypass. The extracorporeal circulation was simulated by submitting the biopsies to varied conditions simulating cardioplegia (cp) and reperfusion (rep) in a microperfusion chamber. Cp/rep time sets were 20/7, 40/13 and 60/20 min. For analyses of the calcium homoeostasis the fluorescent calcium ion indicator FURA-2 and for apoptosis detection PARP-1 cleavage immunostaining were employed. Further the anti-apoptotic effect of carvedilol [10 microM] was investigated by adding into the perfusate.\nViable cardiomyocytes presented an intact calcium homoeostasis under physiologic conditions. Following cardioplegia and reperfusion a time-dependent elevation of cytosolic calcium as a sign of disarrangement of the calcium homoeostasis occurred. PARP-1 cleavage also showed a time-dependence whereas reperfusion had the highest impact on apoptosis. Cardioplegia and carvedilol could reduce apoptosis significantly, lowering it between 60-70% (p < 0.05).\nOur human cardiac preparation served as a reliable cellular model tool to study apoptosis in vitro. Decisively cardiac tissue from the right auricle can be easily obtained at nearly every cardiac operation avoiding biopsying of the myocardium or even experiments on animals.The apoptotic damage induced by the ischemia/reperfusion stimulus could be significantly reduced by the cold crystalloid cardioplegia.

The hearts were excised and mounted on modified Langendorff setup and subjected to 15 min global no flow ischemia and reperfused for 15 min. Pretreatment of animals with PRO, GH-125 and GH-250 (either alone or in combination) provided significant protection to myocardium from IRI damage as indicated by significant decrease in LDH and CK-MB activities in perfusate and an increase in activities of these enzymes in heart tissue homogenate. Similarly, the recovery (%) in developed tension and heart rate were significantly more in treated groups during post-ischemia when compared to control. Moreover, GH-250 either alone or with PRO showed significant increase in activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase during IRI damage.

In the present study, we sought to determine the effect of chronic simvastatin treatment in hyperlipidemic animals with or without POC. Anesthetized rabbits were randomized into eight groups, as follows, and were subjected to 30-min myocardial ischemia followed by 3-h reperfusion. Normally fed animals: a Control group with no additional intervention, a Sim group treated with simvastatin for 3 weeks at a dose of 3 mg kg(-1), a POC group subjected to POC with eight cycles of 30-s ischemia/reperfusion, a Sim-POC group treated with simvastatin, and POC. Cholesterol fed (6 weeks) animals: a Chol group with no additional interventions, a Chol-Sim group treated with simvastatin for 3 weeks, a Chol-POC group subjected to POC, and a Chol-Sim-POC group treated with simvastatin and POC. Infarct size and plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrotyrosine (NT), NOx, total cholesterol, and LDL were evaluated. In a second series of experiments, heart tissue samples were taken for MDA, NT, and NOx assessment. Infarct size, circulating MDA, NT, NOx and cardiac MDA, NT, and NOx levels declined in POC and all Sim groups compared with Control, Chol, and Chol-POC (p < 0.05). Simvastatin also reduced total cholesterol and LDL plasma levels. In conclusion, a 3-week simvastatin treatment limits the infarct size and attenuates the oxidative and nitrosative stress both in normo- and in hyper-cholesterolemic rabbits subjected to ischemia-reperfusion irrespective of the presence of POC, while POC is effective only in normocholesterolemic animals.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2010-01-13", "authors": ["Efstathios KIliodromitis", "IoannaAndreadou", "EftihiosProkovas", "AnastasiaZoga", "DimitriosFarmakis", "TheanoFotopoulou", "KonstantinosIoannidis", "Ioannis AParaskevaidis", "Dimitrios ThKremastinos"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-009-0078-3"}
{"title": "Non-viral gene therapy for myocardial engineering.", "abstract": "Despite significant advances in surgical and pharmacological techniques, myocardial infarction (MI) remains the main cause of morbidity in the developed world because no remedy has been found for the regeneration of infarcted myocardium. Once the blood supply to the area in question is interrupted, the inflammatory cascade, among other mechanisms, results in the damaged tissue becoming a scar. The goals of cardiac gene therapy are essentially to minimize damage, to promote regeneration, or some combination thereof. While the vector is, in theory, less important than the gene being delivered, the choice of vector can have a significant impact. Viral therapies can have very high transfection efficiencies, but disadvantages include immunogenicity, retroviral-mediated insertional mutagenesis, and the expense and difficulty of manufacture. For these reasons, researchers have focused on non-viral gene therapy as an alternative. In this review, naked plasmid delivery, or the delivery of complexed plasmids, and cell-mediated gene delivery to the myocardium will be reviewed. Pre-clinical and clinical trials in the cardiac tissue will form the core of the discussion. While unmodified stem cells are sometimes considered therapeutic vectors on the basis of paracrine mechanisms of action basic understanding is limited.

{"title": "Perfusion seeding of channeled elastomeric scaffolds with myocytes and endothelial cells for cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The requirements for engineering clinically sized cardiac constructs include medium perfusion (to maintain cell viability throughout the construct volume) and the protection of cardiac myocytes from hydrodynamic shear. To reconcile these conflicting requirements, we proposed the use of porous elastomeric scaffolds with an array of channels providing conduits for medium perfusion, and sized to provide efficient transport of oxygen to the cells, by a combination of convective flow and molecular diffusion over short distances between the channels. In this study, we investigate the conditions for perfusion seeding of channeled constructs with myocytes and endothelial cells without the gel carrier we previously used to lock the cells within the scaffold pores. We first established the flow parameters for perfusion seeding of porous elastomer scaffolds using the C2C12 myoblast line, and determined that a linear perfusion velocity of 1.0 mm/s resulted in seeding efficiency of 87% +/- 26% within 2 hours. When applied to seeding of channeled scaffolds with neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, these conditions also resulted in high efficiency (77.2% +/- 23.7%) of cell seeding. Uniform spatial cell distributions were obtained when scaffolds were stacked on top of one another in perfusion cartridges, effectively closing off the channels during perfusion seeding. Perfusion seeding of single scaffolds resulted in preferential cell attachment at the channel surfaces, and was employed for seeding scaffolds with rat aortic endothelial cells. We thus propose that these techniques can be utilized to engineer thick and compact cardiac constructs with parallel channels lined with endothelial cells.", "journal": "Biotechnology progress", "date": "2010-01-07", "authors": ["RobertMaidhof", "AnnaMarsano", "Eun JungLee", "GordanaVunjak-Novakovic"], "doi": "10.1002/btpr.337"}

The histological model of the tissue was generated by a computer algorithm that can be tuned to model different histological changes. For healthy tissue, the model predicted a realistic conduction velocity of 0.42 m/s based solely on the parameters derived from histology. A comparison with a brick-shaped, simplified model showed that conduction depended to a moderate extent on the shape of myocytes; a comparison with a one-dimensional bidomain model with the same overall shape and structure showed that the apparent conductivity of the tissue can be used to create an equivalent bidomain model.

Surprisingly little is known about changes in gene activities that occur during the course of regeneration. To begin to decipher the molecular processes, that underlie restoration of functional cardiac tissue, we generated an EST database from regenerating newt hearts and compared the transcriptional profile of selected candidates with genes deregulated during zebrafish heart regeneration.\nA cDNA library of 100,000 cDNA clones was generated from newt hearts 14 days after ventricular injury. Sequencing of 11520 cDNA clones resulted in 2894 assembled contigs. BLAST searches revealed 1695 sequences with potential homology to sequences from the NCBI database. BLAST searches to TrEMBL and Swiss-Prot databases assigned 1116 proteins to Gene Ontology terms. We also identified a relatively large set of 174 ORFs, which are likely to be unique for urodele amphibians. Expression analysis of newt-zebrafish homologues confirmed the deregulation of selected genes during heart regeneration.

The mechanism by which LVH develops is not well understood nor are biomarkers of it well characterized. Natriuretic peptides are important regulators of cardiac growth, blood volume, and arterial pressure and may be useful biomarkers of LVH and hemodynamic changes that precede it. We measured amino-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (NTproANP), amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations in serum and plasma, as well as transcripts in left ventricular heart tissue for atrial natriuretic peptide precursor (Nppa), brain natriuretic peptide precursor (Nppb), and myosin heavy chain-beta (Myh7) as potential biomarkers of LVH induced by a PPARalpha/gamma dual agonist in Sprague-Dawley rats. We used magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and hemodynamics to identify structural and functional cardiovascular changes related to the biomarkers. Heart-to-brain weight ratios (HW:BrW) were correlated with NTproANP, NTproBNP, and cTnI concentrations in serum as well as fold change in expression of Nppa and Nppb. LVH was characterized by increased left ventricular wall thickness and inner diameter, increased cardiac output, decreased arterial blood pressure, and increased heart rate. In these studies, each end point contributed to the early detection of LVH, the ability to monitor its progression, and demonstrated the ability of NTproANP concentration in serum to predict LVH and hemodynamic changes.", "journal": "Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology", "date": "2010-01-02", "authors": ["Steven KEngle", "Philip FSolter", "Kelly MCredille", "Christopher MBull", "StephanieAdams", "Michael JBerna", "Albert ESchultze", "Emily CRothstein", "Michael DCockman", "Michael LPritt", "HongLiu", "YuefengLu", "Alan YChiang", "David EWatson"], "doi": "10.1093/toxsci/kfp311"}
{"title": "Genesis of myocardial repair with cardiac progenitor cells and tissue engineering.", "abstract": "There is mounting evidence to suggest that the heart has regenerative potential in the event of myocardial injury. Recent studies have shown that a resident population of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) in the heart contains both vasculogenic and myogenic lineages. CPCs are able to migrate to the site of injury in the heart for participation in the healing process. The resident CPCs in the heart may also be activated through outside pharmacological intervention to promote their participation in the intrinsic repair process. In the light of these characteristics, CPCs provide a logical source for the heart cell therapy. During the regenerative cardiac process, stem cell niches (a specialised environment surrounding stem cells) provide crucial support needed for their maintenance.\nCompromised niche function may lead to the selection of stem cells that no longer depend on self-renewal factors produced by its environment. The objective of stem cell transplantation associated with tissue-engineered approaches is to create a new modality in the treatment of heart failure. The use of efficient scaffolds will aid to re-establish a favourable microenvironment for stem cell survival, multiplication, differentiation and function.

{"title": "Focus on: The cardiovascular system: what did we learn from the French (Paradox)?", "abstract": "Although heavy alcohol consumption has deleterious effects on heart health, moderate drinking is thought to have cardioprotective effects, reducing the risk of coronary artery disease and improving prognosis after a myocardial infarction. It still is unclear, however, if this effect can be achieved with all types of alcoholic beverages and results from the alcohol itself, from other compounds found in alcoholic beverages, or both. For example, the polyphenolic compound resveratrol, which is found particularly in red wine, can reduce the risk of atherosclerosis; however, it is not clear if the resveratrol levels present in wine are sufficient to achieve this result. Alcohol itself contributes to cardioprotection through several mechanisms. For example, it can improve the cholesterol profile, increasing the levels of \"good\" cholesterol and reducing the levels of \"bad\" cholesterol. Alcohol also may contribute to blood clot dissolution and may induce a phenomenon called pre-conditioning, whereby exposure to moderate alcohol levels (like short bouts of blood supply disruption [i.e., ischemia]), and result in reduced damage to the heart tissue after subsequent prolonged ischemia. Finally, the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2, which is involved in alcohol metabolism, also may contribute to alcohol-related cardioprotection by metabolizing other harmful aldehydes that could damage the heart muscle.", "journal": "Alcohol research & health : the journal of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["DariaMochly-Rosen", "SamirZakhari"], "doi": null}

Although SkMB engraftment into the post-infarcted heart has been consistently found to improve cardiac contractile function, the underlying therapeutic mechanisms remain still a matter of controversy and debate. This is basically because SkMBs do not attain a cardiac-like phenotype once homed into the diseased heart nor they form a contractile tissue functionally coupled with the surrounding viable myocardium. This issue of concern has generated the idea that the cardiotropic action of SkMBs may depend on the release of paracrine factors. However, the paracrine hypothesis still remains ill-defined, particularly concerning the identification of the whole spectrum of cell-derived soluble factors and details on their cardiac effects. In this context, the possibility to genetically engineering SkMBs to potentate their paracrine attitudes appears particularly attractive and is actually raising great expectation. Aim of the present review is not to cover all the aspects of cell-based therapy with SkMBs, as this has been the object of previous exhaustive reviews in this field. Rather, we focused on novel aspects underlying the interactions between SkMBs and the host cardiac tissues which may be relevant for directing the future basic and applied research on SkMB transplantation for post ischemic cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "date": "2010-01-01", "authors": ["LFormigli", "SZecchi-Orlandini", "EMeacci", "DBani"], "doi": "10.2174/138161210790883390"}

A series of compressive mechanical characterizations was performed on the parametric scaffold design and an empirical formula was presented to predict the compressive stiffness of the scaffold as a function of total porosity. In this work, the porosity of the scaffold was selected to be 85%, with micropores (40-100mum) throughout the scaffold. The compressive stiffness of the scaffold was 345kPa.

{"title": "Molecular mechanisms of adverse drug reactions in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "The myocardium is the target of toxicity for a number of drugs. Based on pharmacological evidence, cellular targets for drugs that produce adverse reactions can be categorized into a number of sites that include the cell membrane-bound receptors, the second messenger system, ionic channels, ionic pumps, and intracellular organelles. Additionally, interference with the neuronal input to the heart can also present a global site where adverse drug effects can manifest themselves. Simply, a drug can interfere with the normal cardiac action by modifying an ion channel function at the plasma membrane level leading to abnormal repolarization and/or depolarization of the heart cells thus precipitating a disruption in the rhythm and causing dysfunction in contractions and/or relaxations of myocytes. It is now recognized that toxic actions of drugs against the myocardium are not exclusive to the antitumor or the so-called cardiac drugs, and many other drugs with diverse chemical structures, such as antimicrobial, antimalarial, antihistamines, psychiatric, and gastrointestinal medications, seem to be capable of severely compromising myocardium function. At present, great emphasis in terms of drug safety is being placed on the interaction of many classes of drugs with the hERG potassium channel in cardiac tissue. The interest in the latter channel stems from the simplified view that drugs that block the hERG potassium channel cause prolongation of the QT interval, and this can cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

Consistent with this functional outcome, animals treated with both factors showed diminished fibrosis and increased contractile myocardium, which were more pronounced after expression of the selective VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) ligand VEGF-B, in the absence of significant induction of angiogenesis. We found that cardiomyocytes expressed VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and neuropilin-1 and that, in particular, VEGFR-1 was specifically up-regulated in hypoxia and on exposure to oxidative stress. VEGF-B exerted powerful antiapoptotic effect in both cultured cardiomyocytes and after myocardial infarction in vivo. Finally, VEGFR-1 activation by VEGF-B was found to elicit a peculiar gene expression profile proper of the compensatory, hypertrophic response, consisting in activation of alphaMHC and repression of betaMHC and skeletal alpha-actin, and an increase in SERCA2a, RYR, PGC1alpha, and cardiac natriuretic peptide transcripts, both in cultured cardiomyocytes and in infarcted hearts.

Although the effects of matrix stiffness on individual CM have been explored, less attention was devoted to studies at the monolayer and the tissue level. The purpose of this study was to characterize the influence of substrate mechanical stiffness on the heart cell phenotype and functional properties. Neonatal rat heart cells were seeded onto collagen-coated polyacrylamide (PA) substrates with Young's moduli of 3, 22, 50, and 144 kPa. Collagen-coated glass coverslips without PA represented surfaces with effectively \"infinite\" stiffness. The local elastic modulus of native neonatal rat heart tissue was measured to range from 4.0 to 11.4 kPa (mean value of 6.8 kPa) and for native adult rat heart tissue from 11.9 to 46.2 kPa (mean value of 25.6 kPa), motivating our choice of the above PA gel stiffness. Overall, by 120 h of cultivation, the lowest stiffness PA substrates (3 kPa) exhibited the lowest excitation threshold (ET; 3.5 +/- 0.3 V/cm), increased troponin I staining (52% positively stained area) but reduced cell density, force of contraction (0.18 +/- 0.1 mN/mm(2)), and cell elongation (aspect ratio = 1.3-1.4). Higher stiffness (144 kPa) PA substrates exhibited reduced troponin I staining (30% positively stained area), increased fibroblast density (70% positively stained area), and poor electrical excitability. Intermediate stiffness PA substrates of stiffness comparable to the native adult rat myocardium (22-50 kPa) were found to be optimal for heart cell morphology and function, with superior elongation (aspect ratio > 4.3), reasonable ET (ranging from 3.95 +/- 0.8 to 4.4 +/- 0.7 V/cm), high contractile force development (ranging from 0.52 +/- 0.2 to 1.60 +/- 0.6 mN/mm(2)), and well-developed striations, all consistent with a differentiated phenotype.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2009-12-17", "authors": ["BashirBhana", "Rohin KIyer", "Wen Li KellyChen", "RuogangZhao", "Krista LSider", "MorakotLikhitpanichkul", "Craig ASimmons", "MilicaRadisic"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.22647"}

Cardiac stem cells (CSC) are considered as candidates for cardiac-directed cell therapies. However, clinical translation is hampered since their isolation and expansion is complex. We describe a population of human cardiac derived adherent proliferating (CAP) cells that can be reliably and efficiently isolated and expanded from endomyocardial biopsies (0.1 cm(3)). Growth kinetics revealed a mean cell doubling time of 49.9 h and a high number of 2.54 x 10(7) cells in passage 3. Microarray analysis directed at investigating the gene expression profile of human CAP cells demonstrated the absence of the hematopoietic cell markers CD34 and CD45, and of CD90, which is expressed on mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and fibroblasts. These data were confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. CAP cells could not be differentiated into adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, or myoblasts, demonstrating the absence of multilineage potential. Moreover, despite the expression of heart muscle markers like alpha-sarcomeric actin and cardiac myosin, CAP cells cannot be differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Regarding functionality, CAP cells were especially positive for many genes involved in angiogenesis like angiopoietin-1, VEGF, KDR, and neuropilins. Globally, principal component and hierarchical clustering analysis and comparison with microarray data from many undifferentiated and differentiated reference cell types, revealed a unique identity of CAP cells. In conclusion, we have identified a unique cardiac tissue derived cell type that can be isolated and expanded from endomyocardial biopsies and which presents a potential cell source for cardiac repair.

Later, it was also shown that the proposed mechanism of adaptation of GJs is consistent with known electrophysiology of GJs. In the present article, we show that a pair of cardiac cell models coupled by dynamic, voltage-sensitive GJs exhibits bistable behavior under certain conditions. Three kinds of cell pairs are considered: (1) a Noble-Noble cell pair that represents adjacent cells in Purkinje network, (2) a pair of DiFranceso-Noble cells that represents adjacent SA nodal cells, and (3) a model of Noble cell coupled to Luo-Rudy cell model, which represents an interacting pair of a Purkinje fiber and a ventricular myocyte. Bistability is demonstrated in all the three cases. We suggest that this bistability might be an underlying factor behind cardiac memory. Focused analysis of a pair of Noble cell models showed that bistability is obtained only when the properties of GJs \"match\" with the properties of the pair of cells that is coupled by the GJs. This novel notion of match between GJs and cardiac cell types might give an insight into specialized distributions of various connexin proteins in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Biological cybernetics", "date": "2009-12-17", "authors": ["GairikSachdeva", "KanakapriyaKalyanasundaram", "JKrishnan", "V SChakravarthy"], "doi": "10.1007/s00422-009-0352-3"}

The goal of this study was to determine the effect of a PAI-1 deficiency (PAI-1(-/-)) on the spontaneous development of cardiac fibrosis. PAI-1(-/-) mice developed pervasive cardiac fibrosis spontaneously with aging, and these mice displayed progressively distorted cardiac architecture and markedly reduced cardiac function. To mechanistically elucidate the role of PAI-1 in cardiac fibrosis, 12-week-old mice were chosen to study the biologic events leading to fibrosis. Although fibrosis was not observed at this early age, PAI-1(-/-) hearts presented with enhanced inflammation, along with increased microvascular permeability and hemorrhage. A potent fibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), was markedly enhanced in PAI-1(-/-) heart tissue. Furthermore, the expression levels of several relevant proteases associated with tissue remodeling were significantly enhanced in PAI-1(-/-) hearts. These results suggest that PAI-1 is cardioprotective, and functions in maintaining normal microvasculature integrity. Microvascular leakage in PAI-1(-/-) hearts may provoke inflammation, and predispose these mice to cardiac fibrosis. Therefore, a PAI-1 deficiency contributes to the development of cardiac fibrosis by increasing vascular permeability, exacerbating local inflammation, and increasing extracellular matrix remodeling, an environment conducive to accelerated fibrosis.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2009-12-17", "authors": ["ZhiXu", "Francis JCastellino", "Victoria APloplis"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2009-09-244962"}

{"title": "Adipose tissue: a new source for cardiovascular repair.", "abstract": "Along with angiogenesis and gene therapy, stem cell transplantation is one of the newest treatment modalities proposed to improve the outcome of patients with heart failure or infarction.

On the basis of these data, stem cells and progenitor cells derived from the bone marrow have been proposed for use in the repair of cardiac tissue after acute myocardial infarction in patients. However, the relatively low abundance, small tissue volume, difficult accessibility and disease-related malfunction of bone marrow-derived stem cells make their clinical usefulness difficult in some situations. Recently it has been shown that adipose tissue contains a population of adult multipotent mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells that, in cell culture conditions, have extensive proliferative capacity and are able to differentiate into several lineages, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. The similarities between stem cells extracted from the bone marrow and the adipose tissue suggest the potential for the adipose tissue to act as an alternative, and perhaps preferable, cell source for repairing damaged tissues, such as the ischemic or infarcted heart.

Antibiotic treatment during the early stage of infection appeared to be more effective than treatment that began during later stages of infection. The viability of noncultivable spirochetes in antibiotic-treated mice (demonstrable by PCR) was confirmed by transplantation of tissue allografts from treated mice into SCID mice, with dissemination of spirochetal DNA to multiple recipient tissues, and by xenodiagnosis, including acquisition by ticks, transmission by ticks to SCID mice, and survival through molting into nymphs and then into adults. Furthermore, PCR-positive heart base tissue from antibiotic-treated mice revealed RNA transcription of several B. burgdorferi genes.

{"title": "Selective gamma-ketoaldehyde scavengers protect Nav1.5 from oxidant-induced inactivation.", "abstract": "The cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A, Na(V)1.5) is a key determinant of electrical impulse conduction in cardiac tissue. Acute myocardial infarction leads to diminished sodium channel availability, both because of decreased channel expression and because of greater inactivation of channels already present. Myocardial infarction leads to significant increases in reactive oxygen species and their downstream effectors including lipoxidation products. The effects of reactive oxygen species on Na(V)1.5 function in whole hearts can be modeled in cultured myocytes, where oxidants shift the availability curve of I(Na) to hyperpolarized potentials, decreasing cardiac sodium current at the normal activation threshold. We recently examined potential mediators of the oxidant-induced inactivation and found that one specific lipoxidation product, the isoketals, recapitulated the effects of oxidant on sodium currents. Isoketals are highly reactive gamma-ketoaldehydes formed by the peroxidation of arachidonic acid that covalently modify the lysine residues of proteins. We now confirm that exposure to oxidants induces lipoxidative modification of Na(V)1.5 and that the selective isoketal scavengers block voltage-dependent changes in sodium current by the oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide, both in cells heterologously expressing Na(V)1.5 and in a mouse cardiac myocyte cell line (HL-1).

Current treatments for hypertension and heart failure have proven beneficial but are not highly specific and associated with side effects. Accordingly, there is an important need for alternative strategies to provide safe and effective treatment.\nTen-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated with resveratrol (2.5 mg/kg/day) for a period of 10 weeks. Systolic blood pressure, and cardiac structure and function were measured in all groups at different time points of resveratrol treatment. Oxidative stress was also determined in all groups after 10 weeks of resveratrol treatment.\nSHRs were characterized with high blood pressure and concentric hypertrophy from 15 weeks of age. Cardiac functional abnormalities were also evident in SHR from 15 weeks onwards. Resveratrol treatment significantly prevented the development of concentric hypertrophy, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction in SHR without lowering blood pressure.

{"title": "Peptide-based antibodies against glutathione-binding domains suppress superoxide production mediated by mitochondrial complex I.", "abstract": "Complex I (NQR) is a critical site of superoxide (O2-*) production and the major host of redox protein thiols in mitochondria. In response to oxidative stress, NQR-derived protein thiols at the 51- and 75-kDa subunits are known to be reversibly S-glutathionylated. Although several glutathionylated domains from NQR 51 and 75 kDa have been identified, their roles in the regulatory functions remain to be explored. To gain further insights into protein S-glutathionylation of complex I, we used two peptides of S-glutathionylated domain ((200)GAGAYICGEETALIESIEGK(219) of 51-kDa protein and (361)VDSDTLCTEEVFPTAGAGTDLR(382) of 75-kDa protein) as chimeric epitopes incorporating a \"promiscuous\" T-cell epitope to generate two polyclonal antibodies, AbGSCA206 and AbGSCB367. Binding of AbGSCA206 and AbGSCB367 inhibited NQR-mediated O2-* generation by 37 and 57%, as measured by EPR spin-trapping. To further provide an appropriate control, two peptides of non-glutathionylated domain ((21)SGDTTAPKKTSFGSLKDFDR(40) of 51-kDa peptide and (100)WNILTNSEKTKKAREGVMEFL(120) of 75-kDa peptide) were synthesized as chimeric epitopes to generate two polyclonal antibodies, Ab51 and Ab75. Binding of A51 did not affect NQR-mediated generation to a significant level. However, binding of Ab75 inhibited NQR-mediated O2-*generation by 35%. None of AbGSCA206, AbGSCB367, Ab51, or Ab75 showed an inhibitory effect on the electron transfer activity of NQR, suggesting that antibody binding to the glutathione-binding domain decreased electron leakage from the hydrophilic domain of NQR. When heart tissue homogenates were immunoprecipitated with Ab51 or Ab75 and probed with an antibody against glutathione, protein S-glutathionylation was enhanced in post-ischemic myocardium at the NQR 51-kDa subunit, but not at the 75-kDa subunit, indicating that the 51-kDa subunit of flavin subcomplex is more sensitive to oxidative stress resulting from myocardial infarction.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2009-11-27", "authors": ["JingfengChen", "Chwen-LihChen", "SharadRawale", "Chun-AnChen", "Jay LZweier", "Pravin T PKaumaya", "Yeong-RennChen"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M109.056846"}
{"title": "Acute attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties increases coronary blood volume independently of coronary flow reserve.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelium is covered with an extensive mesh of glycocalyx constituents, which acts like an effective barrier up to several micrometers thick that shields the luminal surface of the vasculature from direct exposure to flowing blood. Many studies report that various enzymatic and pharmaceutical challenges are able to increase glycocalyx porosity, resulting in farther permeation of plasma macromolecules and greater access of red blood cells into glycocalyx domain. Attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties therefore potentially increases the amount of blood that effectively occupies available microvascular volume. We tested in the present study whether attenuation of coronary glycocalyx barrier properties actually increases coronary blood volume and whether such changes would be noticeable during measurements of coronary flow reserve using adenosine. In anesthetized goats (n = 6) with cannulated left main coronary artery that were perfused under controlled pressure, coronary blood volume was measured via the indicator-dilution technique using high-molecular-weight (2,000 kDa) dextrans as plasma tracer and labeled red blood cells as red blood cell tracer. Coronary blood volume was determined at baseline and during intracoronary infusion of adenosine causing maximal vasodilation (0.2-0.6 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)) before and after intracoronary hyaluronidase treatment (170,000 units) of the glycocalyx. With an intact glycocalyx, coronary blood volume was 18.9 +/- 1.1 ml/100 g heart tissue at baseline, which increased to 26.3 +/- 2.7 ml/100 g after hyaluronidase treatment of the coronary glycocalyx. Maximal vasodilation by administration of adenosine further increased coronary blood volume to 33.9 +/- 6.8 ml/100 g, a value not different from the maximal coronary blood volume of 33.2 +/- 5.3 ml/100 g obtained by administration of adenosine in the absence of hyaluronidase treatment. Adenosine-induced increases in coronary conductance were not affected by hyaluronidase treatment. We conclude that acute attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties increases coronary blood volume by approximately 40%, which is of similar magnitude as additional changes in coronary blood volume during subsequent maximal vasodilation with adenosine. Furthermore, maximal coronary blood volume following administration of adenosine was similar with and without prior hyaluronidase degradation of the glycocalyx, suggesting that adenosine and hyaluronidase potentially increase glycocalyx porosity to a similar extent. Hyaluronidase-mediated changes in coronary blood volume did not affect baseline and adenosine-induced increases in coronary conductance, demonstrating that measurements of coronary flow reserve are insufficient to detect impairment of coronary blood volume recruitment in conditions of damaged glycocalyx.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Mechanics of dynamic needle insertion into a biological material.", "abstract": "During needle-based procedures, transitions between tissue layers often lead to rupture events that involve large forces and tissue deformations and produce uncontrollable crack extensions. In this paper, the mechanics of these rupture events is described, and the effect of insertion velocity on needle force, tissue deformation, and needle work is analyzed. Using the J integral method from fracture mechanics, rupture events are modeled as sudden crack extensions that occur when the release rate J of strain energy concentrated at the tip of the crack exceeds the fracture toughness of the material. It is shown that increasing the velocity of needle insertion will reduce the force of the rupture event when it increases the energy release rate. A nonlinear viscoelastic Kelvin model is then used to predict the relationship between the deformation of tissue and the rupture force at different velocities. The model predicts that rupture deformation and work asymptotically approach minimum values as needle velocity increases. Consequently, most of the benefit of using a higher needle velocity can be achieved using a finite velocity that is inversely proportional to the relaxation time of the tissue. Experiments confirm the analytical predictions with multilayered porcine cardiac tissue.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2009-11-26", "authors": ["MohsenMahvash", "Pierre EDupont"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2009.2036856"}
{"title": "Influence of rutin treatment on biochemical alterations in experimental diabetes.", "abstract": "Dietary antioxidant compounds such as flavonoids may offer some protection against early-stage diabetes mellitus and its complications. Abnormalities in both glucose metabolism and lipid profile constitute one of the most common complications in diabetes mellitus. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of rutin, through biochemical parameters, on experimental streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: untreated controls (GI); normal rats receiving rutin (GII); untreated diabetics (GIII); diabetic rats receiving rutin (GIV). STZ was injected at a single dose of 60 mg kg(-1) to induce diabetes mellitus. The diabetes resulted in increased serum glucose, cholesterol, triacylglycerols and lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL-cholesterol) but decresed serum HDL-cholesterol and insulin. Rutin (50 mg kg(-1)) reduced (p<0.05) blood glucose and improved the lipid profile in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were significantly augmented in serum of STZ-diabetic rats, while these activities were diminished in hepatic and cardiac tissues compared with the control group. Rutin prevents changes in the activities of ALT, AST and LDH in the serum, liver and heart, indicating the protective effect of rutin against the hepatic and cardiac toxicity caused by STZ. Rutin was associated with markedly decreased hepatic and cardiac levels of tryacylglycerols and elevated glycogen.

Cells were grown either within flexible, circular collagen gels or as monolayer on top of respective 1-mum thin silicone membranes. Membrane and cells were bulged outwards by air pressure. This biaxial strain distribution is rather similar the beating, blood-filled heart. The setup allowed presetting the mechanical residual stress level externally by adjusting the centre deflection, thus, mimicking hypertension in vitro. Tension was measured as oscillating differential pressure change between chamber and environment. A 0.5-mm thick collagen-cardiac myocyte tissue construct induced after 2 days of culturing (initial cell density 2 x 10(4) cells/ml), a mechanical tension of 1.62 +/- 0.17 microN/mm(2). Mechanical load is an important growth regulator in the developing heart, and the orientation and alignment of cardiomyocytes is stress sensitive. Therefore, it was necessary to develop the CellDrum technology with its biaxial stress-strain distribution and defined mechanical boundary conditions. Cells were exposed to strain in two directions, radially and circumferentially, which is similar to biaxial loading in real heart tissues.

This prooxidant reaction in cardiac myocytes and mitochondria accounts for necrotic cell death and subsequent myocardial scarring. It is intrinsically linked to increased intracellular zinc concentration ([Zn(2+)](i)) serving as an antioxidant. Herein, we addressed the temporal responses in coupled Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) dyshomeostasis, reflecting the prooxidant-antioxidant equilibrium, by examining preclinical (week 1) and pathological (week 4) stages of ALDOST to determine whether endogenous antioxidant defenses would be ultimately overwhelmed to account for this delay in cardiac remodeling. We compared responses in cardiomyocyte free [Ca(2+)](i) and [Zn(2+)](i) and mitochondrial total [Ca(2+)](m) and [Zn(2+)](m), together with biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses, during 1- and 4-wk ALDOST. At week 1 and compared with controls, we found: 1) elevations in [Ca(2+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](m) were coupled with [Zn(2+)](i) and [Zn(2+)](m); 2) increased mitochondrial H(2)O(2) production, cardiomyocyte xanthine oxidase activity, and cardiac and mitochondrial 8-isoprostane levels, counterbalanced by increased activity of antioxidant proteins, enzymes, and the nonenzymatic antioxidants that can be considered as cumulative antioxidant capacity; some of these enzymes and proteins (e.g., metallothionein-1, Cu/Zn-superoxide, glutathione synthase) are regulated by metal-responsive transcription factor-1; and 3) although these augmented antioxidant defenses were sustained at week 4, they fell short in combating the persistent intracellular Ca(2+) overloading and marked rise in cardiac tissue 8-isoprostane and mitochondrial transition pore opening. Thus a coupled Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) dyshomeostasis occurs early during ALDOST in cardiac myocytes and mitochondria that regulate redox equilibrium until week 4 when ongoing intracellular Ca(2+) overloading and prooxidants overwhelm antioxidant defenses.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

There is economy of extraction time, hence enhancement of productivity.

Mechanical properties such as stress-strain relationship of the fibers were studied, and tensile strength was found to be 112.30 +/- 10.0 MPa.

Based on data from ethnographic fieldwork in British and German clinics, and 32 interviews with medical staff, this article provides an insight into the regulation of adult stem cell research and its clinical implementation. The argument illustrates the enactment of regulation at different stages and highlights the accompanying interpretative strategies employed by the medical personnel involved in the management of clinical trials using patients' own (autologous) stem cells to regenerate damaged cardiac tissue. We argue that the implementation of regulation is a practical accomplishment in both national contexts. The complexities present in this process are instanced by the gradual crystallisation of practices within the organisation of clinical trials.

Estivation is similar to the diapause and hibernation of other animal species in that it is characterized by negligible activity and a profoundly depressed metabolic rate. As is typically observed in quiescent states, estivating P. dolloi are resistant to environmental stresses. We tested the hypothesis that P. dolloi enhances stress resistance during estivation by upregulating intracellular antioxidant defences in brain and heart tissues. We found that most of the major intracellular antioxidant enzymes, including the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, cytosolic superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, were upregulated in brain tissue of lungfish that had estivated for 60 days. Several of these enzymes were also elevated in heart tissue of estivators. These changes were not due to food deprivation, as they did not occur in a group of fish that were deprived of food but maintained in water for the same period of time. We found little evidence of tissue oxidative damage in estivators. Products of lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxynonenal adducts) and oxidative protein damage (carbonylation) were similar in estivating and control lungfish. However, protein nitrotyrosine levels were elevated in brain tissue of estivators.

Hypothyroid hearts were found to be more resistant to H(2)O(2)-induced contracture (60% elevation in LVEDP) as compared to control.

After the induction of diabetes for 4 weeks, the animals were divided into different groups: (1) normal rats as control; (2) diabetic rats; (3) diabetic rats with administration of breviscapine (10 or 25 mg kg(-1) day(-2)). After treatment with breviscapine for 6 weeks, the invasive cardiac function and echocardiographic parameters were measured, and heart tissue was obtained for electron microscope study. The expression of protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium handling regulators, such as protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1), phospholamban (PLB) and Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA-2), ryanodine receptor (RyR) were detected by western blot or RT-PCR. The activity of SERCA-2 was measured using Ca(2+)-ATPase kit. Diabetic rats showed impaired cardiac structure and function compared with control rats. The expression of PKC, PLB increased significantly, while the PPI-1, SERCA-2 and RyR expression decreased. Treatment with breviscapine could reverse the cardiac dysfunction and structure changes in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats, and decrease the expression of PKC and PLB, as well as increase the expression of PPI-1, SERCA-2 and RyR. The protective effect of breviscapine was dose related. This study showed that breviscapine could regulate the expression of PKC, PPI-1, PLB and SERCA-2 and have protective effect on diabetic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Acta diabetologica", "date": "2009-11-03", "authors": ["MinWang", "Wen-binZhang", "Jun-huiZhu", "Guo-shengFu", "Bin-quanZhou"], "doi": "10.1007/s00592-009-0164-x"}
{"title": "Ischemic preconditioning and heat shock activate Akt via a focal adhesion kinase-mediated pathway in Langendorff-perfused adult rat hearts.", "abstract": "Heat stress (HS)-induced cardioprotection is associated with the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and protein kinase B (Akt) in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), suggesting that stress-induced activation of survival pathways may be important in protecting intact hearts from irreversible injury. The purposes of this study were 1) to examine the subcellular signaling pathways activated by HS and ischemic preconditioning (IP) in intact hearts, 2) to determine whether HS and IP activate an integrated survival pathway similar to that activated by HS in cultured NRVMs, and 3) to determine whether HS and IP reduce lethal cell injury in perfused intact hearts. Adult rat hearts perfused in the Langendorff mode were subjected to 25 min of global ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion (I/R) either 24 h after whole animal HS or following a standard IP protocol. Myocardial signaling was analyzed using Western blot analysis, whereas cell death was assayed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release into the perfusate and confirmed by light microscopy. Similar to NRVMs, HS performed in the whole animal 24 h before I/R increased phosphorylation of FAK at tyrosine-397 and protein kinase B (Akt) and resulted in protection from cell death. Using IP as a myocardial stress also resulted in an increased phosphorylation/activation of both FAK and Akt and resulted in reduced cell death in adult perfused rat hearts subjected to I/R. In conclusion, 1) myocardial stress caused by whole animal HS activates cytoskeletal-based survival signaling pathways in whole heart tissue and reduces lethal I/R injury and 2) IP activates the same stress-induced survival pathway and the activation correlates with the well-known cardioprotective effect of IP on lethal I/R injury.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Thyroid hormone and angiogenesis.", "abstract": "In models of thyroid hormone-induced cardiac hypertrophy, there is appropriate, supportive angiogenesis. Twenty years ago in one such model, angiogenesis in response to the hormone was observed before hypertrophy developed and it is now understood that iodothyronines induce neovascularization in a variety of settings, including the heart, ischemic striated muscle and tumor beds. The molecular mechanism of the proangiogenic action of thyroid hormone is both nongenomic and genomic. It is initiated nongenomically at the cell surface receptor for the hormone on integrin alphavbeta3. Kinase transduction of the hormone signal and, ultimately, transcription of several anagiogenesis-relevant genes result. The genes include basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In addition, the integrin receptor for thyroid hormone (l-thyroxine, T(4), and 3, 5, 3'-triiodo-l-thyronine, T(3)) engages in crosstalk with the VEGF and bFGF receptors. Occlusion with tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) of the hormone receptor on the integrin in the absence of T(4) and T(3) suppresses the angiogenic effects of VEGF and bFGF. Tetrac also blocks the proangiogenic actions of T(4) and T(3). Other thyroid hormone analogues that are angiogenic include diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) and the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor-beta-selective agonist, GC-1. Thyroid hormone sustains angiogenesis and coronary blood flow about infarcted heart tissue in experimental models and blocks deleterious heart remodeling that otherwise is predictable in such tissue. The hormone may also induce expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) gene, a transcription factor important to coronary artery collateralization in the setting of hypoxia. The hormone also causes transcription of the matrix Gla protein (MGP) gene that opposes vascular smooth muscle calcification.", "journal": "Vascular pharmacology", "date": "2009-11-03", "authors": ["Mary KLuidens", "Shaker AMousa", "Faith BDavis", "Hung-YunLin", "Paul JDavis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vph.2009.10.007"}

Perforin, a cytolytic protein product of killer cells, is involved in resistance to acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection. However, the contribution of perforin in parasite control and chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is unclear. Perforin-positive cells were detected in the heart tissue during the acute and chronic phases of infection of C57BL/6 mice inoculated with low dose (10(2) parasites) of the Colombian T. cruzi strain. This protocol led to acute phase survival in both wild-type and perforin null (pfp(-/-)) mice lineages. During the chronic infection, parasitism and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) as well as interleukin (IL)-4+ and, mainly, interferon (IFN)-gamma+ cells were more elevated in the heart tissue of pfp(-/-) mice. Higher levels of circulating NO and anti-parasite immunoglobulin (Ig)G2c and IgG3, paralleled by a prominent frequency of IFN-gamma+ and IL-10+ splenocytes, were present in pfp(-/-)-infected mice. Therefore, although the perforin-dependent pathway plays a role, it is not crucial for anti-T. cruzi immunity and acute phase survival of mice infected with a low inoculum. Further, perforin deficiency resulted in lower activity of creatine kinase-muscle brain isoform (CK-MB) isoenzyme in serum and a more restricted connexin 43 loss, both of which are markers of the cardiomyocyte lesion. Moreover, perforin deficiency hampered the development of severe electrocardiographic abnormalities. Hence, our results corroborate that perforin-bearing cytotoxic cells might contribute to cardiomyocyte lesion and heart dysfunction during chronic T. cruzi infection, shedding light on immunopathogenesis of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "International journal of experimental pathology", "date": "2009-11-03", "authors": ["Jaline CoutinhoSilverio", "Luzia Mariade-Oliveira-Pinto", "Andr\u00e9a Aliceda Silva", "Gabriel Melode Oliveira", "JoseliLannes-Vieira"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2613.2009.00670.x"}
{"title": "Proteomic analyses of the developing chicken cardiovascular system.", "abstract": "Up until today, no proteomics approaches have been described for heart muscle development. We describe a proteomics method to study the proteome of different heart structures at three stages of chicken embryonic development. For this purpose, a combination of gel separation, nanoLC separation and mass spectrometry was used. With this method, we identified in total 267 proteins in different tissue structures of chicken heart. We observed differences in protein abundance for a number of proteins between the different tissue structures and time points of development using spectral counting as a semiquantitative measure of protein abundance. For myosin-heavy chain 6, myosin-heavy chain 7, titin, connectin, collagen alpha-1, and xin, differences in protein levels for the different stages and structures (great arteries, outflow tract and ventricles) have been observed. A pathway analysis is performed in which the identified proteins are related to theoretical protein networks. Most prominent was the 'cardiovascular system development and function' network with the abundantly present proteins myosin 6 and myosin 7. We showed that myosin 6 is highly regulated in a stage and heart tissue specific manner.

The micron-sized parallel fibers of the polymer blend were effective in cell alignment and cells have penetrated deep within the mat through the fiber interstices, occupying the whole structure; 8-9 cell layers were obtained.

The function of HERG has been extensively studied, but it is still not clear what mechanisms regulate the surface expression of the channel. In the present report, using human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing HERG, we show that diacylglycerol potently inhibits the HERG current. This is mediated by a protein kinase C-evoked endocytosis of the channel protein, and is dependent on the dynein-dynamin complex.

For this investigation, we examined the influences of rMSCs with or without a CD44-blockage treatment on the aforementioned issues after they were cultivated, and further induced by 5-aza on SF and SF/HA patches. The results showed that the relative growth rates of rMSCs cultured on cultural wells, SF/HA patches without or with a CD44-blockage treatment were 100%, 208.9+/-7.1 (%) or 48.4+/-6.0 (%) (n=3, for all), respectively, after five days of cultivations. Moreover, rMSCs cultivated on SF/HA patches highly promoted fibronectin expressions (e.g., 1.8x10(5)/cell, in fluorescent intensity) while cells with a CD44-blockage treatment markedly diminished the expressions (e.g., 1.1x10(4)/cell, in fluorescent intensity) on same patches. For investigating possible influences of CD44 surface markers of rMSCs on their cardiomyogenic differentiation, the expressions of specific cardiac genes of cells were examined by using real-time PCR analysis. The results indicated that 5-aza inducing rMSCs significantly promoted the expressions of Gata4, Nkx2.5, Tnnt2 and Actc1 genes (all, P<0.01 or better, n=3) on SF/HA patches compared with those expressions on SF patches and for cells with a CD44-blockage treatment on SF/HA patches. Furthermore, the intensity of the expressions of cardiotin and connexin 43 of 5-aza inducing rMSCs were markedly higher than those of cells with a CD44-blockage treatment after they were cultured on SF/HA patches.

In this study, PLCbeta((1-4)) isozymes mRNA relative expression was studied by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in human, rat, and murine left ventricle and the presence of PLCbeta(4) isozyme at the protein level was confirmed by Western blotting in all species studied. Confocal microscopy experiments carried out in HL-1 cardiomyocytes revealed a sarcoplasmic subcellular distribution of PLCbeta(4). Although there were unexpected significant interspecies differences in the PLCbeta((1-4)) mRNA expression, PLCbeta(4) mRNA was the main transcript expressed in all left ventricles studied. Thus, whereas in human and rat left ventricles PLCbeta(4) > PLCbeta(3) > PLCbeta(2) > PLCbeta(1) mRNA pattern of expression was found, in murine left ventricle the pattern of expression was different, i.e., PLCbeta(4) > PLCbeta(1) > PLCbeta(3) > PLCbeta(2).

{"title": "Interrogating functional integration between injected pluripotent stem cell-derived cells and surrogate cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction resulting in irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs) remains a leading cause of heart failure. Although cell transplantation has modestly improved cardiac function, major challenges including increasing cell survival, engraftment, and functional integration with host tissue, remain. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which can be differentiated into cardiac progenitors (CPs) and CMs, represent a candidate cell source for cardiac cell therapy. However, it is not known what specific cell type or condition is the most appropriate for transplantation. This problem is exasperated by the lack of efficient and predictive strategies to screen the large numbers of parameters that may impact cell transplantation. We used a cardiac tissue model, engineered heart tissue (EHT), and quantitative molecular and electrophysiological analyses, to test transplantation conditions and specific cell populations for their potential to functionally integrate with the host tissue. In this study, we validated our analytical platform using contractile mouse neonatal CMs (nCMs) and noncontractile cardiac fibroblasts (cFBs), and screened for the integration potential of ESC-derived CMs and CPs (ESC-CMs and -CPs). Consistent with previous in vivo studies, cFB injection interfered with electrical signal propagation, whereas injected nCMs improved tissue function. Purified bioreactor-generated ESC-CMs exhibited a diminished capacity for electrophysiological integration; a result correlated with lower (compared with nCMs) connexin 43 expression. ESC-CPs, however, appeared able to appropriately mature and integrate into EHT, enhancing the amplitude of tissue contraction.

{"title": "Complete loss of murine Xin results in a mild cardiac phenotype with altered distribution of intercalated discs.", "abstract": "Xin is a striated muscle-specific F-actin binding protein that has been implicated in cardiomyopathies. In cardiomyocytes, Xin is localized at intercalated discs (IDs). Mice lacking only two of the three Xin isoforms (XinAB(-/-) mice) develop severe cardiac hypertrophy. To further investigate the function of Xin variants in the mammalian heart, we generated XinABC(-/-) mice deficient in all Xin isoforms.\nXinABC(-/-) mice showed a very mild phenotype: heart weight, heart weight to tibia length ratios, and cardiac dimensions were not altered. Increased perivascular fibrosis was only observed in hearts of young XinABC(-/-) mice. Striking differences were revealed in isolated cardiomyocytes: XinABC(-/-) cells demonstrated a significantly increased number of non-terminally localized ID-like structures. Furthermore, resting sarcomere length was increased, sarcomere shortening, peak shortening at 0.5-1 Hz, and the duration of shortening were decreased, and shortening and relengthening velocities were accelerated at frequencies above 4 Hz in XinABC(-/-) cardiomyocytes. ECG showed a significantly shorter HV interval and a trend towards shorter QRS interval in XinABC(-/-) mice, suggesting a faster conduction velocity of the ventricular-specific conduction system. In human cardiac tissue, expression of XinC protein was detected solely in samples from patients with cardiac hypertrophy.\nTotal Xin deficiency leads to topographical ID alterations, premature fibrosis and subtle changes in contractile behaviour; this is a milder cardiac phenotype than that observed in XinAB(-/-) mice, which still can express XinC. Together with the finding that XinC is detected solely in cardiomyopathic human tissues, this suggests that its expression is responsible for the stronger dominant phenotype in XinAB(-/-) mice.

{"title": "Postconditioning with levosimendan reduces the infarct size involving the PI3K pathway and KATP-channel activation but is independent of PDE-III inhibition.", "abstract": "Reperfusion injury is strongly involved in the loss of functional heart tissue in patients after acute myocardial infarction. Various signal transduction pathways to reduce infarct size during reperfusion have been characterized. However, so far in the clinical setting no standard therapies are applied due to the lack of suitable drugs. Levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer, has been shown to improve survival in cardiogenic shock after infarction. Focus of the present study was to address the question, whether a bolus application of levosimendan prior to reperfusion is able to reduce the infarct size. A well-characterized model, the in vivo rat model, was used and levosimendan applied 5 min prior to reperfusion after 30-min occlusion of the left coronary artery followed by a 30-min reperfusion period. This pharmacological postconditioning was compared to the ischemic postconditioning with three times occlusion/reperfusion periods of 30 s each. To further address the question if in this in vivo model the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway may be involved, the PDE-III inhibiting property of levosimendan was compared to the PDE-III inhibitor enoximone. Ischemic postconditioning significantly reduced the infarct size from 48 +/- 2 to 32 +/- 1% of the area at risk (P < 0.05). Similarly, levosimendan decreased infarct size down to 29 +/- 3%. The combination of ischemic postconditioning and pharmacological postconditioning using levosimendan did not result in a further reduction of the infarct size. Both, the mitochondrial KATP-channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) and the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin abolished the protection afforded by levosimendan completely, while the inhibitors alone did not influence the infarct size in control hearts. Pharmacological postconditioning with enoximone did not result in any infarct size reduction. Postconditioning with levosimendan significantly increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) at 5 min of reperfusion, an effect which could be blocked completely by the additional administration of wortmannin. In conclusion, levosimendan applied prior to reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction significantly reduces the infarct size in an in vivo rat model. This protection involves the PI3K pathway and the activation of mitochondrial KATP-channels, but is independent of PDE-III inhibition. This finding may open new possibilities for the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction using levosimendan, which is an already established therapy in cardiogenic shock. Whether the reduction of mortality in cardiogenic shock by levosimendan may in part be based on this postconditioning effect remains to be elucidated in clinical setting.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2009-10-21", "authors": ["AntjeH\u00f6nisch", "NormanTheuring", "BerndEbner", "ClaudiaWagner", "Ruth HStrasser", "ChristofWeinbrenner"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-009-0064-9"}

ACE and NEP activities were significantly decreased in heart membranes 4-8weeks post-streptozotocin (STZ) injection. However, insulin-dependent diabetes did not modify significantly bradykinin (BK) half-life (t(1/2)) while the effect of both ACE (enalaprilat) and ACE and NEP (omapatrilat) inhibitors on BK degradation progressively decreased, which may be explained by the upregulation of other unidentified metallopeptidase(s). In vivo insulin treatment restored the activities of both ACE and NEP. ACE and NEP activities were significantly higher in hearts of young Zucker rats than in those of Sprague-Dawley rats. BK t(1/2) and the effects of peptidase inhibitors on t(1/2) varied accordingly. It is concluded that kininase activities are subjected to large and opposite variations in rat cardiac tissue in type I and II diabetes models.

We compared responses of carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), MbCO and P(c)O2 to estimate the potential for myocardial injury due to CO hypoxia. Simulation results predict that during CO exposures and subsequent therapies, cardiac tissue has higher MbCO levels and lower P(c)O2's than skeletal muscle. CO exposure during exercise further decreases P(c)O2 from resting levels. We conclude that in rest and moderate exercise, the myocardium is at greater risk for hypoxic injury than skeletal muscle during the course of CO exposure and washout.

For the in vitro studies, 10(7) vector genome (vg) of rAAV-2, 5, 7, 8 or 9 were used to transduce both rat neonatal cardiac myocytes (RNCM) and fibroblasts (RNCF). For the in vivo studies, 4 x 10(10) vg of rAAV-2, 5, 7, 8 or 9, and 4 x 10(11) vg of rAAV8 or 9 were administered in 5-day-old rats via a relatively non-invasive intracardiac injection. One and two months post-administration, green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in tissues was visualized and GFP mRNA was quantified by the real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nAt 3 days post-viral transduction, rAAV9 and rAAV2 produced the highest transducing efficiency in RNCM. Only rAAV2 elicited any transduction in the RNCF. The results obtained in vivo indicated that the order for transduction efficiency in the heart was: rAAV9 > rAAV8 > rAAV7 > rAAV2 = rAAV5. The transduction efficiency order in the liver was: rAAV2 > rAAV5 > rAAV7 > rAAV8 > rAAV9.

Zero to minimal expression of GFP was found in the lung and kidney for both doses of all rAAV serotypes utilized.\nCollectively, the results obtained in the present study suggest that rAAV9 provides the most selective and stable transduction efficiency in cardiac tissue, and this expression was primarily exhibited in cardiac myocytes.", "journal": "The journal of gene medicine", "date": "2009-10-16", "authors": ["YanfeiQi", "XuanLiu", "HongweiLi", "VinayakShenoy", "QiuhongLi", "William WHauswirth", "ColinSumners", "Michael JKatovich"], "doi": "10.1002/jgm.1404"}
{"title": "Pharmacodynamic interaction of captopril with garlic in isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage in rat.", "abstract": "It is known that various preparations of garlic and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as captopril (CAP) have beneficial effects on the left ventricular function and cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction (MI) when used individually. There is no reported interaction between garlic homogenate (GH) and CAP during and after acute MI. Thus the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the possible pharmacodynamic interaction of GH with CAP on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial damage in rat. Female Wistar albino rats were treated with GH at three different doses of 125; 250 and 500 mg/kg orally for 30 days and CAP (30 mg/kg, p.o.) was incorporated in the interactive groups during the last seven days of GH treatment. Myocardial damage was induced by administration of ISO (150 mg/kg, s.c.) for two consecutive days. Biochemical parameters were studied in serum and heart tissue homogenate of all animals. The GH 250 mg/kg was found to dislodge the effect of ISO on superoxide dismutase and catalase and retained the activities of LDH and CK-MB. Incorporation of CAP during GH treatment provided further protection to myocardium from injury. However, higher dose of GH alone or with CAP failed to prevent damaging effect of ISO. Histopathological determinations confirmed biochemical findings. Thus it is concluded that the combination needs to be used carefully when garlic is consumed at high doses.", "journal": "Phytotherapy research : PTR", "date": "2009-10-16", "authors": ["Syed Mohammed BasheeruddinAsdaq", "Mohammed NaseeruddinInamdar"], "doi": "10.1002/ptr.3009"}
{"title": "Spatial regulation of intracellular pH in multicellular strands of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Intracellular pH (pHi), an important modulator of cardiac function, is normally regulated to within narrow limits (7.1-7.2). In adult ventricular cell pairs, localized cellular pHi disturbances are removed by sarcolemmal acid/base transporters, but can also be dissipated (diluted) across gap junctions, aboard mobile buffers such as CO2/HCO3- and histidine-containing dipeptides (HCDPs). In the present work, we test this model of spatial pHi regulation in multicellular strands of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes.\nWe confocally image pHi (intracellular fluorescence emitted from the pH dye carboxy-SNARF-1) in multicellular (>500 microm long, approximately 30 microm wide) cultured strands of electrically coupled, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Activity of sarcolemmal Na+/H+ exchange and Na+-HCO3- co-transport resembles that in adult cells. Localized photolytic H+ uncaging from intracellular 2-nitrobenzaldehyde, in the presence of CO2/HCO3- buffer, triggers considerable passive H+ spread along a strand, thus helping to dissipate the acid load. Inhibition of gap junctions (with alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid) truncates the spread, indicating they are conduits for local intracellular H+ flux. Without CO2/HCO3- buffer, longitudinal H+ mobility is reduced by approximately 90%, indicating that intracellular and cell-to-cell H+ flux relies far less on intrinsic mobile buffers (e.g. HCDPs) in neonates than in adults. This is consistent with five-fold lower HCDP levels in neonatal, compared to adult, ventricular tissue, and also with measurements of a lower intrinsic (non-CO2/HCO3-) H+ buffering capacity in neonatal strands compared with freshly isolated adult cells.\nWe conclude that mobile buffers and gap junctions are key spatial controllers of pHi in cardiac tissue, helping to maintain a myocardial pHi syncitium. In neonatal tissue, intracellular H+ movement is CO2/HCO3- dependent, while adult tissue relies increasingly on intrinsic dipeptides that provide additional spatial pHi control, appropriate for the developmental increase in myocyte size.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2009-10-16", "authors": ["PawelSwietach", "PatriziaCamelliti", "AlzbetaHulikova", "PeterKohl", "Richard DVaughan-Jones"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvp343"}
{"title": "Gene expression profiling in the fetal cardiac tissue after folate and low-dose trichloroethylene exposure.", "abstract": "Previous studies show gene expression alterations in rat embryo hearts and cell lines that correspond to the cardio-teratogenic effects of trichloroethylene (TCE) in animal models. One potential mechanism of TCE teratogenicity may be through altered regulation of calcium homeostatic genes with a corresponding inhibition of cardiac function. It has been suggested that TCE may interfere with the folic acid/methylation pathway in liver and kidney and alter gene regulation by epigenetic mechanisms. According to this hypothesis, folate supplementation in the maternal diet should counteract TCE effects on gene expression in the embryonic heart.\nTo identify transcriptional targets altered in the embryonic heart after exposure to TCE, and possible protective effects of folate, we used DNA microarray technology to profile gene expression in embryonic mouse hearts with maternal TCE exposure and dietary changes in maternal folate.\nExposure to low doses of TCE (10 ppb) caused extensive alterations in transcripts encoding proteins involved in transport, ion channel, transcription, differentiation, cytoskeleton, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Exogenous folate did not offset the effects of TCE exposure on normal gene expression, and both high and low levels of folate produced additional significant changes in gene expression.\nA mechanism by which TCE induces a folate deficiency does not explain altered gene expression patterns in the embryonic mouse heart. The data further suggest that use of folate supplementation, in the presence of this toxin, may be detrimental and not protective of the developing embryo.", "journal": "Birth defects research.

{"title": "Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease: cellular mechanisms leading autoimmune reactivity and disease.", "abstract": "Rheumatic fever (RF) is an autoimmune disease caused by the gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes that follows a nontreated throat infection in susceptible children. The disease manifests as polyarthritis, carditis, chorea, erythema marginatum, and/or subcutaneous nodules. Carditis, the most serious complication, occurs in 30% to 45% of RF patients and leads to chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which is characterized by progressive and permanent valvular lesions. In this review, we will focus on the genes that confer susceptibility for developing the disease, as well as the innate and adaptive immune responses against S. pyogenes during the acute rheumatic fever episode that leads to RHD autoimmune reactions.\nThe disease is genetically determined, and some human leukocyte antigen class II alleles are involved with susceptibility. Other single nucleotide polymorphisms for TNF-alpha and mannan-binding lectin genes were reported as associated with RF/RHD. T cells play an important role in RHD heart lesions. Several autoantigens were already identified, including cardiac myosin epitopes, vimentin, and other intracellular proteins. In the heart tissue, antigen-driven oligoclonal T cell expansions were probably the effectors of the rheumatic heart lesions. These cells are CD4(+) and produced inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha and IFNgamma).\nMolecular mimicry is the mechanism that mediated the cross-reactions between streptococcal antigens and human proteins.

For large sharks stable isotopes may provide an important tool to elucidate aspects of their ecological roles in marine systems, but laboratory based controlled feeding experiments are impractical. By utilizing commercial aquaria, we estimated (15)N and (13)C of muscle, liver, vertebral cartilage and a number of organs of three large sand tiger (Carcharias taurus) and one large lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) under a controlled feeding regime. For all sharks mean+/-SD for (15)N and (13)C in lipid extracted muscle using lipid extracted prey data were 2.29 per thousand+/-0.22 and 0.90 per thousand+/-0.33, respectively. The use of non-lipid extracted muscle and prey resulted in very similar (15)N and (13)C values but mixing of lipid and non-lipid extracted data produced variable estimates. Values of (15)N and (13)C in lipid extracted liver and prey were 1.50 per thousand+/-0.54 and 0.22 per thousand+/-1.18, respectively. Non-lipid extracted diet discrimination factors in liver were highly influenced by lipid content and studies that examine stable isotopes in shark liver, and likely any high lipid tissue, should strive to remove lipid effects through standardising C:N ratios, prior to isotope analysis. Mean vertebral cartilage (15)N and (13)C values were 1.45 per thousand+/-0.61 and 3.75 per thousand+/-0.44, respectively. Organ (15)N and (13)C values were more variable among individual sharks but heart tissue was consistently enriched by approximately 1-2.5 per thousand. Minimal variability in muscle and liver delta(15)N and delta(13)C sampled at different intervals along the length of individual sharks and between liver lobes suggests that stable isotope values are consistent within tissues of individual animals.

The present study was designed to examine the role of exogenous melatonin against organophosphate toxicity in tissues (brain, heart, jejunum, kidney, liver, lung, muscle and pancreas) trace and major element levels of rats. Trace and major element concentrations in the tissues were measured in the sham group, the control group, prophylaxis with the melatonin group and therapy with the melatonin group (TM) by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. Statistically significant differences among the experimental groups were detected for some tissue trace and major element concentrations. In the brain tissue, the Al, Mn and Se concentrations in the sham group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p<0.05). In the heart tissue, the Cu, Mn and Se concentrations in the sham group were significantly increased than those in the control group (p<0.05). In the kidney tissue, trace and major element concentrations in the TM group were significantly lower than those in the sham group (Fe and Mn; p<0.05, Cu, Mo, Ni, Ti, V and Zn; p<0.01). In the liver, Mg, Al, Zn and Ca concentrations in the TM group were significantly higher than those in the fenthion-treated control group (p<0.01).

Cell density and distribution were followed by 3,3'-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate staining, and their proliferation and viability were assessed by AlamarBlue assay and fluorecein-diacetate/propidium iodide staining. Fibroblast-seeded scaffolds shrank to 1-2 mm(3) spheroids, and their glycosaminoglycans significantly increased by 23%. The expression of ECM remodeling-related mRNAs of collagens I and III, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and type 1 tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and was found significantly elevated in fibroblast-seeded scaffold, compared with the control cells on plates. Fibroblast-seeded scaffolds lost some flexibility, yet gained strength compared with the acellular scaffolds, as shown by mechanical testing.

Using a Cre/loxP system, we studied cell fusion after bone marrow transplantation. Fused cells were chiefly Gr-1(+), a myeloid cell marker, and found predominantly in the bone marrow; in parenchymal tissues. Surprisingly, fused cells were most abundant in the kidney, Peyer's patches, and cardiac tissue. In contrast, after cell fusion with embryonic stem cells, bone marrow cells were reprogrammed into new tetraploid pluripotent stem cells that successfully differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes. Together, these data suggest that cell fusion is ubiquitous after cellular transplants and that the subsequent sharing of genetic material between the fusion partners affects cellular survival and function.

{"title": "Transplantation of a tissue-engineered human vascularized cardiac muscle.", "abstract": "Myocardial regeneration strategies have been hampered by the lack of sources for human cardiomyocytes (CMs) and by the significant donor cell loss following transplantation. We assessed the ability of a three-dimensional tissue-engineered human vascularized cardiac muscle to engraft in the in vivo rat heart and to promote functional vascularization. Human embryonic stem cell-derived CMs alone or with human endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and embryonic fibroblasts (triculture constructs) were seeded onto biodegradable porous scaffolds. The resulting tissue constructs were transplanted to the in vivo rat heart and formed cardiac tissue grafts. Immunostaining studies for human-specific CD31 and alpha-smooth muscle actin demonstrated the formation of both donor (human) and host (rat)-derived vasculature within the engrafted triculture tissue constructs. Intraventricular injection of fluorescent microspheres or lectin resulted in their incorporation by human-derived vessels, confirming their functional integration with host coronary vasculature. Finally, the number of blood vessels was significantly greater in the triculture tissue constructs (60.3 +/- 8/mm(3), p < 0.05) when compared with scaffolds containing only CMs (39.0 +/- 14.4/mm(3)). In conclusion, a tissue-engineered human vascularized cardiac muscle can be established ex vivo and transplanted in vivo to form stable grafts. By utilizing a multicellular preparation we were able to increase biograft vascularization and to show that the preexisting human vessels can become functional and contribute to tissue perfusion.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "A finite volume method solution for the bidomain equations and their application to modelling cardiac ischaemia.", "abstract": "This paper presents an implementation of the finite volume method with the aim of studying subendocardial ischaemia during the ST segment. In this implementation, based on hexahedral finite volumes, each quadrilateral sub-face is split into two triangles to improve the accuracy of the numerical integration in complex geometries and when fibre rotation is included. The numerical method is validated against previously published solutions obtained from slab and cylindrical models of the left ventricle with subendocardial ischaemia and no fibre rotation. Epicardial potential distributions are then obtained for a half-ellipsoid model of the left ventricle. In this case it is shown that for isotropic cardiac tissue the degree of subendocardial ischaemia does not affect the epicardial potential distribution, which is consistent with previous findings from analytical studies in simpler geometries. The paper also considers the behaviour of various preconditioners for solving numerically the resulting system of algebraic equations resulting from the implementation of the finite volume method. It is observed that each geometry considered has its own optimal preconditioner.", "journal": "Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering", "date": "2009-07-30", "authors": ["Peter RJohnston"], "doi": "10.1080/10255840903067072"}

Treatment with recombinant enzyme preparations aims to attenuate and reverse accumulation of the major enzyme substrate, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Pathologic data examining the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in vivo are scant.\nA detailed examination of three whole hearts from patients (all male, aged 55, 59, 73 years) with AFD that had received ERT prior to death (for between 18 months and 4 years) was performed.\nIn spite of ERT, Gb3 accumulation was present in myocytes, within both atria and ventricles, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, coronary arteries, aorta, and valve tissue. Nearly all myocytes within the right and left ventricles were hypertrophied with marked vacuolization of the cytoplasm. In all three cases, there was focal myocyte apoptosis and myocyte necrosis associated with macrophage accumulation and a small T-lymphocytic infiltrate. Extensive areas of replacement fibrosis (mean, 15%) associated with areas of myocyte disarray were present in all three hearts.\nThis study highlights the pancardiac nature of AFD; demonstrates the extent of fibrotic changes; and reports, for the first time, myocyte disarray, necrosis, and apoptosis in hearts from patients affected by AFD and receiving ERT.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of glutamine pretreatment, as a means of preconditioning, on lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial dysfunction.\nC57BL/6 mice were randomized into four groups: Control; lipopolysaccharide; glutamine plus lipopolysaccharide; and Quercetin, an inhibitor of heat shock protein synthesis plus glutamine and lipopolysaccharide. Left ventricular function was assessed at 6h following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) insult by invasive hemodynamics. Heat shock protein (HSP)72 in heart tissue was determined by Western immunoblot at 12h after glutamine administration.\nAdministration of lipopolysaccharide resulted in significant decrease in left ventricular end systolic pressure (LVESP) (69.1 +/- 2.52 mm Hg versus 106.3 +/- 3.36 mm Hg in controls), reduced dP/dtmax (4704.1 +/- 425.31 mm Hg/s versus 9389.8 +/- 999.4 mm Hg/s in controls), and the increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) (5.10 +/- 0.28 mm Hg versus 2.16 +/- 0.27 mm Hg in controls) (P < 0.05). Peritoneal injection of 25 g/kg of glutamine 12 h prior to lipopolysaccharide exposure induced HSP72 expression in heart tissues and attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced left ventricular dysfunction: LVESP 85.94 +/- 3.8 mm Hg (P < 0.05), dP/dtmax 8331 +/- 425 mm Hg (P < 0.05), LVEDP 2.32 +/- 0.23 mm Hg (P < 0.01).

{"title": "Cardiomyoblast-like cells differentiated from human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells improve left ventricular dysfunction and survival in a rat myocardial infarction model.", "abstract": "Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) are multipotent cells. Here we examined whether human ADMSCs (hADMSCs) could differentiate into cardiomyoblast-like cells (CLCs) by induction with dimethylsulfoxide and whether the cells would be utilized to treat cardiac dysfunction. Dimethylsulfoxide induced the expression of various cardiac markers in hADMSCs, such as alpha-cardiac actin, cardiac myosin light chain, and myosin heavy chain; none of which were detected in noncommitted hADMSCs. The induced cells were thus designated as hADMSC-derived CLCs (hCLCs). To confirm their beneficial effect on cardiac function, hCLC patches were transplanted onto the Nude rat myocardial infarction model, and compared with noncommitted hADMSC patch transplants and sham operations. Echocardiography demonstrated significant short-term improvement of cardiac function in both the patch-transplanted groups. However, long-term follow-up showed rescue and maintenance of cardiac function in the hCLC patch-transplanted group only, but not in the noncommitted hADMSC patch-transplanted animals. The hCLCs, but not the hADMSCs, engrafted into the scarred myocardium and differentiated into human cardiac troponin I-positive cells, and thus regarded as cardiomyocytes. Transplantation of the hCLC patches also resulted in recovery of cardiac function and improvement of long-term survival rate. Thus, transplantation of hCLC patches is a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for future cardiac tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Neonate rat MDSCs were isolated from hind-leg muscles via the preplate technique. Isolated MDSCs were approximately 60% positive to Sca-1 and negative to CD34, CD45, or c-kit antigens. We sorted Sca-1(-) MDSCs and constructed MDSC-3DGBs by mixing MDSCs with acid soluble rat tail collagen type-I and matrix factors. MDSC-3DGB exhibited spontaneous cyclic contraction by culture day 7. MDSC-3DGB expressed cardiac-specific genes and proteins. Histological assessment revealed that cardiac-specific troponin-T and -I expressed in a typical striation pattern and connexin-43 was expressed similar to the native fetal ventricular papillary muscle. beta-Adrenergic stimulation increased MDSC-3DGB spontaneous beat frequency. MDSC-3DGB generated contractile force and intracellular calcium ion transients similar to engineered cardiac tissue from native cardiac cells. Results suggest that MDSC-3DGB induces a working CM phenotype in MDSCs and is a useful 3D culture system to directly assess the contractile properties of differentiated CMs in vitro.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiac effects of magnesium sulfate pretreatment on dichlorvos intoxication in rats. Rats were randomly divided into three groups as control, dichlorvos, and magnesium sulfate groups. After 6 h of dichlorvos or corn oil (as a vehicle) injection, venous blood samples were collected, and cardiac tissue samples were obtained. Biochemical analyses were performed to measure some parameters on serum and cardiac tissue. Immunohistochemical analyses of apoptosis and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase showed no change in cardiac tissue. Serum cholinesterase levels were markedly depressed with dichlorvos, and further suppressed markedly with magnesium sulfate pretreatment. Although we have demonstrated that serum NO levels in dichlorvos and magnesium sulfate groups were lower than the control group, cardiac tissue NO levels in magnesium sulfate group were higher than the other two groups. Mortality was not significantly affected with magnesium sulfate pretreatment. Uncertainty still persists on the right strategies for the treatment of organophosphate acute poisoning; however, it was concluded that our results do not suggest that magnesium sulfate therapy is beneficial in the management of acute dichlorvos-induced organophosphate poisoning, and also further studies are required.", "journal": "Biological trace element research", "date": "2009-06-09", "authors": ["NurullahGunay", "ZeynepKekec", "SenizDemiryurek", "AtamanKose", "Emine SNamiduru", "Nahide EGunay", "IbrahimSari", "Abdullah TDemiryurek"], "doi": "10.1007/s12011-009-8418-6"}

The mechanisms by which HHcy leads to arrhythmogenesis and SCD are unknown. Novel findings indicate that Hcy is an agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R), known to be present in cardiac tissue, and when activated, increases intracellular calcium leading to increased cell excitability. Also, HHcy induces oxidative stress in cardiac cells and activates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade cell membranes and proteins. Here we review the literature relevant to HHcy-induced oxidative stress leading to cardiac tissue remodelling that may adversely affect cell-to-cell impulse conduction, in particular on the heart's specialized conduction system, and may provide substrate for arrhythmogenesis and SCD.

{"title": "Use of vitamins C and E as a prophylactic therapy to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress has been strongly involved in the underlying mechanism of atrial fibrillation, particularly in the arrhythmia occurring in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation (postoperative atrial fibrillation). The ischemia/reperfusion injury thus occurring in the myocardial tissue contributes to the development of tissue remodeling, thought to be responsible for the functional heart impairment. Consequently, structural changes due to the cardiac tissue biomolecules attack by reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species could account for functional changes in ion channels, transporters, membrane conductance, cytosolic transduction signals, and other events, all associated with the occurrence of arrhythmic consequences. The lack of success and significant side effects of anti-arrhythmic drugs have given rise to attempts aimed to develop alternative novel pharmacologic treatments. On this line, the biological properties of the antioxidant vitamins C and E suggest that they could decrease the vulnerability of the heart to the oxidative damage. Nevertheless, very few studies to assess their anti-arrhythmic effects have been reported in humans. The clinical and experimental evidence supporting the view that the pharmacological use of antioxidant vitamins could contribute to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation is presented.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2009-05-19", "authors": ["Ram\u00f3nRodrigo", "Jos\u00e9Vinay", "RodrigoCastillo", "MauricioCereceda", "Ren\u00e9Asenjo", "JaimeZamorano", "JuliaAraya", "RodrigoCastillo-Koch", "JuanEspinoza", "ErnestoLarra\u00edn"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.04.043"}

Therapeutic angiogenesis has been suggested as a concept to combat these diseases. The biology of angiogenic factors expressed in the heart such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is well studied, whereas data on anti-angiogenic mediators in the heart are scarce. Here we study the expression of the anti-angiogenic factor pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in the human heart and in human cardiac cells. PEDF expression could be detected in human cardiac tissue on the protein and mRNA levels. PEDF mRNA levels were significantly lower in explanted human ischemic hearts as compared to healthy hearts. Our in vitro experiments showed that human adult cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts constitutively secrete PEDF. In addition to anoxic conditions, cobalt chloride, 2,2'dipyridyl and dimethoxally glycine, which stabilize hypoxia inducible factor-alpha decreased PEDF expression. Furthermore we show that PEDF inhibits VEGF-induced sprouting. We have identified PEDF in healthy and ischemic human hearts and we show that PEDF expression is down-regulated by low oxygen levels.

Growing number of studies and publications indicate epicardium-derived cells as cardiac stem cells. While it is beyond doubt that these cells contribute to normal development of the heart during organogenesis, it remains an open question whether mesothelial epicardial cells can preserve their embryonic potential and if they can undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition, giving origin to cardiac cell lineages, also in the adult human heart. Recent observations in vitro confirm this hypothesis, but direct evidence from the adult human heart is difficult to obtain. We report the absence of epicardial cells from the surface of adult human hearts with ischemic cardiomyopathy and the accumulation of cells with epithelial and mesenchymal markers in the subepicardium. We argue that these findings may correspond to the activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the chronic pathological conditions requiring cardiac cell regeneration, followed by epicardial cell pool exhaustion. Hence, observation of the epicardium of patients with cardiovascular disease, although not offering immediate diagnostic advantage, could provide some urging answers concerning the self-renewal potential of the adult heart.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2009-01-30", "authors": ["FrancaDi Meglio", "ClotildeCastaldo", "DariaNurzynska", "VeronicaRomano", "RitaMiraglia", "StefaniaMontagnani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.12.137"}
