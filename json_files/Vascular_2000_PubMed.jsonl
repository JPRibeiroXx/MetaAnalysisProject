Subjects over 65 years old have a higher incidence of co-morbid factors (diabetes mellitus, atheros clerosis, neoplasms, heart failure), therefore the correct choice in terms of timing and type of permanent access is extremely important. As elbow fistulas are often complicated by heart failure and PTFE grafts have a higher risk of thrombosis, we decided to evaluate the success rate of distal fistula as primary dialysis access in elderly patients. We carried out a retrospective study to identify survival predictors and actual vascular network saving. Between January 1991 and September 2000, 277 vascular access procedures were performed on 198 elderly patients (age 65 or older). The first anastomosis was positioned as peripherally as possible. In cases of patients with poor peripheral vasculature or three co-morbid factors, vascular access was first created at the origin of radial artery (Toledo-Pereyra fistula). Survival (Kaplan - Meyer analysis) was significantly higher for Toledo-Pereyra fistulas compared to wrist and snuff-box ones, in spite of the presence of a high incidence of co-morbid factors.

The pathologic diagnosis, and hence the management, of rare tumors of the orbit can represent a challenge. An increasing number of tumors have been shown to display specific chromosomal abnormalities detectable by cytogenetic analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Two examples of rare primary orbital tumors are presented in which the correct pathologic diagnosis was either established or confirmed by cytogenetic analysis. Small pieces of the tumor were obtained at the time of biopsy and placed immediately, in a sterile fashion, in fresh culture medium. The cells were Giemsa stained and processed for chromosome analysis. RESULTS. In the first case, a 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with a sino-orbital mass after sustaining minor trauma. On biopsy, the pathologic examination was at first consistent with a Burkitt-like lymphoma, until cytogenetic analysis showed a t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation, specific for granulocytic sarcoma, which corresponds to the localized solid form of acute myeloblastic leukemia. Consequently, proper chemotherapy was re-oriented and remission was achieved. In the second case, a 2-year-old boy presented with a well-vascularized orbital tumor. The histopathologic diagnosis of alveolar soft-part sarcoma of the orbit was confirmed by the finding of a specific t(X;17)(p11;q25) translocation. After two unsuccessful courses of chemotherapy, wide excision surgery with primary reconstruction brought remission. CONCLUSIONS. Cytogenetic analysis should be considered in the diagnosis of any orbital tumor which is suspected of malignancy.", "journal": "Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)", "date": "2002-06-05", "authors": ["JLasudry", "PHeimann"], "doi": null}

In wounds treated with TP508, a pattern of increased vascularization is consistently observed both grossly and microscopically when compared to wounds treated with saline. One possible mechanism by which the peptide accelerates wound healing is by promoting revascularization of granulation tissue at the injured site. To evaluate the angiogenic potential of TP508, the peptide was tested in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), where it increased the density and size of CAM blood vessels relative to controls. Additionally, TP508 stimulated chemokinesis and chemotaxis in a dose-dependent fashion in cultured human aortic and human microvascular endothelial cells. Taken together, these in vivo and in vitro data support an angiogenic role for TP508 in wound healing.

{"title": "Experimental models of growth factor-mediated angiogenesis and blood-retinal barrier breakdown.", "abstract": "Following chronic ischemia, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is induced primarily in the ganglion cell layer of the retina. This often results in neovascularization (NV) that originates from the vascular bed closest to the ganglion cell layer. To study the effects of VEGF, independent lines of transgenic mice that express VEGF in the lens and in the retina have been generated. Expression in the lens results in excessive proliferation and accumulation of angioblasts and endothelial cells in proximity to the lens. However, VEGF expression is not sufficient to direct blood vessel organization or maturation in the prenatal mouse. Abnormal vessels do form on the retinal surface, but not until the second postnatal week. In transgenic mice expressing VEGF in the photoreceptors, NV originates from the deep capillary bed--the vascular bed closest to the photoreceptors. NV is accompanied by localized blood-retinal barrier breakdown. NV is also induced in PDGF-B transgenic mice. PDGF-B expression in the lens occurs prenatally and, during this time, mainly affects the perilenticular vessels. Postnatally, transgenic mice expressing PDGF-B in the lens or photoreceptors show a similar phenotype. In both models, a highly vascularized cell mass containing endothelial cells, pericytes, and glia forms in the superficial retina, and the formation of the deep capillary bed is inhibited. The phenotype suggests that an additional factor is necessary for the maturation and penetration of vascular endothelial cells into the retina to form the deep capillary bed.", "journal": "General pharmacology", "date": "2002-03-13", "authors": ["S AVinores", "M SSeo", "NOkamoto", "J DAsh", "E FWawrousek", "W HXiao", "THudish", "N LDerevjanik", "P ACampochiaro"], "doi": "10.1016/s0306-3623(01)00117-3"}

This study is to explore how the C-myc onc ogene and its protein contribute to the intimal hyperplasia after the jugular ve in is transplanted to the abdominal aorta and to assess the effect of Mithramyci n on the intimal hyperplasia. METHODS: In 60 Wistar rats, a 0.8 cm segment of the right j ugular vein graft was interposed at the level of the abdominal aorta. The experi ment group received Mithramycin (150 mug/kg IP) 1 h before and after the operat ion. The control group received normal saline, specimens of vein graft at 2 and 6 h postoperatively were subjected respectively to in situ hybridization. The ve in grafts 4 weeks after operation were perfusion fixed. The specimens were stain ed with hemotoxylin-eosin and the computer morphologic analysis system was used to evaluate the degree of intimal thickening. Immunohistochemistry studies of m uscle-specific &amg;-actin, C-myc protein and 5'-Bromodeoxyuridine were perfor med. RESULTS: The areas of neointimal and the ratios of neointimal t o medial area were significantly smaller and lower in the Mithramycin-treated t han in the control rats (P<0.05).

{"title": "Pre- and postoperative hormonal treatment in patients with hysteroscopic surgery.", "abstract": "Hysteroscopic surgery is widely used for the treatment of patients suffering from infertility and menorrhagia. Preoperative and postoperative treatment plays an important role in this kind of surgery. The indications for hormonal pre- and postoperative treatment are very different and depend on the type of surgery and the condition of the patient. For a septum dissection, preoperative treatment is not necessary. Postoperative estrogen therapy can be helpful especially after dissection of a large septum. For intrauterine adhesiolysis, preoperative treatment is without benefit. In cases of adhesions of grades 3 and 4, postoperative treatment entailing insertion of an IUD and application of estrogens for about 3 months is recommended. A higher amenorrhea rate after endometrium ablation can be reached by pretreatment with a GnRH analogue or danazol. For resection methods, pretreatment is not necessary in any case. The success rate of endometrium ablation (reduction of blood loss) is not influenced by pretreatment. Pretreatment can be useful in coagulation techniques in patients suffering from secondary anemia and in high-risk patient. In patients who need hormone replacement therapy after endometrium ablation, gestagen application is necessary. For prevention of bleedings, a continuous combined hormone replacement therapy should be used and so a bleeding-free treatment is possible. The residual endometrium will so be protected against hyperplasia. Another alternative postoperative method after endometrial ablation is insertion of a levonorgestrel IUS. Our studies show advantages for protection of the endometrium, for contraception and a high amenorrhea rate. Prior to a hysteroscopic myoma resection, pretreatment with GnRH analogues is indicated for all myomas with a diameter of more than 3 cm and/or an intramural portion or for patients suffering from secondary anemia. The aim of the pretreatment is not only to obtain a thin endometrium but also to reduce the size and vascularization of the myomas. The failure rate in patients not treated with GnRH analogues is higher especially in large intramural myomas. Pre- and postoperative hormonal treatment can be effective, especially in the treatment of patients suffering from menorrhagia. The indications for hormonal pre- and postoperative treatment should be very strong.

Corneas on days 3 and 10 were examined by immunohistological methods using hematoxylin-eosin stain, methylgreen pyronin stain, and by immunohistochemical methods with anti-CD 4, anti-CD 8, and anti-OA antibodies. The localization of specific antibodies was identified by fluorescent-antigen method. Electron-microscopic observation was also done.\nRabbits developed corneal opacity and edema on day 1, corneas had on immune ring with a peak intensity on day 3, and vascularization on day 7 after corneal treatment. Microscopic examination revealed infiltration of neutrophils in to the area of the immune ring on day 3 and many plasma cells at the limbus and stroma on day 10. CD 4 positive cells were found at the limbus and stroma on days 3 and 10. CD 8 positive cells were found at the limbus and stroma only on day 10. OA positive findings were observed at the immune ring and its inner area. In the fluorescent-antigen method, specific antibodies were found in plasma cells at the limbus on days 3 and 10.\nIn our experimental model of interstitial keratitis with immune ring and vascularization, the Arthus reaction was dominant.

The infection results can be clinically evident or be subclinical and in this latter case they are revealed by a highly-sensitive colposcopic examination after acetic acid application at 3% followed by Schiller's test with Lugol solution in weak iodine concentration. Indeed, the distal districts of male and female uroano-genital tracts takes advantage of the colposcopic diagnostics although complementary analysis like histology or DNA tests for HPV typing have sometimes to be performed to confirm the results or to evaluate the prognosis. HPV subclinical lesions, above all at cervical and vaginal level, are those mostly involved with the cancer genesis: the bright-white acidophilia often combined with irregular surface, atypical vascularization and discrete iodine caption represents a colposcopic indication to complementary diagnostic analysis aiming at choosing the most suitable therapy for which colposcopy can show the lesion topography and its frequent plurilocalizations.", "journal": "Minerva ginecologica", "date": "2001-08-31", "authors": ["MPeroni", "PVisci"], "doi": null}

Between 1994 and 1999, nine children with intractable diseases of the upper limb were treated using free vascularized fibula grafts (one patient had resection in 1983 and initially prosthetic reconstruction, then fibula transplant in 1996). There were 6 boys and 3 girls. Mean age was 10 years (between 6 and 16). Eight patients had defects after sarcoma resection, one had an aggressive enchondroma. The reconstructed sites were the humerus (= 6), the radius (n = 3). The length of the bone defect ranged from 8 to 19 cm (mean: 14.4 cm). The fibula head with the cartilage and the growth plate was used in 3 children. One girl, 4.5 years old with congenital pseudoarthrosis of radius and cubitus had a resection and reconstruction with a U shaped fibula transplant. One patient died from lung and brain metastasis, two years after the reconstruction. There were no local recurrences. The complications were numerous but usually benign; fracture of the grafted fibula n = 7, necessity of additional bone grafts (n = 4) malunion (n = 1) needed reoperation, pseudoarthrosis (n = 2) with reoperation, ankle valgus (n = 1) required reoperation, necrosis of the fibula head (n = 1), radial inclination (n = 1). The ten patients had bone union. The mean period required to obtain radiographic bone union was 5 months. The functional results of the remaining patients were evaluated according to the scale of ENNEKING. The results ranged from 21 to 30 points.

{"title": "Polymeric contrast agents for medical imaging.", "abstract": "Synthetic polymers and co-polymers are described, to be used as carriers of reporter groups for gamma-, magnetic resonance (MR), and computed tomography (CT) imaging. Those compounds include polychelating and amphiphilic polymers and serve as key components of various contrast agents. Single terminus-activated polychelating polymers were synthesized using poly-L-lysine (PLL) as a main chain and chelating moieties (such as diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid or DTPA) as side groups. These polymers were used for the modification of diagnostic monoclonal antibodies to increase their load with reporter metal atoms. As a result, better images within shorter time intervals were obtained in animal experiments. The application of liposomes and micelles as carriers for diagnostic imaging agents in experimental and clinical medicine is considered. The load of liposomes and micelles with contrast agents for gamma- and MR imaging (MRI) was sharply increased by using polychelating polymers additionally modified on one end with a hydrophobic phospholipid residue to give amphiphilic polymers. Such polymers easily incorporate the liposome membrane or micelle core and provide better loading of liposomes and micelles with reporter metals and, consequently, better and faster imaging of various physiological compartments, such as lymphatic and vascular systems. A block-copolymer of methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) and iodine-substituted PLL was synthesized to prepare long-circulating contrast agent for CT imaging of the blood pool. In the aqueous solution, this copolymer forms stable and heavily loaded with iodine (up to 30% of iodine by weight) micelles. These micelle were successfully used for CT visualization of the vascular network in experimental animals.

In addition, this flap reduced the risk of postoperative infection and promoted primary healing.\nThe procedure, coronoidectomy and insertion of a free flap, was successful because the well-vascularized musculocutaneous flap occupied the dead space, and replaced the shortage of oral mucosa consequently inhibiting the recurrence of extra-articular ankylosis.", "journal": "Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery", "date": "2001-07-24", "authors": ["MFujioka", "TDaian", "RMurakami", "KMakino"], "doi": "10.1054/jcms.2000.0180"}
{"title": "Potential of a high-frequency correlation method to study skin blood flow.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: The vast number of existing dedicated techniques proves that skin blood flow estimation is an unsolved problem. Specificities of cutaneous vascularization (very low blood velocity, noisy environment, complexity of the vascularization architecture) result in the unsuitability of conventional ultrasonic Doppler techniques (long acquisition time, low spatial resolution). The object here was to present a high-frequency time-domain correlation METHOD: In particular, the difficulties of adaptating this type of measurement (data processing, hardware problem) are pointed out. METHODS: Radio-frequency (RF) backscattered signals, obtained with a modified version of a home-made 20 MHz skin imaging system, are studied. Time shifts between successive windowed sections of the RF signals are determined by the mean of the cross-correlation algorithm. A realignment procedure (to remove the artefacts caused by the movements of the patient and the manipulator) and a stationary echo cancelling procedure (to remove the signals coming from the cutaneous tissues and to permit the detection of very small vessels) are used. RESULTS: In vitro results show that velocity measurements as low as 0.1 mm/s are attainable with a 80 &mgr;m axial resolution, and blood vessels of 100 &mgr;m are detectable. Our technique has also been validated by means of in vivo experiment on an erysipelas located on a human leg. In this way, a 180-&mgr;m-diameter blood vessel has been detected on a M-mode RF image and the corresponding velocity profile has been obtained. CONCLUSION: Further improvements can be expected, and the level of performance obtained in vitro in this work should be also attainable in vivo and should then provide an effective tool for skin physiology and pathology.", "journal": "Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging (ISSI)", "date": "2001-06-29", "authors": ["FabriceGens", "Jean-PierreRemenieras", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricPatat", "St\u00e9phaneDiridollou", "MarceauBerson"], "doi": "10.1034/j.1600-0846.2000.006001021.x"}

After transplantation, they were randomly divided into two groups (n = 15 for each group); Group 1 received transplant alone, group 2 received transplant and HBO2 therapy consisting of 100% oxygen at 2.5 atm abs for 90 min twice a day for 7 days. Seven days after their surgery, all animals were killed for histologic examination. Degenerative changes, parenchymal integrity, host spinal cord edema, and vascularization of the graft were scored on a 3-point scale. Scores of these parameters were statistically analyzed. The graft survival rates in groups 1 and 2 were 54.5% and 71.4%, respectively. Animals treated with HBO2 showed statistically less spinal cord edema than the untreated groups (P < 0.05).

The specific stimulus for the resorption to start is still unknown. In most cases the resorption process is without clinical symptoms; diagnosis is made on radiographs. The prognosis of teeth with cervical external root resorption is low: at the time of screening too much tooth material has often been resorbed to be able to make a restoration. Only limited resorption areas with good surgical accessibility may be successfully treated. Thus, of prime importance is an early screening of the resorption process. Therefore, in interpreting radiographs one should not only look for carious or periodontal decay, but also for areas indicative for cervical external root resorption.

{"title": "Diagnostic imaging of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.", "abstract": "The role of diagnostic imaging in differentiated thyroid carcinoma is analyzed. 99mTc-pertechnetate 123I and 131I scintigraphy allows the evaluation of nodules with their differentiation in cold (hypofunctioning) and hot (functionally autonomous) nodules; thyroid carcinomas are cold nodules even if most of them are benign. On sonography thyroid nodules are well visualized with the definition of their site, number, size (not very useful parameters for the diagnosis of malignancy), echoic structure, and vascularization on color Doppler. The sonographic findings suggestive of differentiated thyroid carcinoma are: solid and hypoechoic structure, irregular ill-defined margins, absent or discontinuous peripheral ring, microcalcification, intranodular vascularization, local lymphadenopathies. These findings are characteristic but not pathognomonic, mostly for papillary carcinoma, while in the frequently isoechoic follicular carcinoma microcalcification and lymph node metastases are rare. Only the finding, although rather infrequent, of the dissemination to adjacent structures (muscles and vessels) is a definite indication for malignancy of a thyroid nodule. Color Doppler sonography plays a major role in the postoperative staging and follow-up, in combination with thyroglobulin determination and 131I whole body scintigraphy and it allows the detection of local and/or laterocervical lymph node recurrence. The most typical sonographic findings of metastatic lymphadenopathy are the roundish shape (length/anteroposterior diameter ratio-L/A < 1.5), not visible or displaced nodal hilum, thickened cortical layer with echoic structure similar to that of thyroid parenchyma, at times with microcalcification, cortical vascularization and dismantled angioarchitecture.

The peculiar features, findings, sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of each modality in the diagnosis of nature of cervical lymphadenopathy are described, as reported in most recent reports of literature, and according to the personal experience. CT/MRI criteria commonly used to establish whether a lymph node is metastatic or benign/reactive are related to the size, morphology, density (CT), signal intensity (MRI), evidence of central necrosis and extracapsular spread. Color Doppler US is a reliable method in the diagnosis of cervical metastatic lymphadenopathy even if no parameter is highly predictive; the combination of different findings, especially cortical thickening and structural inhomogeneity with thin, compressed, displaced or non visualized hilum makes the procedure significantly sensitive and specific. Intranodal hilar vascularization on color Doppler, with high resistance arterial flow (PI > 1.5), enhances the predictive value of findings of bi-dimensional sonography. Extracapsular spread impacts on survival as well as on the number of recurrences, which increases in patients with extracapsular spread; the disease-free interval is less in these patients. The identification and definition of extracapsular spread is based on some CT/MRI criteria as: 1) lymph nodes with spiky, irregular margins; 2) loss of adipose cleavage planes around the node and thickening of adjacent fascia; 3) apparent invasion of an adjacent structures or muscles. Similarly to CT/MR, sonographic findings of extracapsular spread can be: 1) blurred margins and irregular contours; 2) invasion of an adjacent structure or muscle.", "journal": "Rays", "date": "2001-05-23", "authors": ["TTartaglione", "VSummaria", "AMedoro", "DBrunetti", "G MDi Lella", "PZacchei"], "doi": null}

While mast cells and basophils share a number of similarities, they also differ in many aspects of natural history and function. Both mast cells and basophils express the high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (Fc epsilon RI) on their surface and can be activated to secrete diverse preformed, lipid and cytokine mediators after crosslinking of Fc epsilon RI-bound IgE with bi- or multivalent antigen. Thus, both cell types can represent important effector cells, as well as potential immunoregulatory cells, in IgE-mediated acquired immunity. However, mature mast cells are long-term residents of vascularized tissues, whereas basophils are granulocytic leukocytes that circulate in mature form and must be recruited into tissues that are sites of inflammatory or immune responses. The similarities and differences in the natural history, mediator content and other features of mast cells and basophils not only strongly indicate that these cells represent distinct hematopoietic lineages that can express complementary or overlapping functions, but also offer insights into the specific roles of these cells in acute, 'late phase' and chronic aspects of adaptive or pathological IgE-associated acquired immune responses.", "journal": "British medical bulletin", "date": "2001-05-22", "authors": ["JWedemeyer", "S JGalli"], "doi": "10.1258/0007142001903616"}

The mean microvessel density (MVD) in carcinomas was significantly higher compared with the respective adenomatous part of the same tumor (27.9 vs. 7; P=0.0001). Linear regression analysis of MVD between cancerous and adenomatous areas showed a significant correlation (P = 0.0001, r = 0.56), raising the possibility that carcinomas arising from better vascularized adenomas might show increased vascularity. The MVD was significantly higher in stage C compared with stage A cases (P=0.04). p53 positivity was detected in 26 of 47 cancerous (55%) and in 14 of 47 adenomatous areas (30%; P = 0.0002). All carcinomas arising from p53-positive adenomas were also p53 positive. p53 positivity associated with a higher MVD in adenomas (P = 0.02), but not in carcinomas (P = 0.78).

Temporalis muscle flap provided profuse well-vascularized tissue for the obliteration of orbital exenteration and total maxillectomy cavities and coverage of surface defects. Cranial, oral, and nasal spaces were separated successfully in all patients. Temporalis muscle flap is a very reliable technique with low complication rates and few donor site problems.

{"title": "Laparoscopic gastrostomy.", "abstract": "Although percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become a common technique for the placement of gastrostomy tubes, gastrostomy can be performed via the laparoscopic approach with minimal trauma or by using a percutaneous gastrostomy kit. In this report, we describe two procedures for laparoscopic gastrostomy using standard instruments. Standard laparoscopic techniques are used to create a pneumoperitoneum. In the first method, three transparieto-transgastric U stitches are placed to surround the site selected for the gastrostomy. A Foley catheter is inserted through the abdominal and gastric opening, then tied to the stomach with a pursestring suture. Traction on the balloon catheter brings the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall, where the three U stitches can be tied. In the second method, a 9-cm vascularized isoperistaltic gastric tube is made on the greater curvature using an endoscopic linear cutter and preserving the gastro-omental vessels. This gastric tube is then brought out through the anterior abdominal wall via a trocar orifice, opened, and fixed to the skin as for standard ostomy. Laparoscopic gastrostomy is a straightforward procedure that reduces postoperative pain and ileus. It obviates the need for a laparotomy while creating an adequate gastrostomy. Postoperative recovery is prompt, with rapid return of intestinal function and early discharge from the hospital. It not only represents an alternative to PEG when this route is not suitable or after failure of the procedure, but can also be widely used for patients as a first choice.", "journal": "Surgical endoscopy", "date": "2001-04-05", "authors": ["MAdham", "JBaulieux"], "doi": "10.1007/s004640000127"}
{"title": "Angiogenesis and bone growth.", "abstract": "Vascularization of the growth plate region represents a key mechanism for the coupling of two fundamental processes determining the rate of bone growth, chondrogenesis (cartilage production) and osteogenesis (bone formation). Precise coupling is crucial during periods of rapid bone growth or fracture repair in adults, and changes in the balance might induce pathologic conditions such as osteoarthritis and ectopic bone formation. During the formation of the growth plates of long bones, there is a close and dynamic interaction between developing vascular structures and the cartilage, which is one of the least vascular tissues in the body. Recent experimental findings provide an explanation why the close proximity of cartilage and vasculature is mutually exclusive: vascular invasion of cartilage is associated with chondrocyte apoptosis and consequently, inhibition of angiogenesis in the growth plate delays chondrocyte cell death, resulting in a massive expansion in the number of hypertrophic cartilage cells in the growth plate. The fundamental importance of chondrocytes in the growth, development and repair of the skeleton has led to intense investigation of the mechanisms that regulate chondrocyte maturation and apoptosis.", "journal": "Trends in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2001-04-03", "authors": ["H PGerber", "NFerrara"], "doi": "10.1016/s1050-1738(00)00074-8"}

{"title": "Bovine embryo culture in vitro: new developments and post-transfer consequences.", "abstract": "The past decade has seen a significant shift away from co-culture systems for cattle blastocyst production. In particular, recent adoption of sequential media systems has increased performance. However, wholly defined systems, such as the replacement of albumin with nonbiological macromolecules, fail to reproduce the nutritive role that this molecule has during development. Cattle blastocysts developed in protein-free medium are metabolically compromised. A further new concept is the use of metabolic inhibitors to stimulate embryo development in vitro. Non-toxic levels of NaN3, 2,4-dinitrophenol or very low oxygen atmospheres (approximately 2%) significantly increase both the yield (by approximately 10-20%) and the quality of blastocysts when these treatments are applied during the peri-compaction period in vitro. Nevertheless, there are also negative consequences of cattle embryo culture, such as fetal oversize and/or significant post-day 35 fetal loss. We have recently found that much of this loss is due to failure of normal allantoic development within the conceptus. Early fetal development is supported by vascularization within the yolk sac, but from day 35 to day 110, loss occurs through poor nutrient supply and an inability to remove nitrogenous wastes, leading to fetal death around day 35. The cause of disrupted allantois development has not been identified as yet, but may share a common 'cause-effect' mechanism with the fetal oversize syndrome.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2001-03-27", "authors": ["J GThompson", "A JPeterson"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/15.suppl_5.59"}

However, the development of new technologies such as CDI, CPA, 3D-US, 3D-CPA is now set to expand the role of ultrasound in the assessment of the processes in the ovaries, uterus and early pregnancy. There is growing evidence that studies of peri-follicular vascularity will predict the development of a healthy oocyte and subsequently an embryo. Endometrial blood flow studies with conventional CDI and the newer techniques of CPA and 3D-CPA will be important in predicting endometrial receptivity. Ovarian stromal vascularity appears to correlate with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and high vascularity is associated with PCO and a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. 3D-CPA may improve our ability to assess ovarian and endometrial vascularization and blood circulation, to diagnose tubal patency.

Furthermore, angiogenesis is also required for metastatic dissemination, since an increase in vascular density will allow easier access of tumor cells to the circulation. Induction of angiogenesis precedes the formation of malignant tumors, and increased vascularization seems to correlate with the invasive properties of tumors and thus with the malignant tumor phenotype. In the last few years, the discovery and characterization of tumor-derived angiogenesis modulators greatly contributed to our understanding of how tumors regulate angiogenesis. However, although angiogenesis appears to be a rate-limiting event in tumor growth and metastatic dissemination, a direct connection between the induction of angiogenesis and the progression to tumor malignancy is less well understood.

{"title": "Models for assessment of angiogenesis in gliomas.", "abstract": "In the last two decades, much attention has been focussed on mechanisms of glioma vascularization including the investigation of growth factors and receptors involved. Recently, these efforts resulted in various approaches for antiangiogenic treatment of experimental brain tumors. These basic science and preclinical trials need an assortment of models, which should allow investigating a variety of questions. Several objectives concerning basic endothelial cell (EC) characteristics can adequately be studied in vitro using EC monolayer assays. Three-dimensional spheroid techniques respect the more complex cell-cell and cell-environment interplay within a three-dimensional culture. To optimize the imitation of the crucial interaction of human gliomas with host endothelial cells, immunological cells and extracellular matrix, animal models are mandatory. An essential rule is to utilize an orthotopic model, since tumor-host interaction is organ specific. To avoid alloimmunogenic responses, it is desirable to use weakly or not immunogenic glioma grafts, what is best accomplished in a syngeneic model. However, since rat gliomas poorly resemble human glioma growth patterns, human glioma xenografting into immunocompromized animals should be considered. In vivo monitoring techniques like videoscopy via a cranial window or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow for functional studies and improve the validity of the model employed.

{"title": "Angiogenesis, metastasis, and endogenous inhibition.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis and the development of metastases are intrinsically connected. Experimental data suggest that establishment and growth of metastases are influenced by soluble factors secreted from the originating solid tumor. Among these factors are so-called endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis which keep metastasis in a non-proliferating quiescent state. For a number of tumors it has been shown that this dormant state is mediated through inhibition of angiogenesis. This dormant state is characterized by normal proliferation, increased apoptosis, and insufficient neo-vascularization. Removal of inhibiting anti-angiogenic factors led to growth of dormant metastases. A number of endogenous inhibitors have been identified and have shown success in experimental therapeutic trials. This might be of special interest for the treatment of cerebral metastases which are the most common type of malignant brain tumors. Similar to the spread of metastases, it is known that single glioma cells can be found in distant parts of the brain. While local recurrence is a common phenomenon in glioma, formation of clinical apparent distant metastasis occurs rarely.

In contrast to traditional cancer treatments that attack tumor cells directly, angiogenesis inhibitors target at the formation of tumor-feeding blood vessels that provide continuous supply of nutrients and oxygen. With respect to brain tumor therapy, inhibitors of angiogenesis display unique features that are unknown to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The most important features are independence of the blood-brain barrier, cell type specificity, and reduced resistance. Malignant brain tumors, especially malignant gliomas, are among the most vascularized tumors known. Despite multimodal therapeutic approaches, the prognosis remains dismal. Thus, angiogenesis inhibitors may be highly effective drugs against these tumors. In a clinical setting, they could be applied in the treatment of multiple tumors or postsurgically as an adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence.

{"title": "Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis as mechanisms of vascular network formation, growth and remodeling.", "abstract": "Two distinct mechanisms, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis implement the formation of the vascular network in the embryo. Vasculogenesis gives rise to the heart and the first primitive vascular plexus inside the embryo and in its surrounding membranes, as the yolk sac circulation. Angiogenesis is responsible for the remodeling and expansion of this network. While vasculogenesis refers to in situ differentiation and growth of blood vessels from mesodermal derived hemangioblasts, angiogenesis comprises two different mechanisms: endothelial sprouting and intussusceptive microvascular growth (IMG). The sprouting process is based on endothelial cell migration, proliferation and tube formation. IMG divides existing vessel lumens by formation and insertion of tissue folds and columns of interstitial tissue into the vessel lumen. The latter are termed interstitial or inter-vascular tissue structures (ITSs) and tissue pillars or posts. Intussusception also includes the establishment of new vessels by in situ loop formation in the wall of large veins. The molecular regulation of these distinct mechanisms is discussed in respect to the most important positive regulators, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors flk-1 (KDR) and flt-1, the Angiopoietin/tie system and the ephrin-B/EpH-B system.

Although little is known about the pathogenesis of angiosarcoma, angiogenic cytokines are suggested to play an important role in tumor progression in a paracrine/autocrine fashion. Mast cells contain several mediators or cytokines influencing vascularization. To clarify the role of mast cells in angiosarcoma, mast cells were counted in primary lesions of angiosarcoma (n=7). The results showed that the number of mast cells in the lesional skin of angiosarcoma (91.2+/-14.6/mm2) was significantly increased compared to that in normal skin (30.1+/-4.6/mm2) (p < 0.001). Immunohistological localization of stem cell factor, a mast cell growth factor, demonstrated that stem cell factor-positive cells occurred in the tumors forming the vascular lumen in nodular-type angiosarcoma. In macular angiosarcoma, stem cell factor was also detected in the tumor vascular endothelial cells. Infiltrating mast cells were positive for the kit receptor in both types of angiosarcoma.

The more reliable etiological theories are the degenerative one (micro trauma and inflammation) and the autoimmune one.

Color Doppler has demonstrated to be the best technique because of its cost/benefit and cost/effectiveness ratio. RMI with gadolinium can determine plaques activity but it has a lower cost/benefit ratio. Color Doppler can determine the presence of an IPP plaque and its status, which is size, location, and degree of calcification.

The nephrostomic catheter is generally positioned under ultrasound guidance, which has the advantages of showing the localization of the renal cavities and the depth of the kidney, and can be used during pregnancy and in subjects with allergy to contrast medium or with reduced renal function. When possible, it is best to associate US with fluoroscopic guidance, as this association has been found to guarantee a success rate exceeding 98%. Within the kidney, the zone known as Broedel's avascular plane, where the terminal branches of the posterior and anterior arterial systems meet, is the safest place to pass the nephrostomic catheter through, as there is little vascularization in this zone. Access is generally posterior and at the level of the inferior calyx, by means of Seldinger's, the one step or a mixed access technique involving a catheter sheathing a metal cannula. Seldinger's access technique is most commonly used, entailing explorative puncture of the renal cavity with a 22 G needle. We prefer to puncture the kidney direct, under US guidance and using an 18 G needle: a metal wire is passed through the needle and then after withdrawing the needle, the fascia dilators are inserted, of scaled widths increasing up to 2 G wider than the nephrostomic catheter. Care must be taken not to go beyond the curve of the guide wire to avoid trauma to the renal parenchyma. The most critical moment is when the catheter is inserted along the wire at the point of passage through the peri-renal fat: the catheter tends to deflect the point of the guide wire away from the desired direction as the peri-renal fat offers less resistance. The metal wire may be of variable rigidity and length, hydrophilic. The catheter may also be made of various materials: the ideal catheter should slide easily, be flexible, soft and resist encrustation.

The closure employs the use of local random- or axial-pattern vascularized flaps in simple cases.

Non-vascularized grafts only add avital scars to the already present ones leading to recurrent fistulas. Free vascularized flaps show more mechanical strength and less scar contraction, resistance to infections and survive better in a compromised surrounding, thus leading to long term sealing in such cases.

Thirty-one Sprague Dawley rats were utilized. Two groups of animals were selected. The control group of 10 animals received a 12 mm reversed isograft into the right sciatic nerve from 5 donor animals. The experimental group (n = 21) received a 12 mm empty PLLA conduits placed into a 12 mm defect in the right sciatic nerve. The left leg served as an internal control. Walking track analysis was performed monthly through 8 months. At the end of 4 and 8 months, animals in the control isograft and experimental group had the medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles harvested and weighed for comparison. The midconduit/isograft and the distal nerve in these same animals were harvested and histomorphologically analyzed. Multiple samples were collected and expressed as means +/- standard error. A two-sample t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the variables. Significance level was set at alpha = 0.05. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, a p value of < or = 0.01 was considered statistically significant. Throughout all time periods, the PLLA conduit remained structurally intact and demonstrated tissue incorporation and vascularization. There was no evidence of conduit collapse or breakage with limb ambulation. Moreover, there was no evidence of conduit elongation at 8 months as previously observed with the 75:25 poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) conduits. The mean absolute value of the sciatic functional index (SFI) demonstrated no group differences from isograft controls measured over the 8 months except at 3 months where the isograft values were higher (p = 0.0379) and at 7 months were the isograft group was significantly lower (p = 0.0115). At 4 and 8 months, the weight of the gastrocnemius muscles of the experimental group was not significantly different from isografts. At 4 months the number of axons/mm2 and nerve fiber density was not significantly different between the isograft control and experimental groups in either the midconduit/isograft or distal nerve. At 8 months the number of axons/mm2 was significantly lower in the isograft compared to the midconduit experimental group (p = 0.006). The number of axons/mm2 in the distal nerve and the nerve fiber density in the midconduit and distal nerve were not significantly different between the two groups. The study confirmed our initial hypothesis that PLLA conduits are a viable scaffold for clinical long-term nerve gap replacement.

{"title": "Matrix-enabled gene transfer for cutaneous wound repair.", "abstract": "Several growth factor proteins have been evaluated as therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic dermal wounds. Unfortunately, most have failed to produce significant improvements in wound healing, in part due to ineffective delivery and poor retention in the wound defect. It has been proposed that gene therapy might overcome the limitations of protein therapy via ongoing transcription and translation, thus prolonging the availability of the therapeutic protein. Reasoning that it would be of further benefit to ensure retention of the DNA vector as well as the therapeutic protein within the wound defect, we have evaluated matrix-enabled gene transfer for cutaneous wound repair (Gene Activated Matrix). Formulations consisting of bovine type I collagen mixed with adenoviral or plasmid gene vectors have been evaluated in 3 in vivo models. The therapeutic transgenes employed encode human platelet-derived growth factor-A or -B, proteins key to each phase of normal wound repair. Increased granulation tissue formation, vascularization, and reepithelialization have been shown compared to controls treated with collagen alone or collagen containing a reporter gene vector. Further enhancements of the tissue repair response have been achieved by combining matrix-enabled gene transfer with molecular targeting, in which the DNA vector is conjugated to a growth factor ligand (basic fibroblast growth factor).

{"title": "Behaviour of metastasis in relation to vascular index in patients with node-positive breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.", "abstract": "Some experimental studies suggested that one possible oestrogen-receptor-unrelated mechanism of action of tamoxifen involves inhibition of angiogenesis. We evaluated the correlation of the degree of vascularisation of the primary tumour and we assessed it by using the panendothelial marker anti-CD31 and immunohistochemistry with microvessels count, performed at the vascular 'hot spot' of each single cancer, with the risk of recurrence in time. A cohort of 176 consecutive patients with node-positive invasive breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen (30 mg/daily for 3 years) and a median follow-up of 72 months was studied. Sixty-two patients developed metastasis (30 visceral, 18 skeletal and 14 in soft tissues) during the time of observation. The study of the hazard function for metastasis was performed by a generalized linear modelling approach with a binomial error according to Efron. The risk of first recurrence was strictly associated with vascular index, having the patients with the highest microvessel counts the highest risk of metastasis during all the period of observation. We did not find an interaction of vascularity with oestrogen receptor (ER) status. However, in the subgroup of patients with ER-positive tumours the hazard of metastasis was almost constant in time, while in that with ER-negative tumours it increased rapidly up to 20 months and, thereafter, decreased sharply. The results of our study are an indirect evidence that the patients with highly vascularized breast cancers may gain poor benefit of adjuvant tamoxifen and, therefore. that this antioestrogen is unlikely to retain a clinically relevant antiangiogenic activity in human breast cancer.

In these species, there is marked morphological evolution, with two muscles in humans, one in sheep and a more or less distinct division of the muscle in the rabbit, cat and dog. Examination of the vascularization and nerve supply enables us to determine degrees of division in species with similar muscle morphology. Thus we were able to distinguish three morphological types which allow us to infer the morphological evolution of the M. extensores carpi radiales and to estimate the point at which one muscle became two.

{"title": "Structure of the human tibialis anterior tendon.", "abstract": "The structure and vascular pattern of the human tibialis anterior tendon was investigated using injection techniques, light and transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. From the well vascularised peritenon, blood vessels penetrate the tendon tissue and anastomose with a longitudinally oriented intratendinous network. The distribution of blood vessels within the tibialis anterior tendon was not homogenous. The posterior part of the tendon had a complete vascular network that extends from the musculotendinous junction to the insertion at the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform bones. In the anterior half, the tissue was avascular in a zone with a length of 45-67 mm. This zone was covered by a single layer (approximately 30 microm) of oval shaped cells. Transmission electron microscopy showed that these cells have the characteristics of chondroid cells. This region was stained by Alcian blue at pH 1 which indicates a high concentration of acid glycosaminoglycans and immunohistochemical staining for chondroitin-4-sulphate, chondroitin-6-sulphate and aggrecan was positive. However, immunostaining for the typical cartilage specific type II collagen within this zone was negative. The location of the avascular zone corresponds to the region where the tibialis anterior tendon wraps around the superior and inferior retinacula which serve as fibrous pulleys. This is the region where most spontaneous ruptures of the tibialis anterior tendon occur. The presence of fibrocartilage within gliding tendons is a functional adaptation to compressive and shearing forces.

{"title": "Paracrine control of the adult adrenal cortex vasculature by vascular endothelial growth factor.", "abstract": "The extensive vascular network that irrigates the adult adrenal cortex is essential for both the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to glandular steroidogenic cells and for the rapid and efficient export of corticosteroid products from these cells into the blood flow. During experimental and pathological changes in adrenal cortex size caused by ACTH overproduction or deficiency, the vasculature evolves in a coordinated manner with the mass of glandular cells so that blood vessel formation/regression and cortical gowth/atrophy are respectively synchronized. In addition to its previously reported expression in human fetal adrenocortical cells, the angiogenic factor VEGF-A appears also to be strongly expressed by both glomerulosa and fasciculata cells of the adult bovine adrenal cortex, when the endothelium is quiescent. Moreover, the expression of the two major transcripts encoding the 121 and the 165 amino acid-long isoforms of VEGF-A was observed to be rapidly (within 2-4 h) up-regulated (2-3 fold) by ACTH in primary cultures of bovine fasciculata and glomerulosa cells. The expression of the signalling VEGF receptors R1 (flt-1) and R2 (flk-1) was restricted to the endothelial cells of the cortex whereas neuropilin-1 was expressed by both endothelial and steroidogenic cells. This suggests that, under the control of the pituitary hormone ACTH, VEGF exerts a paracrine control over the vasculature of the adult adrenal cortex. Given its known effects as an anti-apoptotic agent and an inducer of endothelial fenestration, VEGF is likely to play a role in the maintenance of the dense and fenestrated vascular bed of the adrenal cortex. The vasculature thus appears as an important secondary target of ACTH action in the physiological control of adrenal cortex homeostasis.", "journal": "Endocrine research", "date": "2001-02-24", "authors": ["DVittet", "DCiais", "MKeramidas", "FDe Fraipont", "J JFeige"], "doi": "10.3109/07435800009048607"}

By 36 weeks, the new ligament looked like a natural anterior cruciate ligament, although histologically more cells could be seen than in the natural ligament. This maturation was observed only when the substitute was implanted under good tension. Clinically, the surgical procedure has been improved over the past 10 years, to the current practice in which the tape-in-tube double L-K ligament employs a small piece of autogenous tissue to promote early tissue induction and maturation. Using this practice (n = 135), more than 85% of the patients were satisfied subjectively, objectively, and arthroscopically at the 5-year postoperative FU period. Few patients had joint effusion postoperatively. Sacrifice of autogenous tissue is minimal. The patient can return to activities of daily living within 2 weeks, and more than 50% of them to sports within 10 weeks, and the new ligament is expected to keep its function for a long period as ingrowth completes the structure biologically.", "journal": "Journal of long-term effects of medical implants", "date": "2001-02-24", "authors": ["KFujikawa", "TKobayashi", "YSasazaki", "HMatsumoto", "B BSeedhom"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Tumour necrosis factor alpha up-regulates matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity in periovulatory ovine follicles: metamorphic and endocrine implications.", "abstract": "The collagenous matrix of the wall of periovulatory follicles is degraded and remodelled during ovulatory ovarian rupture and luteinization. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) belongs to a family of zinc endopeptidases that cleave extracellular proteins; its primary substrate is the type IV collagen of basement membranes. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) is a putative mediator of collagenolysis and ovulation. The objective of this investigation was to ascertain the regulatory role of TNFalpha on MMP-2 activity relevant to the folliculo-luteal transition in ewes. Luteal regression and the preovulatory surge of gonadotropins were induced by administration of prostaglandin F2alpha and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) on Days 14 and 15.5 (= 0 h) of the oestrous cycle, respectively. Ovulation occurs from the dominant follicle approximately 24 h after GnRH. An immunocapture-activity assay was used to measure MMP-2 in follicular extracts. Bioactive MMP-2 increased from 0 to 20 to 40 h after GnRH. Enzyme was immunolocalized at 40 h to the connective tissue framework that invades the parenchyma of the formative corpus luteum. Activity of MMP-2 was up-regulated by incubation (20 h) of 0-h follicular explants with TNFalpha; this response was suppressed by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Activity of MMP-2 was reduced when preovulatory follicular tissues were incubated (12-h explants for 6 h) with TNFalpha antiserum. Ovulation was blocked by intrafollicular injection of TNFalpha antiserum. Unruptured follicles luteinized, but were deficient in collagenous/vascularized trabeculae, and produced less progesterone than their control luteal counterparts. It is suggested that TNFalpha, via MMP-2 induction, contributes to the reorganization of an ovulatory follicle into a fully competent corpus luteum.", "journal": "Reproduction, fertility, and development", "date": "2001-02-24", "authors": ["M LGottsch", "E AVan Kirk", "W JMurdoch"], "doi": "10.1071/rd00054"}
{"title": "HIF-1: using two hands to flip the angiogenic switch.", "abstract": "In brain, breast, and other common human tumors there is a correlation between expression of the transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and tumor grade and vascularization. HIF-1 stimulates angiogenesis by activating transcription of the gene encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). HIF-1 is a heterodimer consisting of a constitutively-expressed HIF-1beta subunit and an O2- and growth factor-regulated HIF-1alpha subunit. Recent studies have demonstrated that HIF-1alpha expression is increased in tumor relative to normal tissue by two mechanisms. First, decreased intratumoral O2 concentrations provide a physiological stimulus. Second, genetic alterations that activate oncogene products or inactivate tumor suppressor gene products increase HIF- 1alpha expression and/or HIF-1 transcriptional activity independent of the O2 concentration. Taken together, these recent data suggest that increased HIF-1 activity provides a molecular basis for VEGF-induced angiogenesis and other adaptations of cancer cells to hypoxia that are critical for establishment of a primary tumor and its progression to the lethal phenotype.", "journal": "Cancer metastasis reviews", "date": "2001-02-24", "authors": ["G LSemenza"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1026544214667"}
{"title": "Endogenous regulators of angiogenesis--emphasis on proteins with thrombospondin--type I motifs.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis has been acknowledged as an important requirement for growth and metastasis of tumors. Complete or partial suppression of vascular growth by a number of different strategies has been consistently associated with suppression of tumor expansion and even reduction of tumor burden. Consequently, identification of the molecular pathways of the angiogenic response has been a major focus of interest in academia and industry. The development of tumor-specific anti-angiogenic therapy was also catalyzed by the finding that inhibitors of angiogenesis appeared immune to the development of drug resistance by the tumor cells, a major restrain in current chemotherapy. Although the full identification of players and their cross-talk is still at its infancy, it appears that partial blockade of one of the steps in the angiogenesis cascade, is sufficient to affect capillary morphogenesis. Thus, suppression of specific integrin pathways or vascular endothelial growth factor signaling have been shown effective in the suppression of tumor-mediated angiogenesis and have led to subsequent initiation of clinical trials. In addition to the generation of antibodies or chemical mimetics to interfere with particular steps during vascular organization, several endogenous (or physiological) molecules have also been identified. The list of endogenous modulators of angiogenesis is growing and can offer additional and important tool for the generation of therapies to restrain tumor vascularization. This review will focus one group of such molecules which include the thrombospondins and metallospondins, two families of proteins linked by the presence of a conserved anti-angiogenic functional domain.", "journal": "Cancer metastasis reviews", "date": "2001-02-24", "authors": ["DCarpizo", "M LIruela-Arispe"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1026570331022"}

An extensive medical evaluation did not reveal active underlying rheumatoid disease in any patient. Inadequate clinical response with use of topical steroids and lubricants led to corneal perforations requiring multiple tectonic procedures. Systemic immunosuppressive therapy either could not be initiated owing to a systemic contraindication or was discontinued owing to intolerance and side effects. The patients were ultimately treated with topical cyclosporin.\nSix of the 7 eyes responded favorably. An intense limbal vascularization began within 48 hours of treatment. The neovascularization progressed centrally with the simultaneous arresting of epithelial and stromal ulceration. Over a 2-week period, re-epithelization occurred with vascularization proceeding throughout the cornea. After several months, the corneal vessels attenuated, and all signs of inflammation subsided. Intrastromal bleeding with corneal blood staining occurred in 1 patient; this resolved over several months. No recurrences of corneal ulceration occurred in a mean follow-up period of 28 months (range, 7 to 60 months). None of the 5 patients have had a reactivation of their rheumatoid disease in the follow-up period.\nThe clinical response in these patients contrasts with previous animal studies demonstrating an anti-angiogenic property of cyclosporin. We report that an immediate intense neovascularization is the first sign of a favorable clinical response.

Involvement of endothelial cell migration and tumor cell proliferation at a primary site in distant metastasis.", "abstract": "The mechanism by which tumor cells interact with endothelial cells at the primary site in metastasis remains obscure.\nTo disclose the precise mechanisms and processes of metastasis and angiogenesis, we investigated the interactions of endothelial cells (CPAE; calf pulmonary arterial endothelial cells) with two mouse liver tumor cell lines, G-5, a highly metastatic clone, and G-1, a poorly metastatic clone, based on the difference in their angiogenic activities in vivo at a primary site.\nG-5 cell cultured conditioned medium (CM) promoted migration of endothelial cells more than did G-1 cell CM, in migration assay using modified Boyden chambers. Anti-basic FGF antibody inhibited G-5-induced endothelial cell migration. Furthermore, endothelial cells stimulated proliferation of G-5 cells more than that of G-1 cells in coculture assay using Transwell chambers (pore size; 0.4 microm). Pretreated endothelial cells with bFGF enhanced tumor cell proliferation, suggesting the ability of activated endothelial cells to support tumor growth. In addition, incubation with endothelial cell CM also improved the proliferative activity of G-5 cells more than that of G-1 cells in a concentration-dependent fashion, indicating production and secretion of liver tumor cell growth substance by endothelial cells.\nThese results provide evidence that liver tumor cells stimulate endothelial cell migration and migrated endothelial cells facilitate liver tumor cell proliferation. Tumor growth at a primary site may initially be dependent on migrated endothelial cells rather than vascularization or blood nutrient supply.

The bone graft was trimmed to the size of this bone tunnel, and inserted up to immediately below the articular surface. In the monitoring using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the low signal-intensity area between the bone graft and intact area had disappeared, and a high signal-intensity area on the weight-bearing portion of the femoral head had extended.

{"title": "Current progress and perspectives in immunoisolated islet transplantation.", "abstract": "This review summarizes the recent results of immunoioslated islet allo- and xenotransplants, especially in large animal species, and presents certain issues that would be important for the advancement of this technology toward clinical application. To date, the best results have been obtained with alginate microcapsules in both allo- and xenogeneic (porcine) islet transplantation in the spontaneously diabetic dogs and monkeys. Reversal of diabetes was also achieved in mice with cryopreserved, microencapsulated rat islets. However, results with these microcapsules have been highly variable and inconsistent from one laboratory to another. The causes of these discrepancies are multiple, but not totally understood. Immunoisolation devices have been investigated as an alternate approach to house a large number of islets in a space constructed by membranes of a defined pore size. Vascularized bioartificial devices were among the few cases that obtained long-term allo- and xenogeneic islet survival in totally pancreatectomized dogs. Thrombosis and associated problems were the major cause of failure with these devices. Diffusion chambers that have no vascular connection have been tested successfully in rodents, but no report has been available in large animal species. We have learned many important lessons and made considerable progress in islet immunoisolation. However, immunoisolated islet transplants have been only minimally successful in large animal models, and such technologies must be improved to achieve consistent success in large animal models prior to clinical trials. This will requires strict quality control of the islets, the membrane material, and the device construction. The membrane pore size that allows the permeation of molecules necessary for islet survival and function also permits the entry of cytokines, oxygen-radicals, and other small-size inflammatory products. Thus, the key to success appears to be to minimize inflammatory reactions generated by immuneisolation devices/capsules.", "journal": "Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery", "date": "2001-02-17", "authors": ["YMullen", "MMaruyama", "C VSmith"], "doi": "10.1007/s005340070028"}

Previously, we have shown that the human FGF1 gene contains four distinct tissue-specific promoters. In an effort to perturb the programming of proliferation and differentiation in a subset of neural cells, we have produced transgenic mice bearing the brain-specific promoter of the human FGF1 gene joined to the SV40 immediate early gene, which encodes the large T antigen. The resulting mice, and offspring from four individual lines, developed brain tumors that originated in the pontine gray, just rostral to the fourth ventricle. Tumors were moderately vascularized, as demonstrated by staining with both hematoxylin and eosin and antibodies to three different endothelial cell markers, but vessels were histologically normal. Scattered tumor foci were present as early as postnatal day 26; and affected animals died between 5 - 8 months of age. In mature animals, tumors lacked terminal differentiation markers for astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein) or neurons (synaptophysin and neuron-specific enolase). However, they expressed high levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and vimentin, markers for proliferating cells. This immunophenotype is consistent with the tumor being at an early stage of differentiation. Therefore, these mice may provide a valuable tool for the study of tumorigenesis, replenishment and differentiation of neural stem cells.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2001-02-15", "authors": ["I MChiu", "KTouhalisky", "YLiu", "AYates", "AFrostholm"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1204021"}

Therefore, we examined archival tissues of preinvasive breast pathologies by immunohistochemistry for alterations in the expression of four proteins, cyclin D1, retinoblastoma (Rb), p53, and Her2/neu, known to be important in breast tumorgenesis, and correlated these data with tissue vascularity.\nVascularity was determined by immunologic detection of von Willebrand factor. For carcinoma in situ (CIS) both stromal vascularity (MVD) and vascular cuffing (MCD) were determined.\nWe found that cyclin D1 expression was increased in usual hyperplasia (11% of cases). Atypical hyperplasia, noncomedo CIS and comedo CIS were positive in 43, 49, and 57% of cases, respectively. Changes in Rb and p53 were rare in hyperplasia but occurred in 8 and 10% of CIS, respectively. Her2/neu protein was identified rarely in atypical hyperplasia and in both noncomedo and comedo ductal CIS. Neither Rb nor Her2/neu expression correlated with vascularity. p53 immunoreactivity correlated positively with both MCD and MVD.

{"title": "[Morphology of peripheral nerves, their sheaths, and their vascularization].", "abstract": "This review aims to update our understanding of peripheral nerves, including the nature and function of their sheaths and, finally, their vascularization. The peripheral nervous system is made up of nerves whose function is to gather stimuli from the periphery as well as to transport the motor, secretory or vegetative responses that are triggered to the periphery. The connective tissue surrounding peripheral nerves all along their extension is made up of endoneurial, perineurial and epineurial. The endoneurium surrounds individual axons, which are grouped in fasciculi, each of which is surrounded by the perineurium and finally, the group of fasciculi that comprise all the axons present in this nerve are surrounded by the epineurium. Axons form an intraneural plexus such that they occupy positions in the various fasciculi along the trajectory of the plexus. The number and size of fasciculi vary along the trajectory of a nerve as a result of the plexus positioning of the axons. Peripheral nerves are richly vascularized throughout their length, with multiple anastomoses forming the intraneural vascular network, which is made up mainly of arterioles, capillaries, postcapillary venules and venules. Regarding the blood-nerve barrier and the existence of capillary permeability: endoneural capillaries have junctions that are stronger than those of the endothelial cells of vessels in the epineurium and perineurium. Two distinct lymph channels networks are present in the peripheral nerve stems and are separated by the perineural barrier.

In case of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, the conventional techniques only partially determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of contrast medium (CM) exchange between different compartments. Here a modified pharmacokinetic model is applied, which is based on the bidirectional CM exchange between blood and two interstitial compartments in terms of the fractional volumes of the compartments and the vessel permeabilities between them. The evaluation technique using this model allows one to quantify the fractional volumes of the different compartments (blood, cells, slowly and fast enhancing interstitium) as well as the vessel permeabilities and cerebral blood flow (CBF) with a single T1-weighted dynamic MRI measurement. The method has been successfully applied in 25 glioma patients for generating maps of all of these parameters. The fractional volume maps allow for the differentiation of glioma vascularization types. The maps show a good correlation with the histological grading of these tumors. Furthermore, regions with enhanced interstitial volumes are found in high-grade gliomas. Differences in permeability maps of Gd-DTPA apart from BBB disruption do not exist between different tissue types.

A two-fold increase in VEGF levels was found in the 20% SO dietary group compared to the 20% FO group in 100-mm3 but not larger tumors.

These cells proliferated and differentiated to produce cords of endothelial cells. By 15 WG, some cords were already patent and formed an immature vascular tree in the inner retinal layers that was centered on the optic disc. These processes are consistent with vessel formation by vasculogenesis. Angiogenesis then increased the vascular density of this immature plexus and extended it peripherally and temporally. Maturation of the plexus was characterized by substantial remodeling, which involved the withdrawal of endothelial cells into neighboring vascular segments. The outer plexus was formed as a result of the extension of capillary-sized buds from the existing inner vessels, a process that began around the incipient fovea between 25 and 26 WG.\nThese observations suggest that the formation of primordial vessels in the central retina is mediated by vasculogenesis, whereas angiogenesis is responsible for increasing vascular density and peripheral vascularization in the inner retina. In contrast, the outer plexus and the radial peripapillary capillaries are formed by angiogenesis only. These mechanisms of retinal vascularization appear similar to those of vascularization of the central nervous system during development.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2001-02-07", "authors": ["SHughes", "HYang", "TChan-Ling"], "doi": null}

PAI-1 mRNA was first found in the ciliary epithelium in embryonic day 18.5, when the ciliary body has reached an advanced developmental stage. PAI-1 mRNA was also detected in the ganglion cell layer of the retina at postnatal days 1 to 4, when angiogenesis takes place.\nDuring development, PAI-1 is likely to be involved in retina vascularization, in agreement with other cases of angiogenesis. Results for the adult eye indicate that the ciliary epithelium is the source for PAI-1 activity found in the aqueous humor. The results suggest that PAI-1 plays a role in balancing fibrinolysis and proteolysis specifically in the anterior segment of the eye, implying that PAI-1 overproduction in the ciliary epithelium could shift the balance against proteolysis and thus may interfere with aqueous outflow.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2001-02-07", "authors": ["TMasos", "J ADan", "RMiskin"], "doi": null}

Tumor vascularity was assessed with continuous, harmonic gray-scale imaging with a low mechanical index (MI). Tumor vascular volume was assessed with brief, high-MI insonation called interval-delay imaging, which caused microbubble destruction. As the total contrast agent volume in the liver reflects the total vascular volume, quantitation of lesion enhancement relative to normal hepatic enhancement helped determine the vascular volume of the tumor relative to that of normal parenchyma.\nLow-MI continuous harmonic imaging showed lesional vessels in hepatocellular carcinomas, minimal or no vessels in hemangiomas, and variable vascularization in metastases. High-MI interval-delay imaging showed greater enhancement in hepatocellular carcinomas than in normal liver (P <.02) and showed less enhancement in hemangiomas than in normal liver (P <.02). Enhancement in metastases was greater in the margins than in the center; as a result, the lesions appeared smaller (P <.03) and less well defined on the interval-delay images.\nContrast-enhanced harmonic imaging appears superior to conventional Doppler US for hepatic mass characterization.

Acute vascular rejection of porcine-to-primate xenografts is thought to be triggered by binding of xenoreactive antibodies to the graft. We tested whether antibodies, binding to Galalpha1-3Gal epitopes in porcine tissue, initiate this phenomenon.\nSpecific depletion of anti-Galalpha1-3Gal antibodies from the blood of baboons, using extracorporeal perfusion of separated plasma through columns of Sepharose beads covalently linked to the antigenic trisaccharide, Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcAc, averted the development of acute vascular rejection in porcine organs transgenic for human decay-accelerating factor and CD59. More importantly, after immunodepletion was stopped and Gala1-3Gal antibodies were allowed to return, these same organs continued to function and remained pathologically normal and thus seemed to achieve a state of accommodation.\nThese results demonstrate that anti-Galalpha1-3Gal antibodies cause acute vascular rejection and suggest that depletion of these antibodies leads to accommodation of the donor cardiac xenograft and could supply an important model for additional study.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2001-01-11", "authors": ["S SLin", "M JHanaway", "G VGonzalez-Stawinski", "C LLau", "WParker", "R DDavis", "G WByrne", "L EDiamond", "J SLogan", "J LPlatt"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200012270-00002"}

Insufficient oxygen supply to the grafted islets is one possible major obstacle to the preservation of graft function.

A bFGF-releasing device was designed enclosing bFGF in a polyethylene terephthalate mesh bag coated with polyvinylalcohol hydrogel. In the vascularized group (n = 5), two bFGF-releasing devices were implanted bilaterally into the subcutaneous tissue of the back of streptozotocin-induced diabetic Lewis rats. One week after implantation, isolated rat islets (5000) were syngeneically transplanted subcutaneously after the removal of the devices. In the control group (n = 5), no devices were implanted and the same number of rat islets was transplanted directly. One week after the implantation of the devices into the test animals, a thick, well-vascularized capsule was observed in the subcutaneous site. All vascularized recipient rats showed significant decreases in nonfasting blood glucose and maintained normoglycemia for more than 1 month after islet transplantation. However, in the control group, all rats failed to achieve normoglycemia after transplantation. This study provides evidence that the subcutaneous tissue is a promising site for pancreatic islet transplantation, offering convincing advantages in acceptability for diabetic recipients.

{"title": "Indicator dilution methods for measuring blood flow, volume, and other properties of biological systems: a brief history and memoir.", "abstract": "In 1824 Hering introduced an indicator-dilution method for measuring blood velocity. Not until 1897 was the method extended by Stewart to measure blood (volume) flow. For more than two decades, beginning in 1928, Hamilton and colleagues measured blood flow, including cardiac output. They proposed that the first-passsage indicator concentration-time curve could be recovered from observed curves that included recirculation by semilogarithmic extrapolation of the early downslope. Others followed with attempts to fit the complete first-passage curve by various forms, such as by the sum of three exponential terms (three well-stirred compartments in series). Stephenson (1948) thought of looking at indicator-dilution curves as convolutions of indicator input with a probability density function of traversal times through the system. Meier and I reached a similar conclusion, and extended it. The fundamental notion is that there exists a probability density function of transit times, h(t), through the system. We proved that mean transit time t= V/F, where V is volume in which the indicator is distributed. Thus, V, F, and t might all be calculated, or r alone might suffice if one wanted only to know relative blood flow. I extended the analysis to include residue detection of indicator remaining in the system, so that V, F, and could be calculated by external monitoring. Chinard demonstrated the value of simultaneous multiple indicator-dilution curves with various volumes of distribution. Goresky extended the technique to study cell uptake and metabolism. He also found a transform of indicator-dilution output curves (equivalent to multiplying the ordinate by tand dividing the time by t) which made congruent the family of unalike curves obtained by simultaneous injection of indicators with different volumes of distribution. Bassingthwaighte showed the same congruency with the transform of outputs of a single indicator introduced into a system with experimentally varied blood flows. We showed the same congruency for the pulmonary circulation, adding a correction for delays. Success of these transforms suggests that the architecture of the vascular network is a major determinant of the shape of density functions of transit times through the system, and that there is in this architecture, a high degree of self-similarity, implying that the fractal power function is a component in shaping the observed density of transit times. I proposed that the distribution of capillary critical opening pressures, which describes recruitment of vascular paths, may be important in shaping indicator-dilution curves, and that h(t) may be derived from flow-pressure and volume-pressure curves under some circumstances.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2001-01-06", "authors": ["KZierler"], "doi": "10.1114/1.1308496"}

Clinical studies have shown that angiogenesis in solid tumors relates to a poor prognosis and, in premalignant lesions, indicates potential for cancerous transformation. High-fat, n-6 fatty acid-rich diets were associated with a relatively poor prognosis in breast cancer patients; in a nude mouse model the same diet enhanced breast cancer progression, whereas n-3 fatty acids exerted suppressive effects that were associated with impaired angiogenesis. Lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase products of n-6 fatty acid metabolism are angiogenic in in vitro assays.

Adjuvant or neo-adjuvant radiotherapy (RTH) increases susceptibility to trauma and infections. The aim of this study is to compare the incidence of local complications after mandibular reconstruction with vascularised composite free flaps, related to pre- or postoperative radiotherapy. The effects of these complications on functional rehabilitation with a dental prosthesis fixed on bone implants are also studied.\nBetween 1990 and 1999, 49 vascularised composite free flaps were used for mandibular reconstructions (41 iliac crest flaps and 8 fibula flaps). 31 patients (63%) underwent preoperative (8) or postoperative (23) radiotherapy. Short (6-12 months) and long-term (over 12 months) outcomes are analysed separately. The incidence of complications depending on the timing of radiotherapy (neo vs adjuvant) was compared.\nIn the first 12 months the complication rates among the irradiated and non-irradiated patients were 26 and 11% respectively. During short-term evaluation complications were seen in 26% of the irradiated patients and 11% of the non-irradiated group. After 12 months the rate of complications rises to 45% for the irradiated and 18% for the non-irradiated patients. 27% of irradiated patients presented with fistula, 27% with exposed metallic plates and 9% developed osteoradionecrosis of the graft. Dental implants were inserted in 29 grafts, among which 9 had secondary radiotherapy. 90% of the non-irradiated patients and 56% of the irradiated patients chewed with the dental prosthesis fixed on bone implants.\nRegardless of pre- or postoperative timing, radiotherapy clearly augments complications, the incidence of which increases with time. Only in one patient did osteoradionecrosis necessitate removal of the dental prostheses. Inability to chew is linked more to the amount of resection of the mobile tongue than to complications of radiotherapy.

{"title": "Ancient views on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis: an historical and epistemological perspective.", "abstract": "The modern views on the anatomical and physiological interactions between the hypothalamus, pituitary and thyroid gland have emerged only in the last fifty years, although their historical roots may be found in a number of ancient and still not widely known ideas and observations. The regulation of energy body stores and temperature by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, for example, is a classical case of \"fixit\u00e8 du mileu interieur\" in the sense originally suggested by Claude Bernard in the late 1800s, i.e. a homeostatic mechanism, but already 2100 year previously Aristotle had stated that the brain was necessary for the maintenance of body integrity by regulating food intake and behavior in relation to body temperature, the latter primarily determined by the heat of the blood. Five hundred years later Galen of Pergamon reported fundamental discoveries in the anatomy of the third ventricle region, including the location of the pituitary gland inside the sella turcica embodied in a vascular network, the rete mirabilis, and observed nerves adjoining the \"soft flesh\" in the neck, i.e. the thyroid gland. He first proposed that the energy of the body (the vital spirit) was carried through the arteries at the level of the rete mirabilis, where it was transformed into nerve impulse (the animal spirit), eventually transferred by the nerves to the periphery of the body, \"glands\" included, raising implicitly the possibility for a nervous influence over the thyroid activity. The Galenic model remained virtually unaltered up to the beginning of the 14th century, when the mediaeval anatomist Mondino de' Liuzzi put forth the idea that the thyroid gland interacted with the heat of the blood present in the internal carotid arteries due to their anatomical relation with the thyroid. This interaction enriched the vital spirit, i.e. the energy of the body, prior to its transformation into animal spirit, i.e. to nerve impulse directed to the periphery of the body. In addition, Mondino envisaged the possibility that the third ventricle was implicated in the regulation of the animal behavior by processing sensory, cognitive and emotional informations. No trace of these Mondino's ideas can be found throughout the Renaissance, despite the leading anatomical work of the period, the Fabrica by Andreas Vesalius, remained apparently inclined to the Galenic dogma of the rete mirabilis. After Vesalius, the Galenic anatomy and physiology of the infundibular region survived for at least two more centuries, and we owe Luigi Galvani, the discoverer of animal electricity, the first detailed anatomical observation that in humans the nasal secretions were not a \"drainage\" waste of the brain ventricles, as postulated by Galen, but the product of nasal mucous glands. From an epistemological standpoint, Aristotle anticipated the possibility that the \"set point\" for energy intake and behavioral adaptation was determined by the interplay between the brain activity and a thermogenic principle present in the blood, in a manner very close to a circuitry devoted to maintain the energetic and thermic steady state of the living organism (homeostasis). The Galenic modelling of brain-thyroid interaction is an evolution of the Aristotelian one, since it postulates an anatomical and functional loop linking the transport of body energy to the brain through the arteries, and the transformation of this energy into neural output directed to the peripheral glands, \"thyroid\" included, by the mediation of the pituitary gland. Finally, the proposal by Mondino de' Liuzzi provides a scheme of brain-thyroid interaction that merges together the \"homeostatic\" Aristotelian with the \"pituitary/autonomic\" Galenic models, suggesting that the thyroid plays a \"thermoregulatory\" role linked to the control of body energy. This remarkable set of ideas has never been credited to Mondino by the modern historical critique, possibly due to the impact that the methodological reform of anatomy by Vesalius, resulting in the denial of much Galenic tradition, had on the way to interpret Mondino's work from the late Renaissance up to the 20th century. The current concepts of the regulation by peripheral nerves of the thyroid blood flow and/or secretion seems to have been anticipated by anecdotal observations in the Egyptian and Roman times. In the second half of the 18th century the belief by Luigi Galvani that the peripheral nerves were carrying electrical impulses can be considered the first theoretical statement derived from an empirical evidence, i.e. the animal electricity, supporting the Galenic idea that autonomic fibers might influence the secretion of \"humors\" from peripheral glands, thyroid included.

Many growth factors important to ovarian cancer invasion are also prominent in its associated angiogenesis. Deregulation of normal angiogenic processes occurs with the cancer's acquisition of the ability to secrete pro-angiogenic factors. The local imbalance of endogenous angio-stimulators and angio-inhibitors promotes vascularization and vascular leak. Assessment of these pro-angiogenic growth factors and enumeration of tumour-associated microvessels have been shown to be prognosticators of ovarian cancer outcome, and may also be surrogates of ovarian cancer tumour burden and/or ascites formation. The process of angiogenesis has been targeted for therapeutics development. Ovarian cancer is a primary cancer against which these new agents are being tested. Thus, further understanding of the molecular and cell biology of angiogenesis in the context of ovarian cancer offers important directions for estimation of patient outcome and for patient treatment.", "journal": "Bailliere's best practice & research.

{"title": "Vascularization is a general requirement for growth of plant and animal tumours.", "abstract": "Solid-tumour growth in animals as in humans depends on angiogenesis. Tumours that fail to induce the formation of new blood vessels do not enlarge beyond a few millimetres in diameter. Plant tumours induced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens can reach diameters of more than 100 mm, thus raising the question of how they are sufficiently supplied with nutrients and water. Until recently, these rapidly growing tumours were considered unorganized or partly organized masses. However, in analogy to animal and human tumours, growth of leaf and stem tumours depends on neovascularization. Plant tumour cells induce the formation of a sophisticated vascular network consisting of water-conducting vessels and assimilate-transporting sieve elements. Similar to animal and human tumours that overexpress angiogenic growth factors, plant tumours overexpress the T-DNA-encoded vascularization-promoting growth factors auxin and cytokinin upon AGROBACTERIUM: infection. High auxin levels induce ethylene emission from the tumours, which has a strong impact on tumour and host stem, as well as on root structure and function. Ethylene apparently stimulates abscisic acid synthesis in the leaves above the tumour, which reduces transpiration and thus protects the host plant from rapid wilting. Hence, for the elucidation of phytohormone-dependent vascular development in plants, such tumours are regarded as an excellent model system. The comparison of analogous requirement of neovascularization for tumour growth in plants, as in animals and humans, is discussed in terms of interdisciplinary strategies of possible prevention and therapy.", "journal": "Journal of experimental botany", "date": "2001-01-05", "authors": ["C IUllrich", "RAloni"], "doi": "10.1093/jexbot/51.353.1951"}

The sudden surge of interest and subsequent growth in CXCR4 research following this discovery has led to a number of surprising findings. As well as being important for lymphocyte trafficking and recruitment at sites of inflammation, it appears that CXCR4 and its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1 play an important role in hematopoiesis and developmental processes such as organogenesis, vascularization and embryogenesis.

{"title": "The role of VEGF and thrombospondins in skin angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The vasculature in adult skin remains normally quiescent, due to the dominant influence of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors over angiogenic stimuli. However, skin retains the capacity for brisk initiation of angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels, during tissue repair and in numerous diseases, including inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and skin cancers such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. Moreover, cyclic vascular expansion occurs during the growth phase of the hair follicle. Recent evidence suggests vascular endothelial growth factor as the major skin angiogenesis factor. During skin angiogenesis, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor is induced in epidermal keratinocytes by several stimuli including transforming growth factor-alpha and hypoxia, leading to increased vascularization of the dermis. In contrast, vascular endothelial growth factor-C induces skin lymphangiogenesis. Thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 are endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis that are expressed in normal skin, maintaining the quiescence of cutaneous vessels. Both inhibitors potently inhibit skin cancer growth via inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.

{"title": "[Angiogenesis and tumor progression in melanoma].", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new blood capillaries from preexisting vessels. It takes place in physiological and pathological conditions, such as cancer. Tumor angiogenesis depends on the release of angiogenic growth factors by tumor cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells, and from the extracellular matrix following degradation by tumor proteases. Human melanoma progresses through different steps: nevocellular nevi, dysplastic nevi, in situ melanoma, radial growth phase melanoma (Breslow index < or = 0.75 mm), vertical growth phase melanoma (Breslow index > 0.75 mm), and metastatic melanoma. In agreement with progression, it acquires a rich vascular network, whereas an increasing proportion of tumor cells express the laminin receptor, which enables their adhesion to the vascular wall. Hence, both phenomena favour tumour cell extravasation and metastases. Melanocytic cells produce and release Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2), mainly in the steps of dysplastic nevus and melanoma in vertical growth phase. Melanoma cells also secrete the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), in parallel with the switch from the radial to the vertical growth phase and the metastatic phase.

To probe the role of distinct T cell receptor (TCR) avidity differences and the role of cytokine expression patterns of different effector T cells that may participate in allograft rejections, we have identified a dominant allopeptide derived from the H-2Kd molecule, recognized by H-2b CD4 T cells in the context of syngeneic I-Ab.\nTo identify a stimulatory peptide derived from the H-2Kd molecule, a panel of synthetic overlapping peptides was screened for immunogenicity and a panel of T cell clones established. These clones were characterized for TCR Vbeta usage by mAb staining and/or reverse transcribed-polymerase chain reaction analysis, peptide dose sensitivity as a marker of TCR avidity, cytokine expression phenotype in vitro, and their ability to mediate rejection of a vascularized cardiac allograft after adoptive transfer to immunodeficient mice.\nThe H-2Kd54-68 peptide was identified as a dominant stimulatory peptide by the ability of T cells from C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice primed by a combination of allogeneic spleen cell injection and mixed peptide immunization to mount an in vitro proliferative response and interferon-gamma production by peptide stimulation. Furthermore, direct immunization with synthetic H-2Kd54-68 peptide of normal C57BL/6 mice resulted in accelerated rejection of both skin and cardiac allografts from B10.D2 (H-2d) mice, but not 3rd party B10.BR (H-2k) grafts. A panel of 15 distinct CD4+ clones specific for H-2Kd54-68 peptide were established and shown to utilize a variety of TCR Vbeta and different apparent TCR avidities to H-2Kd54-68 peptide when stimulated in vitro. To characterize these clones further, two clones were chosen based on the difference of avidity to H-2Kd54-68 peptide. The cytokine expression pattern was determined and indirect alloantigen specificity confirmed by analysis of responses to purified peptide and B10.D2 spleen cells using normal H.2b and I-Abeta chain knockout mice as APC donors. Both of these T cell clones were able to mediate rejection of B10.D2, but not B10.BR hearts, in immunodeficient mice, but the morphological pattern of T cell infiltration was distinct.\nThese results demonstrate the potential importance of fine dissection of the alloantigeneic response to solid organ transplants and provide unique insights into the role of TCR avidity and cytokine expression patterns in different morphological patterns of transplant rejection.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2000-12-16", "authors": ["KHonjo", "X YXu", "R PBucy"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200011270-00020"}

Stem cell factor (SCF) stimulates mast cell migration, proliferation, and degranulation and therefore may influence mast cell behavior within tumors. We investigated the contribution of SCF to tumor angiogenesis by manipulating its level in mammary tumors. Sense or antisense cDNA fragments of rat SCF were ligated into an episomal expression vector. Ethylnitrosourea-induced rat mammary tumor cell lines were transfected with vector containing either control (no insert, C-P), sense (S-P), or antisense (AS-P) SCF DNA. The functional nature of the transfectants was confirmed by measuring SCF in cell lysates and conditioned media. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors induced in Berlin-Druckrey rats by these transfected cells demonstrated that mast cell number and microvascular density were significantly higher in S-P tumors and significantly lower in AS-P tumors, compared with C-P tumors. The expression of von Willebrand factor, an endothelial cell marker, showed a similar pattern. AS-P tumors were significantly smaller than either C-P or S-P tumors.

In our previous study (G. Zeng et al., Biochemistry, 38: 8762-8769, 1999), we established a subclone of the rat dorsal root ganglion-derived F-11 cells in which the expression of ganglioside GD3 was inhibited by stable transfection of the antisense vector against CMP-NeuAc: GM3 alpha2-8 sialyltransferase (GD3-synthase) gene. This cell line exhibits markedly reduced rate of tumor growth in vivo. Here, we further characterized the antisense-transfected cell line, and the results showed that these cells formed small, minimally vascularized tumors exhibiting extensive necrosis. In vivo Matrigel assay revealed reduced vascularization and low hemoglobin content in the antisense xenografts. Significantly fewer new vessels were found on the antisense xenografts and the skin around them than those on/around the xenografts formed by the sense-transfected and untransfected F-11 cells. The hemoglobin content of the antisense xenografts was much lower than that of the xenografts formed by the control cells. The reduced angiogenesis in the antisense xenografts was correlated with a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. The expression of VEGF was suppressed in the antisense xenografts and the conditioned culture media of the antisense-transfected F-11 cells as determined by Western blotting analysis. This was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry of the tumors using antibodies against VEGF and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1). Therefore, our results demonstrate that reduced tumor growth in nude mice by suppression of GD3-synthase expression in F-11 cells results from minimal angiogenesis of the tumors through down-regulation of the VEGF expression, which indicates an important role for GD3 in tumor angiogenesis.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2000-12-16", "authors": ["GZeng", "LGao", "SBirkl\u00e9", "R KYu"], "doi": null}

A rat model of tibial lengthening was used with a protocol divided into a latency period of 7 days, a distraction period that lasted 14 days with a daily distraction rate of 0.5 mm in two steps, and a consolidation period of 21 days. Vascular casting was done on the hindlimbs before osteotomy and on postoperative days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42. Scanning electron microscopic findings were correlated with radiological and histological observations. On days 7 and 14, the proliferation of periosteal vessels was pronounced and there was distinct subperiosteal bone formation on the osteotomized surfaces. On day 21, vascular branches from the medullary canal of the host bone formed a vascular network, which gave rise to multiple axial, straight vascular branches, running parallel to the direction of distraction, toward the interzone, in accordance with the progress of mineralization. On day 28, the periosteum provided vascularization to the peripheral side of the interzone whereas the center of the interzone was still relatively avascular. On day 42, the periosteal and medullary vascular channels were completely connected at the distraction site including the interzone, which was occupied by developing and mature bone trabeculae. These results suggest that vascular proliferation occurs actively during the latency and distraction periods and then gradually decreases over time. A close temporal and spatial relationship exists between formation of regenerated bone and vascular proliferation of the periosteum and medullary canal.", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society", "date": "2000-12-16", "authors": ["I HChoi", "J HAhn", "C YChung", "T JCho"], "doi": "10.1002/jor.1100180504"}

Because the vasculogenesis requires a cascade of growth factors, their receptors, and intracellular signals, such therapies may require the application of more than a single growth factor. We examined the effect of 2 endothelial cell-specific growth factors, angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), on primary cultured porcine coronary artery endothelial cells. VEGF, but not Ang1, increased DNA synthesis and cell number. Ang1 or VEGF induced migration and sprouting activity, increased plasmin and matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion, and decreased tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase type 2 secretion. A combination of the submaximal doses of Ang1 and VEGF enhanced these effects and was more potent than the maximal dose of either alone. In a rabbit ischemic hindlimb model, a combination of Ang1 and VEGF gene delivery produced an enhanced effect on resting and maximal blood flow and capillary formation that was greater than that of either factor alone. Angiographic analyses revealed that larger blood vessels were formed after gene delivery of Ang1 or Ang1 plus VEGF than after VEGF gene delivery.

In the present study we show that established ONB tumors treated with bFGF upregulate the bFGF receptor (FGFR1) prior to differentiation. This cellular differentiation was evidenced by bFGF-induced expression of the human runt homologue AML1 (PEBP2 alpha B, CBFA-2) that is highly expressed in developing olfactory neuroepithelium and TrkA, a preferred nerve growth factor receptor. Since TrkA is expressed in supporting cells, but not in mature olfactory neurons, we hypothesize that the expression of AML1 and TrkA in bFGF-treated JFEN cells induced supporting cell differentiation.

This may be attributable to lack of a proper microenvironment for hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation. We have designed a model in which complete hematopoietic reconstitution of lethally irradiated rats can be achieved by vascularized bone marrow transplantation (VBMT) in an orthotopic hind-limb graft. The aim of the study was to investigate the process of repopulation of bone marrow cavities and peripheral blood of irradiated rats after VBMT and, in particular, to follow the contribution of grafted BM cells and residual recipient BM cells in hematopoietic regeneration. Lewis hind-limbs were transplanted orthotopically to totally irradiated (8 Gy) syngeneic sex-mismatched recipients (VBMT). In the control group 8 x 10(7) BM cells in suspension were injected intravenously (BMCT). After 10 days BM and peripheral blood (PB) cells were collected from the recipient. For cell subset analysis cytomorphological evaluation of BM smears and flow cytometry of PB cells were performed. Additionally, PCR was performed using specific primers for rat Y chromosome (sex-determining region Y-Sry) to detect male (donor or recipient) cells in sex-mismatched BM graft recipients and the products were analyzed by electrophoresis. VBMT brought about much faster replenishment of nucleated cells in BM and PB than did BMCT. Cytometry analysis of PB cells revealed more lymphocytes in VBMT than in BMCT recipients. The amount of donor DNA of bands corresponding to Y-Sry was also higher in PB cells of VBMT than of BMCT recipients. The presence of host DNA was observed in PB cells of VBMT rats but was not detected in PB population of BMCT recipients. VBMT is highly effective in hematopoietic reconstitution of irradiated recipients. The fast cell maturation and repopulation may be due to the presence of stromal cells transplanted in a normal spatial relationship with donor hematopoietic cells in hind-limb graft.

We included in this study single or multiple, bleeding and/or large fibroids, symptomatic on compression, contraindicated for myomectomy because of high surgical or anesthesiologic risks or myomata in which myomectomy could probably be converted into hysterectomy. Fibroids enlarging the uterus to the size of 25 weeks' pregnancy or more, pedunculated myomata or small submucous fibroids--smaller than 5 cm--were excluded.

Indications must be restricted to patients in good condition with a good functional prognosis. The goal of replantation must be focused not only on reimplanting the amputated limb but also on achieving a good functional outcome. For the lower limb, simple terminalization remains the best choice in many cases. When a proximal amputation is not suitable for replantation, the main aim of the surgical procedure must be to reconstruct a stump long enough to permit fitting a prosthesis preserving the function of the adjacent joint. If the proximal stump beyond the last joint is very short, it may be possible to restore some length by partial replantation of spared tissues from the amputated part. We present here the results we obtained following this policy.\nThis series included 16 cases of partial replantations, 14 involving the lower limb and 2 the upper limb.

The functional calcaeoplantar unit was used in 13 cases. The transfer of this specialized weight bearing tissue provided a stable distal surface making higher support unnecessary. In one case, we raised a 13-cm vascularized tibial segment covered with foot skin for additional length. For the upper limb, the osteocutaneous transfer, based on the radial artery, was not reinnervated, but this lack of sensitivity did not impair prosthesis fitting.\nOne vascular failure was finally amputated. This was the only unsuccessful result. For all other patients, the surgical procedure facilitated prosthesis fitting and preserved the proximal joint function despite an initially very proximal amputation.\nThe advantages of partial replantation are obvious compared with simple terminalization or secondary reconstruction. There is no secondary donor site and, because there is no major muscle mass in the distal fragment, the overall risk is very low compared with the risk of total proximal leg replantation.", "journal": "Revue de chirurgie orthopedique et reparatrice de l'appareil moteur", "date": "2000-12-06", "authors": ["TDubert", "S AMalikov", "ADinh", "D DKupatadze", "COberlin", "J YAlnot", "B BNabokov"], "doi": null}

Takilon was injected into the median coccygeal arteries of six specimens from each species, and Latex (a natural rubber with ammonia) into those of four specimens. Takilon-injected specimens were corrosion casted, and arteries nourishing the gland were revealed via dissection. Vascularization of the uropygial glands of both the goose and the duck was observed to be the right (a. gl. uropygii dextra), left (a. gl. uropygi sinistra) and ventral (a. gl. uropygi ventralis) glandular uropygial arteries, arising from the median coccygeal (a. coccygea media) artery. Both the right and left glandular uropygial arteries were observed, divided into four branches as follows; muscular ramus (ramus muscularis), medial ramus (ramus medialis), ventral ramus (ramus ventralis) and lateral ramus (ramus lateralis). Of these, as the lateral, medial and ventral branches feed the gland, the muscular branch provides blood for the lateral coccygeal (m. coccygealis lateralis) and levator coccygeal (m. levator coccygealis) muscles, and the skin.

Strictly controlled angiogenesis in the healthy adult occurs cyclically in the ovary and corpus luteum, which therefore make an excellent model with which to study vascular growth. Dysfunctional or uncontrolled angiogenesis is involved in a number of diseases and is responsible for growth and dissemination of tumours. This review focuses on the following aspects of the ovary: the gross and microscopical anatomy of the blood vessels, described mainly--but not exclusively--in the bovine; vascularization of the follicle before and after ovulation; angiogenesis in the developing and the mature corpus luteum as well as in the corpus luteum of pregnancy. The potential mechanisms of vascular regression during luteolysis and the potential role of vascular growth in dominance and atresia of follicles will be described. Furthermore, recent research on ovarian angiogenic and potential anti-angiogenic factors including fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), angiopoietin and metalloproteinase inhibitor will be presented. Finally, the role of hormones including FSH, LH, sexual steroids, prostaglandins, prolactin, oxytocin and activin/inhibin in ovarian angiogenesis will be summarized.

Such tissue can be generated in vivo using basic tissue engineering principles. In previous studies in our laboratory, we have used a model comprising an arteriovenous (AV) shunt loop sandwiched in artificial dermis, placed in a cylindrical plastic growth chamber, and inserted subcutaneously to grow new connective tissue progressively up to 4 weeks. To learn more about the basic growth characteristics with this model, the same AV shunt loop within a chamber without added extracellular matrix was inserted subcutaneously into the groins of rats for 2, 4, or 12 weeks (n = 5 per group). There was a progressive increase in the mass and volume of tissue such that the chamber was two-thirds full after 12 weeks. Histological examination showed that at 2 weeks there was evidence of fibroblast and vascular outgrowth from the AV shunt, with the formation of granulation tissue, surrounded by a mass of coagulated exudate. At 4 weeks the connective tissue deposition was more extensive, with a mass of more mature granulation tissue containing considerable collagen. By 12 weeks there was an extensive, well vascularized mass of mature fibrous tissue. The blood vessels and residual adventitia of the AV shunt were the likely source of growth factors and of the cells which populated the chamber with new maturing connective tissue. A patent AV shunt in an isolated chamber appears to be the minimal requirement for the generation of new vascularized tissue that is potentially suitable for microsurgical transplantation.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2000-12-05", "authors": ["RMian", "W AMorrison", "J VHurley", "A JPenington", "RRomeo", "YTanaka", "K RKnight"], "doi": "10.1089/10763270050199541"}

Theoretically, myocardial neoangiogenesis could be further enhanced by the addition of angiogenic growth factors. Triads of TMLR channels were created in the lateral wall of the left ventricles of 12 pigs (mean body weight 73+/-5 kg), using a holmium:yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG) laser. The animals were allocated randomly either to receive an injection of 100 microg of a bovine bone-derived growth factor mixture within the triads (n=6), or to a control group (n=6). Animals were killed 1 month later. Capillary and arteriolar densities were determined by computed morphometric analysis of histological sections of the triads. The capillary density of myocardial areas within the triads was significantly greater in the group receiving the bovine bone-derived growth factor mixture than in the control group (14.3+/-3.5/mm(2) and 5.7+/-1.4/mm(2) respectively; P<0.001). The difference was also significant when considering arteriolar density (0.7+/-0.4/mm(2) and 0.2+/-0.1/mm(2) respectively; P<0.001). For comparison, capillary and arteriolar densities of the TMLR channel scars were 48.7+/-9.7 and 1.9+/-0. 5/mm(2) respectively in the angiogenic group, and 46.3+/-13.7 and 2. 3+/-1.3/mm(2) respectively in the control group (no significant differences). These results demonstrate that the addition of angiogenic factors to TMLR stimulates neoangiogenesis significantly in the areas adjacent to the channels, but not within the channel scars. The latter are themselves strongly vascularized.

Retinal photographs were taken at the end of each test period. Bifurcation angles and arteriolar diameters were measured using operator-directed image analysis, and junction exponents were calculated. Arteriolar diameters narrowed on breathing O(2). The magnitude of this change was significantly greater in normotensive than in hypertensive subjects. Angles narrowed in normotensive subjects, but not significantly in hypertensive subjects. Arteriolar diameters increased significantly on breathing CO(2) in normotensive but not in hypertensive subjects, but there were no changes in angles. Despite changes in diameter, junction exponents did not change under any conditions. Vascular reactivity in the retinal arteriolar bed appears to be diminished in hypertensive subjects. The failure of junction exponents to change, despite alterations in diameter, suggests that arteriolar diameters at retinal bifurcations adhere to optimality principles when exposed to acute vasoactive stress.

Densely covered microcarriers were brought into a fibrin matrix together with endothelial cells. In order to demonstrate the formation and stabilization of capillary-like structures, UEA-I labeled specimens were evaluated using laser scanning microscopy and digital image analysis.

{"title": "[Effect of different factors on the bone forming properties of recombinant BMPs].", "abstract": "The extent of BMP-induced new bone formation is mainly determined by the number of mesenchymal target cells in the recipient bed as well as by the biological half-life of the BMP molecules within the tissue. While the number of inducible cells is determined by the age and vascularization of the tissue, the retention time of the BMP molecules can be influenced. One possibility is the coupling of BMPs to suitable carriers, which significantly increases the osteoinductive effect. The reason for this is the physical binding of BMPs to the carrier material, which delays the resorption of the proteins. Other factors are the composition of the carrier materials, their structural stability, and possible dislocations of carrier particles. The local tissue concentration of BMPs can also be increased by an enhanced binding of the proteins to the extracellular matrix. A BMP-2 mutant (BMP-2xa) was produced by the specific modification of the amino acid sequence using recombinant technologies. BMP-2xa induces heterotopic bone formation at significantly lower concentrations than natural BMP-2.

Determination of the extent of bone formation using quantitative computerized tomography].", "abstract": "Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogenic (AAA) bone is an osteoinductive preparation of completely demineralized bone matrix. It has been clinically applied for years. In an experimental study in rabbits, we evaluated the influence of cortical bone and periosteum on the amount of bone formation following augmentation with AAA bone. Two implants of standardized size were placed on the femoral bone of rabbits. A cell-excluding PTFE membrane was wrapped circularly around the femur as well as the anterior implant shielding the implant from the surrounding periosteum. The posterior implant was exposed directly to the periosteum while being shielded from the cortical bone by the membrane. Thus, two compartments were created selectively, preventing contact between the periosteum or cortical bone and the implants. For each compartment the area and volume of the induced new bone were evaluated by computerized radiograph analysis and quantitative CT (pQCT) scans. Implantation of AAA bone led to new bone formation in both compartments. Contact of the periosteum and the implant led to an almost four-fold increase in bone volume. Although bone formation showed interindividual variations, the difference of both compartments was highly significant using the Student's t-test for paired samples (P < 0.0001). The data show that periosteum is the primary source of new bone formation in augmentations with osteoinductive materials as it is rich in inducible progenitor cells and is well vascularized. In osseous augmentations with AAA bone, the periosteum should be preserved in order to achieve a close contact of the osteoinductive implant. Shielding from the periosteum, e.g., by cell-excluding membranes, leads to significantly less bone formation following implantation of AAA bone and should therefore be avoided.", "journal": "Mund-, Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie : MKG", "date": "2000-11-30", "authors": ["K KW\u00fcrzler", "N RK\u00fcbler", "J FReuther"], "doi": "10.1007/PL00012692"}

In the Lewis rat, periosteal flaps were harvested from the medial surface of the tibia vascularized by the saphenous artery and vein and were transferred to the groin on its vascularized pedicle. Alternatively, the periosteal flap along its pedicle was transferred between the thigh muscles to be wrapped around a femoral defect of 1 cm. The animals were divided into 10 groups (82 animals). In group 1, the periosteal flap was left empty in the groin. Groups 2 and 3 consisted of the periosteal flap and 20 micrograms rh-BMP-2, but in group 3 the vascular pedicle was ligated proximally. In group 4 the flap was harvested without the periosteal layer and turned \"inside out\". Groups 5 and 6 consisted of the periosteal flap and the matrix OPLA/HY +/- 20 micrograms rh-BMP-2. In the femoral defect model, bone formation was studied using the matrix OPLA/HY alone (group 7) or combined with the vascularized periosteal flap (group 8), or in combination with OPLA/HY + BMP (group 9) or OPLA/HY + BMP + the periosteal flap (group 10). The presence and density of new bone formation in the groin and femoral defect were evaluated radiologically and histologically at 4 and 8 weeks. Good bone formation in the groin chamber (ectopic) was demonstrated in the periosteal flap + OPLA/HY + BMP group. In the femoral defects, good bone formation (orthotopic) was seen in the OPLA/HY + BMP + the periosteal flap groups. However, with the presence of a vascularized periosteal flap, more bone formation along the rim of the defect was observed. This study of ectopic bone formation in the groin and orthotopic bone formation in the femoral defect demonstrates that optimal bone formation requires four factors: BMP, a biodegradable matrix, osteoprogenitor cells, and blood supply. Potentially in the future, this technique could be used to reconstruct a bony defect or a nonunion by covering the involved area with a vascularized periosteal flap and a suitable matrix combined with BMP.

{"title": "Evidence for placental abnormality as the major cause of mortality in first-trimester somatic cell cloned bovine fetuses.", "abstract": "The production of cloned animals is, at present, an inefficient process. This study focused on the fetal losses that occur between Days 30-90 of gestation. Fetal and placental characteristics were studied from Days 30-90 of gestation using transrectal ultrasonography, maternal pregnancy specific protein b (PSPb) levels, and postslaughter collection of fetal tissue. Pregnancy rates at Day 30 were similar for recipient cows carrying nuclear transfer (NT) and control embryos (45% [54/120] vs. 58% [11/19]), although multiple NT embryos were often transferred into recipients. From Days 30-90, 82% of NT fetuses died, whereas all control pregnancies remained viable. Crown-rump (CR) length was less in those fetuses that were destined to die before Day 90, but no significant difference was found between the CR lengths of NT and control fetuses that survived to Day 90. Maternal PSPb levels at Days 30 and 50 of gestation were not predictive of fetal survival to Day 90. The placentas of six cloned and four control (in vivo or in vitro fertilized) bovine pregnancies were compared between Days 35 and 60 of gestation. Two cloned placentas showed rudimentary development, as indicated by flat, cuboidal trophoblastic epithelium and reduced vascularization, whereas two others possessed a reduced number of barely discernable cotyledonary areas. The remaining two cloned placentas were similar to the controls, although one contained hemorrhagic cotyledons. Poor viability of cloned fetuses during Days 35-60 was associated with either rudimentary or marginal chorioallantoic development.

The perforation was large and leakage of contrast prevented demonstration of the distal CBD despite our attempt to primarily repair the perforation. The CBD was explored; a T-tube was placed. T-tube cholangiogram demonstrated flow of contrast into the duodenum. A large leak remained at the cystic CBD junction. A cholecystectomy was performed and a vascularized flap of the gallbladder wall was used to repair the CBD over the T-tube. The T-tube was clamped intermittently beginning 3 weeks postoperatively.

{"title": "Intussusceptive arborization contributes to vascular tree formation in the chick chorio-allantoic membrane.", "abstract": "Various reports indicate that the process of intussusceptive microvascular growth (IMG) plays a crucial role in capillary network formation of the chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM). In the present study we demonstrate by methylmethacrylate (Mercox) casting and in vivo time-lapse observations that intussusception, i.e. insertion of transcapillary tissue pillars, is also strongly involved in vascular tree formation, a process we refer to as intussusceptive arborization (IAR). From day 7 to day 14 of incubation, several arterial and venous branching generations arise from the capillary plexus. The process is initiated by pillar formation in rows, which are demarcating future large vessels in the capillary meshwork. In a subsequent step the pillars undergo reshaping to form narrow tissue septa that successively merge, which results in the production of new generations of blood vessels. This is followed by growth and maturation of all vascular components. The process of IAR in the CAM is very active at days 10 and 11 of incubation and takes place in preferentially perfused capillary regions determining \"dynamic areas\". The process of intussusception may be preceded by endothelial division, but the transcapillary pillar formation itself occurs primarily by rearrangement and attenuation of the endothelial cells without local endothelial cell proliferation. We conclude that after the early sprouting phase, the process of intussusception is the basic mechanism of CAM vascularization. It leads to capillary network growth and expansion (IMG) and, at the same time to feed vessel formation with several branching generations (IAR).", "journal": "Anatomy and embryology", "date": "2000-11-23", "authors": ["V GDjonov", "A BGalli", "P HBurri"], "doi": "10.1007/s004290000126"}
{"title": "[Cataract surgery in children].", "abstract": "Cataract extraction in children has improved and became more popular over the past few decades but, due to particular features of children's eyes, still remains controversial--especially regarding the intraocular lens implantation.\nIn contrast to adults, indications for cataract surgery in children are much more difficult to determine. Since subjective visual acuity cannot be obtained, greater reliance must be placed on the morphology and location of the lens opacity, and the behavior of the child. Forced preferential looking and visual evoked potentials can be helpful, but they should not be the only criteria.\nIn management of pediatric cataract, correction of postoperative aphakia is still an incompletely resolved problem. Conventionally, optical correction is achieved by spectacles or contact lenses. The power of both spectacles and contact lenses can be readily adjusted to compensate for ocular growth. The success of both depends significantly on parental compliance and the child's acceptance. Hutchinson reported that 44% children with aphakia stopped wearing glasses or contact lenses 2 months after surgery. Contact lens wearing can also result in a number of corneal complications, including infectious keratitis, corneal vascularization and hypoxic corneal ulceration. IOL implantation is theoretically superior to glasses and contact lenses since it provides almost immediate optical correction which is much more reliable because it does not depend on parental or child's compliance. Still, there are many controversies about IOL implantation in infants and young children like IOL-size, material, IOL power calculation, prevention and management of secondary cataract, as well as long term safety of IOLs in children's eyes. Although short-term anatomic results after cataract extraction and primary IOL implantation in children are excellent and stable, long-term follow-up is necessary to answer questions about the long-term safety of implants in children's eyes.\nA higher incidence of postoperative inflammation and opacification of the optical axis has been reported after pediatric cataract surgery. Posterior capsular opacification is almost an unavoidable complication in children's eyes if the posterior capsule is left intact. Several methods have been proposed in order to keep the optical axis clear in infants and young children. Comparison of posterior capsulectomy with and without anterior vitrectomy showed that posterior capsular opacification rates are diminished only after combined posterior capsulectomy and anterior vitrectomy and not after capsulectomy alone. Posterior capsulorhexis with optic capture seems to effectively prevent posterior capsular opacification. This technique eliminates the need for anterior vitrectomy and ensures the centration of the intraocular lens. Glaucoma and retinal detachment are late complications of pediatric cataract surgery. On average glaucoma develops 6.8 years after cataract operation. Retinal detachment develops several decades after cataract extraction.\nThe functional results after pediatric cataract surgery depend not only on the anatomic success of the operation and postoperative maintenance of a clear optical axis, but even more on aphakic visual rehabilitation. Children's eyes with cataract severe enough to require cataract extraction usually have some degree of amblyopia already present prior to surgery. In unilateral pseudophakia amblyopia develops postoperatively unless the fellow eye is occluded or optically and/or pharmacologically penalized. Immediate optical correction is desirable because prevention and/or therapy of amblyopia should be initiated directly after surgery. Parental compliance with occlusion therapy and not successful surgery are major determinants of a good visual outcome in unilateral aphakic/pseudophakic children.", "journal": "Medicinski pregled", "date": "2000-11-23", "authors": ["SPavlovi\u0107"], "doi": null}

CBF (i.e., flow velocity x coronary cross-sectional area at the Doppler tip) and CP were monitored during washout of 2-5 mCi of (133)Xe after bolus injection into the left main artery before and after PTCA. Xe mean transit time (MTT) was calculated as the area under the time-activity curve, acquired by a gamma camera, divided by the dose obtained from a model fit of the Xe curve in the anterior wall. CBF response to intracoronary adenosine (2 mg) was also assessed. PTCA increased baseline CBF (from 14.5 +/- 9.4 to 20 +/- 8 ml/min, P < 0.01), coronary flow reserve (from 1.52 +/- 0.24 to 2.33 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01), and CP (from 64 +/- 9 to 100 +/- 10 mmHg, P < 0.05). MTT decreased from 89 +/- 32 to 70 +/- 19 s (P < 0.05) after PTCA; however, MTT and CBF changes were not correlated (r = -0.09, not significant). Inasmuch as MTT is the ratio of distribution volume to CBF, MTT x CBF was used as an index of perfused myocardial volume. Volume increased after PTCA from 23 +/- 18 to 56 +/- 30 ml. A direct correlation was observed between the percent increase in distal CP and percent increase in perfused volume (r = 0.91, P < 0.01). Thus low CP was not associated with exhaustion of flow reserve but, rather, with reduction of perfused myocardial volume. These data suggest that, in the presence of a severe coronary stenosis, derecruitment of vascular units occurs that is proportional to the decrease in driving pressure. Residual perfused units maintain a vasomotor tone, thus explaining the paradoxical persistence of coronary reserve.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Activation of recipient vascular endothelium and platelets by porcine hematopoietic cells and/or activation of donor organ vascular endothelium and/or molecular differences between the species may play roles. Irradiation or drug therapy could possibly potentiate endothelial cell activation and/or injury.\nWe have investigated parameters of coagulation and platelet activation in nonhuman primates after (1) a regimen aimed at inducing mixed hematopoietic chimerism and tolerance (TIR that included total body irradiation, T cell depletion, and splenectomy; (2) pig bone marrow or pig peripheral blood mobilized progenitor cell transplantation (PCTx); and/or (3) pig organ transplantation (POTx). Five experimental groups were studied. Baboons were the recipient subjects in all groups except Group 1. Gp 1 Cynomolgus monkeys (n=6) underwent TIR + allotransplantation of hematopoietic cells and a kidney or heart or TIR + concordant xenotransplantation (using baboons as donors) of cells and a kidney; Gp 2 Baboons (n=4) underwent TIR with or without (+/-) autologous hematopoietic cell infusion; Gp 3 (n=12) PCTx+/-TIR; Gp 4 (n=5) POTx+/-TIR; Gp 5 (n=4) TIR + PCTx + POTx. Platelet counts, with plasma prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen levels, fibrin split products and/or D-dimer were measured.\nIn the absence of a discordant (porcine) cellular or organ transplant (Groups 1 and 2), TIR resulted in transient thrombocytopenia only, in keeping with bone marrow depression from irradiation. PCTx alone (Group 3) was associated with the rapid development of a thrombotic thrombocytopenic (TTP)-like microangiopathic state, that persisted longer when PCTx was combined with TIR. POTx (+/-TIR) (Group 4) was associated with a gradual fall (over several days) in platelet counts and fibrinogen with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); after graft excision, the DIC generally resolved. When TIR, PCTx and POTx were combined (Group 5), an initial TTP-like state was superseded by a consumptive picture of DIC within the first week, necessitating graft removal.\nBoth PCTx and POTx lead to profound alterations in hemostasis and coagulation parameters that must be overcome if discordant xenotransplantation of hematopoietic cells and organs is to be fully successful.

Donor hearts were perfused with either DNA-liposome complexes or adenoviral vectors that encode the active form of human TGFbeta1. DNA-liposome mediated transfection prolonged allograft survival in approximately two-thirds of transplant recipients, while adenoviral delivery of TGFbeta1 was not protective. Protective TGFbeta1 gene transfer was associated with reduced Th1 responses and an inhibition of the alloantibody isotype switch. The protective effects of TGFbeta1 gene transfer were overridden by exogenous interleukin-12 administration. Interestingly, alloreactive CD4+ and CD8+ cells exhibited distinct sensitivities to TGFbeta1 gene transfer: CD4+ Th1 function was abrogated by this modality, although CD8+ Th1 function was not. Transient depletion of recipient CD8+ cells markedly prolonged the survival of grafts transfected with either DNA-liposome complexes or adenoviral vectors. Transgene expression persisted for at least 60 days, and Th1 responses were not detectable until CD8+ T cells repopulated the periphery. However, long-term transfected allografts appeared to exhibit exacerbated fibrosis and neointimal development. These manifestations of chronic rejection were absent in long-term transfected isografts, suggesting that long-term expression of active TGFbeta1 alone is not sufficient to induce fibrosis of the grafts. Collectively, these data illustrate the utility of immunosuppressive gene therapy as a treatment for transplantation when combined with additional conditioning regimens. Further, they illustrate that alloreactive CD4+ and CD8+ cells may be differentially influenced by cytokine manipulation strategies.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2000-11-22", "authors": ["S YChan", "R EGoodman", "J RSzmuszkovicz", "BRoessler", "E JEichwald", "D KBishop"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200011150-00006"}

We have investigated the activity of cis-acting sequences of the murine Flk-1 gene in the tumor endothelium of experimental tumor models in vivo. B16 melanoma, BFS-1 fibrosarcoma, and polyoma middle T-induced mammary adenocarcinoma were grown in transgenic mice that express the LacZ reporter gene under the control of a 939-bp Flk-1 promoter fragment and an enhancer element located in a 2.3-kb fragment of the first intron. In all experimental tumor models examined, strong endothelium-specific reporter gene expression was observed while being absent from most blood vessels in normal adult tissue. The expression patterns of the LacZ reporter gene correlate well between established tumors grown in Flk1-LacZ transgenic mice and tumors grown in Flk-1+/LacZ knock-in mice that express the LacZ reporter gene from the endogenous Flk-1 locus. The endothelium-specific activity of the Flk-1 promoter/enhancer sequences in three different experimental tumor models demonstrates that the regulatory sequences that mediate the up-regulation of Flk-1 in the tumor endothelium are contained in the Flk-1 promoter/enhancer sequences used, and that these elements function relatively independently of the tumor type.

{"title": "Placental defects in ARNT-knockout conceptus correlate with localized decreases in VEGF-R2, Ang-1, and Tie-2.", "abstract": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is a transcriptional regulator that heterodimerizes with Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) proteins. ARNT also dimerizes with hypoxia inducible factor1alpha (HIF1alpha), inducing expression of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) to promote angiogenesis. The angiogenesis/vasculogenesis pathway is required for embryonic survival and includes several receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, Tie2) and ligands (VEGF, Ang1, Ang2, neuropillin). Transgenic knockout of ARNT in mice is lethal due to abnormal placentation. This study examines the VEGF pathway in GD9.5 embryos of wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-), or knockout (-/-) ARNT genotype. All genotypes expressed abundant VEGF in trophoblastic giant cells. However, -/- conceptuses had less VEGFR2 in placental labyrinth and trophoblastic giant cells. Ang1 and Tie2 decreased in trophoblastic giant cells and Ang2 was decreased in placental endothelial cells. Abnormal development of the labyrinth correlated with decreased binding of VEGF and decreased expression of VEGFR2. In addition, VEGFR2 seemed to be the primary VEGF binding receptor in the labyrinth and blood lacunae of the placenta, as binding could be eliminated by masking the VEGFR2 receptor with inactive antibody complex. VEGFR1 may be primarily responsible for binding of VEGF to yolk sac and embryonic tissues, as masking VEGFR2 did not reduce VEGF binding in those areas, and it is interesting that major structural defects were also not found in those regions. In summary, in the ARNT knockout conceptus, the impact of ARNT deficiency on placental expression of VEGFR2 seems to provide an explanation for the failure of the placental labyrinth to progress, whereas the vascularization of the yolk sac and embryo appear relatively unaffected on GD9.5.

Although this has been attributed to bronchospasm, characteristically it is refractory to bronchodilators, suggesting that other mechanisms may play a role.\nThe clinical course and preoperative angiograms of patients who underwent unifocalization were reviewed. Patients who developed airflow limitation early after surgery underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy. In addition, the anatomy of the MAPCAs was examined in 14 heart-lung blocks from patients with PA-VSD. Twenty-two procedures were performed in 16 children. Three developed marked airflow limitation early after surgery, necessitating prolonged high-pressure ventilation. Bronchoscopy demonstrated tracheobronchial epithelial necrosis in 2 and signs of tracheobronchial ischemia in the third. Two were successfully extubated after 15 and 16 days, but the third died after 57 days of ventilatory support. Review of the preoperative angiograms demonstrated an extensive peribronchial arterial supply arising from a MAPCA in 1 of the patients who developed severe airway necrosis after unifocalization. This was also obvious in a second patient, but the MAPCA was not included in the unifocalization. In 7 autopsy specimens, MAPCAs contributed to a peribronchial or peritracheal vascular network. Dissection of the distribution of these branches in 2 specimens revealed extensive intrapulmonary peribronchial anastomoses.\nAirflow limitation early after unifocalization is related to airway ischemia resulting from interruption of the tracheobronchial blood supply during mobilization of MAPCAs.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2000-11-18", "authors": ["ISchulze-Neick", "S YHo", "ABush", "MRosenthal", "R CFranklin", "A NRedington", "D JPenny"], "doi": "10.1161/01.cir.102.suppl_3.iii-142"}
{"title": "Inhibition of platelet aggregation in baboons: therapeutic implications for xenotransplantation.", "abstract": "Activation of endothelial cells and platelet sequestration play major roles in rejection of xenografts. The histopathology of both hyperacute and acute vascular or delayed rejection of vascularized discordant xenografts is characterized by interstitial hemorrhage and intravascular thrombosis. Agents that prevent platelet activation and consequent microthrombus formation have proven beneficial in xenograft rejection but do not fully preclude vascular thrombosis. Recently, several new anti-platelet therapies have undergone extensive clinical testing for atherosclerotic thrombotic vascular disorders; other putative therapies are undergoing pre-clinical evaluation. We have investigated the effect of several of these novel agents on platelet aggregation in baboons in order to screen for future potential in xenograft rejection models.\nDrugs tested in these experiments were aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA, von Willebrand Factor-GPIb inhibitor), fucoidin (a selectin-inhibitor), 1-benzylimidazole (1-BI, thromboxane synthase antagonist), prostacyclin (PGI2, endothelial stabilizer), heparin (thrombin antagonist), nitroprusside sodium or nicotinamide (NPN or NA, both NO-donors), and eptifibatide (EFT, GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist). These were infused intravenously to nine baboons. Coagulation parameters and platelet counts were monitored and baboons were observed for adverse side-effects. The efficacy of these agents in inhibiting platelet aggregation was assayed in a platelet aggregometer.\nTreatment with ATA and fucoidin resulted in complete inhibition of platelet aggregation but also in major perturbation of coagulation parameters. 1-BI and PGI2 had no effect when administered alone, but in combination resulted in moderate inhibition of aggregation without disturbance in PT or PTT. NPN and NA had no substantive effects on platelet aggregation. Heparin resulted in specific inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and, as anticipated, was associated with moderate prolongation of PTT. Importantly, EFT caused complete inhibition of platelet aggregation without changes in coagulation. Platelet counts, fibrinogen levels, and fibrinogen degradation products remained within the normal ranges in all experiments.\nAlthough excellent inhibition of platelet activation was obtained with ATA and fucoidin, clinical use may be precluded by concomitant disturbances of coagulation. Combinations of heparin and EFT may prove beneficial in preventing the thrombotic disorders associated with xenograft rejection while maintaining adequate hemostatic responses.

This results from pre-formed xenoreactive antibodies directed against galactose-alpha1,3-galactose (alphaGal) in the donor organ and activation of the complement cascade. We describe an in vivo murine model of HAR using a BALB/c mice system devoid of histocompatibility or complement differences between donor and recipient to investigate in isolation, the effects of alphaGal epitope and anti-alphaGal antibody interactions in causing rejection of vascularized heart transplants. Gal KO mice were immunized with rabbit red blood cell membranes to induce high anti-alphaGal antibody titers that were predominantly IgM by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). When alphaGal-expressing mice hearts were transplanted heterotopically into these recipients (n= 12), 67% of grafts rejected within 24 h, the majority within 16 h with histological features of HAR. In contrast, none of the grafts in the non-immunized Gal KO recipient control group (n=11) underwent HAR. Interestingly, approximately 50% of the remaining grafts in both the immunized and non-immunized Gal KO recipient group were rejected between 7 and 27 days by a rejection process characterized by a dense infiltrate of macrophage/monocytes, perivascular cuffing and tissue destruction similar to recent descriptions of delayed xenograft rejection (DXR). In addition, some grafts (21.5%) continued to survive in the immunized Gal KO recipients despite the presence of anti-alphaGal antibody and normal complement activity and these showed well-preserved myocardium when harvested whilst still functioning well at days 30 or 90. No rejection was seen when Gal KO donors were used in this system (n=4), nor when alphaGal-expressing BALB/c hearts were transplanted into alphaGal-expressing BALB/c recipients (n=5).

The mean postoperative interval was 50.2 months. Primary reconstruction was accomplished by vascularized soft tissue repair alone in 1 case, an osteocutaneous scapula graft in 1 case, and by vascularized soft tissue and nonvascularized bone grafts in 3 cases. Secondary reconstruction with nonvascularized bone after vascularized soft tissue transfer was done in 3 cases, and vascularized secondary reconstructions with composite flaps were performed in the remaining 7 cases. Patients were examined for closure of oronasal or oroantral perforations and restoration of midfacial contour. The results were categorized as good, fair, and poor, and were related to the type and timing of the restoration.\nOne flap loss was encountered and one compromised flap was salvaged. Secondary nonvascularized skeletal reconstructions after vascularized soft tissue transfer were susceptible to infectious complications caused by voids, and they did not provide adequate skeletal contour in higher-order defects. Contour restoration was estimated to be good in 9 patients, fair in 3, and poor in 3. Poor results were limited to secondary reconstructions.\nIt is concluded that the skeletal repair of the midface frame should be done primarily, as far as possible. If the orbital frame can be preserved, primary repair by vascularized soft tissue alone may be sufficient, with secondary restoration of the alveolar crest with nonvascularized bone grafts.

In general, the cutaneous evaporative cooling mechanism is not activated by appropriate stimuli in cold-acclimated pigeons in contrast to heat-acclimated pigeons. We studied with electron microscopy whether the differences in the function of the skin are reflected in the structure of the epidermal water barrier of these two extreme acclimation states. The epidermis of cold-acclimated pigeons is attenuated, and the underlying dermis lacks any intimate vascularization. Both the extracellular and the intracellular domains in the stratum corneum contain organized lamellar lipids. At the stratum transitivum-stratum corneum interface, multigranular body secretion is indicated by the highly convoluted cell membranes and membraneous sacculae enclosing the multigranular bodies. Alternatively, multigranular bodies retain in the corneocytes, and the lipoid material originated from them is reprocessed to broad lamellae. The keratohyalin (KH) granules are spotlike and oriented as cortical bands beneath the plasma membrane. In heat-acclimated pigeons, the epidermis displays modified patches side by side with basic structural type of epidermis. The modified areas are characterized by hypertrophy and abundance of dermal capillaries adjacent to the hypertrophied patch. No lamellar lipids are discerned in the dilated extracellular space. The structure of multigranular bodies is abnormal, and the numbers of lipid droplets in the outer viable epidermis and stratum corneum are decreased. The transitional cells contain stellate KH granules, which form a network throughout the cell. It is concluded that cold-acclimated pigeons have a lamellar, extracellular water barrier, the cutaneous water evaporation is minimized, and heat is stored in the body core. Acclimation to heat leads to formation of structurally heterogeneous skin. The structurally modified skin patches show disruption of the barrier-forming machinery in the multigranular bodies and marked reorganization of fibrillar proteins and electron-dense KH masses in the transitional layer.

To examine whether VEGF plays a role as a chemoattractant for the developing kidney vasculature, avascular metanephric kidneys from rat embryos (E14) were cocultured with endothelial cells. To determine whether VEGF directly provides chemoattractive guidance for migration, we examined migration of endothelial cells toward VEGF-coated beads. Mouse glomerular endothelial cells expressing beta-galactosidase (MGEC) were isolated from Flk-1(+/-) heterozygous mice and passaged 4-12 times. Upon 24 h culture on collagen I gels MGEC formed a lattice or capillary-like network. Embryonic metanephroi were cocultured with MGEC on collagen I gels for 1-6 days in defined media, stained for beta-galactosidase, and examined by light microscopy. Metanephric organs induced a rearrangement of the endothelial cell lattice and attracted MGEC. MGEC invaded the metanephric organs forming capillary-like structures within and surrounding the forming nephrons. This process was accelerated and amplified by low oxygen (3% O(2)) and was prevented by anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies. MGECs migrated toward VEGF-coated beads, whereas PBS-coated beads did not alter MGEC networks.

{"title": "Clinical biocompatibility of biodegradable orthopaedic implants for internal fixation: a review.", "abstract": "When the polymeric material reaches the final stages of its degradation process, biodegradable orthopaedic fixation devices elicit a local foreign-body reaction. In most cases, the symptoms of this tissue response are subclinical and pass unnoticed, but in some patients a clinically manifest inflammatory foreign-body reaction ensues. Mild clinical reactions consist of a painful erythematous papule, those of medium severity show a sinus discharging polymeric debris for up to 6 months, and in the patients affected by a severe reaction, extensive osteolytic lesions may develop at the implant tracks. The histopathologic picture is that of a non-specific foreign-body reaction. For implants made of polyglycolide, the average incidence of the manifest reactions is 5%. When slow-degrading polymers are used, the incidence is lower. The tissue responses to polyglycolide manifest themselves 11 weeks after surgery, on an average, whereas foreign-body reactions to devices made of poly-L-lactide can emerge as late as 4 or 5 yr after the original fracture fixation operation. A poorly vascularized bone section, use of a quinone dye as an additive in the polymer, and an implant geometry with large surface area each seems to be associated with an increased risk of the occurrence of a foreign-body reaction. Yet in majority of the patients affected, no known individual marker of high risk is present. Some recent laboratory experiments indicate that it may be possible to diminish the risk of an adverse tissue response by incorporating alkaline salts or antibodies to inflammatory mediators in the implants.

HESR1 is detectable in all adult tissues and at high levels in well vascularized organs such as heart and brain. Its expression is also enriched in aorta and purified capillaries. Overexpression of HESR1 in endothelial cells down-regulates vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) mRNA levels and blocks proliferation, migration, and network formation. Interestingly, reduction of expression of HESR1 by antisense oligonucleotides also blocks endothelial cell network formation in vitro. Finally, HESR1 expression is altered in several breast, lung, and kidney tumors. These data are consistent with a temporal model for HESR1 action where down-regulation at the initiation of new vessel budding is required to allow VEGFR2-mediated migration and proliferation, but re-expression of HESR1 is necessary for induction of tubular network formation and continued maintenance of the mature, quiescent vessel.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2000-11-09", "authors": ["A MHenderson", "S JWang", "A CTaylor", "MAitkenhead", "C CHughes"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M008506200"}

The latter prevented direct contact between the autograft and the host bone. Observations were continued for 3 years.\nAbrogation of the contact between subchondral bone and articular cartilage-bone autograft had little effect on the cartilage during the first 5-12 months. By 3 years, autografts in the methylmethacrylate wells had non-vascularized and non-viable subchondral bone. The cartilage in these wells underwent degenerative changes compatible with OA.\nInterruption of contact between articular cartilage and vascularized subchondral bone resulted in degeneration of the cartilage. The onset and detection of these degenerative changes required long time periods (3 years).

The neovagina consists of two parts; a long vascularized urethral flap and a pedicled island tube skin flap created from the penile skin. The urethral flap is embedded into the skin tube. The tube, consisting of skin and the urethral flap, is inverted, thus forming the neovagina. The new vagina is inserted into the previously prepared perineal cavity between the urethra, bladder and rectum. The neovagina is then fixed to the sacrospinous ligament. The labia minora and majora are formed from remaining penile and scrotal skin. The new method was used in 89 patients (mean age 28 years, range 18-56) with a mean (range) follow-up of 4. 6 (0.25-6) years.\nGood cosmetic and functional results were obtained in 77 of the 89 patients (87%). Importantly, the neovagina produced in most patients was of satisfactory depth and width. There was only one major complication, a rectovaginal fistula caused by intraoperative injury to the rectum.\nThe technique produces a vagina with more normal anatomical and physiological characteristics than those produced by other methods, as all the penile components are used (except for the corpora cavernosa) to form almost normal external female genitalia.

For the preparation of more soluble 7-alkylamino-2-ureas, a number of protecting groups for the 2-amine were evaluated (phthaloyl, 4-methoxybenzyl) following selective blocking of the 7-amine (trityl), but these were not superior to the (required) 2-tert-Bu-urea group itself. Direct alkylation of the anion of the (unprotected) 7-amino group with excess 4-(3-chloropropyl)morpholine in DMF gave low (10%) yields of the desired product, but alkylation of the 7-acetamido anion, followed by mild alkaline hydrolysis, raised this to 64%. 3-Phenyl analogues were nonspecific inhibitors of isolated c-Src, FGFR, and PDGFR tyrosine kinases, whereas 3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl) analogues were most effective against c-Src and FGFR, and 3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl) derivatives showed high selectivity for FGFR alone.

The exogenous insulin requirement decreased progressively after transplantation, and insulin treatment was withdrawn at 6 months. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels were in the normal range at 1 and 2 yr (5.3%) and increased slightly above the upper normal limit at 3 and 4 yr (6.3% and 6.4%). Fasting C peptide levels remained stable during the entire follow-up, but the proinsulin to insulin ratios increased dramatically at yr 3. Glycemic levels after an oral glucose tolerance test showed a diabetic profile at 1 yr, a normal profile at 2 yr, and an impaired glucose tolerance profile at 3 yr. Intravenous glucose tolerance test-induced first phase insulin release, present at 1 and 2 yr, disappeared at 3 yr. Diabetes-related autoantibodies (islet cell antibodies, glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, and tyrosine phosphatase-like protein antibodies) were undetectable before transplantation and remained so during the entire follow-up. The patient died of myocardial infarction 50 months after transplantation while she was still in good metabolic control (glycosylated hemoglobin, <6.8%) in the absence of exogenous insulin administration. The autoptic liver showed well granulated islets, richly vascularized and without evidence of lympho-mononuclear cell infiltration. The morphometrically extrapolated intrahepatic beta-cell mass was 99.9 mg.

Several studies have shown the prognostic importance of microvessel density (MVD) and of angiogenic factor expression in operable gastric cancer. In the present study we investigated, with immunohistochemistry the MVD, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and of thymidine phosphorylase (TP) expression, as well as the nuclear expression of p53 protein, in a series of patients with locally advanced inoperable gastric cancer. A strong association of VEGF with TP expression was noted (P = 0.005), and tumors coexpressing these factors had a statistically higher MVD (P = 0.0001). Nuclear p53 accumulation was also related to a high MVD (P = 0.004), and this was independent of VEGF or TP expression. Microvessel density showed a bell-shaped association with prognosis; cases with an intermediate MVD exhibit a favorable outcome (P < 0.05). A trend of nuclear TP expression to define a group of patients with poorer prognosis was noted (P = 0.06), while none of the remaining variables showed any significant association. The immunostaining results allowed the grouping of the angiogenic profile in four major categories: 1) highly vascularized tumors with VEGF and/or TP expression (about 36% of cases); 2) highly angiogenic tumors with p53 nuclear accumulation and low VEGF/TP expression (7% of cases); 3) poorly vascularized tumor with low VEGF/TP and negative nuclear p53 staining (32% of cases); 4) poorly vascularized tumors with TP expression (7% of cases). Specific therapies targeting hypoxia, VEGF, or TP expression as well as p53 gene therapy have entered clinical experimentation or are already available for clinical use. Using the suggested markers more than 80% of locally advanced gastric carcinomas can be grouped in different categories according to their angiogenic profile.

Treatment of ODC/Ras double transgenic mice with alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific inhibitor of ODC enzyme activity, causes a rapid regression of these spontaneous tumors. DFMO treatment led to dramatic decreases in ODC activity and putrescine levels, but v-Ha-ras expression was not affected in the regressed tumors. Moreover, cyclin D1 continued to be strongly expressed in the basal epithelial cells of regressed tumors, and there was no decrease in the proliferative index of these same tumor cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling analyses revealed increased DNA fragmentation in DFMO regressed tumors compared with similarly sized spontaneous tumors from ODC/Ras transgenic mice not treated with DFMO. Moreover, the blood vessel count was significantly decreased in regressed tumors within the first four days of DFMO treatment. The decreased vasculature in DFMO regressed tumors was not attributable to altered expression of murine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoforms. Elevated levels of ODC activity in the skin of K6/ODC transgenic mice increased the dermal vascularization compared with that in nontransgenic normal littermates. Our results suggest that ODC stimulates an angiogenic factor(s) other than VEGF and/or may play a key role in a cell survival effector pathway of Ras that is independent of a Ras-induced proliferation pathway.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2000-11-04", "authors": ["LLan", "CTrempus", "S KGilmour"], "doi": null}

Our investigation showed that in parallel to the increase of MBP reactivity in the spinal cord white matter more GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes appeared. Reaction of vessel endothelium with lectin UEA-1 revealed the temporal increase of vascularization in the course of the spinal cord tracts myelination in fetuses. In the postnatal period when the myelination is nearly morphologically completed, the spinal cord white matter was poorly vascularized although GFAP-immunoreactive cells were still relatively numerous.

However, no quantitative data have placed the magnitude of this contribution into a physiological perspective. We have used hematopoietic chimeras to determine that 0.2% to 1.4% of ECs in vessels in control tissues derived from hematopoietic progenitors during the 4 months after irradiation and hematopoietic recovery.

{"title": "Migration of cells from human anterior cruciate ligament explants into collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffolds.", "abstract": "Regeneration of the human anterior cruciate ligament after complete rupture offers several theoretical advantages over reconstruction, including maintenance of the complex insertion sites and fan-shape of the ligament and preservation of remaining proprioceptive fibers within the ligament substance. Well vascularized connective tissues, such as dermis, heal as a result of migration of fibroblasts into a provisional scaffold, the fibrin clot. Wound closure is subsequently facilitated by a contractile cell phenotype. This study was designed to determine if fibroblasts intrinsic to the human anterior cruciate ligament were capable of migrating from their native extracellular matrix onto an adjacent provisional scaffold in vitro. Another objective was to determine whether any of the cells that successfully migrated into the scaffold expressed the contractile actin isoform, alpha-smooth muscle actin, associated with wound contraction in other tissues. The results demonstrated that the cells intrinsic to the human anterior cruciate ligament were able to migrate into a collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold, bridging a gap between transected fascicles in vitro. As a result of this cell migration and proliferation, areas in the scaffold contained cell number densities similar to those seen in the human anterior cruciate ligament in vivo. No extracellular matrix or tissue formation was seen in the gap between directly apposed transected ends of the anterior cruciate ligament explants cultured without an interposed collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold. The fascicle-collagen-glycosaminoglycan-fascicle constructs and the fascicle-fascicle explants displayed minimal adherence after 6 weeks in culture. Any disruption in the contact area between explant and scaffold, even as small a gap as 50 microm, prevented cell migration from the explant to the collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold at the area of loss of contact. All cells that migrated into the scaffold at early time periods expressed the alpha-smooth muscle actin isoform. These results demonstrate that cells that migrate into and proliferate within the collagen-glycosaminoglycan matrix have contractile potential as reflected in their expression of the alpha-smooth muscle actin isoform. The role of these contractile cells in the healing process warrants further investigation.

{"title": "Villous sprouting: fundamental mechanisms of human placental development.", "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that maldevelopment of the placental villous tree can play an important role in the pathogenesis of various pregnancy diseases. In this review we present the most recent advances of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the early formation of chorionic villi. In particular we focus our attention on the structural events during early villous sprouting leading to the formation of the mesenchymal villi which are the forerunners of all other villous types, i.e. immature intermediate villi, stem villi, mature intermediate villi and terminal villi. Early villous sprouting starts as 'hot spots' which are circumscribed areas consisting of highly proliferating cytotrophoblastic and stromal cells. The post-proliferative cytotrophoblastic cells fuse with the overlying syncytium leading to the formation of the trophoblastic sprouts. When villous mesenchyme invades the trophoblastic sprouts, the latter are transformed into villous sprouts. The vascularization of the villous sprouts leads to the formation of the mesenchymal villi, the most basic villous type. This process is repeated throughout pregnancy. We analyse the influence of various extracellular matrix molecules, e.g. tenascin and hyaluronic acid, on the formation of hot spots and mesenchymal villi as well as the transformation of the latter in other villous types. We present a critical survey on the data on vessel formation related to villous sprouting and morphogenesis of mesenchymal villi as well as the expression of various angiogenic factors and their receptors.", "journal": "Human reproduction update", "date": "2000-10-25", "authors": ["MCastellucci", "GKosanke", "FVerdenelli", "BHuppertz", "PKaufmann"], "doi": "10.1093/humupd/6.5.485"}

Various local flaps and free flaps have been described for reconstruction of small and large defects. Small defects can be closed with local tissue, whereas free flap coverage may be necessary for coverage of large defects.\nFrom July 1993 to September 1998 14 patients between the age of 15 and 74 years (mean 47 years; 3 female, 11 male) underwent free flap coverage for the exposed Achilles tendon due to primary trauma, chronic wounds or tumors. The mean duration of follow-up was 33.3 months. The defect size ranged from 8 x 8 to 25 x 28 cm.\nSix parascapular flaps (three with a vascularized scapular fascial extension), four radial forearm flaps and four latissimus dorsi flaps (one combined with free serratus fascia) were used for soft tissue coverage over the Achilles tendon. Thirteen flaps survived. In one case a parascapular flap had to be removed due to venous thrombosis and a free latissimus dorsi flap was used as secondary salvage procedure. The donor site morbidity was acceptable for most patients after flap harvesting in the subscapular region and also satisfactory in the forearm region. Average active range of motion in the upper ankle joint was 15-0-40 degrees for extension/flexion. All patients were satisfied with the functional and aesthetic result.\nSoft tissue coverage over the exposed Achilles tendon requires an optimal solution for each patient to achieve an aesthetically pleasing result and acceptable function.

Subchondral bone is not only an important shock absorber, but it may also be important for cartilage metabolism. Contrary to many drawings and published reports, the subchondral region is highly vascularized and vulnerable. Its terminal vessels have, in part, direct contact with the deepest hyaline cartilage layer. The perfusion of these vessels accounts for more than 50% of the glucose, oxygen, and water requirements of cartilage. Bony structure, local metabolism, hemodynamics, and vascularization of the subchondral region differ within a single joint and from one joint to another. Owing to these differences, repetitive, chronic overloading or perfusion abnormalities may result in no pathological reaction at all in one joint, while in another joint, these same conditions may lead to osteonecrosis, osteochondritis dissecans, or degenerative changes. According to this common etiological root, similar pathological reactions beginning with marrow edema and necrosis and followed by bone and cartilage fractures, joint deformity, and insufficient healing processes are found in osteonecrosis, osteochondritis dissecans, and degenerative disease as well.", "journal": "Investigative radiology", "date": "2000-10-21", "authors": ["HImhof", "ISulzbacher", "SGrampp", "CCzerny", "SYoussefzadeh", "FKainberger"], "doi": "10.1097/00004424-200010000-00004"}

{"title": "Quantitative image analysis of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization in rat.", "abstract": "Rodent models of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) are now extensively used to identify angiogenic proteins, determine the role of specific genes with knockout mice, and evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-angiogenic therapies. CNV is typically evaluated by fluorescein angiography or vascular endothelial cell labeling in histologic sections. The current study examined an alternative method using high molecular weight FITC-dextran (MW 2 x 10(6)) for high resolution angiography in RPE-choroid-sclera flat mounts. At 24 hr after lasering, the lesions appeared as a circular weakly fluorescent area of approximately equal diameter to the laser spot. No FITC-dextran labeled blood vessels were visible in the lesion at day 1. Three days after lasering, 47% of the lesions showed FITC-dextran labeling indicative of CNV. The incidence (71%) and extent of CNV increased by day 6, and by day 10 all lesions were vascularized, and the maximal area was attained. No significant change followed day 10, and the neovascular area remained constant through day 31. The highest rate of blood vessel growth (between 3 and 10 days after laser) correlates with the peak expression of VEGF, bFGF, and their receptors shown in previous studies. Morphologic analysis of flat mounts and histologic sections showed that the neovascular plexus in most lesions originates from deeper choroidal vessels in the center of the lesion, grows towards the neural retina, then branches circumferentially to anastamose with uninjured choriocapillaris. The microvessels in these lesions are broad and flat, similar to normal choriocapillaris. In a separate study, rats were treated daily with the angiostatic corticosteroid dexamethasone (20-500 microg kg(-1)day(-1)), and CNV was examined at day 10 in FITC-dextran labeled flat mounts and histologic sections. Dexamethasone dose-dependently inhibited CNV, and its highest dose inhibited approximately 95% of CNV labeled by FITC-dextran and resulted in lesions with no detectable Factor VIII immunostaining. High resolution angiography with FITC-dextran is reproducible and quantifiable, and it may accelerate the discovery of therapeutic agents that modulate choroidal neovascularization.", "journal": "Experimental eye research", "date": "2000-10-21", "authors": ["J LEdelman", "M RCastro"], "doi": "10.1006/exer.2000.0907"}
{"title": "Humoral human xenoreactivity against isolated pig pancreatic islets.", "abstract": "It is widely believed that the hyperacute rejection of vascularized xenografts in the pig-to-human combination is triggered by the binding of human preformed natural antibodies (PNAbs) to the Galalpha.(1,3)Gal epitope in pig endothelium and the subsequent activation of complement. However, it remains poorly defined whether xenogeneic pig pancreatic islets are damaged by antibody and complement-mediated mechanisms. We examined the expression of Galalpha(1,3)Gal on isolated adult pig islets and the presence of PNAbs in normal human sera directed against islets, using immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The pig islets were not stained with Galalpha(1,3)Gal-specific lectin GSIB4, however, the exocrine cells reacted strongly with GSIB4, indicating that the Galalpha(1,3)Gal epitope was highly expressed on exocrine cells, but not on islets. Human sera showed weak reactivity of IgM and IgG class PNAbs to the islets, but strong reactivity to the exocrine cells. Furthermore, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of human serum on pig islets using an in vitro model of pig-to-human islet transplantation. The incubation of pig islets with normal human sera for 45 min resulted in less than 10% specific lysis despite the binding of PNAbs, whereas exposure of porcine aortic endothelial cells to the same human sera caused 56% complement-mediated lysis, determined using a MTT cytotoxic assay.

The immunohistochemical and lectin-histochemical examination of the tumors included analysis of the proliferation-associated protein Ki-67, the p53 protein, estrogen and progesterone receptor, sarcolectin as an indicator of the presence of lymphokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor, antibodies and the labeled protein to assess galectin (galactoside-binding animal lectin)-dependent parameters, analysis of tumor vascularization (CD-34), and expression of bcl-2, vimentin, smooth muscle actin, desmin, and keratin.

Similarly the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and their analogs have been known to exert a variety of biological activities. In this study we evaluated the potential of GAG-chitosan and dextran sulfate (DS)-chitosan complex materials for controlling the proliferation of vascular endothelial (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC). GAG-chitosan complex membranes were generated in vitro and seeded with human ECs or SMCs for culture up to 9d. In addition, porous chitosan and GAG-chitosan complex scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in rats to evaluate the in vivo response to these materials. The results indicated that while chitosan alone supported cell attachment and growth, GAG-chitosan materials inhibited spreading and proliferation of ECs and SMCs in vitro. In contrast, DS-chitosan surfaces supported proliferation of both cell types. In vivo, heparin-chitosan and DS-chitosan scaffolds stimulated cell proliferation and the formation of a thick layer of dense granulation tissue. In the case of heparin scaffolds the granulation layer was highly vascularized.

Because adequate vascular perfusion is needed for appropriate erectile tissue function a likely reason for the high incidence of this complication in diabetics is a pathological change associated with the disease in vascularization of erectile tissues. We investigate whether chronic diabetes may induce changes in vascularization of the corpora cavernosa using a computerized image analysis system to quantify changes in the smooth muscle and endothelial cell content of the corpora cavernosa of diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin 6 months previously, and compare these changes to those associated with aging.\nWe studied 3 groups of rats, including 10-week-old untreated controls, diabetic rats treated with streptozotocin for 6 months starting at age 10 weeks and 18-month-old rats (aged). Penile shafts from these groups were excised, fixed, sectioned and immunostained with anti-smooth muscle actin to identify smooth muscle cells and anti-CD31 to identify endothelial cells. Computerized image analysis was used to quantify the percent area within the corpora cavernosa occupied by smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells, and the data were compared among the groups.\nWe identified a highly significant decrease in the percentage of smooth muscle and endothelial cells within the cavernosa areas of diabetic rats compared to control or aged rats. Mean cavernous smooth muscle cell content was 15.28 +/- 2.54% in control rats and 9.83 +/- 1.21% in diabetic rats (p = 0.0001). Likewise, cavernous endothelial cell content was 6.93 +/- 0.86% in the control group and 4.01 +/- 1.08% in the diabetic group (p = 0. 0001). However, no statistical difference of smooth muscle or endothelial cell content was found between control and aged rats.\nUsing the streptozotocin treated rat as a model for diabetes, we showed that smooth muscle and endothelial cell density is significantly decreased in diabetic corpora cavernosa but not in normal aged rats.

As ESM-1 mRNA is preferentially expressed in human lung and kidney tissues, and as ESM-1 mRNA expression is regulated by inflammatory cytokines, ESM-1 is thought to play a role in the vascular contribution to organ-specific inflammation. In order to define its behavior, mouse anti-ESM-1 monoclonal antibodies were developed, and three distinct epitopes were mapped, which allowed development of a specific ELISA assay, immunohistological staining and immunoblot analysis. Here, we demonstrate that ESM-1 is present in cell lysates of human endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) with an apparent molecular weight of 20 kD. In contrast, the secreted form of ESM-1 is shifted to an apparent molecular weight of 50 kD, indicating that the secreted form of ESM-1 is posttranslationally modified. By ELISA, we show that the secretion of ESM-1 is significantly enhanced in the presence of TNFalpha. In contrast, the spontaneous as well as TNFalpha-induced secretion of ESM-1 is strongly inhibited by IFNgamma. Moreover, ESM-1 was detected in the serum of healthy subjects at an average concentration of 1.08 ng/ml, and we demonstrated that the serum level of ESM-1 is dramatically increased in patients presenting a septic shock. Analysis of ESM-1 expression in normal human tissues by immunohistochemistry showed that ESM-1 is localized in the vascular network, but also in the bronchial and renal epithelia. Our results demonstrate that ESM-1 is mainly expressed in the vascular endothelium both in vitro and in vivo, but also by different epithelia.

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess fibrovascular ingrowth 4, 8, and 12 weeks after implantation. Three animals were killed at each of the times for histopathologic examination. The Brazilian implant was also examined chemically and by scanning electron microscopy.\nThe Brazilian HA was found to be heavier than either the BioEye or synthetic FCI3 HA implants. It did not have a visible, regularly arranged interconnected porous architecture. Rather, it had randomly appearing channels apparent on its external and internal surface in addition to large cystic areas within the body of the implant. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the implant to have a microporous architecture in addition to the large channels and cystic cavities. Histopathologically, central vascularization occurred by 4 weeks and was also present at 8 and 12 weeks. In three Brazilian implants an unrecognizable, nonbirefringent material was identified. The cause of it was unclear. Chemical analysis confirmed the implant to consist of pure HA.\nThe Brazilian implant is pure HA that appears solid but has randomly arranged channels as well as a microporous architecture that allows vascularization to its center. It is heavier than other available HA implants and has the presence of an unidentified foreign material within it.

At the present time there are two well-characterized receptors for VEGF that are selectively expressed on endothelium. VEGF receptor 2 [VEGFR2 (KDR/Flk-1)] mediates endothelial cell mitogenesis and permeability increases, whereas the role of VEGF receptor 1 [VEGFR1 (Flt-1)] has not been clearly defined. In the present study, a monoclonal antibody, 2C3, is shown to block the interaction of VEGF with VEGFR2 but not with VEGFR1 through ELISA, receptor binding assays, and receptor activation assays. 2C3 blocks the VEGF-induced vascular permeability increase in guinea pig skin. 2C3 has potent antitumor activity, inhibiting the growth of newly injected and established human tumor xenografts in mice.

The study included 23 patients. The lower femur was involved in 17 cases, the upper tibia in 6. The cases included giant cell tumor of the lower femur (2 patients), giant cell tumor of the upper tibia (1 patient), malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the lower femur (1 patient), parosteal osteosarcoma (1 patient), and periosteal osteosarcoma (1 patient). The remaining patients suffered from conventional osteogenic sarcomas. The size of the defect ranged from 12 to 16 cm in length. Skin flap necrosis after tumor resection was the most common complication encountered. Other complications included peroneal nerve involvement in one case and rupture of the arterial anastomosis in another. All transferred fibulas progressed to union within 7-9 months. Union time of both upper and lower ends of the fibula and time of appearance of periosteal reaction were identical. In evaluating periosteal hypertrophy of the fibula, the hypertrophy (de Boer) index (de Boer HD, Wood MB, J Bone Joint Surg 1989;71B:374-378) proved unreliable. False positive results are obtained, when callus formation around the lower end of the femur is far more abundant than at the upper end of the fibula. For this reason, we introduced the graft index. The latter is the ratio between the diameter of the graft at its thinnest portion at latest follow-up to its diameter on the day of operation, as calculated on plain radiographs. Two of the viable fibulas developed stress fractures after plate removal. Functional and quality-of -life results were satisfactory. It is concluded that the free vascularized fibular graft remains a valuable reconstruction option after the resection of tumors around the knee, provided certain precautions are followed. First, before closure of the wound, the skin flaps should be assessed for their viability. Necrotic parts should be excised. Stable fixation is a necessary prerequisite at the time of operation.

{"title": "The pig analogue of CD59 protects transgenic mouse hearts from injury by human complement.", "abstract": "It has been proposed that hyperacute rejection (HAR) of pig-to-primate vascularized xenografts is due in large part to ineffective regulation of recipient complement by pig complement regulatory proteins (CRPs), and indeed transgenic expression of human CRPs in pigs can prevent hyperacute rejection. However, at least one pig CRP (CD59) efficiently regulates human complement in vitro, suggesting that it is the level of expression of a particular CRP(s) rather than cross-species incompatibility that explains the HAR of porcine xenografts. We investigated the relative effectiveness of transgenically expressed pig and human CD59 in providing protection of mouse hearts from human complement in an ex vivo setting.\nTransgenic mice expressing pig CD59 or human CD59 under the control of the human ICAM-2 promoter, which restricts expression in tissues to vascular endothelium, were used. Hearts from mice expressing similar levels of pig CD59 or human CD59 were perfused ex vivo with 10% human plasma and heart function was monitored for 60 min. Sections of perfused hearts were examined for deposition of the membrane attack complex (MAC).\nControl nontransgenic hearts (n=5) were rapidly affected by the addition of human plasma, with mean function falling to less than 10% of the initial level within 15 min. In contrast, hearts expressing either pig CD59 (n=6) or human CD59 (n=8) were protected from plasma-induced injury, maintaining 31 and 35% function, respectively, after 60 min of perfusion. MAC deposition was markedly reduced in both pig CD59 and human CD59 transgenic hearts compared to nontransgenic control hearts.\nWhen highly expressed on endothelium in transgenic mice, pig CD59 provided equivalent protection to human CD59 in a model of human complement-mediated xenograft rejection.

Previously described methods used for eliminating natural antibodies, however, constantly removed both anti-porcine IgM and IgG antibodies, as well as often complement proteins. To study specifically the role of preformed anti-porcine IgM antibodies, a specific anti-IgM monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been designed and evaluated in vivo.\nIterative injections of anti-IgM mAb (LO-BM2) at high dose (20 mg/kg) depleted to undetectable level the circulating IgM and therefore anti-porcine IgM antibodies but did not change the concentration of anti-pig IgG antibodies. The serum concentration of IgM and IgG antibodies was assessed by ELISA and the level of anti-pig natural IgM and IgG antibodies by flow cytometry (FC). Anti-rat sensitization was assessed by specific ELISA as well as the serum concentration of LO-BM2.\nIterative injections of LO-BM2 allowed to specifically eliminate the anti-porcine IgM antibodies to undetectable levels at ELISA. Despite a normal serum level of anti-porcine IgG and complement proteins, HAVR was avoided. Without immunosuppression, the specific elimination of preformed anti-porcine IgM prolonged the survival of a renal xenograft in baboon up to 6 days, whereas without IgM antibody elimination, the renal xenografts were hyperacutely rejected within hours. The lost of activity of LO-BM2 after 10 days was concomitant to an IgM and IgG antibody rebound, which caused an acute vascular rejection of the xenograft.\nSpecific elimination of natural anti-porcine IgM antibodies allows to avoid HAVR of a pig to baboon renal xenograft, whereas anti-porcine IgG antibodies and complement proteins were present in the serum. This result confirms previous in vitro reports and demonstrates for the first time in vivo that preformed IgM antibodies alone are responsible for HAVR, while preformed anti-porcine IgG antibodies are unable alone to cause HAVR.

Sense gliomas demonstrated by far the fastest growth in vivo, with intense contrast enhancement meeting criteria for highly malignant tumors. Histological examination revealed masses of von Willebrand- and VEGF-positive tumor vessels with a high vessel density. Antisense gliomas depicted the radiological features of low-grade gliomas, with slow growth and poor vascularization, although they were highly infiltrative. Wild-type and mock-transfected gliomas demonstrated similar growth and vascularization patterns intermediate between sense and antisense gliomas.

{"title": "Hypervascularization in the magnocellular nuclei of the rat hypothalamus: relationship with the distribution of aquaporin-4 and markers of energy metabolism.", "abstract": "In the magnocellular nuclei of the hypothalamus, there is a rich vascular network for which the function remains to be established. In the supraoptic nucleus, the high vascular density may be one element, which together with the water channel aquaporin-4 expressed in the astrocytes, is related to a role in osmoreception. We tested the osmoreception hypothesis by studying the correlation between vascular and cellular densities in the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus. Whether aquaporin-4 is likely to contribute to osmoreception was tested by studying the distribution in the magnocellular nuclei of the hypothalamus. The high vascular density may also reflect a high metabolic activity due to the synthesis of vasopressin and oxytocin. This metabolic hypothesis was tested by studying the regional cytochrome oxidase histochemistry, the local cerebral blood flow, and the density of glucose transporter type-1 in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. All the magnocellular nuclei were characterized by an extended and intense aquaporin-4 labelling and a weak cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. The highest vascular density was found in the supraoptic nucleus and the magnocellular regions of the paraventricular nucleus. The local cerebral blood flow rates were surprisingly low in the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus in comparison to the cerebral cortex. Furthermore in these nuclei, the antibody for glucose transporter type-1 revealed two populations of vessels differing by their labelling intensity. The similarities observed between the different nuclei suggest that, in the hypothalamus, all magnocellular regions sense the plasma osmolarity.

Through a sequential series of complex integrated adhesion and signalling events, 'multistep model of migration', specific subsets of PBL are recruited into inflamed tissues. In this process both leucocyte receptors and microvascular endothelial (MVE) counter-receptors play a critical role. The MVE in particular, during an inflammatory state, is the target of various inflammatory mediators that cause the up-regulation of several cell adhesion molecules (CAM). One of the most important factors known to be a powerful inducer of MVE CAM is TNF-alpha. Conversely, blocking TNF-alpha causes a down-modulation of CAM expression. To test directly the capacity of TNF-alpha to induce cell migration into RA synovium we adapted a model in which synovial grafts were implanted into SCID mice subcutaneously. Using this model we demonstrate that: (i) transplants remain viable and become vascularized and fed by mouse subdermal vessels; (ii) the mouse vasculature connects to the transplant vasculature which maintains the ability to express human CAM; (iii) intragraft injections of TNF-alpha up-regulate the expression of human CAM, following the down-regulation which occurred 4 weeks post-transplantation; and (iv) the up-regulation of graft CAM is associated with increased human PBL migration into the transplants. This study provides direct evidence in vivo of the capacity of TNF-alpha to induce cell migration. In addition, it provides the experimental background for the optimal use of this model.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental immunology", "date": "2000-09-30", "authors": ["SWahid", "M CBlades", "DDe Lord", "IBrown", "GBlake", "GYanni", "D OHaskard", "G SPanayi", "CPitzalis"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-2249.2000.01342.x"}

The diagnosis is confirmed with serologic testing and histology is rarely needed. This paper is based on our experience with the use of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of CSD.\nThe aim of this study was to describe the sonographic and color Doppler appearances of regional lymphadenopathy in CSD, as this has not widely reported in the literature.\nForty-seven patients (average 9.4 years) were included who all had serologically and/or histologically proven CSD and had been studied using US early in the clinical course. All had a positive history of exposure to cats and exhibited regional lymphadenopathy.\nUS showed large hypoechoic adenopathy with some transmission enhancement and high vascularization on color-flow Doppler imaging. In 30 patients, abdominal US was also performed and splenic and/or hepatic granulomata were found in 10.\nIn our experience, sonography and especially color-Doppler and power-Doppler sonography was helpful in the diagnosis of CSD.

Thirteen total mesorectal excision specimens were examined by angiography after continence-preserving resection of rectal carcinoma. In 11 of the 13 cases the vascular supply was exclusively via the superior rectal artery. In two cases with hypoplastic left terminating branches of the superior rectal artery there was additional perfusion via a caudally ascending vessel or via smaller vessels connected laterally. In all specimens both arterial supply and venous outflow were located within the mesorectal fascial sheath. There was no radio-opaque substance leaking from the mesorectal surface in the case of a complete mesorectal specimen. Tiny vascular branches running laterally occurred in 7 of the 13 cases. We found no larger vascular connections branching off in the lateral direction. The rectal blood supply comes almost exclusively through the superior rectal vessels. Thus the fascia covering the mesorectum forms, as far as rectal vascularization is concerned, a closed compartment. The mesorectal vessels are enclosed in the fibrous avascular mesorectal fascia. They run close above the fascia. In the case of an incomplete mesorectal excision the specimen angiography shows a stain leaking from the mesorectal fascia.

To establish a molecular basis for C6 gliosarcoma malignancy, we have constructed a molecular profile of the most abundantly expressed genes, using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). Sequence tags (1168) representing 738 individual transcripts were collected and tag-to-gene mapping was carried out using the UniGene data set for rat. Differentially expressed C6 transcripts were identified by comparison of tags collected for C6 cells with a similar number (1002) of tags from a rat primary astrocyte library. Genes found to be expressed at increased levels in C6 cells are associated with cell surface interactions, migration, or metastasis formation and proliferation. These include the receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM), S-100 related protein 42A, galectin I, preproenkephalin, osteopontin, autocrine motility factor, alpha-tubulin, ad1 antigen, and cofilin. In addition, a tag with no database match probably representing a previously uncharacterized transcript was differentially expressed in C6 cells. Transcripts showing reduced expression in C6 cells relative to astrocytes included the extracellular matrix glycoprotein osteonectin/SPARC (secreted protein, acidic, rich in cysteine), actin-binding proteins thymosins beta-4 and beta-10, the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin C, the actin-gelling protein SM22/transgelin, and ferritin-H.

The clinical situation can be further complicated when diabetic patients are affected by painful and unstable wounds of this kind because of the familiar phenomenon of vasculopathy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using distally based foot flaps to cover forefoot defects in diabetic patients. Preoperative selection of patients was the key to this study; those who had other major disease, chronic infection, bone involvement, and/or insufficient foot vascularization were excluded from the study. The authors report a series of 12 diabetic patients in whom the reconstruction of medium-sized defects (ranging from 1.5 x 2.0 cm to 3.0 x 7.0 cm) of the forefoot was performed using distally based dorsalis pedis flaps or medial plantar flaps. The transferred flaps survived and adapted well to the defects, except for one flap in a patient who had a slight venous insufficiency at outset. Wearing their own footwear, patients could walk after 20 to 30 days. After the follow-up period (3 months to 3 years), no skin breakdown in the treated areas was observed. Temporary donor-site pain was reported by medial plantar flap patients, and partial skin graft loss at the donor site occurred in some of the dorsalis pedis patients.

The embryos were pretreated with an Ah receptor agonist, i.e. beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) or 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126), or vehicle in ovo. BNF and PCB 126 induced EROD activity and covalent binding of [3H]Trp-P-1 seven- to tenfold in the CAM of chicken embryos. In the CAM of eider duck embryos, which are known to be nonresponsive to coplanar PCBs, PCB 126 treatment had no effect on EROD activity or covalent binding of [3H]Trp-P-1 whereas BNF treatment increased these activities five- and threefold, respectively. Light microscopic autoradiography was used to identify the cellular localization of covalent binding of [3H]Trp-P-1 in the CAM. Preferential binding was observed in endothelial cells in intraepithelial capillaries in the chorionic epithelium and in blood vessels in the mesenchymal layer. The addition of the CYP1A inhibitor ellipticine abolished the covalent binding of [3H]Trp-P-1 in the CAM of BNF- and PCB 126-treated chicken and eider duck embryos. The results suggest that CYP1A-dependent metabolic activity can be induced in blood vessel endothelia in the CAM of bird embryos following exposure to Ah receptor agonists and that the CAM may be a target tissue for CYP1A-activated environmental pollutants.

Laparotomy was performed on four pigs under general anesthesia. A 25-cm segment of mid jejunum was tagged with proximal and distal sutures, and its mesentery was ligated and divided. Thermal imaging, visual inspection, Doppler ultrasound, and fluorescence with Wood's lamp after fluorescein were used to estimate the extent of bowel ischemia five minutes after ligation of the mesentery. Measurements were taken in reference to both the proximal and distal tags to obtain two data points per animal for each method. After two hours of warm ischemia, the jejunum was harvested and sectioned longitudinally. Comparisons were made between the estimated region of necrosis for each method and microscopic evidence of necrosis.\nVisual inspection was the only method unable to detect a difference between vascularized and devascularized bowel for each of the eight data points. Fluorescein dye missed 3 cm of ischemic bowel. Doppler ultrasound and thermal imaging were 100 percent sensitive for necrotic bowel, with thermal imaging overestimating necrosis to a greater extent than Doppler ultrasound.

{"title": "Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor by macrophages is up-regulated in poorly vascularized areas of breast carcinomas.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is essential to the growth and metastasis of solid tumours. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent pro-angiogenic cytokine that is overexpressed in malignant tumours such as invasive carcinoma of the breast. The low oxygen tensions (hypoxia) present in these tumours are known to up-regulate the expression of VEGF by tumour cells. Human macrophages also respond to hypoxia by increasing their release of VEGF in vitro, although the effect of hypoxia on VEGF expression by macrophages in vivo has yet to be demonstrated. The present study compared the expression of VEGF by macrophages in areas of low and high vascularity in 24 invasive breast carcinomas (12 lobular, 12 ductal). The cellular distributions of VEGF protein, CD31 (vessels), and CD68 (macrophages) were compared in sequential sections for each tumour. In ten tumours, both tumour cells and macrophages were immunoreactive for VEGF protein. Use of non-isotopic in situ hybridization to localize VEGF mRNA showed that these cell types also expressed VEGF mRNA. No significant differences in the cellular distribution of VEGF protein were found between lobular and ductal carcinomas. In all tumours, macrophages accumulated in higher numbers in poorly vascularized than in highly vascularized areas. In VEGF-positive tumours, macrophages were immunoreactive for VEGF only in avascular areas where tumour cells also expressed VEGF. This suggests that VEGF expression by these two cell types may be regulated by the same microenvironmental stimuli in breast carcinomas. In addition, significantly more macrophages were present in poorly vascularized areas of VEGF-positive than VEGF-negative tumours. This suggests that VEGF may exert a chemotactic action on macrophages in vivo and guide their migration into avascular tumour sites.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2000-09-27", "authors": ["J SLewis", "R JLanders", "J CUnderwood", "A LHarris", "C ELewis"], "doi": "10.1002/1096-9896(2000)9999:9999<::AID-PATH687>3.0.CO;2-G"}

Although this active angiogenesis takes place in the tumour periphery, the process of vessel growth and survival in inner areas and its clinical role remain largely unexplored. The present study compared the microvessel score (MS) as well as the single endothelial cell score (ECS) in the invading edge and in inner areas of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). Three different patterns of vascular growth were distinguished: the edvin (edge vs. inner) type 1, where a low MS was observed in both peripheral and inner tumour areas; the edvin type 2, where a high MS was noted in the invading front but a low MS in inner areas; and the edvin type 3, where both peripheral and inner tumour areas had a high MS. The ECS was high in the invading edge in edvin type 2 and 3 cases and was sharply decreased in both types in inner areas, suggesting that endothelial cell migration is unlikely to contribute to the angiogenic process in areas away from the tumour front. Expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and of thymidine phosphorylase (TP) was associated with a high MS in the invading edge. VEGF was associated with a high MS in inner areas (edvin 3), while TP expression was associated with edvin type 2, showing that VEGF (and not TP) contributes to the preservation of the inner vasculature. Both edvin type 2 and 3 cases showed an increased incidence of node metastasis, but edvin type 3 cases had a poorer prognosis, even in the N1-stage group. The present study suggests that tumour factors regulating angiogenesis and vascular survival are not identical.

The use of prosthetic mesh as a fascial substitute or reinforcement has been widely reported. In wounds with unstable soft tissue coverage, however, the use of prosthetic mesh poses an increased risk for extrusion or infection, and vascularized autogenous tissue may be required to achieve herniorrhaphy and stable coverage.\nPatients undergoing abdominal wall reconstruction for 106 recurrent or complex defects (104 patients) were retrospectively analyzed. For each patient, hernia etiology, size and location, average time present, technique of reconstruction, and postoperative results, including recurrence and complication rates, were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups based on defect components: Type I defects with intact or stable skin coverage over hernia defect, and Type II defects with unstable or absent skin coverage over hernia defect. The defects were also assigned to one of the following zones based on primary defect location to assist in the selection and evaluation of their treatment: Zone 1A, upper midline; Zone IB, lower midline; Zone 2, upper quadrant; Zone 3, lower quadrant.\nA majority of the defects (68%) were incisional hernias. Of 50 Type I defects, 10 (20%) were repaired directly, 28 (56%) were repaired with mesh only, and 12 (24%) required flap reconstruction. For the 56 Type II defects reconstructed, flaps were used in the majority of patients (n = 48; 80%). The overall complication and recurrence rates for the series were 29% and 8%, respectively.\nFor Type I hernias with stable skin coverage, intraperitoneal placement of Prolene mesh is preferred, and has not been associated with visceral complications or failure of hernia repair. For Type II defects, the use of flaps is advisable, with tensor fascia lata representing the flap of choice, particularly in the lower abdomen. Rectus advancement procedures may be used for well-selected midline defects of either type. The concept of tissue expansion to increase both the fascial dimensions of the flap and zones safely reached by flap transposition is introduced. Overall failure is often is due to primary closure under tension, extraperitoneal placement of mesh, flap use for inappropriate zone, or technical error in flap use. With use of the proposed algorithm based on defect analysis and location, abdominal wall reconstruction has been achieved in 92% of patients with complex abdominal defects.", "journal": "Annals of surgery", "date": "2000-09-22", "authors": ["S JMathes", "P MSteinwald", "R DFoster", "W YHoffman", "J PAnthony"], "doi": "10.1097/00000658-200010000-00014"}

The objective of the present study was to determine whether the bioactive peptides could have been amelogenin protein degradation products or specific amelogenin gene splice products. Thus, the splice products were prepared, and their activities were determined in vitro and in vivo. A rat incisor tooth odontoblast pulp cDNA library was screened using probes based on the peptide amino acid sequencing data. Two specific cDNAs comprised from amelogenin gene exons 2,3,4,5,6d,7 and 2,3,5,6d, 7 were identified. The corresponding recombinant proteins, designated r[A+4] (8.1 kDa) and r[A-4] (6.9 kDa), were produced. Both peptides enhanced in vitro sulfate incorporation into proteoglycan, the induction of type II collagen, and Sox9 or Cbfa1 mRNA expression. In vivo implant assays demonstrated implant mineralization accompanied by vascularization and the presence of the bone matrix proteins, BSP and BAG-75. We postulate that during tooth development these specific amelogenin gene splice products, [A+4] and [A-4], may have a role in preodontoblast maturation.

This technique leads to a direct assessment of the in vivo concentration of an iodine- or gadolinium-labeled compound. Rats bearing C6 glioma were imaged by MRI prior to the SRCT experiment. The SRCT experiments were performed after a 1.3 g I/kg (n = 5) or a 0.4 g Gd/kg (n = 5) injection. Finally, brains were sampled for histology. The SRCT images exhibited contrast enhancement at the tumor location. Ten minutes after injection, iodine and gadolinium tissular concentrations were equal to 0.80 ( +/- 0.40) mg/cm3 and 0.50 ( +/- 0.10) mg/cm3, respectively in the peripheral area of the tumor (respective background value: 0.20 +/- 0.02 to 0.10 +/- 0.01). Correlation to MRI and histology revealed that the contrast uptake occurred in the most vascularized area of the tumor. The present study summarizes the feasibility of in vivo SRCT to obtain quantitative information about iodine and gadolinium-labeled compounds.

{"title": "Expression and tissue concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor, its receptors, and localization in the bovine corpus luteum during estrous cycle and pregnancy.", "abstract": "The presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the ovary has been reported in a number of species. The objective of the present study was to demonstrate the expression of VEGF, VEGF receptor (R)-1, and VEGFR-2 in detail by different methodological approaches in bovine corpora lutea (CL) obtained from different stages of the estrous cycle and during pregnancy. VEGF and VEGF receptor transcripts were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ribonuclease protection assay. All components of the VEGF system were found in the bovine CL during the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Analysis of VEGF transcript by RT-PCR shows that CL tissues expressed predominantly the smallest isoforms (VEGF(121) and VEGF(165)). The highest mRNA expression for VEGF and VEGFR-2 mRNA was detected during the early luteal phase, followed by a significant decrease of expression during the mid and late luteal phase and a further decrease of VEGF mRNA after regression. During pregnancy, high levels of expression were always present. In contrast, no significant change in VEGFR-1 mRNA expression during the estrous cycle and pregnancy was found. The VEGF protein concentration in CL tissue was significantly higher (20.9-23.4 ng/g wet weight) during the early luteal phase (Days 1-7), followed by a decrease at the late luteal phase (14.3-18.7 ng/g wet weight) and, especially, after CL regression (2.8 ng/g wet weight). However, relatively high levels were found during pregnancy (10.1 ng/g wet weight). As achieved by immunohistochemistry, VEGF protein was localized predominantly in luteal cells. High VEGF protein and transcript concentrations and increased VEGFR-2 expression during the early luteal phase coincided with luteal vascularization. These results suggest an important role of VEGF in angiogenesis of the newly formed CL. The high VEGF mRNA expression and protein levels during matured vasculature in the mid-stage CL and pregnancy also suggest also a survival function for endothelial cells.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2000-09-20", "authors": ["BBerisha", "DSchams", "MKosmann", "WAmselgruber", "REinspanier"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod63.4.1106"}

We sought to study the effectiveness of 4 different types of biodegradable materials for bladder augmentation using laparoscopic techniques.\nThirty one minipigs underwent successful transperitoneal laparoscopic partial cystectomy and subsequent closure (6 control) or patch augmentation (25): porcine bowel acellular tissue matrix (ATM) (6), bovine pericardium (BPC) (6), human placental membranes (HPM) (6) or porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) (7). An intracorporeal suturing technique with the EndoStitch device (U.S. Surgical, Norwalk, CT) and Lapra-Ty clips (Ethicon, Enodsurgery Inc.

Bladders were evaluated by cystoscopy at 6 and 12 weeks and harvested at 12 weeks.\nGrafts remained in place in all groups except for the BPC group, where all grafts failed to incorporate. For the ATM and SIS groups, at 6 weeks, there was mucosal coverage of the grafts without evidence of encrustation. In the control group, at 12 weeks, the bladder capacity was 23% less than preoperatively. In the ATM, HPM and SIS groups, at 12 weeks, the bladder capacities were larger than preoperatively by 16%, 51% and 43% respectively; also the grafts had contracted to 70%, 65%, and 60% of their original sizes, respectively. Histologically, there was patchy epithelialization of ATM and SIS grafts with a mixture of squamoid and transitional cell epithelia. The graft persisted as a well-vascularized fibrous band in HPM, ATM, and SIS without evidence of significant inflammatory response.\nA laparoscopic technique for partial bladder wall replacement using a free graft is feasible.

{"title": "Imaging evaluation of ovarian masses.", "abstract": "Adnexal masses present a special diagnostic challenge, in part because benign adnexal masses greatly outnumber malignant ones. Determination of a degree of suspicion for malignancy is critical and is based largely on imaging appearance. Endovaginal ultrasonography (US) is the most practical modality for assessment of ovarian tumors because it is readily available and has a high negative predictive value. Morphologic analysis of adnexal masses is accurate for identifying masses as either low risk or high risk. The most important morphologic features are non-fatty solid (vascularized) tissue, thick septations, and papillary projections. Color Doppler US helps identify solid, vascularized components in a mass. Spectral Doppler waveform characteristics (eg, resistive index, pulsatility index) correlate well with malignancy but generally add little information to morphologic considerations. Computed tomography can help assess the extent of disease in patients before and after primary cytoreductive surgery. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is better reserved for problem solving when US findings are nondiagnostic or equivocal because, although it is more accurate for diagnosis, it is also more expensive. The signal intensity characteristics of ovarian masses make possible a systematic approach to diagnosis.

The transplants were allowed to survive for up to 583 days prior to sacrifice and light microscopic examination.\nIn most grafts, both neural and glial cells survived, however, some of the grafts seemed to contain predominantly glial cells. Only when the photoreceptors in the graft were apposed to the host pigmented epithelium did they survive. Otherwise, the neuronal components of the grafts were largely cells typically found in the inner retina. The long-term transplants were much thinner than short-term ones. Even after long survival times, the transplants lacked vascularization. No inflammatory cells were seen in or around the grafts.\nThe results suggest that the cells of the inner retina survive for long periods after transplantation, but the photoreceptor cells seem to need the support of the host pigmented epithelium for long-term survival.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors, VEGF-receptor 1 (VEGF-R1; FLT-1) and VEGF-R2 (KDR), have been shown to play a major role in tumor angiogenesis. PTK787/ZK 222584, a specific inhibitor of both VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinases, was investigated for its antitumoral and antiangiogenic activity in a murine renal cell carcinoma model. After intrarenal application of the renal carcinoma cells, mice develop a primary tumor and metastases to the lung and to the abdominal lymph nodes. Daily oral therapy with PTK787/ZK 222584 at a dose of 50 mg/kg resulted in a significant decrease of 61 and 67% in primary tumors after 14 and 21 days, respectively. The occurrence of lung metastases was significantly inhibited at both time points (98% reduction and 78% reduction, respectively). After 14 days, no lymph node metastases developed in the PTK787/ZK 222584-treated group, whereas after 21 days of treatment, the lymph node metastases were reduced by 87%. Vessel density in tumor tissues, detected by immunohistochemistry with an anti-CD31 antibody, was significantly decreased by PTK787/ZK 222584. Using color Doppler imaging ultrasound, significant changes in blood flow in the tumor feeding renal artery were found under treatment with PTK787/ZK 222584. Blood flow changes correlated with changes in vessel density but not with tumor volume. The compound was well tolerated in all in vivo experiments and had no significant effects on body weight or general well-being of the animals. This was in contrast to the animals treated with the antiangiogenic agent TNP-470. s.c. therapy with 30 mg/kg TNP-470 every other day had to be discontinued after 13 days because of animal weight loss (>20%) and ataxia. These results demonstrate that PTK787/ZK 222584 is a potent inhibitor of tumor growth, metastases formation, and tumor vascularization in murine renal cell carcinoma. Furthermore, we have been able to demonstrate that color Doppler imaging ultrasound can be used to measure blood flow to a tumor and that flow correlates with vessel density.

However, it does not exclude the possibility of a role for vimentin in pathological conditions, like tumorigenesis. To address this question directly, we have used a teratocarcinoma model involving the injection of ES cells into syngeneic mice. ES cells lacking vimentin were generated from 129/Sv Vim-/- mice with high efficiency. The absence of vimentin did not affect ES cell morphology, viability or growth rate in vitro.

The boundary of these 2 networks was initially indistinct but became clearer with the progress of root formation. The PDL vessels further elongated longitudinally and connected with each other by lateral branches to form a coarse mesh. Other vessels derived from the alveolar bone via Volkman's canals also contributed to the vascular construction of the PDL. The vessels from the alveolar bone provided branches to the existing mesh of the PDL. Consequently, the vascular network of the PDL consisted of vessels from 2 sources: 1 derived from the basal region of the tooth germ, and the other from the alveolar bone.

Thus, clinical, radiological and histological results of the 2 groups of 3 patients were compared.\n6 months after sinus grafting with OP-1, in 1 male, well-vascularized bone-like tissue of good quality was observed clinically. This could be confirmed by histology. In the second, female, patient no bone formation was observed at all. A cyst-like granular tissue mass, without purulent content, was removed. In the 3rd, female, patient, who received bilateral sinus grafts, some bone-like formation was seen, however it showed flexible tissue which led to the decision that at 6 months after the sinus grafting, the implant placement had to be postponed. In all 5 autogenous grafted sinuses a bone appearance similar to normal maxillary bone was observed clinically as well as histologically and dental implants could be placed six months after sinus floor elevation surgery.\nThese findings indicate that the OP-1 device has the potential for initiating bone formation in the human maxillary sinus within 6 months after a sinus floor elevation operation. However, the various findings in these 3 patients indicate that the behaviour of the material is at this moment insufficiently predictable, in this indication area.

It is expressed as several splice variants; the major forms contain 120 amino acids, 164 amino acids, and 188 amino acids. We utilized transformed cells nullizygous for VEGF to specifically express each of these isoforms in isolation, in order to determine the role of each in tumorigenic neo-vascularization. We found that only the intermediate isoform, VEGF164, could fully rescue tumor growth; VEGF120 partially rescued tumor growth, and VEGF188 failed completely to rescue tumor expansion. Surprisingly, the vascular density of VEGF188 isoform-expressing tumors is significantly greater than that of wild-type VEGF cells and the other isoform-specific tumors. The failure of the hypervascular VEGF188-expressing tumors to grow may be due to inadequate perfusion of the massive number of microvessels in these tumors; three-dimensional imaging of the tumorigenic vasculature indicated little or no recruitment of the peripheral vasculature. This demonstrates that the VEGF isoforms perform unique functions which together enable tumorigenic vascularization.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2000-09-13", "authors": ["JGrunstein", "J JMasbad", "RHickey", "FGiordano", "R SJohnson"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.20.19.7282-7291.2000"}

Bone formation was observed in the group with vascularized periosteum and in the group with bone marrow fluid added to the vascularized periosteum. In particular, woven bone was observed in the group that had added bone marrow. Osteogenesis appeared earlier in the group with bone marrow fluid added to the vascularized periosteum, but histologically, there was no significant difference between this group and the group with vascularized periosteum without bone marrow fluid added at week 24 after the operation. In the group with non-vascularized periosteum, slight osteogenesis was found at week 6 after the operation, but in the control group, with beta-TCP implanted in soft tissue, osteogenesis did not occur at all. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity reached a peak at week 2 after the operation in the group with vascularized periosteum, but only half the peak value was then maintained until week 8. In the group with bone marrow fluid added to the vascularized periosteum, similar values were found from immediately after the operation until week 8. ALP activity did not show any significant difference between these two groups at week 8 postoperatively. In the group with beta-TCP implanted in the soft tissue, ALP activity was low at all times measured. These results suggested that the periosteum had osteoinduction capacity and beta-TCP had osteoconduction capacity; that better osteogenesis occurred with vascularized periosteum; and that bone marrow fluid was involved in the promotion of osteoblastic activity, but not in calcification.", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association", "date": "2000-09-12", "authors": ["MSaito", "HShimizu", "MBeppu", "MTakagi"], "doi": "10.1007/s007760050163"}

{"title": "Migration of phagocytotic cells and development of the murine intraretinal microglial network: an in vivo study using fluorescent dyes.", "abstract": "This work was undertaken to study whether retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, which occurs during postnatal development of the mouse retina could aid in assessing the topological and chronological pattern of microglial cell migration. The study was conducted from postnatal day 0 (P0) to adulthood. The fluorescent dyes Fluorogold (FG) or (4-[4-didecylaminostyryl]-N-methylpyridinium iodide (4Di-10ASP) used in this study, were transported retrogradely to the RGC soma when either dye was injected into the superior colliculus (SC) at P0. Some of these labeled RGCs die due to natural apoptosis during this stage of development and are phagocytosed by microglial cells, which move to the site of RGC death, to become labeled with the same dye. The retinas were examined to quantify the microglial cells from P5 to adulthood. In addition, the reaction of microglia to optic nerve crush was studied in adult animals. Both dyes labeled RGCs in the contralateral retina and a few RGCs in the retina ipsilateral to the injected SC. The density of labeled RGCs decreased by 22% between P5 and P7. During this phase, microglial cells become visible as they ingested the fluorescent detritus of the dying RGCs. Microglial cells were evenly distributed across the entire retinal surface and migrated to the outer plexiform layer. Migrating microglia consecutively altered their morphology from the amoeboid to the ramified form. In terms of intracellular storage of the dyes, resident microglial cells retained the fluorescent dye 4Di-10ASP over a period of 12 months. In contrast, FG was completely transferred from the RGCs and microglial cells to intramural cells (pericytes) of the retinal capillaries after 10 months. This resulted in delineation of the entire intraretinal vascular network. Finally, resident retinal microglial cells were also activated by injury to the adult optic nerve and phagocytosed degenerating neurons. Retinal microglial cells can be monitored with vital fluorescent dyes while they migrate across the retina and establish their intra-retinal network. It is possible to label microglia with lipophilic dyes and they remain labeled for a long time. In addition, intramural pericytes can be labeled by slow release of FG from RGCs and microglial cells.

Here, we report on the in vivo use of an IL-15 antagonist, a soluble fragment of the murine IL-15R alpha-chain, to investigate the contribution of IL-15 to the rejection of fully vascularized cardiac allografts in a mouse experimental model. Administration of soluble fragment of the murine IL-15R alpha-chain (sIL-15Ralpha) to CBA/Ca (H-2k) recipients for 10 days completely prevented rejection of minor histocompatibility complex-mismatched B10.BR (H-2k) heart grafts (median survival time (MST) of >100 days vs MST of 10 days for control recipients) and led to a state of donor-specific immunologic tolerance. Treatment of CBA/Ca recipients with sIL-15Ralpha alone had only a modest effect on the survival of fully MHC-mismatched BALB/c (H-2d) heart grafts. However, administration of sIL-15Ralpha together with a single dose of a nondepleting anti-CD4 mAb (YTS 177.9) delayed mononuclear cell infiltration of the grafts and markedly prolonged graft survival (MST of 60 days vs MST of 20 days for treatment with anti-CD4 alone). Prolonged graft survival was accompanied in vitro by reduced proliferation and IFN-gamma production by spleen cells, whereas CTL and alloantibody levels were similar to those in animals given anti-CD4 mAb alone.

First detected in the eye at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5), the eb defect is observed as an increased vascularization throughout the developing eye and head region. As development proceeds, the embryonic eye fills with blood, and the resulting hematoma distorts the shape of the iris. The eyelids fail to close, and animals are born with open eyes. Lens degeneration and retinal folding are characteristic of eb, as are microphthalmia and thick, disorganized irises.

Tumoral vasculature is the vehicle for the hemoglobin to reach the tumoral stroma. Although anemia has long been focused on as an important parameter related to tumor hypoxia, differences in vascular density may also affect the intratumoral access of hemoglobin.\nIn the present study, we examined the vascular density in 1459 human carcinomas. The distribution of the vascular density within tumors was studied in 436 non-small-cell lung carcinomas and 298 breast carcinomas.\nThe vascular density was found to vary up to 22-fold even among tumors of the same histology. Overall, the vascular density was significantly higher in the tumor periphery as compared to inner areas. Three different patterns of vascularization were identified in both lung and breast cancer specimens; (1) tumors with low or (2) tumors with high vessel density throughout the tissue section, and (3) tumors with high vessel density in the tumor periphery and low in inner areas. The death rate following surgery showed a direct association with the vascular density in lung, breast, colon, and endometrial cancer. In inoperable gastric cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, and in head and neck cancer patients treated with radical chemoradiotherapy there was a 'U-like' association of the death rate with the vascular density suggesting that very low (poor oxygen and drug availability) and very high (intensified angiogenic pathways) vascularization are both linked to poor outcome.\nThe present study stresses the importance of the vascular density as a putative variable that may have affected the results of large clinical trials that investigated the role of anemia, hyperbaric oxygen, hypoxic sensitizers, or even of combined chemoradiotherapy in the outcome of radiation treatment.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2000-09-07", "authors": ["M IKoukourakis", "AGiatromanolaki", "ESivridis", "IFezoulidis"], "doi": "10.1016/s0360-3016(00)00677-5"}

Furthermore, p38alpha mutants display abnormal angiogenesis in the embryo proper as well as in the visceral yolk sac.

In the CNS, inflammatory mediators (mainly cytokines) act either as regulatory (i.e. activation of glial cells, shaping the autoimmune response) or effector molecules (i.e. myelinotoxicity, oligodendrotoxicity). In the periphery, inflammatory cytokines induce, in a bystander fashion, activation of monocytes and T cells. Among this latter cell population there are myelin-specific T cells belonging to the normal 'autoimmune' repertoire that home to the CNS where they may trigger the continuous recruitment of effector cells (macrophages) from the periphery.

The goal of this study was to determine effects of pretreatment and late dexamethasone on retinopathy in a mouse model.\nThe C57BL6 mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (by placing animals in 75% oxygen from postnatal days 7 through 12) was used to create retinal neovascularization. Dexamethasone at 0.5 mg/kg per day was administered from day 1 through day 5 in the pretreatment group. The late-treatment group received 5 days of dexamethasone at the same dose beginning on day 12. Mice were killed at days 17 through 20, and retinal vasculature was assessed by a retinal scoring system of wholemount preparation after high-molecular-weight fluorescein-labeled dextran perfusion. In addition, retinal neovascularization was assessed by quantification of extraretinal neovascular nuclei in retinal sections. Statistical significance was defined as P: < 0.05 and was determined by the Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test, and Student's t-test.\nOxygen-exposed animals that received treatment with dexamethasone before oxygen exposure had an improvement in retinopathy, with a median score of 6 (5,7; 25th,75th quartiles) compared with 10 (8,11) in the untreated oxygen-exposed (P: < 0.05). The group treated late (after oxygen exposure) with dexamethasone had a median score of 10 (9,11).

{"title": "Sustained angiogenesis enables in vivo transplantation of mucocutaneous derived AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma cells in murine hosts.", "abstract": "AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS), the most prevalent HIV-associated malignancy, is a debilitating, potentially fatal disease. Currently, there is a need for development of AIDS-KS therapies that are not only well tolerated, but also capable of providing sustained remission. Preclinical assessment of pharmacological parameters and therapeutic efficacies are dependent upon in vivo parameters. However, there are currently no animal KS models and mucocutaneous KS cell isolates have proved to be non-tumorigenic in animal hosts. This report describes the development of a murine model that enables in vivo transplantation of 'native' low population doubling level AIDS-KS cells from biopsy-confirmed mucocutaneous lesions. The angiogenic phenotype of in situ AIDS-KS lesions is reconstituted via controlled release of a complete angiogenic peptide, recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), from locally injectable, biodegradable polylactide-co-glycolide implants. Consequential to the sustained local release of bioactive bFGF, a murine vascular network is established, which facilitates the in vivo transplantation of AIDS-KS cells. Desirable aspects of this model include: low cost murine species, transplantation of non-selected patient cells and use of animal hosts that are T cell-deficient. The transplanted human AIDS-KS cells and extensive murine vascular network create lesions that retain a striking resemblance, at both the gross and microscopic levels, to in situ AIDS-KS tumors. Because the bFGF-induced murine vascular network is analogous to the abundant vascularity present in AIDS-KS lesions, this murine model should provide an excellent vehicle for numerous clinically relevant studies, such as assessment of drug clearance at AIDS-KS lesional sites. Finally, applicability of this method is not restricted to AIDS-related malignancies.

{"title": "Anatomical basics, variations, and degenerative changes of the shoulder joint and shoulder girdle.", "abstract": "This paper summarizes the anatomical basics of the shoulder, their variations, and precise definitions, including differential diagnoses. It also describes the characteristic degenerative changes caused by aging. A typical variation (7-15%) is the os acromiale, which forms the triangular epiphysis of the scapular spine. This abnormality must be differentiated from a fracture of the acromion or a pseudarthrosis. Because ossification of the acromion is complete after age 25, the os acromiale should be diagnosed only after this age. The shape of the acromion is a further important feature. In a recent anatomical study, the following frequencies of the Bigliani-types of the acromial shape were anatomically determined - type 1 (flat), 10.2% and type 2 (curved), 89.8%. Type 3 (hooked) was not observed, which indicates that this type is probably a misinterpretation of the so-called acromial spur. Minor dehiscences and perforations in the infraspinate or supraspinate fossa should not be confused with malignant osteolyses. The scapula has three ligaments of its own, (1) the coracoacromial ligament and its osseous fixations form an osteofibrous arch above the shoulder joint, which plays a part in impingement syndrome; (2) the superior transverse scapular ligament or its ossified correlate arches the scapular incisure and can cause a typical compression syndrome of the suprascapular nerve; (3) the inferior transverse scapular ligament is of no great clinical importance. Two intraarticular structures (glenoid labrum and tendon of the long bicipital head) must be mentioned. The glenoid labrum consists of dense connective tissue and surrounds the margin of the glenoid cavity. Two areas exhibit specialized conditions, cranial at the supraglenoid tubercle an intimate relationship exists to the tendon of the long bicipital head and in about 55% of cases, the labrum is stretched over the glenoid rim at the ventral side. At the area of the biceps-tendon-labrum complex, so-called SLAP-lesions may occur and at the glenoid rim, where the labrum is often not fixed to the bony margin, avulsions of the labrum may occur. This well-established anatomical condition must not be mistaken for a manifest Bankart-lesion. The glenohumeral ligaments, which are located in the ventral articular capsule, have a stabilizing function for the ventral part of the glenoid labrum. The glenohumeral ligaments lift the articular lip where it crosses the glenoid notch. This 'labrum-lift effect' supports the stabilizing features of the articular lip and the glenohumeral ligaments. The rotator cuff is composed of the tendons of the teres minor, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles. This cuff has a poorly vascularized area, due to mechanical conditions, about 1.5 cm from the major tubercle, which causes degenerative changes and eventually may lead to ruptures. Results of the impingement-syndrome and the osteoarthrotic changes of the shoulder and acromioclavicular joint are also presented and discussed. Finally, the coracoclavicular joint, which probably represents no congenital entity but appears due to a changed, lowered position of the shoulder girdle, is discussed. The paper also presents instructive figures of anatomical preparations that can be used to make more precise radiological and differential diagnoses. All preparations were done by the author and are part of a series of more than 300 preparations of the shoulder joint and girdle.", "journal": "European journal of radiology", "date": "2000-08-30", "authors": ["APrescher"], "doi": "10.1016/s0720-048x(00)00225-4"}
{"title": "The primordial to primary follicle transition.", "abstract": "The mechanisms that regulate the gradual exit of ovarian follicles from the non-growing, primordial pool are very poorly understood. A better understanding of the signals that initiate follicular growth in mammals, and of the conditions necessary for sustained growth of early preantral follicles in vitro, could have practical implications for contraception, alleviation of infertility, and regulation of the rate of follicle depletion (menopause). Our laboratory has developed two experimental systems that can be used to study factors involved in the activation of primordial follicles. In the first experimental system, small pieces of ovarian cortex, containing mostly primordial follicles, are isolated from fetal ovaries of cattle or baboons and cultured in serum-free medium. Under these conditions most primordial follicles become activated between 12 and 24 h of culture; their granulosa cells change shape, from flattened to cuboidal, and begin to express proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). During 7 days in culture, the newly-formed primary follicles and their oocytes increase significantly in diameter. This wholesale 'spontaneous' activation in serum-free medium is quite different from the much more gradual exit of primordial follicles from the resting pool that occurs in vivo and suggests that primordial follicles in vivo may be subject to a tonic inhibition of growth initiation or, alternatively, that some aspect(s) of the environment in vitro stimulates growth initiation. Recently we developed a second experimental system for studying activation of primordial follicles. Pieces of ovarian cortex from bovine or baboon fetuses were grafted beneath the developing chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of 6-day-old chick embryos, a site known to support xenografted tissues. The cortical pieces were rapidly vascularized and histological analysis of pieces recovered after 2, 4, 7, or 10 days 'in ovo' revealed no increase in the number of primary follicles and maintenance of original numbers of primordial follicles. Therefore, grafting ovarian cortical pieces beneath the chick CAM provides an experimental system in which follicles remain at the primordial stage in a readily accessible environment and which, thus, may be used to study potential regulators of the initiation of follicle growth. The results suggest that vascularization of isolated pieces of ovarian cortex provides conditions that maintain follicular quiescence, whereas culture in vitro allows unrestrained activation of primordial follicles. Future studies with and comparisons of the in vitro and in ovo models may provide new insight into the mechanisms that regulate the primordial to primary follicle transition.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular endocrinology", "date": "2000-08-30", "authors": ["J EFortune", "R ACushman", "C MWahl", "SKito"], "doi": "10.1016/s0303-7207(99)00240-3"}

The requirement for each mAb in this conditioning regimen in order to avoid the rejection of FP THY grafts has not yet been defined. In our present studies, CD4 cell-depleted ATX B6 mice and euthymic MHC class II-deficient (IIKO) mice were employed to investigate the role of mouse CD4+ cells in the rejection of FP THY grafts in vivo. After grafting FP THY/LIV to CD4+ cell-depleted ATX B6 mice, efficient repopulation of mouse CD4+ T cells was observed in the periphery. However, only two of four mice had remaining FP THY grafts by 17 weeks post-implantation, and these were of poor quality, whereas four of four T and NK cell-depleted ATX B6 mice had well-developed FP THY grafts. Furthermore, three of four FP THY/LIV-grafted, CD4+ cell-depleted ATX B6 mice rejected donor MHC-matched pig skin grafts. In contrast, three of three FP THY/LIV grafted, T and NK cell-depleted, ATX B6 mice accepted donor MHC-matched pig skin grafts, suggesting that optimal tolerance to xenogeneic pig antigens was not achieved in mice conditioned only with anti-CD4 mAb. ATX B6 mice treated with only anti-CD8 mAb rejected FP THY completely by 6 weeks post-grafting, a time when CD4+ cell-depleted ATX B6 mice had well-vascularized FP THY grafts. In addition, when euthymic IIKO mice were pre-treated with the standard conditioning regimen that includes four different mAbs, FP THY grafts survived and supported the repopulation of mouse CD4+ T cells in the periphery, while high levels of mouse CD8+ T cells developed in host thymi. These studies suggest that mouse CD4+ T cells play a critical role in the acute rejection of xenogeneic FP THY grafts. Without help from CD4+ cells, mouse CD8+ cells, NK, NK/T, and TCR(gamma/delta)+ T cells do not mediate acute rejection of FP THY grafts.

{"title": "Concordant xenotransplantation--non-vascularized pancreatic islets are more difficult to regraft than the vascularized heart.", "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that it is possible to perform retransplantation of a xenogeneic heart (mouse-to-rat) using cyclosporine A as monotherapy, provided that the first heart is transplanted under a short course of deoxyspergualin (DSG). If DSG is omitted, the first heart is rejected within four days and the second heart succumbs to hyperacute rejection within minutes. A mouse heart as first graft does not protect a consecutive pancreatic islet graft, although the heart continues to function after rejection of the cellular graft. One explanation for this discrepancy may be the fact that cellular grafts, as pancreatic islets, lack an endothelial lining. We have, therefore, further investigated possible differences between vascularized and non-vascularized xenografts regarding their capacity to induce unresponsiveness. The use of pancreatic islets as primary graft neither accelerated nor decelerated the speed of rejection of the vascularized heart used as secondary graft. Furthermore, hemagglutinating and cytotoxic antibody titres responded in the same manner as in naive rats transplanted with a mouse heart. Retransplantation with pancreatic islets also resulted in complete rejection of both the primary and secondary grafts. Thus, the lack of unresponsiveness cannot simply be explained by differences, between the pancreatic and cardiac tissues, in antigen expression. In addition, intraperitoneal transplantation of mouse heart cells as primary graft resulted in rejection of a secondary cardiac graft after three days. However, it cannot be totally excluded that the time of antigen exposure had an impact on these results. In conclusion, our previous and present studies suggest that the presence of an intact vascular bed, both in the first and second graft, is necessary to create a state of unresponsiveness. Because the pancreatic islets lack an endothelial lining, they do not benefit from an unresponsiveness of the immune system.

{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor expression and capillary architecture in high-grade PIN and prostate cancer in untreated and androgen-ablated patients.", "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that angiogenesis is a potent prognostic indicator for patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and have pointed out that the evaluation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is useful in assessing the angiogenic phenotype in PCa. The aim of the study was to investigate immunohistochemically the expression of VEGF and its correlation with the pattern of capillary architecture in prostate cancer and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), in untreated and androgen-ablated patients.\nForty-five patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate carcinoma were recruited for this study. The study population included two groups: 35 patients who did not receive chemo-, hormone, or radiation therapy before surgery, and 10 patients who were under complete androgen blockade (CAB) for 3 months at time of surgery. VEGF was examined by immunohistochemistry, and its tissue expression was compared with the pattern of capillary architecture evaluated by immunostaining the endothelial antigen CD34. The relationship of VEGF expression to chromogranin A-positive (e.g., neuroendocrine) cells was investigated.\nIn normal tissue, the intensity of the VEGF immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of secretory cells ranged from negative to low. Very few basal cells stained for VEGF. All prostate cancer specimens stained positively, the intensity of the immunoreaction ranging from low to strong and being correlated with the Gleason score. Strongly positive VEGF immunoreactivity was detected in vascular endothelial cells and in stromal cells surrounding blood vessels. Two discrete immunostaining patterns were observed in high-grade PIN. VEGF expression of low-to-moderate intensity was defined as pattern A. The other, characterized by a strong cytoplasmic immunoreaction similar to that of poorly differentiated tumors, was defined as pattern B. The capillary architecture in high-grade PIN with pattern A was similar to the orderly vascular network seen in normal prostates, whereas in the pattern B it had the characteristics of microvessels usually seen in PCa. The degree of vascularization in the stroma adjacent to intensely VEGF-stained cells (neuroendocrine phenotype) was higher than that noted in association with secretory cells. CAB before surgery downregulated the expression of VEGF and decreased the degree of vascularization, except in the cell areas with neuroendocrine (NE) features.\nOur immunohistochemical results indicate that significant levels of VEGF are present in prostate cancer and in a population of PIN lesions, expression being highest in association with NE cells.

To understand the in vivo antitumor effect and mechanism of recombinant human IFN-beta (rhIFN-beta) depending on the stages of tumor development or progression, we used orthotopic xenograft brain tumors generated by stereotactic intracerebral implantation of U-87 human glioma cells in nude mice. Mice bearing tumors 7 days (group 1) and 21 days (group 2) postimplant were treated with 2 x 10(5) IU/day of rhIFN-beta or saline i.p. for 15 days, respectively.

Pedicled skin flaps harvesting and utilisation are techniques typical of plastic surgery but are also largely used in urologic adult and paediatric surgery. They are adopted for urethral, penile and corpora cavernosa reconstruction. Pedicled flaps are utilised for the closure of large skin defect in case of complicated wound or when an urinary fistula is present, especially after radiotherapy. A perfect knowledge of the flap nourishment and of the method of harvesting is crucial if the best results must be obtained. In our work we describe the surgical technique for the utilisation of gracilis muscle and forearm flap.

{"title": "Inhibition of angiogenesis and tumorigenesis, and induction of dormancy by p53 in a p53-null thyroid carcinoma cell line in vivo.", "abstract": "Our recent in vitro findings for suppression of thrombospondin-1 (TSP1; an antiangiogenic factor) expression by wild-type (wt) p53 in a p53-null thyroid carcinoma cell line, FRO, prompted us to investigate the in vivo effect of exogenous wt-p53 and TSP1 expression on tumor growth and angiogenesis of FRO xenografts in nude mice. Overexpression of TSP1, which did not affect the in vitro cell growth, significantly inhibited the in vivo tumor growth and neovascularization but not tumorigenesis; all the mice inoculated with FRO cells expressing TSP1 developed tumors, which were smaller and less vascularized than those derived from FRO cells. In contrast, restoration of wt-p53 expression, which reduced the in vitro cell growth rate, inhibited tumorigenesis and induced a state of \"dormancy\". Thus, approximately 40% of mice inoculated with FRO cells expressing wt-p53 (FRO-p53) were tumor free and the remaining mice developed hypovascular tumors which remained small (< or = 5 mm in size) for up to 60 days. Of interest, the phenotype of FRO-p53 tumors reverted to a well vascularized, progressively expanding tumor by exogenous expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (a proangiogenic factor). Our data demonstrated wt-p53 inhibition of tumorigenesis and induction of dormancy by suppression of neovascularization in FRO cells. The results suggest that p53 gene therapy for thyroid carcinoma harboring p53 mutation may be more efficacious than we had expected from previous in vitro data.", "journal": "Anticancer research", "date": "2000-08-23", "authors": ["YNagayama", "KShigematsu", "HNamba", "KZeki", "SYamashita", "MNiwa"], "doi": null}

In both species, the EPPB were intercalated between the clavicular and the cranial thoracic air-sacs. A notable difference between the morphology of the EPPB in G. g. domesticus and C. livia was that, in the former, the EPPB were constricted at the origin of the MVSB, while a dilatation occurred at the same site in the latter. In both species, a highly vascularized, dorsally located hemispherical epithelial swelling was observed cranial to the origin of the MVSB. The MVSB were narrow at their origin and variably angled relative to the longitudinal axis of the EPPB. Conspicuous epithelial tracts and folds were observed on the luminal aspect of the EPPB in both C. livia and G. g. domesticus. From their marked development and their orientation relative to the angled MVSB, these properties may influence the flow of the air in the EPPB. It was concluded that features such as syringeal constriction, an intimate topographic relationship between the EPPB and the cranial air-sacs, prominent epithelial tracts and folds, an epithelial swelling ahead of the origin of the first MVSB (corresponding to the 'segmentun accelerans'), and narrowing and angulation of the MVSB at their origin, may together contribute to IAV to a variable extent. In as much as the mechanism of pulmonary ventilation and mode of airflow in the parabronchial lung are basically similar in all birds, the morphological differences observed between G. g. domesticus and C. livia suggest that either the mechanism of production of IAV or its functional efficiency may be different, at least in these two species of birds.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2000-08-23", "authors": ["J NMaina", "MAfrica"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.203.18.2865"}
{"title": "Human peritoneal adhesions are highly cellular, innervated, and vascularized.", "abstract": "Peritoneal adhesions are a major complication of healing following surgery or infection and can lead to conditions such as intestinal obstruction, infertility, and chronic pain. Mature adhesions are the result of aberrant peritoneal healing and historically have been thought to consist of non-functional scar tissue. The aim of the present study was to analyse the cellular composition, vascularity, and extracellular matrix distribution of human peritoneal adhesions, to determine whether adhesions represent redundant scar tissue or are dynamic regenerating structures. Furthermore, the histological appearance of each adhesion was correlated with the clinical history of the patient, to determine whether maturity or intraperitoneal pathology influences adhesion structure. Human peritoneal adhesions were collected from 29 patients undergoing laparotomy for various conditions and were prepared for histology, immunocytochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. All adhesions were highly vascularized, containing well-developed arterioles, venules, and capillaries. Nerve fibres, with both myelinated and non-myelinated axons, were present in adhesions from nearly two-thirds of the patients, with increased incidence in those with a malignancy. Approximately one-third of the adhesions contained conspicuous smooth muscle cell clusters lined by collagen fibres of heterogeneous size. Adipose tissue was a consistent feature of all the adhesions, with some areas displaying fibrosis. There appeared to be no correlation between the estimated maturity or site of each adhesion and its histological appearance. However, intraperitoneal pathology at the time of surgery did influence the incidence of some histological features, such as the presence of nerve fibres, clusters of smooth muscle cells, and inflammation. This study challenges previous concepts that adhesions represent non-functional scar tissue and clearly demonstrates that established adhesions are highly cellular, vascularized, and innervated, features more consistent with dynamic, regenerating structures.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2000-08-22", "authors": ["S EHerrick", "S EMutsaers", "POzua", "HSulaiman", "AOmer", "PBoulos", "M LFoster", "G JLaurent"], "doi": "10.1002/1096-9896(2000)9999:9999<::AID-PATH678>3.0.CO;2-E"}

This study was carried out on a large series of surgically resected Barrett's adenocarcinomas and associated preneoplastic lesions. Vascularization was quantified by microvessel counting and measurement of the percentage microvessel surface area after immunohistochemistry using the CD34 antibody. The expression of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) was also examined by immunohistochemistry. Results were correlated with clinico-pathological data and prognosis. Vascularization, assessed by both microvessel counting and measurement of the microvessel surface, was statistically higher in superficial cancers than in others. Higher vascularization was correlated with a lower rate of lymph node and distant metastasis, as well as with better survival. However, when superficial carcinomas were excluded from the study, microvessel count failed to provide any significant prognostic information. Irrespective of the inclusion or exclusion of superficial tumours, the expression of VEGF was correlated with a higher vascularisation but did not provide prognostic significance. It is concluded that high angiogenic properties are acquired in precancerous lesions and early cancers in Barrett's oesophagus. Vascularization as assessed by both microvessel counting and measurement of the microvessel surface is not informative for prognosis in infiltrative Barrett's adenocarcinomas.

{"title": "Chromosomal localization, gene structure, and expression pattern of DDAH1: comparison with DDAH2 and implications for evolutionary origins.", "abstract": "Endogenously produced asymmetrically methylated arginine residues are competitive inhibitors of all three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) specifically hydrolyzes these asymmetrically methylated arginine residues to citrulline and methylamines. Previously we have proposed that regulation of asymmetric methylarginine concentration by DDAH may provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of NOS activity in vivo. Recently we reported the cloning of human DDAH and identified a novel human DDAH isoform (DDAH I and DDAH II, respectively). Here we report that the DDAH1 gene maps to chromosome 1p22 and confirm that DDAH2 maps to the MHC III region of chromosome 6p21.3. Extensive analysis of the distribution of DDAH1 and DDAH2 mRNA in 50 human tissues indicates differential expression of DDAH isoforms in brain regions, in immune cells, and during development. DDAH2 expression predominates in highly vascularized tissues that express the endothelial NOS isoform and in immune tissues that can express iNOS. Whereas DDAH2 is expressed at relatively high levels in all fetal tissues examined, DDAH1 expression varies little between fetal and adult tissues. The chromosomal localization of the DDAHs is consistent with gene duplication, and consistent with this, comparison of the gene structures indicates that the intron/exon organization is highly conserved. Phylogenetic analysis of DDAH sequences from diverse species suggests that DDAH gene duplication occurred prior to the emergence of bony fish some 400 million years ago. Overall the data suggest that DDAH2 may be the more ancient of the two genes.", "journal": "Genomics", "date": "2000-08-22", "authors": ["C TTran", "M FFox", "PVallance", "J MLeiper"], "doi": "10.1006/geno.2000.6262"}

The authors present their experience with the use of sural flaps for the treatment of small- and medium-size defects of the distal region of the lower limb. The flap used was a distally based fasciocutaneous flap raised in the posterior region of the lower two thirds of the leg. Vascularization was ensured by the superficial sural artery, which accompanies the sural nerve together with the short saphenous vein. The authors treated 18 patients (12 men and 6 women) from May 1997 to August 1999 at the Division of Plastic Surgery, University of Turin, Italy. Superficial necrosis without involvement of the deep fascia (which was grafted 1 month later) occurred in 1 patient of the 18 treated. In another 2 patients, defects were found in the flap margins, but no additional surgical revision was necessary, and recovery occurred by secondary intention. In every patient the sural flaps provided good coverage of the defects, both from a functional and an aesthetic point of view. The major advantages of this flap are its easy and quick dissection.

We also tested the extent to which CD154 induction was NFkappaB-dependent by using NFkappaB/p50-deficient mice as allograft recipients and as source of cells for in vitro studies of CD154 induction, and through use of proteasome inhibitors to block IkappaBalpha degradation and NFKB activation in wild-type mice.\nConcomitant use of cyclosporin A or methylprednisolone, but not rapamycin or mycophenolate, inhibited CD154 mAb-induced allograft survival. The differential effects of these agents on CD154 mAb-induced tolerance correlated with their capacity to inhibit activation-induced CD154 expression on CD4+ T cells. Full expression of CD154 expression was found to require NF-kappaB activation, and CD154 mAb was ineffective in NF-kappaB/p50 deficient allograft recipients or control mice in which NF-kappaB activation was blocked by proteasome inhibition.\nStrategies to use CD154 mAb clinically must take into account the effects of immunosuppressive agents on CD154 induction, which seems to be at least partially NF-kappaB dependent. Our data suggest that ligation of surface-expressed CD154 provides an important signal that modulates T cell activation and thereby contributes to the effects of CD154 mAb, in addition to previously recognized actions involving blockade of CD40/CD154-dependent cell activation and activation-induced cell death.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2000-08-19", "authors": ["S TSmiley", "VCsizmadia", "WGao", "L ATurka", "W WHancock"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200008150-00005"}

The aim of this study was to analyze potential risk factors for the onset of anastomotic stenoses and to evaluate their treatment and final outcome.\nBetween 1990 and 1995, 187 patients underwent esophagectomy and esophagogastrostomy with anastomosis performed inside the chest using a circular stapler.\nTwenty-three patients (12.3%) developed an anastomotic stenosis. The incidence of strictures was inversely related to the diameter of the stapler. Concomitant cardiovascular diseases; morphofunctional disorders of the tubulized stomach, such as those related to duodenogastric reflux; and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were also recognized as significant risk factors. Endoscopic dilatations proved safe and were effective in the treatment of most anastomotic stenoses.\nTo reduce the risk of anastomotic stenosis after stapled intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy, adequate vascularization of the viscera being anastomized should be maintained, and it is mandatory to use the largest circular stapler suitable. Furthermore, it is essential to reduce the negative inflammation-inducing effects of duodenogastroesophageal reflux to a minimum.

Following a vast experience with a complete laparoscopic two-stage Fowler-Stephens procedure, we report our experience with laparoscopic orchiopexy performed without dividing the spermatic vessels.\nOver a 24-month period, 70 boys with nonpalpable testes (72 overall) underwent laparoscopic diagnostic exploration. Twenty patients (27.8%) of this series who showed an intraabdominal testis underwent laparoscopic orchiopexy without sectioning the spermatic vessels. In seven cases, the testis was just proximal to the internal inguinal ring; in 13, it was in the high intraabdominal position. The technique consisted in sectioning the gubernaculum (when present), opening the peritoneum laterally to the spermatic vessels, and mobilizing the testicular vessels and the vas deferens in a retroperitoneal position for 8-10 cm. The testis was then brought down into the scrotum through the internal inguinal ring (11 cases), if this was open, or through a neo-inguinal ring (nine cases) created medially to the epigastric vessels. In every case, we closed the inguinal ring at the end of the operation using one or two detached sutures.\nOperating time ranged between 40 and 75 min (median, 55). All the testes were successfully brought down into the scrotum. We had only one (5%) intraoperative complication. In the second patient treated with this procedure, there was an iatrogenic rupture of the spermatic vessels due to excessive traction.\nOn the basis of our experience, we believe that laparoscopic orchiopexy without division of the spermatic vessels should be the treatment of choice in the management of nonpalpable testes, because it does not affect normal testicular vascularization and is minimally invasive. A blunt dissection and a delicate manipulation of the testis without excessive traction are the best ways to avoid any kind of complication.", "journal": "Surgical endoscopy", "date": "2000-08-19", "authors": ["CEsposito", "GVallone", "ASettimi", "M AGonzalez Sabin", "GAmici", "TCusano"], "doi": "10.1007/s004640000107"}

The turgor pressure in cells of the pod wall was initially 0.25 MPa, and began to increase within a few minutes of irrigation. By 2-4 h after irrigation, pod wall cell turgor had increased to 0.97 MPa. This increase in turgor was matched closely by increases in the total water potential of both the pod and the stem, as measured by a pressure chamber. However, turgor pressure in cells of the seed coat was relatively low (0.10 MPa) and was essentially unchanged up to 24 h after irrigation (0.13 MPa). These data demonstrate that water exchange is relatively efficient throughout most of the plant body, but not between the pod and the seed.

An aortic valve homograft recipient cohort was studied to determine whether HLA mismatch and associated factors predicted homograft dysfunction.\nBoth donor and recipient HLA type was obtained for 162 recipients of cryopreserved aortic valve homografts between 1986 and 1998. Structural deterioration of the homograft was defined by echocardiography as at least moderate aortic stenosis or regurgitation. Patients' records were searched for postoperative fever, ABO blood type disparity, and other associated factors. HLA class 1 (A and B antigens) were typed serologically, and HLA class 2 (DR antigens) by molecular genotyping. Associations were analyzed using chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier curves of freedom from structural deterioration in all patients, and in those with > or =5 years of follow up. Cox regression was used to determine independent predictors of structural deterioration.\nClass 2 antigen mismatch had a significant association (p = 0.04) with decrease in cryopreserved aortic valve homograft freedom from structural deterioration in patients with long-term follow up (> or =5 years). In addition, there was an important difference in frequency of postoperative fever in recipients with two DR mismatches (31.2%), and in those with no or one DR mismatch (16.9%; p = 0.051).

The loss of HIF-1alpha negatively affects tumor growth in these two sets of H-ras-transformed cell lines, and this negative effect is not due to deficient vascularization. Despite differences in VEGF expression, vascular density is similar in wild-type and HIF-1alpha-null tumors.

Angiopoietins are vascular endothelial cell-specific growth factors that play important roles principally during the later stages of angiogenesis, after the induction of new capillaries by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

{"title": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head after traumatic hip dislocation in the adult.", "abstract": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is most commonly classified according to the system of Ficat and Arlet, and the choice of treatment is based directly on the corresponding stage. Therefore it is important to accurately determine the stage of the disease because it has important bearings on the patient's clinical course. Patients with Stage I lesions (preradiologic stage of the disease) usually can be treated with pulsed electromagnetic fields with or without a core decompression, bone grafting and decompression, and rotational intertrochanteric osteotomy. These procedures are equally applicable for patients with Stage II lesions but frequently additional measures such as vascularized fibular grafting and intertrochanteric osteotomy may be necessary. Patients with Stages III and IV lesions also may be treated in a similar way, especially if one wishes to avoid total hip arthroplasty, especially in younger patients. The trapdoor procedure with autogenous cancellous bone and cortical bone grafting can be successful in Stage III osteonecrosis of the hip in patients with small- to medium-sized lesions. When core decompression is used to treat patients with Stage III lesions, an 89% satisfactory outcome can be expected providing that the lesion is small and central, and does not have head depression. Many times the number and variety of procedures tend to reflect the relatively poor results and the desire to avoid total hip arthroplasty.

A similar transplantation of microencapsulated aggregates of human hepatoma HepG2 cells did not result in viable cells even at 7 days. The loss of viability was attributed to the tissue reaction, because both encapsulated cell types remained viable in vitro. However, it is not clear if the cells lost their viability in vivo, leading to the aggressive tissue reaction or if the latter caused the cells to starve or otherwise die. The tissue reactions to microcapsules containing rat or human hepatoma cells at day 1 was one cell layer thick and avascular. At later times, tissue reactions were comprised of three regions: macrophages, fibroblasts, and some foreign body giant cells apposed to the polymer membrane, a dense region of fibroblasts and collagen, and a region of vascularized granulation tissue. Prompt vascularization of the tissue reactions occurred after 4 days and was maintained for up to 14 days.

{"title": "Silicon micromachining to tissue engineer branched vascular channels for liver fabrication.", "abstract": "To date, many approaches to engineering new tissue have emerged and they have all relied on vascularization from the host to provide permanent engraftment and mass transfer of oxygen and nutrients. Although this approach has been useful in many tissues, it has not been as successful in thick, complex tissues, particularly those comprising the large vital organs such as the liver, kidney, and heart. In this study, we report preliminary results using micromachining technologies on silicon and Pyrex surfaces to generate complete vascular systems that may be integrated with engineered tissue before implantation. Using standard photolithography techniques, trench patterns reminiscent of branched architecture of vascular and capillary networks were etched onto silicon and Pyrex surfaces to serve as templates. Hepatocytes and endothelial cells were cultured and subsequently lifted as single-cell monolayers from these two-dimensional molds. Both cell types were viable and proliferative on these surfaces. In addition, hepatocytes maintained albumin production. The lifted monolayers were then folded into compact three-dimensional tissues. Thus, with the use microfabrication technology in tissue engineering, it now seems feasible to consider lifting endothelial cells as branched vascular networks from two-dimensional templates that may ultimately be combined with layers of parenchymal tissue, such as hepatocytes, to form three-dimensional conformations of living vascularized tissue for implantation.", "journal": "Tissue engineering", "date": "2000-08-15", "authors": ["SKaihara", "JBorenstein", "RKoka", "SLalan", "E ROchoa", "MRavens", "HPien", "BCunningham", "J PVacanti"], "doi": "10.1089/107632700320739"}

It is found that the arterial supply of the cerebral cortex are from cortical branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). These arteries are in turn branches of the internal carotid artery (ICA). In addition, the cerebral cortex receives the blood from the cortical branches of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) that originates from the basilar artery (BA). These cortical arteries gives rise to rectilinear orientated intracortical arteries that are divided into dense capillary networks to supply the cerebral cortex. The capillary networks drain the blood into intracortical veins and then into the tributaries of major superficial cerebral veins. The basal ganglia (caudate and lentiform nuclei) are supplied by central or perforating branches of the ACA and MCA. These central or medullary arteries give rise to arterioles that ramify into dense capillary plexuses. The venous blood from both nuclei drains into venules and finally into the tributaries of internal cerebral veins. It is obvious that on the ventral aspect, the diameter of the lateral striate artery (LSA) and of the penetrating arterioles from the MCA are much smaller than that of the MCA. These arterioles have few side branches while the peripheral branches of the superficial cerebral arteries exhibit several series of branches that are gradually reduced in diameter before branching into intracortical arteries.

The ability of fetal thymi from C57BL/6 mice to support these selection events in culture is, however, critically dependent on the timing of their excision: whereas thymi from 16 day embryos generate mature CD4+8(-) and CD4(-)8+ thymocytes, 14 day thymi show a profound blockage in positive selection at the CD4+8+ stage. Here we show that this blockage is not due to intrinsic deficiencies in the ability of thymocytes to transduce positive selection signals, suggesting the defect to lie within the thymic microenvironment. Since vascularization of the thymus occurs at day 15 of gestation, we investigated whether the exclusion of plasma proteins from 14 day thymi was responsible. Accordingly, the addition of serum from 16 day embryos to organ cultures of 14 day thymi rescued mature CD4+8(-) and CD4(-)8+ subsets. Activity was found to reside in a low molecular weight fraction of serum, sensitive to proteolysis, which was present only transiently during ontogeny. Our data suggest that repertoire selection is initiated following \"priming\" of the thymic microenvironment by plasma proteins, thereby ensuring the onset of positive selection to be delayed until the entry of extrathymic proteins to which self tolerance must be established.", "journal": "European journal of immunology", "date": "2000-08-15", "authors": ["P JFairchild", "HWaldmann"], "doi": "10.1002/1521-4141(200007)30:7<1948::AID-IMMU1948>3.0.CO;2-3"}
{"title": "Vascular response of the rabbit bladder to short term partial outlet obstruction.", "abstract": "Partial bladder outlet obstruction of the rabbit bladder results in a rapid increase in mass characterized by remodeling of the bladder wall. In this study we investigated the effect of partial outlet obstruction on microvessel density and distribution in the bladder wall immunohistochemically using CD31 as a marker for vascular endothelium, and on blood flow using a fluorescent microsphere technique. Transverse sections of bladder wall were examined after 0 (unobstructed), 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days of obstruction. The microvasculature of obstructed rabbit bladder mucosa and detrusor smooth muscle apparently increased relative to augmentation of these compartments, while new vessels appeared in the thickening serosa. These vascular changes correlated with results showing that, at 1 week after obstruction, blood flow (ml/min/g tissue) to the mucosa and detrusor was unchanged. Thickening of the serosa, apparent after 1 day of obstruction, began before its vascularization. Then, 1 week post-obstruction, there was significant microvessel formation in the transition region between the detrusor smooth muscle and the increasing serosa; after 2 weeks, the entire serosa was vascularized. The vascularization of the muscle-serosal transition region and then the remaining serosa apparently precedes fibroblast differentiation, providing blood supply and thus metabolic support for this process. All obstructed rabbit bladders in this study were in a state of compensated function based on their weights. Our working hypothesis is that blood flow per unit tissue mass is normal in compensated obstructed bladders, thus allowing for normal contractile function and cellular metabolism.

{"title": "[Tumor surgery].", "abstract": "Surgery is still the primary therapeutic approach in treatment of tumors in the head and neck area, dating back to the early nineteenth century. More than 150 years ago, hemimaxillectomies and mandibular resections as well as hemiglossectomies were already performed by leading surgeons. The block principle we are now following dates back to Crile, who also established the principle of cervical lymph node dissection. Ablative oncologic surgery has always been closely linked with plastic and reconstructive surgery, rendering radical surgical interventions possible without disfiguring patients. The development of facial reconstructive surgery proceeded in stages, in the first instance as secondary reconstruction using tube pedicled flaps. The change to the concept of primary reconstruction occurred via arterialized skin flaps and myocutaneous flaps to the widely accepted and performed free tissue transfer. Free bone grafting, inaugurated earlier and still representing the majority of bone grafting, has been supplemented for certain reconstructive purposes by free vascularized bone transfer from various donor sites. Although the five-year-survival rate of carcinoma of the oral cavity has remained unchanged in the past 30 years, distinctive improvements in tumor surgery can be recorded. This is primarily based on improved diagnostics such as modern imaging techniques and the refinement of surgical techniques. The DOSAK has worked out distinctive guidelines for effective ablative oncologic surgery. Surgical approaches offering wide exposure and carrying low morbidity play a decisive role in radical resections. For this reason, midfacial degloving offers an essential improvement for the resection of midface tumors, especially from an aesthetic point of view. Tumors situated deep behind the viscerocranium at the skull base can be clearly exposed either through a lateral approach following a temporary osteotomy of the mandibular ramus or a transmandibular, transmaxillar, or transfacial approach with minimal morbidity. Concerning the concept of neck dissection, radical techniques are more and more abandoned in favor of a more conservative procedure. Actual inquiries concerning present surgical procedures as to the surgical strategy in \"N(o)-neck\" or marginal and segmental resection in mandibular adherent carcinomas demand scientific clarification.", "journal": "Mund-, Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie : MKG", "date": "2000-08-12", "authors": ["J EHausamen"], "doi": "10.1007/PL00014535"}

In addition, a panel of monoclonal antibodies was used to characterize the composition of the inflammatory infiltrates and to confirm the presence of neovascularization. Furthermore, VEGF concentrations were determined in vascularized corneas using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nVEGF was expressed by epithelial cells, by corneal endothelial cells, by vascular endothelial cells of limbal vessels and of newly formed vessels in the stroma, and weakly by keratocytes. Furthermore, VEGF expression was often markedly increased in inflamed corneas on epithelial cells and on vascular endothelial cells, particularly in the vicinity of macrophage infiltrates, and on fibroblasts in scar tissue. Correspondingly, VEGF concentrations were significantly higher in vascularized corneas compared with normal control corneas (P < 0.001). Expression of both VEGF receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1, was increased on endothelial cells of newly formed vessels in the stroma of inflamed corneas compared with limbal vessels of normal control corneas. In addition, Flt-1 was also expressed by corneal endothelial cells and by macrophages, whereas Flk-1 expression was lacking.\nThese results demonstrate that VEGF, Flt-1, and Flk-1 are strongly expressed in inflamed and vascularized human corneas and, thus, may play an important role in corneal neovascularization.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2000-08-11", "authors": ["WPhilipp", "LSpeicher", "CHumpel"], "doi": null}

The experimental eyelid malignant melanoma was induced by the injection of B16 melanoma cells (4 x 10(6) cells) into the right upper eyelid of BALB/c nu/nu mice, and the size of the tumor was recorded for 3 weeks after tumor cell injection. The effect of Adflt-ExR was examined in three ways. Model 1: B16 cells were infected by Adflt-ExR beforehand (at a multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 10) and injected into the eyelid. Model 2: Adflt-ExR was injected into pre-established B16 cell-induced eyelid malignant melanoma. Model 3: Adflt-ExR was injected into the femoral muscle of mice before B16 cell injection into the eyelid, and the remote effect was evaluated. An adenovirus vector bearing the LacZ gene (AdLacZ) or phosphate-buffered saline was used as a control. The amount of VEGF and the flt-ExR protein was measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Vascularization was evaluated by counting the number and the size of the vessels.\nThe supernatant of Adflt-ExR-transfected cells clearly inhibited VEGF-induced bovine retinal EC proliferation in vitro.

The effects of CsA on non-lymphoid immune cells, such as endothelial cells (ECs), have not been well characterized and sometimes seem contradictory, because both protective and adverse effects have been reported. In the present study, we investigated in vitro whether CsA could alter the antigenicity of activated porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) by reducing class I and class II MHC antigen expression.\nThe effect of CsA on MHC antigen expression during tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha- or lymphocyte-mediated PAEC activation was evaluated in vitro by flow cytometry and correlated to the ability of porcine ECs to promote human T lymphocyte proliferation. The effect of CsA on class II MHC antigen mRNA expression was also analyzed and related to class II transcriptional activator (CIITA) mRNA expression.\nFlow cytometry analysis showed that TNF-alpha-mediated induction of class II MHC antigen expression on PAECs was completely inhibited by CsA, whereas expression of class I MHC was reduced by 50%. The inhibition was dose dependent (at drug concentrations ranging from 2.5 microg/ml to 20.0 microg/ml) and was consistently observed at all time points (24-72 hr) during the activation period. Decreased MHC antigen expression dramatically reduced the ability of PAECs to further promote human T-cell proliferation. Similar levels of inhibition were achieved using an anti-porcine class II MHC blocking monoclonal antibody. Pretreatment of PAECs with CsA for 4 hr before coculture with human peripheral blood leukocytes efficiently blocked the induction on PAECs of E-selectin and class II MHC antigens and inhibited overexpression of class I antigens. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments showed that CsA markedly reduced the steady-state level of porcine class II (SLA-DRA and SLA-DQA) mRNA at 16 hr, compared with PAECs stimulated with TNF-alpha alone. The reduced level of class II MHC mRNA was associated with a lack of CIITA expression at this time point, suggesting that CsA could alter transcription or promote the rapid decay of CIITA mRNA.\nOur study indicates that CsA could play a role in preventing porcine MHC antigens being directly presented to human T lymphocytes by xenogeneic ECs.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2000-08-10", "authors": ["BCharreau", "SCoupel", "GBoulday", "J PSoulillou"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200007270-00021"}

{"title": "[Sonographic representation of the normal and acute inflamed appendix--in patients wi right-sided abdominal pain].", "abstract": "The detectability, vascularization and size of the normal and inflamed appendix were investigated in the study. 148 patients under suspicion of appendicitis or with lower right abdominal pain were studied over a period of five months beginning in January 1998. An ultrasound-transducer was employed at a wave length of 3.5 MHz to 10 MHz. Vascularization was measured using 'Duplex' and 'Color Angio'. The results were compared with operative evidence, histology and patient history. The appendix was detected in about 30% of the cases (47/148). But of the presumably normal appendices only 12% (13/109) were detected. 27 appendices sonographically diagnosed as acutely inflamed were confirmed by operation and phlegmonic. The acute appendicitis was sonographically diagnosed with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 95%. The diameter of the normal appendices was an average of 5.5 mm, that of the acute was 12.2 mm whereby 21 of 25 organs were at least 9 mm. The measurement of the organ size seems to be more helpful than the detection of vascularization. Both methods alone cannot detect the acute phlegmonic appendicitis. The normal appendix was less frequently detected than described in current literature.

Skin loss was covered in the same operative time using free muscle flaps (four latissimus dorsi, one gracilis). For the patient with massive articular and diaphyseal bone loss, a vascularized fibula transfer with arthrodesis was performed one day after the trauma. For the patient with grade IIIC open tibial fracture, a shortening was performed in emergency treatment.\nThe average follow-up was 21 months (range: eight months to 3.5 years). Partial weight-bearing was started at three months and the time of full weight-bearing was five months after the trauma. No angular complication and no non-union were observed. We noted one superficial infection without osteitis. All fractures healed within five to ten months (mean: 8.5 months). At the last follow-up, ankle and knee motion was normal and no pain was noted, except for the patient who had an arthrodesis and another who had associated lesions.\nWe think that \"aggressive\" emergency management for severe open tibial fractures gives good results.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1, 25(OH)(2)D(3)], the active metabolite of vitamin D(3), on angiogenesis by using well-characterized in vitro and in vivo model systems. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (1 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-7) mol/L) significantly inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced endothelial cell sprouting and elongation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner and had a small, but significant, inhibitory effect on VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. 1, 25(OH)(2)D(3) also inhibited the formation of networks of elongated endothelial cells within 3D collagen gels. The addition of 1, 25(OH)(2)D(3) to endothelial cell cultures containing sprouting elongated cells induced the regression of these cells, in the absence of any effect on cells present in the cobblestone monolayer. Analysis of nuclear morphology, DNA integrity, and enzymatic in situ labeling of apoptosis-induced strand breaks demonstrated that this regression was due to the induction of apoptosis specifically within the sprouting cell population. The effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on angiogenesis in vivo was investigated by using a model in which MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, which had been induced to overexpress VEGF, were xenografted subcutaneously together with MDA-435S breast carcinoma cells into nude mice. Treatment with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (12.5 pmol/d for 8 weeks) produced tumors that were less well vascularized than tumors formed in mice treated with vehicle alone.

Electrical transformers spanning the integument (skin or mucosa) have long been attractive means of circumventing this risk. Yet all existing skin surface transformers leak substantial magnetic flux, with an intrinsic risk of battery draining cross-coupling by any nearby conductor, requiring strict control of surroundings. In a progression of designs, we have used the walls of a small pouch, surgically formed from ileum, rather than skin, as a barrier. Previously, we reported a torroidal design with complete magnetic circuits, having zero flux leakage and unmatched heat dissipation in a 2 week canine trial. This work was in three parts: (1) Devices were placed in eight dogs for 9-12 weeks to document performance of the existing design. (2) Based on these results, the device was further miniaturized. Iterative computational modeling was applied to material selection and design. Simultaneously, practical techniques for surgically constructing tiny accommodating ileal pouches were explored in cadavers, by using polymer \"mock-ups\" of potential designs. (3) The final design was tested by acute implantation in a live 52 kg goat and by in vitro testing of electrical transfer function. IN VIVO TRIALS: The earlier design demonstrated 97.2% AC/AC and 84.2% DC/DC efficiency with contiguous tissue warming of 0.1 degrees C.

The chemoactive conditioned medium specifically induces directional migration of endothelial cells, not affecting the expression and activation of gelatinases, cell proliferation, and scattering. Directional migration induced in endothelial cells by conditioned medium from osteoblasts is inhibited by pertussis toxin, by blocking antibodies to integrins alpha(1), beta(1), and beta(3), and by antibodies to metalloproteinase 2 and 9. The biologically active purified protein has two sequences, coincident with the amino-terminal amino acids, respectively, of the alpha(1) and of the alpha(2) carboxyl propeptides of type I collagen, as physiologically produced by procollagen C proteinase. Antibodies to type I collagen and to the carboxyl terminus of alpha(1) or alpha(2) chains inhibit chemotaxis. The chemoattractant is the propeptide trimer carboxyl-terminal to type I collagen, and its activity is lost upon reduction.

In this study, we investigated the role of 4-1BB costimulation in allogeneic T cell responses.\nVascularized heart transplantation, allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR), and graft versus host disease models were used to examine 4-1BB and 4-1BBL expression. In addition, agonistic anti-4-1BB antibodies were used in MLR to functionally analyze T cell responses.\nUsing a heart transplant model, we found that 4-1BB and 4-1BBL transcripts were both expressed in rejecting cardiac grafts. In the allogeneic MLR, 4-1BB was expressed on both activated CD4 and CD8 T cells and 4-1BB was expressed on T cells after multiple cell divisions in vivo. Functionally, 4-1BB was a potent stimulator of proliferation, cytokine secretion, and CD25 expression by CD8 T cells, but 4-1BB signals had a weak effect on the proliferation of CD4 T cells. Because 4-1BB promoted the secretion of IL-2 and the expression of CD25 on CD8 T cells, we investigated whether IL-2 was the only factor whereby 4-1BB signals induced CD8 T cell proliferation. Although IL-2 was required for optimal CD8 T cell proliferation, 4-1BB also costimulated CD8 T cell proliferation independently of IL-2.\nThis study demonstrates that 4-1BB is expressed on activated, maximally divided T cells and shows that 4-1BB promotes CD8 T cell proliferation by enhancing signals through the IL-2 receptor and by other mechanisms independent of the IL-2 pathway.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2000-08-05", "authors": ["J TTan", "JHa", "H RCho", "CTucker-Burden", "R CHendrix", "R SMittler", "T CPearson", "C PLarsen"], "doi": null}

Microfracture technique belongs to the bone marrow stimulating methods like abrasion arthroplasty or subchondral bone drilling. Using a specially designed awl or pick, multiple perforations (\"microfractures\") are placed 3 to 4 mm apart and about 4 mm deep into the subchondral bone to reach a zone of vascularization. The formation of a fibrin clot (\"super clot\") containing the desired pluripotential stem cells is stimulated. This clot then differentiates and remodels, resulting in a durable fibrocartilage repair tissue. The arthroscopic awls produce essentially no thermal necrosis of the bone compared to hand-driven or motorized drills. In contrary to drills, it is possible with differently curved awls to reach and treat every area of the knee joint or even of the upper ankle or shoulder joint. Between 1992 and 1998 this technique has been used in 351 cases. 162 patients were interviewed with a questionnaire with respect to their subjective judgement of health between 3 and 6 years (mean 4.4) after operation.

Two rabbits from each group were sacrificed-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 14 days after grafting. Neovascularization was assessed by immunohistochemical staining with antihuman angiogenesis-related endothelial cell antibodies (EN 7/44). Quantitative analysis of neovascularization, represented by percentage area of positive immunohistochemical staining, was performed on 320 sections of the experimental groups by a computer-assisted image analyzer.\nPositive immunohistochemical staining was first identified on day 2 post grafting for the composite EC-DBM(IM) group in comparison with day 4 in the EC bone graft group. The composite EC-DBM(IM) bone graft group showed earlier and almost 100% more neovascularization when compared with the EC bone graft group.\nDBM(IM) enhances healing and integration of EC bone graft by enhancing vascularization as well as increasing the amount of new blood vessels formed.

Observers were blinded to their own and each other's results. Brachial systolic pressures were obtained using a DINAMAP(TM)(Critikon, Tampa, U.S.A.) automated blood pressure monitor, the Korotkoff method (12 cm cuff, parallel wrap) and an 8 MHz Doppler probe (Huntleigh) and sphygmomanometer. Ankle systolic pressures were obtained using the Doppler probe.

{"title": "[Impact of neoangiogenesis on the survival of patients of patients with stage Ib-IIb cervical carcinoma].", "abstract": "The survival of patients with cervical cancer has not improved much over the past few years. Cervical cancer is characterised by a degree of heterogeneity. Some patients undergoing surgery die a few months after diagnosis and treatment, whereas others live for longer and metastases only occur at a later stage. Over the past few years a new prognostic factor of cervical cancer has been identified. Neoangiogenesis can predict the possible metastasization of lymph nodes, disease-free survival, recidivation and therefore which patients require specific postoperative adjuvant therapies. This oncogenetic model, which also correlates the degree of neoangiogenesis with metastasization, and hence the level of tumour aggression, has been well demonstrated in lung cancer and skin melanoma. The microscopic discovery of increased tumour vascularization might be a useful independent prognostic factor in patients otherwise regarded as low risk. Cervical cancer with intense neoangiogenesis at an early phase may undergo rapid growth, early invasion and an increased capacity for metastasization. Neoangiogenesis is expressed as the density of microvessels inside the stroma of the neoplasm in invasive cervical cancer. It is predictive of recurrent disease and mortality independent of other prognostic factors. Patients with a high density of microvessels have a risk of fatal recidivation. The quantification of angiogenesis in primary tumours may be a useful prognostic factor in patients with cervical cancer. The quantification of neovascularization in neoplasms today is made easier by immunohistochemical staining procedures with greater specificity and sensitivity compared to conventional stains. It is to be hoped that this method will be used systematically by pathologists in biopsies to identify the most appropriate surgical and adjuvant therapies.", "journal": "Minerva ginecologica", "date": "2000-07-25", "authors": ["GGarozzo", "LCaragliano", "PConsalvo", "A MTorrisi", "SCaschetto"], "doi": null}

Therefore, a retrospective study was undertaken to determine the incidence of such problems in a large series of patients, with the intent to use these data to make possible changes in the perioperative protocol used in our clinic.\nThe files of all patients operated on between 1992 and 1996 were studied. These comprised 1,108 patients with 1,872 osteotomy procedures. The following parameters were descriptively analyzed: airway obstruction, hemorrhage, hematoma, infection, neurosensory disturbances, unfavorable fractures, malposition of condyles and nasal septum, and vascularization problems.\nThe most frequent complication was impairment of trigeminal nerve function. In 31.5% of the mandibular base osteotomies, 43.6% of the combined mandibular base and chin osteotomies, and 13% of the chin osteotomies, lip sensibility was decreased immediately postoperatively. After 1 year, this number was reduced to approximately 5%. The function of 17 lingual nerves and 45 infraorbital nerves was temporarily impaired. A wound infection was next in frequency. Fifty-three infections (mandible-to-maxilla ratio, 2.5:1) were treated with drainage under local anesthesia and antibiotic therapy. Loss of part or all of an osteotomized segment did not occur. Other complications were rare and/or temporary.\nThe most frequent complication was impairment of inferior alveolar nerve function. Life-threatening complications were not encountered.

The portion of the residual lesion adjacent to the transferred free flap disappeared, and the remaining discoloration also vanished grossly. Histologic comparison of immediate postoperative and 4-month postoperative specimens from the margin and residual lesion using Victoria blue staining showed that the typical preoperative findings for arteriovenous malformation-an intermingling of thick-walled vessels with abundant elastic fibers and thin-walled vessels without elastic fibers-had undergone change, resulting in the disappearance of the thick-walled vessels and leaving only homogeneous, thin-walled vasculature.

Its expression pattern is consistent with it being an important regulator of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and targeted disruption of VEGF-A has demonstrated that it is essential for vascular development. To determine if VEGF-A was sufficient to alter vascularization in the eye we generated transgenic mice which express human VEGF-A(165) specifically in the lens. Expression of transgenic VEGF-A led to excessive proliferation and accumulation of disorganized angioblasts and endothelial cells around the lens. The results support the hypothesis that VEGF-A can initiate the process of vascularization by stimulating chemoattraction and proliferation of angioblasts and endothelial cells and that VEGF-A expression can stimulate angiogenic remodeling.

In particular, some epidemiological data suggests that during fetal growth an altered intrauterine hormonal status, especially a change in estrogen status, could predispose to carcinogenesis. In an attempt to achieve new information on early breast growth, a series of developing human breasts have been analyzed, namely: 4 fetal breasts (28-32 weeks of gestational age), 7 infant breasts (7 h to 2 years) and 1 puberal breast (12 years). In addition to the morphological features, we studied the immunohistochemical expression of some markers involved in morphogenesis, such as MIB-1 for cell proliferation, bcl-2 for apoptosis control, CD34 for vasculogenesis, estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors for hormonal profile, and smooth-muscle actin for myoepithelial differentiation. The results were as follows: (a) lobules, absent between 28 weeks and 2 days, were well evident at 2 years of age and at puberty; (b) myoepithelial cells appeared from 28 weeks onward and persisted later with no modification in quantity and distribution; (c) epithelial cell proliferation was constantly low; (d) in all breasts inner epithelial cells showed diffuse bcl-2 positivity, while basal myoepithelial-like cells were generally negative; (e) all breasts were well vascularized with two different patterns: periductal vascularization (PDV) and interductal vascularization (IDV), IDV being always present, whereas PDV was found only in infant breasts; (f) ER and PR were almost absent in fetal and infant breasts, while their expression was high in the epithelial cells of the puberal breast; (g) stromal cells had no hormonal receptors and were heterogeneous for proliferation and bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, two fetal breasts showed high proliferation and high ER expression, respectively, in their epithelial compartment.

In the present study we have used the same model to evaluate whether quantitative differences in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes can be detected between animals receiving therapeutic immunizations with either IFN gamma-transfected glioma cells, wild-type glioma cells or no treatment. Since leucocyte transpedesis into the tumour can be anticipated to depend on the state of vascularization, we have mapped the development of microvessels in the tumour in parallel with the leucocyte infiltration. Our results show that microvessels start to form at day 7 and then gradually increase in number and size, indicating the establishment of an extensive vascularization by day 24. Leucocyte infiltration displays a biphasic pattern after tumour grafting. We have therefore studied the infiltration kinetics after an early immunization (1 day after intracerebral isografting) and compared the effects with those of a late immunization (10 days after intracerebral isografting) with N32-IFN gamma or wild-type N32. Our results show (1) an early infiltration of granulocytes 3 days after isografting; (2) a T-cell-receptor-positive (TCR+) T-cell infiltration starting on day 10; (3) a macrophage infiltration starting on day 13; (4) a CD8+ cell infiltration starting on day 13. The proportions of TCR+ T cells, CD8+ cells and natural killer cells differs significantly between animals immunized with N32-IFN gamma and those receiving wild-type N32, when analysed 14 days after immunization at day 10. This difference can only be detected when animals are immunized at later stages of tumour growth. We propose that this could depend on an early-immunization-independent leucocyte infiltration during tumour establishment.

All were stage V in the Duparc classification. We call them \"pied de mine\" fractures as they resembled those described in military reports. Half of them (16 cases; 54%) were open fractures. All patients suffered multiple injuries and 12 had a psychiatric history. These fractures were associated with spinal fracture in 17 cases (73%) and half had neurologic deficit, limb fracture in 16 (73%), and pelvic fracture in 12 (52%). The most frequent associated foot injuries were a talus fracture in 9 cases (29%) and Chopart displacement in 10 cases (32%). Clinical evaluation used the Maryland foot score, foot print and radiologic evaluation with lateral retrotibial view.\nMean follow-up was 35 months. Mean Maryland foot score was 62.7 and 13 cases were pain free. Pain was due to conflict with the lateral malleolus, bony plantar thorns, medial malleolus and subtalar osteoarthritis. Orthopedic shoes were used 11 times. The other patients used sports shoes. Subtalar mobility was most frequently absent (23/29 cases, 2 amputations). Foot print showed 13/16 flat feet; 6 thorns were indirectly visible. Two patients had retraction toes and were initially treated by external fixation. Radiologic evaluation showed 23/29 complete subtalar arthrodeses, 23/29 migration of the great tuberosity, often(17/23 cases) associated with varus angulation. Eleven patients needed subsequent surgery: 5 for arthrodeses and 6 for resection of bony thorns. Rate of complication was high, especially for open fractures: 2 infections for 15 closed fractures, and 8 infections (50%) for 16 open fractures with 2 cases of chronic osteitis. Secondary amputation was required in 2/31 cases due to sepsis. TREATMENT PROPOSITIONS: For closed calcaneum burst fractures, it is better to wait one week before osteosynthesis. This delay is used to decrease edema with limb elevation and compressive bandaging. Skin tension due to trauma is increased by edema and osteosynthesis gives a high risk of wound disunion. We recommend reduction and Y-plate fixation even for burst fracture. Reduction must lower the tuberosity and correct the varus. After surgery, subtalar spontaneous arthrodesis is usually observed in a good position. Any bony plantar thorn must be resected. For open calcaneum burst fracture, the risk of sepsis is high. First treatment is debridement, stabilization and external fixation with antibiotic therapy. Stabilization should improve vascularization and facilitate internal fixation. The external fixation can be placed on the medial side to free the lateral approach to the calcaneum. Flap repair can be performed after one week when skin tension has subsided and areas of necrosis controlled.", "journal": "Revue de chirurgie orthopedique et reparatrice de l'appareil moteur", "date": "2000-07-06", "authors": ["ECastel", "JBenazet", "RTrabelsi", "CLaporte", "CSamaha", "GSaillant"], "doi": null}

However, healing of full-thickness skin wounds was greatly delayed in TSP-1 transgenic mice and was associated with reduced granulation tissue formation and highly diminished wound angiogenesis. Moreover, TSP-1 potently inhibited fibroblast migration in vivo and in vitro.

Nude mice inoculated with these cells were treated with 30 mg / kg of TNP-470 subcutaneously every other day. At this dose, TNP-470 only significantly suppressed the growth of H226Br tumor, but not H226B tumor. Attempts to use a high dose of TNP-470 (100 mg / kg) resulted in a severe loss of body weight. Immunohistochemical studies showed marked tumor vascularization in H226Br tumor, but the formation of new blood vessels was suppressed by 30 mg / kg of TNP-470.

Mutation of many genes in mice results in embryonic mortality or fetal growth restriction due to defects in placental development. Several important principles about placental development have emerged from these studies. First, distinct molecular pathways regulate the differentiation of the various trophoblast cell subtypes. Second, trophoblast proliferation, differentiation and morphogenesis are highly regulated by interactions with adjacent cell types.

The etiology of KS appears to be linked to activation of a latent HHV8 infection. Sporadic and iatrogenic KS are slow progressing lesions that can undergo spontaneous regression. In contrast, KS, which is frequently associated with HIV infection, is found in a highly aggressive form in AIDS patients. The HIV-1 Tat has been shown to activate the VEGF receptor KDR in endothelial and KS spindle cells, suggesting this HIV protein could contribute to KS pathogenesis. We used primary 'reactive' KS cell culture from sporadic and epidemic KS, and an immortal KS-line (KS-Imm) isolated in our laboratory from a iatrogenic KS lesion, to verify if Tat-induced cell signaling is able to mediate cellular responses. We demonstrate that KS cells migrated in response to Tat and that VEGF is able to compete with the Tat chemotactic activity towards these cells. A function-blocking anti-KDR antibody was able to abrogate both VEGF and Tat-induced KS chemotactic response, indicating a direct involvement of this receptor.

The model exhibits a fractal scaling in the dispersion of the regional flow in the branches. Experimentally measurable fractal dimension of the relative dispersion in regional flow is analytically calculated in terms of the asymmetry and the variance at local bifurcation; hence the model suggests a powerful method to obtain the physiological information on local flow bifurcation in terms of flow dispersion analysis. Both the fractal behavior and the lognormal distribution are intimately related to the fact that it is the logarithm of flow, rather than flow itself, which is the natural variable in the tree models. The kinetics of tracer washout is also discussed in terms of the lognormal distribution.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2000-06-30", "authors": ["HQian", "J BBassingthwaighte"], "doi": "10.1006/jtbi.2000.2060"}

In order to clarify the arterial supply of this muscle column, we studied 28 adult hearts, free of any signs of coronary disorder. The path of the moderator band artery was followed by means of microdissection, and we studied the source, course, and interconnections made with other arteries. We observed that the source of the moderator band artery lies in the first three anterior septal arteries, most often in the second one. In relation to the short axis of the heart, the artery of the moderator band can either follow a horizontal path to the septal papillary muscle of the right ventricle or an oblique route to the moderator band, depending on the position of its source. In all the hearts studied, the moderator band artery made anastomotic connections at the base of the anterior papillary muscle of the right ventricle with various branches of the right coronary artery, which means that it can play a key role in collateral circulation following obstruction of the epicardium coronary arteries.", "journal": "Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2000-06-29", "authors": ["JReig", "NAlbert\u00ed", "MPetit"], "doi": "10.1002/1098-2353(2000)13:4<244::AID-CA3>3.0.CO;2-H"}
{"title": "Inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in in situ and invasive breast carcinomas.", "abstract": "In this investigation, we studied the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and its association to apoptosis and angiogenesis in 43 in situ and 68 invasive breast carcinomas. Its expression was studied immunohistochemically using a polyclonal iNOS antibody, and the staining was evaluated both in tumor and stromal cells. Apoptosis was detected by 3' end labeling of fragmented DNA (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling method). Vascularization was detected immunohistochemically using an antibody to the FVIII-related antigen, and calculated microvessel densities were determined. In addition to strong iNOS expression in stromal cells, iNOS positivity was observed in tumor cells in 46.5% of in situ and 58.8% of invasive carcinomas. In invasive carcinomas, there were more cases with iNOS positivity both in tumor and stromal cells compared to in situ carcinomas (0.007). The proportion of cases with iNOS-positive tumor cells increased in in situ carcinomas from grade I to III (20.0%, 46.2%, and 73.3%). In invasive ductal carcinomas, there were more cases with iNOS-positive tumor cells than with in situ carcinomas (P = 0.04). Carcinomas with both iNOS-positive tumor and stromal cells had a higher apoptotic index (P = 0.02) and a higher calculated microvessel densities index (P = 0.02). A high number of iNOS-positive stromal cells associated with metastatic disease (P = 0.05). The results show that breast carcinoma cells, in addition to stromal cells, express iNOS and are capable of producing NO. Carcinomas with iNOS-positive tumor and stromal cells have a higher apoptotic indices and increased vascularization, suggesting that iNOS contributes to promotion of apoptosis and angiogenesis in breast carcinoma. The association of the number of iNOS-positive stromal cells with metastatic disease might be attributable to stimulation of angiogenesis, resulting in a higher vascular density and consequently a higher probability for tumor cells to invade.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2000-06-29", "authors": ["MVakkala", "KKahlos", "ELakari", "PP\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6", "VKinnula", "YSoini"], "doi": null}

One possible solution to the organ shortage is the use of renal xenografts. However, the transplantation of xenografts is complicated by hyperacute and acute rejection. It has been postulated that the host immune response might be attenuated following the transplantation of renal precursor cells or embryonic kidneys (metanephroi) instead of developed (adult) kidneys. Transplanted metanephroi become chimeric organs in that their blood supply originates, at least in part, from the host. It is possible to transplant a developing metanephros, without the use of immunosuppression, from one rat to another.

A histologic evaluation was also undertaken. Findings demonstrated that there is a close vascular connection between the crural fascial-linked section of the plantaris tendon and the posterior tibial artery. Through its rich surrounding paratenon, the blood supply of the tendon is provided by two to four transfascial branches of the posterior artery in the lower-middle portion of the leg. Out of these branches, one or two anastomosing arteries (more than 1.0 mm in diameter), together with accompanying veins, consistently emerge 5 to 8 cm from the insertion of the plantaris tendon. Histologic observations demonstrate the reliable vascularity of the paratenon and crural fascia. The authors consider this vascularized tendon donor a good option for grafting.

{"title": "Lateral arm fascial flap: microarterial anatomy and potential clinical applications.", "abstract": "Previously, muscle flaps and the omentum have been used to indirectly vascularize tissues. Induction of synangiogenesis, or indirect vascularization through the formation of collateral vessels, occurs through the development of vascular connections at the interface between the donor and recipient tissues. Unfortunately, muscle and omental flaps are bulky and, when used to salvage ischemic hands and digits, may limit digital range of motion. Additionally, disadvantages to using omentum include a requirement for an intraabdominal procedure and a lack of subsequent donor tissue if the contralateral limb becomes involved at a later time. The purpose of this anatomic study was to develop a customized lateral arm fascial flap (LAFF) which may be used for flap prefabrication or synangiogenesis of non-bypassable ischemia. Detailed anatomic dissections were performed to more thoroughly define the microvascular anatomy of the LAFF. Computer analysis of the data was performed to demonstrate the potential clinical application of using the LAFF. Dissections revealed a consistent pattern of vessels branching within the lateral arm fascia and to the neighboring musculature. In order to optimize the surgical use of available tissue, computer-aided design techniques were used to model a reliable fascial free flap for inducing synangiogenesis while imparting minimal donor-site morbidity. Anatomic studies of the LAFF revealed pitfalls in flap dissection, while computer-generated models illustrated the detailed microarterial anatomy of the LAFF and potential limitations in flap design.

Immunocytochemistry staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization allowed characterization of isolated cancer cells.\nTerminal cells can be divided into 3 classes: 1) large, buoyant, fragile cells with a large nucleus that were captured in a 1.068 g/mL gradient; 2) enucleate cells (4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI] negative) that were positive for cytokeratin and PSMA antibodies; and 3) cellular debris exhibiting cytokeratin and PSMA positive staining as well as nuclear debris identified by DAPI staining, which included cytoplasmic debris. Growing cells also exhibited three morphologic characteristics: those possessing stem cell-like morphology and characteristics such as small size, high density, developed cytokeratin systems, PSMA expression, and aneuploidy; those in M phase; and cell clusters. The majority of isolated cells exhibited intermediate characteristics and thus comprised the third group of circulating cancer cells.\nAlthough the significance of the cluster remains undetermined, observation suggests that the cluster has the ability to circulate as a microtumor and subsequently arrest in the small veins and capillaries. It is hypothesized that the clusters could escape certain facets of immune surveillance and possibly gain a selective growth advantage over single cells in a distant site.

It is not known whether FasL and TNFalpha, expressed by the recipient's lymphoid or nonlymphoid cells, are essential for the apoptosis of alloreactive T lymphocytes and the induction of allograft acceptance.\nWe compared the survival of fully allogeneic vascularized cardiac allografts between wild-type (wt) and FasL-mutant (gld) recipient mice. In addition, we studied cardiac allograft survival in gld mice injected with TNFalpha-neutralizing antibody. Allograft acceptance (graft survival >100 days) was induced by treating the recipients with CTLA4Ig, a recombinant fusion protein that blocks B7-CD28 T cell costimulation. In vivo alloantigen-driven apoptosis of mature CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes was analyzed in mice repeatedly stimulated with allogeneic splenocytes.\nWe found that CTLA4Ig induces 100% long-term acceptance of cardiac allografts in wt and gld mice. Similarly, CTLA4Ig induced 100% allograft acceptance in gld recipients injected with TNFalpha-neutralizing antibody. In vivo alloantigen-driven apoptosis of mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was significantly reduced in gld mice and in wt mice treated with anti-TNFalpha antibody. However, neutralizing TNFalpha activity in gld mice failed to abrogate alloantigen-driven T cell apoptosis.\nThese data indicate that: (1) FasL and TNFalpha expression are not obligatory for the induction of long-term allograft acceptance by CTLA4Ig and (2) FasL- and TNFalpha-independent death pathways contribute to alloantigen-driven T cell apoptosis.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2000-06-27", "authors": ["M EWagener", "B TKonieczny", "ZDai", "G HRing", "F GLakkis"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200006150-00037"}
{"title": "A new method for reconstruction of the larynx after vertical partial resections.", "abstract": "The indications and problems of organ-preserving vertical partial laryngectomy (VPL) in cases of T1b glottic or T2 glottic and subglottic cancers are well known. The first and imperative requirement for the surgeon is adequate resection of tumor while the second prerequisite is the safe and successful correction of the excised portion of the anterolateral wall of the larynx. Since reconstruction of the defect can cause significant challenges for surgeons, the main requirements are an adequate lumen for breathing, a smooth surface for epithelialization, voice restoration and good deglution. Krajina's method for reconstruction of the larynx utilizes pedicled sternohyoid fascia, which is thin, elastic, well adaptable to defects, and resistent to infection or saliva. By providing a large surface for covering defects, granulations and synechiae can be prevented. We now use the superficial fascia colli as a new method for reconstruction of laryngeal defects after frontolateral partial resections. The technique was first refined experimentally in dogs. A Leroux-Robert partial laryngectomy was carried aut on five animals and laterally pedicled fascia was sutured to the edge of the defect created. At 2-week intervals through 8 weeks after the operation fixation, vascularization and epithelialization were examined histologically. To date, clinical reconstruction with the fascial flap has been used in 29 cases. Because the flap has a very low metabolism, no necrosis was seen. Functional results of respiration, phonation and swallowing have been good. These findings show that laterally pedicled fascia with the bipedicled sternohyoid muscles can play an important role in laryngeal reconstruction.", "journal": "European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery", "date": "2000-06-27", "authors": ["JEl\u00f3", "EHorv\u00e1th", "RK\u00e9sm\u00e1rszky"], "doi": "10.1007/s004050050224"}
{"title": "Apolipoprotein E gene expression correlates with endogenous lipid nutrition and yolk syncytial layer lipoprotein synthesis during fish development.", "abstract": "During embryogenesis of teleost fish, the formation of a yolk syncytial layer (YSL) enables the resorption of the yolk reserves and development up to the larval stage. We have examined the changes of the yolk cell structure in relation to yolk and oil-globule lipid utilization during development of the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). After encapsulation by the YSL, resorption of the single, large oil globule occurred predominantly after yolk resorption and was slower in fasting larvae. The YSL was in contact with an enlarged perisyncytial space, but no vascular network or red blood cells were present within the walls of the yolk sac. Intrasyncytial channels infiltrated by pigmented lining cells were observed in the YSL surrounding the oil globule. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) has a prominent role in lipid metabolism because of its ability to interact with lipoprotein receptors. We performed molecular cloning of the putative low-density lipoprotein-receptor binding domain of turbot apoE. In situ hybridization analysis revealed a very high level of apoE transcripts in the YSL, while no expression could be detected in the intestine. YSL apoE expression was correlated with the synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. An extraordinarily high number of VLDL particles were poured into the perisyncytial space, and intrasyncytial channels enabled the transfer of yolk- and oil globule-derived lipids to the developing embryo or larva. The pattern of apoE mRNA distribution in relation to YSL lipoprotein synthesis indicates that apoE expression is a suitable molecular marker for monitoring endogenous lipid nutrition during the endoexotrophic period of teleost fish development.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2000-06-27", "authors": ["GPoupard", "MAndr\u00e9", "MDurliat", "CBallagny", "GBoeuf", "P JBabin"], "doi": "10.1007/s004419900158"}

To investigate the possible role of these factors in corneal neovascularization we have analysed the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and VEGF in a rat model of inflammation-associated corneal neovascularization. In this model, corneal neovascularization was induced in Long-Evans rats by krypton laser photocoagulation whereafter eyes were enucleated at 1, 4, 7, 10 and 20 days. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy and histologic analysis revealed a gradual development of corneal neovascularization that peaked 7-10 days after treatment when newly formed vessels could be seen throughout the corneal surface reaching deep into the stroma. Antisense and sense riboprobes were generated using DNA complementary to MMP-2, MMP-9 and VEGF, and mRNA expression was analysed using in situ hybridization. The expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in untreated corneas was low or absent whereas VEGF was weakly expressed in the corneal epithelium. MMP-2 expression was increased during corneal neovascularization and was mainly localized to the cells infiltrating areas of new vessel formation. Many of these cells appeared to be inflammatory cells.

However, evidence suggests that the growth fraction increases and the cell-loss factor decreases as the tumor shrinks. We investigate whether this evolution in tumor geometry, as well as the irregular time intervals between fractions in conventional hyperfractionation schemes, can be exploited by fractionation schedules that employ time-varying fraction sizes.\nWe construct a mathematical model of a spherical tumor with a hypoxic core and a viable rim, which is most appropriate for a prevascular tumor, and is only a caricature of a vascularized tumor. This model is embedded into the traditional linear-quadratic model by assuming instantaneous reoxygenation. Dynamic programming is used to numerically compute the fractionation regimen that maximizes the tumor-control probability (TCP) subject to constraints on the biologically effective dose of the early and late tissues.\nIn several numerical examples that employ five or 10 fractions per week on a 1-cm or 5-cm diameter tumor, optimally varying the fraction sizes increases the TCP significantly. The optimal regimen incorporates large Friday (afternoon, if 10 fractions per week) fractions that are escalated throughout the course of treatment, and larger afternoon fractions than morning fractions.\nNumerical results suggest that a significant increase in tumor cure can be achieved by allowing the fraction sizes to vary throughout the course of treatment.

Because such a distinction is not possible at fine-needle aspiration, surgery is often necessary. Clinical information such as age, sex, and node size is important in case of suspected carcinoma. Follicular carcinoma is characterized by capsular invasion, vascular invasion, and metastatic dissemination mainly by the hematogenic pathway. This invasion depends on collagen degradation in capsule and in subendothelial basement membrane. Collagen degradation has been widely researched in the angiogenesis process and in the hematogenic dissemination mechanism. In this study, we performed clinical and histopathologic assessment of 74 follicular neoplasms, as well as immunohistochemical reactions for CD-34 protein to estimate angiogenesis and for metalloproteinase-9, an enzyme that degrades type IV collagen.\nThe research was carried out retrospectively in 74 patients who had surgery and were followed up at HC-FMUSP and IBCC. Clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical variables were compared among the groups of follicular neoplasms and a control group of 36 patients with colloid goiter.\nNo significant statistical difference was found between patients with follicular adenoma and thyroid follicular carcinoma concerning sex (p =.092), age (p =.098), thyroid node size (p =.426), vascularization (p =.388), and immunostaining intensity for metalloproteinase-9 (p =.055).

{"title": "The peripapillary glia of the optic nerve head in the chicken retina.", "abstract": "The eye of reptiles and birds is characterized by an avascular retina and a vascular convolute called conus papillaris in reptiles and pecten oculi in birds which arises from the papilla nervi optici (PNO) or optic nerve head into the vitreous. At least in birds, this central part of the retina is the site of a heterogeneous population of glial cells. M\u00fcller cells reside in the retina, astrocytes in the optic nerve, and pecteneal glial cells in the pecten. The latter are developmentally related to the pigment epithelial cells. In addition to these established types of cells, there is a population of glial cells lining the base of the pecten oculi. In the present study, we investigated both the morphology and the development of these glial cells of the PNO in a series of chicken embryos. These cells were called peripapillary glial cells. They were characterized by their morphology and by their spatiotemporal expression of antigens typical of glial cells (intermediate filaments and glutamine synthetase). They reside at the border between the retina and the optic nerve and at the innermost border of the ventricular cleft representing transitional forms among M\u00fcller cells, astrocytes, and pigment epithelial cells. The developmental data suggest a migration of the perikarya of the peripapillary glia in vitread direction, which may coincide with that of the pecteneal glia. Whereas the pecteneal glial cells differentiate morphologically from E16 on, the peripapillary glia retain characteristics of radial glia by spanning the distance from the vitreous to the ventricular cleft.

Thirty-six male Wistar rats aged 6 weeks were used in the study. For twelve months 24 of them drank only 25% ethanol--12 starting at 6-week-age and 12 at 3-month-age. The control group of 12 rats drank only water. As an effect of long-term ethanol exposure on hippocampal capillaries we observed the increase in the terminal vessel diameter and the decrease in microvascular length, surface, and volume densities. These changes varied between different age groups and between particular hippocampal regions. The observed age and regional differentiation of ethanol-related microvascular changes did not correlate well with the damaging effects of alcohol on corresponding neuronal elements, which emphasizes the very complicated pathogenesis of ethanol-induced injuries.", "journal": "Folia morphologica", "date": "2000-06-22", "authors": ["MKraszpulski", "CTukaj", "TWrzo\u0142kowa"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Hyaluronic acid as an anti-angiogenic shield in the preovulatory rat follicle.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis in the preovulatory follicle is confined to the theca cell layers, and penetration of capillaries through the basement membrane into the granulosa cell layers does not occur until after ovulation. However, elevated expression of the angiogenic growth factor (VEGF) has been reported in the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte, which are expelled from the follicle during ovulation. This spatial and temporal discrepancy between VEGF expression and angiogenesis was studied here in the rat ovarian follicle, and we showed that cumulus cells secrete to the follicular fluid, in addition to VEGF, material with antiangiogenic activity that blocks endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and capillary formation in vitro. Hyaluronic acid produced by the cumulus cells can account for this antiangiogenic activity. Degradation of hyaluronic acid by hyaluronidase restored proliferation and migration of endothelial cells directed toward the cumulus. Inhibition of hyaluronic acid synthesis with 6-diazo-5-oxo-1-norleucine restored endothelial proliferation and migration in vitro, and it also resulted in early penetration of capillaries across the follicular basement membrane in vivo. These results support the role of hyaluronic acid produced by the cumulus cells as a high-molecular-weight, antiangiogenic shield that prevents premature vascularization of the preovulatory follicle by blocking endothelial cell migration and proliferation.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2000-06-22", "authors": ["CTempel", "AGilead", "MNeeman"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod63.1.134"}

The internal surface of the air-bladder is highly vascularized, illustrating possible utilization as an accessory respiratory organ. The wall of the bladder consists of five distinct tissue layers. From the outer to the inner surfaces are: a squamous, undifferentiated epithelial cell; a collagen-elastic tissue space; a smooth muscle tissue band; an inner connective tissue space; and columnar gas-gland cells projecting into the lumen. The cell membrane over the perikarya of the gas-gland cells was sporadically broken. The disruptions were ascribed to possible physical damage by discharging gas-bubbles. Juxtaluminally, the gas-gland cells attached across tight junctions. The cells have highly euchromatic nuclei and conspicuously large intracytoplasmic secretory bodies. On the blood capillary facing (basal) aspect, the cell membrane of the gas-gland cells is highly amplified. The cells insert onto a smooth muscle tissue band. The morphological features and the topographical arrangement of the gas-gland cells in O. a. grahami are indicative of an operative exchange of materials between them and the underlying tissue components especially the blood capillaries. For a fish that subsists in hot, highly saline and alkaline water heavily invested by avian predators and where the partial pressure of oxygen diurnally shifts from virtual anoxia to hyperoxia, development of a versatile air-bladder for efficient buoyancy control conforms to the functional demands placed on it by a unique environment. Illustratively, instead of the gas-gland morphology in O. a. grahami resembling that in the freshwater fishes, the group from which the fish has evolved, it compares more closely to that of the marine fish. This similarity suggests amazing parallel evolutionary adaptation to biophysically corresponding aquatic milieus.", "journal": "Tissue & cell", "date": "2000-06-16", "authors": ["J NMaina"], "doi": "10.1054/tice.2000.0094"}
{"title": "Angiogenesis in the corpus luteum.", "abstract": "The ovarian corpus luteum plays a critical role in reproduction because it is the primary source of circulating progesterone. After ovulation, as the corpus luteum forms from the wall of the ruptured follicle, it grows and vascularizes extremely rapidly. In fact, the rates of tissue growth and angiogenesis in the corpus luteum rival those of even the fastest growing tumors. Thus, the corpus luteum provides an outstanding model for studying the factors that regulate the angiogenic process, which is critical for normal tissue growth, development, and function. In agreement with data from other tissues, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) seem to be a major angiogenic factor responsible for vascularization of the developing corpus luteum. Recent data suggest that luteal expression of VEGF occurs primarily in specific perivascular cells, including arteriolar smooth muscle and capillary pericytes, and is regulated primarily by oxygen levels. In addition, soon after ovulation, pericytes derived from the thecal compartment appear to be the first vascular cells to invade the developing luteal parenchyma. The granulosa-derived cells produce a factor that stimulates pericyte migration. Moreover, nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator and can stimulate VEGF production and angiogenesis, is expressed in endothelial cells of luteal arterioles and capillaries, often in association with expression of VEGF by luteal perivascular cells. Thus, we have proposed a model for the initial process of luteal vascularization in which hypoxia plays a major role. In this model, which we believe will apply to other tissues as well, a paracrine loop exists between the vascular endothelial cells, which produce NO, and the peri-endothelial cells (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes), which produce VEGF, to ensure coordinate regulation of luteal vasodilation and angiogenesis.", "journal": "Endocrine", "date": "2000-06-16", "authors": ["L PReynolds", "A TGrazul-Bilska", "D ARedmer"], "doi": "10.1385/ENDO:12:1:1"}

As Tie-2((-/-)) mice exhibit growth retardation and vascular network malformation, the expression of Tie-2 and its ligands, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), were investigated in human placenta from normal pregnancies and those complicated by severe IUGR. Ribonucleotide protection assays showed no significant change in the expression of Ang-2 mRNA between gestationally matched normal and IUGR placentas; however, immunoblots revealed that Ang-2 protein was significantly decreased in IUGR, suggesting that this may contribute to the abnormal development of the villous vasculature. In situ hybridization studies showed that Ang-1 and Tie-2 were detected in the cyto/syncytiotrophoblast bilayer in first-trimester placenta, whereas Ang-2 mRNA was restricted to the cytotrophoblast, suggesting their role in trophoblast function. At term, Ang-1 mRNA and immunoreactive protein were restricted to the paravascular tissues of the primary stem villi, supporting its role in vessel maturation. In contrast, Ang-2 was expressed throughout the term villous core, perhaps to permit the developing placental vascular network to remain in a state of fluidity. As these studies also revealed that trophoblast, in addition to endothelial cells, expressed Tie-2 receptors, we investigated the potential role of Ang-1/Ang-2 on trophoblast proliferation, migration, and the release of NO. Using spontaneously transformed first-trimester trophoblast cell lines that exhibit cytotrophoblast-like (ED(27)) and extravillous trophoblast-like (ED(77)) properties, we show that the addition of Ang-2 (250 ng/ml) stimulated DNA synthesis in ED(27) trophoblast cells and triggered the release of NO. Ang-1 stimulated trophoblast (ED(77)) migration in a dose-dependent manner that was inhibited by recombinant Tie-2-FC.

Finally, the intragraft profile of cytokines was altered in class II- allografts, with significantly reduced expression of Th2 cytokine mRNA compared to controls.\nThese results support a role of MHC class II antigens in the kidney regulating immune cells within the graft.

Mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene predispose individuals to highly vascularized tumors. However, VHL-deficient mice die in utero due to a lack of vascularization in the placenta. To resolve the contradiction, we cloned the Drosophila VHL homologue (d-VHL) and studied its function. It showed an overall 50% similarity to the human counterpart and 76% similarity in the crucial functional domain: the elongin C binding site. The putative d-VHL protein can bind Drosophila elongin C in vitro. During embryogenesis, d-VHL is expressed in the developing tracheal regions where tube outgrowth no longer occurs. Reduced d-VHL activity (using RNA interference methodology) caused breakage of the main vasculature accompanied by excessive looping of smaller branches, whereas over-expression caused a general lack of vasculature. Importantly, human VHL can induce the same gain-of-function phenotypes. VHL is likely involved in halting cell migration at the end of vascular tube outgrowth. Loss of VHL activity can therefore lead to disruption of major vasculature (as in the mouse embryo), which requires precise cell movement and tube fusion, or ectopic outgrowth from existing secondary vascular branches (as in the adult tumors).

The aim of the study was to investigate the process of repopulation of bone marrow cavities and lymphoid organs of irradiated recipient by bone marrow cells from syngeneic hind limb transplant. Lewis rats received total body irradiation of 8 Gy followed by orthotopic transplantation of syngeneic limb or i.v. infusion of equivalent amount of bone marrow cells. In control experiments the hind limb was shielded with lead plate during total body irradiation. Ten days after irradiation and hind limb transplantation the yield of nucleated cells from tibia was reaching values of normal animals. In rats receiving i.v. bone marrow cell infusion it was 40% of control values and in rats repopulated from shielded own hind limb it was 60% of controls. In all groups a higher percentage of early and immediate normoblasts and a reduced pool of juvenile and segmented neutrophils was observed. Thirty days after irradiation and repopulation procedures all parameters were returning to normal levels in each group. The results indicate that bone marrow cell transplantation in hind limb graft is highly effective in lethally irradiated animals in reconstituting bone marrow.", "journal": "Annals of transplantation", "date": "2000-06-13", "authors": ["BLukomska", "SJanczewska", "MDurlik", "W LOlszewski"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Therapeutic efficacy of the suicide gene driven by the promoter of vascular endothelial growth factor gene against hypoxic tumor cells.", "abstract": "We examined whether herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene expression driven by the promoter of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene that is activated by hypoxia is effective in killing highly metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma A11 cells under hypoxic conditions. We isolated the promoter region encompassing the hypoxia response element (HRE) of the mouse VEGF gene. To assess the hypoxia responsiveness of the VEGF promoter, A11 cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids. Exposure of the transfectants to hypoxia resulted in a 2-3-fold induction of luciferase activity. Deletion of the HRE site abolished VEGF promoter activity under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We constructed a retroviral vector harboring the HSV-TK or green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene under the control of the VEGF promoter. A11 cells transfected with vector harboring the VEGF promoter fused to the HSV-TK gene [A11(HRE/TK) cells] were more sensitive to ganciclovir than cells transfected with the control vector harboring the VEGF promoter alone, and the sensitivity of the A11(HRE/TK) cells was increased by exposure to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation. Culturing A11 cells transfected with vector harboring the VEGF promoter fused to the GFP gene under hypoxic conditions resulted in an increase in the expression of GFP. Monitoring GFP expression and vascularity in the A11 transfectant tumors revealed up-regulation of GFP expression in poorly vascularized regions. Administration of ganciclovir to mice bearing s.c. tumors formed by A11(HRE/TK) cells resulted in regression of the tumors. These results suggest a possible application of the suicide gene driven by the VEGF promoter to cancer gene therapy that efficiently targets hypoxic tumor cells.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2000-06-13", "authors": ["NKoshikawa", "KTakenaga", "MTagawa", "SSakiyama"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Clinical governance and the vascular surgeon.", "abstract": "Audit of adverse outcome might allow identification of substandard surgical results. To test this hypothesis statistical modelling was applied to two indicator vascular procedures (elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and carotid endarterectomy) with accepted adverse event rates.\nBinomial statistical models for varying adverse event rates were constructed. A power calculation was used in an attempt to predict the case numbers required to determine substandard results for individual surgeons and vascular units. Two scenarios were considered: first a base adverse event rate of 6 per cent and surgical practice with 9, 12 and 24 per cent morbidity rates, and second a base adverse event rate of 3 per cent and surgical practice with 6, 9 and 12 per cent morbidity rates.\nA mean of 57 elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs and 70 carotid endarterectomies were performed per annum. The adverse event rate for both operations was 4 per cent. Power calculations revealed that 130 patients would need to be studied to detect a surgeon with an adverse event rate twice 6 per cent and over 280 patients would be required with an adverse event rate twice 3 per cent. To gather this number of patients 2 years of unit data and between 3 and 22 years of individual data would need to be studied for a base adverse event rate of 6 per cent. A base rate of 3 per cent requires 7-47 years for an individual and 4-65 years for the unit. With a base adverse event rate of 6 per cent, detection of widely variant surgical practice (four times the morbidity rate as base) requires only 21 procedures.\nStatistical modelling demands assumptions about accepted adverse event rates, confidence criteria and what constitutes substandard results.

Changes in pulmonary blood volumes, pulmonary transit times and the heterogeneity (coefficient of variation) of pulmonary transit times in man were measured using the first-pass radiotracer technique both at rest and during muscular exercise. Dichotomously branching and dispersive flow models of the lung vasculature were applied. The results showed that total pulmonary blood volume increased by 29%, total transit time decreased by 55% and the heterogeneity of pulmonary transit times decreased by 31% when blood flow increased threefold. All changes obeyed power law functions. The changes were greatest when blood flow increased from baseline to intermediate levels. Further increases in total blood flow were associated with decreases in transit times but not with more homogeneous distribution of transit times. The simulated results suggest that the transit time through the arterial vessels and the large veins have a negligible heterogeneity. Most of the variability of transit times through the lungs is due to the heterogeneity of the transit times through the capillaries and venules.", "journal": "Physiological measurement", "date": "2000-06-10", "authors": ["J TKuikka"], "doi": "10.1088/0967-3334/21/2/304"}
{"title": "A classification system and algorithm for reconstruction of maxillectomy and midfacial defects.", "abstract": "Maxillectomy defects become more complex when critical structures such as the orbit, globe, and cranial base are resected, and reconstruction with distant tissues becomes essential. This study reviews all maxillectomy defects reconstructed immediately using pedicled and free flaps to establish (1) a classification system and (2) an algorithm for reconstruction of these complex problems. Over a 5-year period, 60 flaps were used to reconstruct defects classified as the following: type I, limited maxillectomy (n = 7); type II, subtotal maxillectomy (n = 10); type IIIa, total maxillectomy with preservation of the orbital contents (n = 13); type IIIb, total maxillectomy with orbital exenteration (n = 18); and type IV, orbitomaxillectomy (n = 10). Free flaps (45 rectus abdominis and 10 radial forearm) were used in 55 patients (91.7 percent), and the temporalis muscle was transposed in five elderly patients who were not free-flap candidates. Vascularized (radial forearm osteocutaneous) bone flaps were used in four of the 60 patients (6.7 percent) and nonvascularized bone grafts in 17 (28.3 percent). Simultaneous reconstruction of the oral commissure using an Estandler procedure was performed in 10 patients with maxillectomy and through-and-through soft-tissue defects. Free-flap survival was 100 percent, with reexploration in five of 55 patients (9.1 percent) and partial-flap necrosis in one patient. Seven of the 60 patients (11.7 percent) had systemic complications, and four died within 30 days of hospitalization. Fifty patients had more than 6 months of follow-up with a mean time of 27.7 (+/- 15.6) months. Postoperative radiotherapy was administered in 32 of these patients (64.0 percent). Chewing and speech functions were assessed in 36 patients with type II, IIIa, and IIIb defects. A prosthetic denture was fixed in 15 of 36 patients (41.7 percent). Return to an unrestricted diet was seen in 16 patients (44.4 percent), a soft diet in 17 (47.2 percent), and a liquid diet in three (8.3 percent). Speech was assessed as normal in 14 of 36 patients (38.9 percent), near normal in 15 (41.7 percent), intelligible in six (16.7 percent), and unintelligible in one patient (2.8 percent). Globe and periorbital soft-tissue position was assessed in 14 patients with type I and IIIa defects. There were no cases of enophthalmos, and one patient had a mild vertical dystopia. Ectropion was observed in 10 of 14 patients (71.4 percent). Oral competence was considered good in all 10 patients with excision/reconstruction of the oral commissure; however, two patients (20 percent) developed microstomia after receiving radiotherapy. Aesthetic results were evaluated at least 6 months after reconstruction in 50 patients. They were good to excellent in 29 patients (58 percent) for whom cheek skin and lip were not resected, and poor to fair (42 percent) when the external skin or orbital contents were excised. Secondary procedures were required in 16 of 50 patients (32.0 percent). Free-tissue transfer provides the most effective and reliable form of immediate reconstruction for complex maxillectomy defects. The rectus abdominis and radial forearm flaps in combination with immediate bone grafting or as osteocutaneous flaps reliably provide the best aesthetic and functional results.

We have studied the expression of a panel of angiogenic factors, and of the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin, in a panel of human melanoma cell lines giving rise to xenografts with different vascular densities. Angiogenic-factor expression was analyzed in vitro (cell lines) and in vivo (xenografts), both at mRNA (RT-PCR and Northern blot) and at protein level (ELISA and Western blot). In vitro angiostatin generation was assessed by Western-blot analysis. Expression of bFGF and VEGF was clearly correlated with a high degree of vascularization, confirming the importance of these factors for tumor angiogenesis. In addition, there was exclusive or elevated in vitro expression of angiogenic factors IL-8, PDGF-AB, and, to a lesser extent, midkine in cell lines that formed highly vascularized tumors. A similar angiogenic-factor-expression pattern was found in the corresponding xenografts, with the exception of VEGF. In most cell lines, this factor had low expression in vitro which was strongly enhanced in vivo. Although all 8 melanoma cell lines were able to excise the angiostatin fragment from the plasminogen parent molecule in vitro, cell lines BLM and M14 showed the most potent angiostatin generation. In vitro angiostatin generation by cell lysates prepared from melanoma xenografts was comparable in all xenograft types. Thus, in our model system we found no correlation between angiostatin generation and vascular density. Our study has limited the number of pro-angiogenic factors that may be involved in melanoma angiogenesis, and provides evidence for the notion that regulation of tumor angiogenesis is dependent on multiple factors.

Transgenic mice expressing ORF74 under control of the CD2 promoter develop highly vascularized Kaposi's sarcoma-like tumors. Through targeted mutagenesis we here create three distinct phenotypes of ORF74: a receptor with normal, high constitutive signaling through the phospholipase C pathway but deprived of binding and action of chemokines obtained through deletion of 22 amino acids from the N-terminal extension; an ORF74 with high constitutive activity but with selective elimination of stimulatory regulation by angiogenic chemokines obtained through substitution of basic residues at the extracellular ends of TM-V or TM-VI; and an ORF74 lacking constitutive activity but with preserved ability to be stimulated by agonist chemokines obtained through introduction of an Asp residue on the hydrophobic, presumed membrane-exposed face of TM-II. It is concluded that careful molecular dissection can selectively eliminate either agonist or inverse agonist modulation as well as high constitutive activity of the virally encoded oncogene ORF74 and that these mutant forms presumably can be used in transgenic animals to identify the molecular mechanism of its transforming activity.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2000-06-08", "authors": ["M MRosenkilde", "T NKledal", "P JHolst", "T WSchwartz"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M003800200"}

The potency of acetylated, amidated PHSRN (Ac-PHSRN-NH(2)) is significantly increased, making it more active on a molar basis than the 120-kDa cell-binding domain of pFn. Arginine is important to this activity because PHSAN and PHSEN are inactive, as is a randomized sequence peptide, Ac-HSPNR-NH(2). One treatment with Ac-PHSRN-NH(2) stimulates reepithelialization and contraction of dermal wounds in healing-impaired, obese diabetic C57BL6/KsJ db/db mice. Wound closure is equally rapid in treated db/db and db/+ mice and may be more rapid than in untreated nondiabetic db/+ littermates. In contrast, treatment with either Ac-HSPNR-NH(2) or normal saline (NS) has no effect. Analysis of sectioned db/db wounds shows that, in contrast to treatment with Ac-HSPNR-NH(2) or NS, a single Ac-PHSRN-NH(2) treatment stimulates keratinocyte and fibroblast migration into wounds, enhances fibroplasia and vascularization in the provisional matrix, and stimulates the formation of prominent fibers that may be associated with wound contraction.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2000-06-07", "authors": ["D LLivant", "R KBrabec", "KKurachi", "D LAllen", "YWu", "RHaaseth", "PAndrews", "S PEthier", "SMarkwart"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI8527"}

Histological sections of the adrenocortical grafts were obtained on day 100.\nRecipients of syngeneic and Kb-transgenic grafts displayed pretransplant corticosterone levels on days 20, 50, and 100 and ACTH-stimulated serum corticosterone levels similar to those of controls on day 100 after adrenocortical transplantation. In contrast, in recipients of fully MHC-mismatched grafts, corticosterone excretion was significantly reduced. In this group, 4 of 7 mice did not survive. Syngeneic skin grafts survived indefinitely in recipients of syngeneic and Kb-transgenic adrenocortical grafts, whereas Kb-transgenic and fully MHC-mismatched skin grafts were acutely rejected.

The assumption has been that the immune response to such organs is initiated in the graft itself when recipient lymphocytes encounter foreign histocompatibility antigens presented by the graft's endothelial cells. In contrast to this view, we show here that cardiac allografts are accepted indefinitely in recipient mice that lack secondary lymphoid tissue, indicating that the alloimmune response to a vascularized organ transplant cannot be initiated in the graft itself.

In human placenta, IGF-II mRNA is expressed in chorionic mesoderm and first trimester villous cytotrophoblast, but not in syncytiotrophoblast. In contrast, in rhesus monkey placenta, IGF-II mRNA is expressed in syncytiotrophoblast but not in chorionic mesoderm. IGFBP-3 mRNA is present in the chorionic mesoderm of placental villi from both these species and may modulate IGF-II action through a paracrine mechanism. In rodent placentae, IGF-II mRNA is expressed both in fetal mesoderm and in the trophoblast of the placental labyrinth. In guinea pig, where IGFBP-5 mRNA is expressed in the marginal and interlobular syncytium and IGF-II mRNA in the labyrinth, interaction between IGF-II and IGFBP-5 mRNA may be involved in vascularization of the placenta by fetal vessels. In sheep placenta, IGF-II mRNA is expressed, not in the trophoblast layer, but in the fetal mesoderm immediately adjacent to it. In the basal plate of human, rhesus monkey and baboon placentae, extravillous trophoblasts express IGF-II mRNA and uterine decidual cells IGFBP 1-6 mRNAs. The inference is that there is interaction between IGF-II and IGFBPs at the maternal-fetal interface of the primate placenta during trophoblast invasion and decidualization. IGFBP-1 expressed by the decidua may also interact with alpha(5)beta(1)integrin expressed by the extravillous trophoblast. The placentae of rodents are also of the invasive type. Glycogen cells of the mouse placenta are analogous with human extravillous trophoblast and express IGF-II mRNA. However, expression of IGFBP mRNAs in the mouse, as in the guinea pig, is confined to non-decidualized endometrium and myometrium. IGF-II mRNA is strongly expressed by trophoblasts invading uterine vessels in human and guinea pig placentae. Interactions probably occur between IGF-II expressed by these trophoblasts and IGFBPs expressed in the vessel walls. However, it is possible that IGFBPs expressed by maternal vessels are associated with processes that are independent of trophoblast invasion. Thus, IGFBP-3 mRNA is highly expressed in the maternal blood vessels of the non-deciduate sheep placenta. Findings to date highlight the diversity in the expression of the IGF system among placentae of man and different laboratory animals, and even between closely related species.

The existence of vascularization at the periphery of the corneal stroma and the lack of a conspicuous Bowman's layer made it difficult to characterize morphologically the rabbit limbus with the light microscope.\nIt takes >14 days for a daughter cell to migrate from the basal stratum to the outermost layer of the epithelium. Labeled daughter cells were detected < or = 90 days in several layers of the corneal epithelium. Therefore it takes >2 weeks for the complete renewal of the epithelium.

Major limitations were anastomotic dehishence and stenosis, which were attributed to the poor epithelisation of the prosthetic graft. We developed a new tracheal prosthesis that has a viable lined and well-vascularized mucosa. The prosthesis consists of Prolene mesh reinforced with polypropylene rings, and is coated with gelatin. In addition, we lined the luminal surface of the prosthesis with transplanted autogenous oral mucosa and wrapped the prosthesis with greater omentum. Animal experiments were performed using 10 adult mongrel dogs. The transplanted mucosa and wrapped greater omentum tightly adhered to the prosthesis to make a single unit within two weeks. The mucosa survived well, was well vascularised by new vessels from greater omentum and showed normal histology. Complete surgical resection and replacement of a thoracic trachea (3 cm in length, 6 tracheal rings) were carried out in 2 dogs, which survived well with normal activity. We concluded that this highly biocompatible tracheal prosthesis could be very useful for step-wise reconstruction of tracheal defects.", "journal": "The International journal of artificial organs", "date": "2000-06-01", "authors": ["S WSuh", "JKim", "C HBaek", "HKim"], "doi": null}

Overall follow-up time corresponded to the follow-up time for patients who were alive and to the survival time for patients who had died, all of them expressed in months. Data included age, staging, histologic type, morphometric assessment of histologic features related to tumor (stroma and vascularization), and immunohistochemical detection of proliferation cell markers (Ki-67 protein and proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and p53 protein. The morphometric assessment was made by the point-counting procedure. Data analysis included Life Tables for Survival and Cox Regression models. Overall follow-up analysis showed that significant univariate predictors (P < .05) were T stage; N stage; tumor stromal proportion; and immunohistochemical indexes of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Ki-67, and p53 proteins. Variables that presented independent predictive value for overall follow-up with the multivariate model (P < .05) were sex, T stage, N stage, tumor stromal proportion, and immunohistochemical detection of p53 protein.

In vitro, the combination regimen was significantly (P < 0.001) more cytotoxic for human microcapillary endothelial cells than either treatment alone, whereas survival of C6 glioma cells was not affected in the conditions used. Radiotherapy and AdK3 gene delivery was then studied on well established C6 xenografts (165 +/- 70 mm(3)). In these tumors, AdK3 intratumoral injections had only a marginal effect. Interestingly, when experimental radiotherapy was added, significantly higher (P < 0.005), and possibly synergistic, antitumoral effects were observed that tightly correlated a marked decrease of intratumoral vascularization. The combination of radiotherapy and AdK3 intratumoral injections also revealed a significant (P < 0.05) inhibition of tumor growth as compared with either treatment alone for larger tumors (467 +/- 120 mm(3)).

{"title": "Utility of both muscle and fascia flaps in severe lower extremity trauma.", "abstract": "The evolving technology in trauma management today permits salvage of many severe lower extremity injuries previously even considered to be lethal. An essential component for any such treatment protocol must be adequate soft tissue coverage that often will use vascularized flaps. Traditionally, calf muscles have been used proximally and free flaps for the distal leg and foot. The reintroduction of reliable local fascia flaps has challenged this dictum, proving to be a simpler and yet versatile option.\nThe role of both muscle and fascia flaps in lower extremity injuries has been retrospectively reviewed from a 2-decade experience. Soft tissue deficits requiring some form of vascularized flap occurred in 160 limbs in 155 patients. The frequency of use of flap types, specific complications and benefits, effect of timing of wound closure, and rate of limb salvage were compared.\nInitial coverage after significant lower extremity trauma in these 160 limbs required 60 local muscle flaps, 50 local fascia flaps, and 74 free flaps. These flaps had been selected on a nonrandom basis according to wound location, its severity, and flap availability. Complications were directly related to the severity of injury, and for free flaps as a group (39%), although these were not independent variables. Local muscle (27%) or fascia flaps (30%) were similar with regard to this morbidity. Healing was more likely to be uneventful if coverage were accomplished during the acute period after injury, regardless of flap type. Muscle flaps were still used in two thirds of all cases, with the soleus muscle used as often for the distal leg as the mid-leg. Local fascia flaps were most valuable for smaller defects, especially in the distal leg or foot, and often as a reasonable alternative to a free flap.\nThe traditional role of the gastrocnemius muscles for flap coverage of knee and proximal leg defects and the soleus muscle for the middle third of the leg was reaffirmed. The soleus muscle often also reached distal leg defects as could local fascia flaps, where classically, otherwise, a free flap would have been necessary. The largest or most severe wounds, irrespective of limb location, required free flap coverage. Local fascia flaps proved to be a valuable alternative.", "journal": "The Journal of trauma", "date": "2000-05-24", "authors": ["G GHallock"], "doi": "10.1097/00005373-200005000-00016"}

The left axillary arteries (LAA) of nine Yucatan miniature swine were perfused with latex material to reveal the organization of the arterial blood supply to the TBM. Blood is supplied to the TBM by the main branches of the LAA. Some of the branches end in one of the four heads of the TBM. Other branches continue to bifurcate further and to supply blood to adjacent muscles. The feed arteries (FAs) arise as side-branches at regular distances from the branches of the LAA. The mean number of FAs per TBM was 109.7 and the mean diameter was 388 microns. The distribution of FAs to the muscle area is heterogenous. Most FAs penetrate the epimysium of the TBM on its medial aspect. It appears that more FAs come out of the branches of LAA that end in the TBM as compared to arteries which continue to bifurcate away from TBM. FA diameters were in the range of 300 microns.

The aim of this study is to analyze the three-dimensional vascularization of the human knee joint and to find out if there are any differences in the blood supply of the medial and lateral femoral condyles which may explain the preponderance of aseptic bone necrosis in the medial side.\nThe femoral arteries of 14 unfixed lower extremities have been injected with epoxy resin. After documentation of the extraosseous course of the blood vessels the bone was macerated with 10% formic acid. The insertions of tendons and ligaments were investigated by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\nThe arterial supply of the lateral femoral condyle originates from the upper lateral geniculate artery, the terminal ends of which penetrate the bone from lateral. Branches of the middle geniculate artery reach the bone from the medial wall of the intertubercular notch. The subchondral bone of the medial femoral condyle draws its blood supply mainly from the descending geniculate artery. Branches of the middle geniculate artery penetrate the medial femoral condyle only in the posterior part of the intercondylar fossa. These posterior vessels do not contribute to the supply of the subchondral bone. In the anterior part of the medial wall of the intercondylar fossa there is the wide femoral insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament. Injection techniques and immunohistochemical investigations show that the fibrocartilage of the chondral apophyseal insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament is avascular and acts as banier which impedes blood vessels to penetrate the bony surface in this region. The subchondral bone adjacent to the femoral insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament receives its blood supply from vessels that penetrate the bone at the medial wall of the medial femoral condyle. The blood vessels which supply the lateral parts of the medial condyle have the longest intraosseous course. The density of vessels within this region is largely reduced.\nThe region adjacent to the femoral insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament is the most frequent site for osteochondrosis dissecans in the knee joint.

In transplantation, the rejection of fully mismatched cardiac allografts by recipients depleted of CD8(+) T cells is characterized by the recruitment of eosinophils in the rejected organs. We show here that this intragraft eosinophilia is dependent on the production of IL-5 since hearts transplanted into IL-5-deficient recipients depleted of CD8(+) cells did not contain eosinophils. More importantly, allograft survival was significantly extended in these animals. In mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), the presence of CD8(+) T cells in the responding cell population inhibited the secretion of IL-5. This inhibition was IFN-gamma dependent since adding neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma antibodies induced the production of IL-5. Furthermore, spleen cells isolated from IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR)-deficient mice secreted IL-5 upon allogeneic stimulation in primary MLC. In vivo, eosinophilia was observed in allografts rejected by IFN-gammaR-deficient recipients. On the contrary, grafts rejected by IFN-gammaR-deficient mice treated with neutralizing anti-IL-5 antibodies did not exhibit eosinophilic infiltration.

{"title": "Nonadrenergic innervation of the rat laryngeal vasculature.", "abstract": "In order to gain a better understanding of the central and local control of laryngeal blood flow, the vascular innervation to the rat laryngeal muscles was examined. To visualize the vascular network, the animals were perfused with a gelatin/India ink solution. The larynges were removed and fixed. The superior laryngeal, cricothyroid, and inferior laryngeal arteries (all branch off the superior thyroid artery) were dissected in continuity into their respective muscles. Specimens were reacted in toto using immunohistochemical techniques for the presence of neuropeptide-Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS-1). Results show that all of the laryngeal vasculature is richly innervated by fibers containing these peptides. Qualitatively, the most prominent of these is NPY in association with the superior and the inferior laryngeal arteries, followed by VIP and NOS-1, and finally CGRP distributed equally on all the vessels. Immunopositive fibers are found along the entire course of the feeding arteries, beginning with the superior thyroid artery and continuing down to small arterioles into the terminal vascular beds. These peptides can act as vasodilators, vasoconstrictors, and/or neuromodulators and may work synergistically or antagonistically with other transmitters in controlling laryngeal blood flow. Their effects are dependent on the specific vascular bed in question, that is, in some areas they are vasodilators, in others vasoconstrictors, and in other neuromodulators.

{"title": "C-terminal parathyroid hormone-related protein increases vascular endothelial growth factor in human osteoblastic cells.", "abstract": "The N-terminal region of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) interacts with a common PTH/PTHrP receptor in osteoblasts. These cells synthesize PTHrP, but its role in bone turnover is unclear. Intermittent treatment with N-terminal PTHrP or PTH stimulates bone growth in vivo, possibly by increasing local bone factors. In addition, C-terminal PTHrP (107-139), which does not bind to the PTH/PTHrP receptor, appears to affect bone resorption in vivo and in vitro, although its effect on bone formation in vivo remains controversial. Bone angiogenesis is an often overlooked but critical event in the process of bone remodeling. Recently, PTH (1-34) has been shown to induce gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor, by osteoblastic cells. However, no data are available on the effect of PTHrP (107-139) on VEGF expression in these cells. Using semiquantitative reverse transcription followed by PCR, we found that PTHrP (107-139), between 10 nM and 1 pM, increased VEGF mRNA in human osteoblastic (hOB) cells from trabecular bone. This effect of this agonist, at 10 nM, was maximal (fivefold for VEGF(165), and twofold for VEGF(121), compared to control) within 1 to 4 h. This effect was similar to that induced by PTHrP (1-34) in these cells, as well as in human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells, using Northern blot analysis. Moreover, the effect of both peptides, added together at 100 pM, was not higher than that observed with each peptide alone in hOB cells. The effects of PTHrP (107-139) and that of PTHrP (1-34) were abolished by actinomycin D in hOB cells. In these cells, the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine, but not the protein kinase A inhibitor H89, inhibited the increase in VEGF mRNA induced by 10 nM PTHrP (107-139). PTHrP (107-139), at 10 nM, also stimulated cytosolic VEGF immunostaining in hOB cells, and VEGF secretion into the medium conditioned by hOB or MG-63 cells for 24 h, which was (ng/mg protein): 10 +/- 1 or 5 +/- 3 (control), respectively, and 21 +/- 1 or 11 +/- 2 (PTHrP [107-139]-stimulated), respectively. Furthermore, medium conditioned by these cells for 24 h in the presence of 10 nM PTHrP (107-139), with or without 10 nM PTHrP (1-34), increased about 30% bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAEC) growth at 48 h. This effect was inhibited by adding a specific anti-VEGF antibody to the BAEC incubation medium. These findings demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of PTHrP induces expression and secretion of VEGF, a main angiogenic factor, in hOB cells and MG-63 cells. This relationship between PTHrP and VEGF has potential implications for both bone vascularization and bone formation, and neoangiogenesis in PTHrP-producing tumors.", "journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "date": "2000-05-23", "authors": ["PedroEsbrit", "Maria VictoriaAlvarez-Arroyo", "FernandoDE Miguel", "OlgaMartin", "Maria EugeniaMartinez", "CarlosCaramelo"], "doi": "10.1681/ASN.V1161085"}

The nephrogenic pattern of Ang-2 was documented in a mouse strain that expresses the LacZ reporter gene driven by the Ang-2 promoter. Heterozygous animals were healthy with morphologically normal kidneys, and they were examined after X-gal staining. At embryonic days 10.5 (E10.5) and E12.0, transgene expression was absent in the mesonephros and metanephros. At E14.0, expression was noted in the metanephric artery and its major branches. At E19.0 and in neonatal kidneys, expression was maintained in larger renal artery branches, extending to arcuate and smaller cortical vessels. Histologically, transgene expression was located in multiple layers of vessel wall cells, extending further from the endothelium than alpha-smooth muscle actin. The mesangium of immature glomeruli also expressed LacZ. In the first 3 postnatal weeks, a new pattern became evident, with intense X-gal staining in the inner stripe of the outer medulla, where a subset of thin descending limbs of loops of Henle expressed the transgene. This dynamic and developmentally regulated pattern indicates that Ang-2 is an early marker of the renal pericyte and vascular smooth muscle lineage and is also an epithelial-derived growth factor.

We hypothesized that introduction of these molecules into cardiac allografts may block leukocyte infiltration into the grafts and prolong survival. Vascularized and nonvascularized cardiac allografts in mice were performed and plasmid DNA encoding vMIP-II, MC148 and/or vIL-10 was transferred into the allograft at the time of transplantation. Gene transfer of either vMIP-II or MC148 into cardiac allografts markedly prolonged graft survival. Combining gene transfer of either one of these chemokine antagonists with vIL-10 gene transfer, which has a mechanistically different immunosuppressive action, further enhanced graft survival. vMIP-II and MC148 gene transfer both resulted in a marked decrease of donor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) infiltrating the grafts and inhibited alloantibody production. These results demonstrate that plasmid-mediated gene transfer of virally encoded chemokine antagonists vMIP-II and MC148 can block donor-specific lymphocyte immunity within cardiac allografts and prolong graft survival.

{"title": "Role of blood vessels in producing pathological changes in the brain with Alzheimer's disease.", "abstract": "Vascular factors have been shown to be highly involved in the deposition of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the detailed mechanism remains unknown. Here, we showed that more numerous deposits of A beta 40 and A beta 42 in the brain were found in AD patients than in controls. Together with evidence of no difference in the level of A beta 40 and A beta 42 in sera between sporadic AD and controls, a certain dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier could induce an abnormal transport of A beta from sera to the parenchyma in AD. In addition, vascular A beta deposits and mature A beta plaques stained by Congo red in AD brains contained more A beta 40 than A beta 42, whereas Congo red-negative immature plaques mainly consisted of A beta 42. Our confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated an intimate relationship between A beta 40 and the vascular network. The amount of mature plaques but not that of immature plaques was reportedly correlated with the severity of dementia in AD patients. These results suggest that serum-derived A beta 40 and/or A beta 42 cause A beta 40 deposition in and around blood vessels through unknown but possible mechanisms such as (1) endocytosis of A beta 40, (2) selective transport A beta 40 and A beta 42 into blood vessels and the parenchyma, respectively, and (3) proteolysis of A beta 42 into A beta 40 induced by a putative carboxyl dipeptidase in blood vessels including vascular feet, which is involved in A beta fibrillation and cognitive deterioration in the patients.

{"title": "Mouse macrophage metalloelastase gene transfer into a murine melanoma suppresses primary tumor growth by halting angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Mouse macrophage metalloelastase (MME) has been associated with the generation of angiostatin, an internal fragment of plasminogen, which inhibits angiogenesis. To clarify whether tumor cells that consistently generate MME can suppress angiogenesis and, therefore, inhibit the growth of primary tumors in vivo, we transfected a cDNA coding for MME into murine B16-BL6 melanoma cells that grow rapidly and are MME deficient. The generation of active MME in MME-transfected clones was confirmed by immunoprecipitation followed by in vitro cleavage of plasminogen. Subcutaneous implantation of these stable clones in C57BL/6 mice inhibited primary tumor growth by an average of 73% (P = 0.00002), which directly correlated with a significant reduction of blood vessel formation (approximately 76%) in such tumors. Microangiography revealed massive angiogenesis in control tumors (mock and vector); however, in MME-transfected primary tumors it demonstrated a decreased and disrupted vascular network. Western blot analysis using a specific anti-mouse angiostatin antibody demonstrated a strong 38-kDa immunoreactive band in MME-transfected tumors and in the serum of mice bearing those tumor cells. These results show that placing MME gene directly into B16-BL6 melanoma cells is an effective approach to suppress primary tumor growth in vivo because it halts angiogenesis.

Data from mixed lymphocyte reactions showed that cell-mediated immune responses were uniformly suppressed in groups 2, 3, and 4 compared with group 1.

During the procedure of distraction, however, revisions were frequently needed to change the pin position or to change the flap configuration. In case of flap ischemia, distraction should be delayed or abandoned. Then, a vascularized bone transfer might be necessary. To avoid these complications and achieve safe distraction, the configuration of the flap with its vascular pedicle should be carefully planned in terms of the future bony lengthening procedures and the concomitant soft-tissue changes of the lower leg. According to the response of local tissue to the distraction process, the lower limb can be divided into four compartments (active mobile, passive mobile, receptive, and restrictive). The configuration of the transferred free flap with its vascular pedicle can be classified into five types. To minimize the undue forces to the vascular pedicle and reduce the possibility of vascular compromise, the transferred free flap should have the configuration that its vascular pedicle lies in the territory of the mobile compartment.

Island-flap mobilization is possible thanks to the rich blood supply of the perineal region. The methods described are a \"V-Y amplified sliding flap from the pubis\" and a \"fasciocutaneous island flap\" raised from one or both gluteal folds. The V-Y amplified sliding flap from the pubis is indicated when the defect is symmetric and located anteriorly. This flap is harvested from the pubis and vascularized by the deep arterial network of the pubis. Sensory innervation is provided by branches of the ileo-inguinal nerve. The fasciocutaneous island flap, raised from one or both gluteal folds, can be used following hemivulvectomy or radical vulvectomy, respectively, to cover posteriorly located defects. Vascularization is provided by the musculocutaneous perforating branches of the pudendal artery, whereas sensory innervation is maintained through the perineal branches of the pudendal nerve. Twenty-two patients have undergone reconstructive surgery of the vulvar region from 1989 to date. On 14 patients, a V-Y amplified sliding flap was used; on 7 patients, reconstruction was carried out by island flaps raised from the gluteal fold. Both techniques are compatible with inguino-femoral lymphadenectomy, and they allow for a correct morphofunctional reconstruction and provide good local sensibility.

We had attributed this acquired responsiveness to CsA to the induction of tolerance of T-independent xeno-antibody responses in the recipient and recently reported that this tolerance is species-specific. Here we have further characterized the specificity and nature of this tolerant state. Lewis rats transplanted with either hearts, skin, kidney or spleen/pancreas from Golden Syrian hamsters were treated with leflunomide (5 mg/kg/day by gavage) for 14-21 days and CsA (20 mg/kg/day by gavage) continuously from the day of transplant. Some Lewis rats received a second graft of hearts or skin from Golden Syrian hamsters (day 21-30 after first transplant), and a third heart graft from Balb/c mice (day 60 after the first transplant). Serum was harvested and the titers of xenoreactive antibodies were quantified by flow cytometry. All grafts were harvested at the end of each experiment and examined by histological and immunohistochemical methods. The combination of CsA and leflunomide was able to completely inhibit the rejection of kidney, spleen and pancreas xenografts in this hamster-to-rat xenotransplantation model. In addition, only a transient treatment with leflunomide was necessary, and long-term graft survival could subsequently be maintained by CsA alone. Histological examination of these grafts at > 80 days post-transplantation indicated minimal signs of rejection. These immediately vascularized organs induced T-independent B-cell tolerance, so that second grafts of hamster hearts and skin could be maintained with CsA alone. Under the same immunosuppressive regimen, only four out of nine Lewis rats exhibited long-term hamster skin survival, probably reflecting the increased immunogenicity of the skin compared with other vascularized grafts. Nonetheless, all rats that did not reject the hamster skin graft also did not reject the hamster heart while on CsA alone. Finally, we demonstrate that the tolerant state could be maintained for up to 30 days in the absence of xenograft. The vigorous T-independent antibody response that mediates acute xenograft rejection in the hamster-to-rat model can be tolerized by the immunosuppressive regimen of CsA and leflunomide. The lack of organ specificity for the induction of this tolerance suggests that the xenoantigens inducing tolerance may be common endothelial cell antigens. Finally, the presence of the xenograft has been previously shown to be critical for the induction of T-independent B-cell tolerance, however, the tolerant state is relatively stable and persists after the removal of the xenograft.", "journal": "Xenotransplantation", "date": "2000-05-16", "authors": ["A SChong", "L LMa", "DYin", "LBlinder", "JShen", "J WWilliams"], "doi": "10.1034/j.1399-3089.2000.00037.x"}

Preservation injury of murine heterotopic vascularized cardiac isografts caused a small, albeit significant, increase in neointimal formation; preservation injury of allografts markedly increased both the incidence and severity of transplant-associated coronary artery disease. As cAMP is an important vascular homeostatic mediator the levels of which decline during organ preservation, buttressing cAMP levels solely during initial preservation both improved acute allograft function and reduced the severity of transplant-associated coronary artery disease in grafts examined 2 months later. Inhibiting the cAMP-dependent protein kinase abrogated these beneficial effects. cAMP treatment was associated with an early reduction in leukocyte infiltration and a reciprocal decrease in superoxide and increase in NO levels.

Most retrospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of determination of intratumoral microvessel density (IMD) at the vascular \"hot spot\" (a surrogate marker of angiogenesis) found that IMD is a significant and independent prognostic indicator in patients with both node-negative and node-positive breast cancers. More recently, the expression of certain endothelial growth factors has been tested.

Eight of the nine published retrospective studies reported that VEGF is significantly associated with relapse-free survival, overall survival, or both. Patients with early stage breast cancer who have tumors with elevated levels of VEGF have a higher likelihood of recurrence or death than patients with low-angiogenic tumors, even if treated with conventional adjuvant therapy.

Targeting this angiogenic signaling pathway presents a promising alternative for the treatment of neoplasms. However, recent experimental and clinical studies have suggested that VEGF-Flk-1/KDR activity is unevenly distributed throughout the tumor microvasculature. To further evaluate this phenomenon, the regional differences in VEGF-Flk-1/KDR signaling activities in vivo were studied using intravital fluorescence videomicroscopy in an experimental murine brain tumor model. Regional VEGF-Flk-1/KDR was assessed using the small molecule inhibitor SU5416, which selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase receptor Flk-1. C(6) glioblastoma cells were implanted into the dorsal skinfold chamber preparation of nude mice. The process of tumor vascularization was repeatedly assessed over 22 days. SU5416 treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tumor vascular density (p<0.05). Regional microvascular evaluation indicated that the magnitude of this antiangiogenic effect was pronounced in the more angiogenic and better vascularized peritumoral areas than in the intratumoral areas of the tumor microvasculature.

{"title": "[Microangiographic evaluation of vascular supply of the medial collateral ligament of the knee joint].", "abstract": "Because the vascularization of ligaments is an important factor in ligament healing we wanted to examine the vascularization status of the medial collateral ligament of the knee. The type of vascularization was examined by microangiographie of 21 postmortem preparations. We could observe a vascularization from the proximal end of the ligament by one or two major vessels in all cases. These vessels were mostly localized in the ventral third of the ligament. From the proximal to the distal part of the ligament we found a decreasing density of blood vessels. We could not observe vessel free ligament areas. Due to this vascularization status we would advise the differentiation of two ligament areas respecting the following therapy. Because of the good vascularization in the proximal part of the ligament we can accept good conditions concerning complete healing after a non-operative treatment and an operative therapy by suture or refixation. In the case of interligamentous and distal ruptures operative reconstruction by sutures often in difficult and a conservative therapy leads to a high rate of poor results. Therefore we advise fibrin bonding in these ligament areas if a surgical procedure is indicated because of the high risk of vessel strangulation after suture.", "journal": "Der Unfallchirurg", "date": "2000-05-09", "authors": ["TAmbacher", "CJurowich", "JNachtkamp", "OPaar"], "doi": "10.1007/s001130050524"}
{"title": "The dorsal inlay graft for hypospadias repair.", "abstract": "Hypospadias is a common genitourinary anomaly affecting every 1/300 male newborns. The goals of hypospadiac surgery include a straight penis with a urethral meatus at the tip of the glans, a well vascularized neourethra of adequate caliber with a solid, straight urinary stream and achievement of sexual function when mature. Current theory advocates preservation of the urethral plate with chordee correction. Hypospadias repair without an adequate urethral plate to roll into a tube requires longitudinal incision of the plate or a transverse preputial island flap. We describe a technique of 1-stage urethroplasty using an inner preputial based dorsal inlay graft.\nAfter the penis is degloved and chordee corrected incisions are made bilaterally along the urethral plate from the native urethral meatus to the glans tip. The urethral plate is incised longitudinally. A graft harvested from the inner prepuce is defatted and sutured onto the incised urethral plate. The neourethra is rolled into a tube in Thiersch-Duplay fashion.\nThis technique was used in 32 patients. The original urethral meatus was coronal to penoscrotal and chordee release was performed concomitantly. At 21 months of followup no patient had a stricture, fistula or diverticulum at the inlay graft site.\nThis technique successfully fulfills all traditional hypospadias repair criteria. We believe that the dorsal inlay graft after incision of the urethral plate is a rapid, easy and successful addition to the armamentarium of the \"hypospadiologist.\"", "journal": "The Journal of urology", "date": "2000-05-08", "authors": ["T FKolon", "E TGonzales"], "doi": null}

In the present study we investigated the formation of new blood vessels around a planar membrane diffusion device (the Baxter Theracyte System) undergoing a continuous infusion of vascular endothelial growth factor through the membranes and into the surrounding tissue. Each device (20 microl) had both an inner immunoisolation membrane and an outer vascularizing membrane. Human recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor-165 was infused at 100 ng/day (low dose: n = 6) and 500 ng/day (high dose: n = 7) for 10 days into devices implanted s.c. in Sprague-Dawley rats; noninfused devices transplanted for an identical period were used as controls (n = 5). Two days following the termination of VEGF infusion, devices were loaded with 20 microl of Lispro insulin (1 U/kg) and the kinetics of insulin release from the lumen of the device was assessed. Devices were then explanted and the number of blood vessels (capillary and noncapillary) was quantified using morphometry. High-dose vascular endothelial growth factor infusion resulted in two- to threefold more blood vessels around the device than that obtained with the noninfused devices and devices infused with low-dose vascular endothelial growth factor. This increase in the number of blood vessels was accompanied by a modest increase in insulin diffusion from the device in the high-dose vascular endothelial growth factor infusion group.

However, there is little review and discussion of this entity among pathologists with only 2 of 40 published reviews of testicular regression syndrome (TRS) found in the pathologic literature.\nTo assess recognition of TRS among a subset of pathologists and to determine the applicability of histologic criteria for TRS as published.\nAn 8-year retrospective review of cases submitted as atrophic or regressed testis was performed. Original diagnosis and diagnosis after review were compared to assess pathologic recognition of TRS. Pathologic assessment included identification of vas deferens, epididymis, dystrophic calcification, hemosiderin, dominant vein, pampiniform plexus-like vessels, and vascularized fibrous nodule formation. At minimum, the presence of a vascularized fibrous nodule (VFN) with calcification or hemosiderin or VFN with cord element(s) was required for diagnosis.\nMedical records and pathologic specimens of patients undergoing surgery for cryptorchidism or with specimens reviewed at a medium-sized university hospital were analyzed.\nThe original diagnosis in 3 (23%) of 13 cases was that of TRS. On secondary review, 11 (85%) of 13 cases showed features consistent with TRS. The diagnoses both before and after review showed a concurrence of 23% (3/13 cases). Two (15%) of 13 cases were correctly recognized and diagnosed as TRS at primary review; 1 case originally thought to represent TRS was not confirmed. Pathologic features correlated well with those reported in the literature. Among all 13 cases, the 11 confirmed TRS cases showed VFN in 11 (85%), intranodular calcification in 8 (62%), intranodular hemosiderin in 9 (69%), vas deferens in 9 (69%), epididymal structures in 5 (38%), and a dominant venous structure in 11 (85%). The average size of the VFN was 1.1 cm.\nA urologic and pediatric surgical problem, TRS may be unrecognized by many practicing pathologists. In the typical situation in which a blind ending spermatic cord is submitted for tissue analysis, characterization of such cases as consistent with regressed testis is desirable and achievable in a high percentage of cases.

The effect of regional hypoxia on the vascular density of American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and chicken (Gallus gallus) CAMs was studied to determine if hypoxic proliferation of blood vessels is localized or global across the CAM. Eggs were incubated under normoxic conditions with a portion of the eggshell covered with non-toxic beeswax to induce external regional hypoxia. CAMs were examined under a microscope with a 'bulls eye' coverslip and a vascular density index (VDI) was determined. The hypoxic portions of the alligator CAMs were more vascular than the normoxic portions (VDI = 200.9 versus 157. 8, respectively). Presumably this response is maladaptive by causing increased blood flow to the poorly oxygenated portions, i.e. increased 'shunt'. Thus, we hypothesize increased vascularity due to hypoxic incubation is due to local release and subsequent rapid local breakdown or uptake of angiogenic factors. In contrast, the hypoxic and normoxic portions of the chick CAMs exhibited virtually no difference in VDI (VDI= 211.5 versus 217.9, respectively).

Patients who undergo bladder-augmentation procedures using a vascularized gastric patch appear to be protected from vesicolithiasis, perhaps by the acidic environment.

In the CNS, xenografts are classically thought to be rejected more slowly by a T-cell-dependent process. We now report that xenografts of embryonic porcine ventral mesencephalic tissue in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned, nonimmunosuppressed rat induce both a humoral and a cell-mediated response. Over the first 10 d after implantation, the xenografts matured with identifiable TH neurons and pig-specific neurofilament fibers extending along host white matter tracts. During this period of time, IgM and complement binding were observed within the graft, as well as a CD8 cellular infiltrate, leading to rejection of the transplant over the next 25 d. These intracerebral xenografts were not associated with an early systemic antibody response. A role for complement in this rejection process was further investigated using cobra venom factor (CVF), which systemically depleted the rats of complement for 7 d. CVF treatment, when given in the period immediately before and after grafting, delayed but did not prevent the cellular immune response induced by the graft, demonstrating that xenografted neural tissue can activate the humoral arm of the rejection process, in particular the complement cascade. This suggests that interventions targeting this aspect of the immune rejection process may be of great importance for the future development of xenotransplantation for neurodegenerative conditions.", "journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "date": "2000-04-25", "authors": ["R ABarker", "ERatcliffe", "MMcLaughlin", "ARichards", "S BDunnett"], "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.20-09-03415.2000"}

In order to analyse predisposing factors and outcome of ischaemic colitis, the authors reviewed their clinical experience from 1988 to 1998. It concerns 28 cases (16 ruptured AAA, 7 elective AAA, 5 OAD) of clinically evident colonic ischaemia. This means an incidence of 7% after repair of ruptured AAA, 0.6% after elective AAA repair, and 0.8% after bypass for AOD. Transmural necrosis (grade 3) was observed in 21 patients, grade 2 ischaemia in 5 patients, and grade 1 ischaemia in 2 patients. Fifteen patients with grade 3 ischaemia underwent colectomy (Hartmann's procedure) with a mortality rate of 66%. All non operated grade 3 patients died. Overall, 16 of the 28 patients died at hospital (57% mortality rate). None of the patients with mild (grade 2 or 1) colonic ischaemia died. Profound hypovolaemic shock and inflammatory AAA were the only significant predisposing factors leading to colonic ischaemia. Associated colon revascularization could not avoid the evolution to colon necrosis in four patients. Reimplantation of a patent inferior mesenteric artery or an internal iliac artery was performed in only 4.8% of all aortoiliac reconstructions, and did not influence the development of ischaemic colitis.

Earlier morphologic studies suggested healing at the infarct site was complete within 6-8 weeks following MI and resultant scar tissue, albeit necessary, was acellular and simply fibrillar collagen. Utilizing molecular and cellular biologic technologies, recent studies indicate otherwise. Infarct scar is composed of phenotypically transformed fibroblast-like cells, termed myofibroblasts (myoFb) because they express alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and these microfilaments confer contractile behavior in response to various peptides and amines. These cells are nourished by a neovasculature and are persistent at the MI site, where they are metabolically active expressing components requisite to angiotensin (Ang) peptide generation, including converting enzyme, receptors for AngII and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. They continue to elaborate fibrillar type I collagen. Their generation of these peptides contribute to ongoing scar tissue collagen turnover and to fibrous tissue formation of noninfarcted myocardium. Infarct scar contraction accounts for its thinning and its tonus may contribute to abnormal ventricular chamber stiffness with diastolic dysfunction. Infarct scar is a dynamic tissue: cellular, vascularized, metabolically active and contractile.

With the new sustained-release formulation, the time of peak (Tmax) and mean residence time (MRT) values are significantly longer than those observed with the standard cefaclor IR. For the first time the penetration of the MR formulation of cefaclor was determined both in suction blister fluid (SBF) and alveolar epithelial lining fluid (ELF). Cefaclor demonstrated a high tissue distribution, with a high penetration index (PI) into blister fluid, which is at least representative of a relatively large volume of fluid-filled spaces and in part of highly vascularized tissues. SBF and ELF concentrations were higher than blood levels starting at the 4th-6th hour after dose, with longer elimination half-lives from the extravascular compartment than from serum. Cefaclor has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, especially the new sustained-release formulation, which maintains effective concentrations for a longer time than the IR preparation. The MR formulation improves the kinetic properties of the cefaclor molecule with a prolonged MRT which allows a daily dosage of 750 mg every 12 h.", "journal": "Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)", "date": "2000-04-18", "authors": ["TMazzei", "ANovelli", "SEsposito", "PPeriti"], "doi": "10.1179/joc.2000.12.1.53"}
{"title": "Comparison of narrow-band reflectance spectroscopy and tristimulus colorimetry for measurements of skin and hair color in persons of different biological ancestry.", "abstract": "We have used two modern computerized handheld reflectometers, the Photovolt ColorWalk colorimeter (a tristimulus colorimeter; Photovolt, UMM Electronics, Indianapolis, IN) and the DermaSpectrometer (a specialized narrow-band reflectometer; Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Denmark), to compare two methods for the objective determination of skin and hair color. These instruments both determine color by measuring the intensity of reflected light of particular wavelengths. The Photovolt ColorWalk instrument does so by shining a white light and sensing the intensity of the reflected light with a linear photodiode array. The ColorWalk results can then be expressed in terms of several standard color systems, most importantly, the Commission International d'Eclairage (CIE) Lab system, in which any color can be described by three values: L*, the lightness; a*, the amount of green or red; and b*, the amount of yellow or blue. Instead of a white light and photodiodes, the DermaSpectrometer uses two light-emitting diodes (LEDs), one green and one red, to illuminate a surface, and then it records the intensity of the reflected light. The results of these readings are expressed in terms of erythema (E) and melanin (M) indices. We measured the unexposed skin of the inner upper arm, the exposed skin of the forehead, and the hair, of 80 persons using these two instruments. Since it is important for the application of these measures in anthropology that we understand their relationship across a number of different pigmentation levels, we sampled persons from several different groups, namely, European Americans (n = 55), African Americans (n = 9), South Asians (n = 7), and East Asians (n = 9). In these subjects, there is a very high correlation between L* and the M index for the inner arm (R(2) = 0.928, P < 0.001), the forehead (R(2) = 0.822, P < 0.001), and the hair (R(2) = 0.827, P < 0.001). The relationship between a* and the E index is complex and dependent on the pigmentation level. We conclude that while both types of instruments provide accurate estimates of pigment level in skin and hair, measurements using narrow-band instruments may be less affected by the greater redness of certain body sites due to increased vascularization.", "journal": "American journal of physical anthropology", "date": "2000-04-15", "authors": ["M DShriver", "E JParra"], "doi": "10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(200005)112:1<17::AID-AJPA3>3.0.CO;2-D"}
{"title": "Systems for therapeutic angiogenesis in tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The goals in tissue engineering include the replacement of damaged, injured, or missing body tissues with biologically compatible substitutes. To overcome initial tissue-mass loss, improved vascularization of the regenerated tissue is essential. Two pathways of tissue neovascularization are known: vasculogenesis, the in situ assembly of capillaries from undifferentiated endothelial cells (EC), and angiogenesis, the sprouting of capillaries from preexisting blood vessels. Recent advances in our understanding of the process of bloodvessel growth have provided significant tools for the neovascularization of bioengineered tissues. Several growth factors serve as stimuli for EC proliferation and migration as well as the formation of new blood vessels. They convey their effects via specific receptors expressed on the surface of EC. Vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major regulator of neovascularization. VEGF plays a major role in the early development of blood-cell progenitors. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was identified as the first angiogenic factor. It is a potent inducer of EC proliferation and blood-vessel growth in vitro and in vivo. VEGF and bFGF have been injected into undervascularized ischemic tissues, resulting in new blood-vessel formation and tissue perfusion. Gene-therapy approaches using VEGF cDNA injection into ischemic tissues have augmented the formation of collateral vessels. Angiogenic factors such as VEGF and bFGF have also been incorporated into bioengineered tissues and have facilitated blood-vessel growth. Other approaches such as prevascularization of the matrix prior to cell seeding and incorporation of EC into the bioengineered tissues have produced encouraging results.

{"title": "Phonomicrosurgical management of vocal fold polyps: the subepithelial microflap resection technique.", "abstract": "Vocal fold polyps are typically caused by acute and chronic trauma to the microvasculature of the superficial lamina propria (SLP). Shearing stresses that are induced by hyperfunctional glottal sound production lead to bleeding into the SLP and malformed neo-vascularized masses. Because the primary process does not involve the epithelium, the authors designed a technique to resect hemorrhagic polyps by epithelial cordotomy with partial or complete preservation of the vocal fold epithelium. This approach is different from the traditional microsurgical resection of hemorrhagic polyps by amputation with or without the carbon dioxide laser. Forty patients who underwent microlaryngoscopic resection of hemorrhagic polyps from 1996 through 1998 were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty-six of the 40 procedures were by epithelial cordotomy and subepithelial removal of the polyp contents. Sixteen of 36 were assisted by a subepithelial infusion of saline and epinephrine, and all were 3 mm to 6 mm. Four of 40 polyps were amputated; all of these were less than 3 mm and were pedicled on a narrow base. Cold instruments were used exclusively in all 40 patients. Postoperative laryngeal stroboscopy within 2 weeks revealed improved mucosal wave propagation and improved glottal closure in all 33 patients in whom postoperative strobovideolaryngoscopy was available. The epithelial cordotomy technique was introduced to minimize disturbance of normal SLP and epithelium. Despite the hemorrhagic nature of these lesions, cold instruments could be used exclusively with facility due to careful microdissection between the polyp and the residual normal SLP and the enhanced hemostasis provided by the subepithelial infusion of saline and epinephrine. The rapid return to improved glottal function is the result of this ultra tissue-sparing technique.", "journal": "Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation", "date": "2000-04-14", "authors": ["I IHochman", "S MZeitels"], "doi": "10.1016/s0892-1997(00)80101-0"}

To classify tumor perfusion on Doppler sonography, a 4-step rating score was introduced: (1) no vessels (hypoperfusion); (2) one feeding or central vessel (hypoperfusion); (3) some vessels (hyperperfusion); and (4) disseminated vessels (hyperperfusion). In 36 patients, 1 pancreatic primary tumor, 33 liver metastases, 1 splenic metastasis, and 1 lymph node metastasis were examined.

Contrast-enhanced Doppler correctly classified 15 of 18 patients (83%) with hyperperfused lesions as well as 16 of 18 (89%) hypoperfused tumors by applying the rating score. SAE correctly identified 4 of 9 hyperperfused lesions (44%), 2 were isoperfused compared with normal liver tissue (22%), and 3 were hypoperfused (33%).

There were eleven female patients and six male patients. Eight patients had a bone neoplasm and nine, a soft-tissue neoplasm. The diagnosis was Ewing sarcoma in four patients; lymphoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma in two patients each; and cavernous hemangioma, metastatic breast carcinoma, reticulum-cell sarcoma, myxosarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, and fibrosarcoma in one patient each. The remaining patient had a soft-tissue tumor for which the diagnosis was not known. All patients received radiation therapy. The average dose was 5564 centigray. There were no recurrent tumors. The average interval between the radiation therapy and the original fracture was 111 months. The fracture was in the femur in thirteen patients, in the humerus in three, and in the tibia in one. All patients had operative or nonoperative treatment, or both, of the initial fracture, and two had iliac-crest bone-grafting after the initial open reduction and internal fixation procedure. The ages of the patients ranged from thirteen to eighty-two years at the time of the vascularized free fibular transfer. All fibular transfers were applied as onlay grafts because no nonunion was associated with a large segmental defect. Cancellous autogenous bone graft from the iliac crest was used as an additional graft at the proximal and distal junctions of the graft with the bone and at the fracture site in all patients. The average duration of follow-up after the vascularized free fibular transfer was fifty-seven months (range, twenty-eight to 112 months).\nSixteen of the eighteen fracture sites united, after an average of 9.4 months (range, three to twenty-four months). Thirteen patients had an excellent result, one had a good result, two had a fair result, and one had a failure of treatment. Four patients had an infection, including one who continued to have a nonunion. The other three patients had union after treatment with antibiotics, debridement, and removal of the hardware.

{"title": "Arteries of the insula.", "abstract": "The insula is located at the base of the sylvian fissure and is a potential site for pathological processes such as tumors and vascular malformations. Knowledge of insular anatomy and vascularization is essential to perform accurate microsurgical procedures in this region.\nArterial vascularization of the insula was studied in 20 human cadaver brains (40 hemispheres). The cerebral arteries were perfused with red latex to enhance their visibility, and they were dissected with the aid of an operating microscope. Arteries supplying the insula numbered an average of 96 (range 77-112). Their mean diameter measured 0.23 mm (range 0.1-0.8 mm), and the origin of each artery could be traced to the middle cerebral artery (MCA), predominantly the M2 segment. In 22 hemispheres (55%), one to six insular arteries arose from the M1 segment of the MCA and supplied the region of the limen insulae. In an additional 10 hemispheres (25%), one or two insular arteries arose from the M3 segment of the MCA and supplied the region of either the superior or inferior periinsular sulcus. The insular arteries primarily supply the insular cortex, extreme capsule, and, occasionally, the claustrum and external capsule, but not the putamen, globus pallidus, or internal capsule, which are vascularized by the lateral lenticulostriate arteries (LLAs). However, an average of 9.9 (range four-14) insular arteries in each hemisphere, mostly in the posterior insular region, were similar to perforating arteries and some of these supplied the corona radiata. Larger, more prominent insular arteries (insuloopercular arteries) were also observed (an average of 3.5 per hemisphere, range one-seven). These coursed across the surface of the insula and then looped laterally, extending branches to the medial surfaces of the opercula.\nComplete comprehension of the intricate vascularization patterns associated with the insula, as well as proficiency in insular anatomy, are prerequisites to accomplishing appropriate surgical planning and, ultimately, to completing successful exploration and removal of pathological lesions in this region.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "date": "2000-04-13", "authors": ["UT\u00fcre", "M GYa\u015fargil", "OAl-Mefty", "D CYa\u015fargil"], "doi": "10.3171/jns.2000.92.4.0676"}

Amniogenesis is complete and two yolk sac membranes, vascular trilaminar omphalopleure (choriovitelline membrane) and bilaminar omphalopleure, enclose the yolk vesicle. A small allantoic vesicle contacts the chorion. The choriovitelline membrane is the primary vascular system. Blood islands, sites of hematopoiesis, are associated with omphalomesenteric vessels of the choriovitelline membrane. The bilaminar omphalopleure, which contacts the eggshell over the abembryonic hemisphere of the egg, lies external to an isolated yolk mass and yolk cleft and is not vascularized. The definitive yolk sac (splanchnopleure) is formed when the extraembryonic coelom and allantoic vesicle intrude into the choriovitelline membrane. Omphalomesenteric vessels are retained with the yolk sac splanchnopleure and the associated hematopoietic sites are present throughout incubation. The chorioallantoic membrane reaches the equator of the egg, entirely supplanting the choriovitelline membrane, after 25% of incubation is completed. Further growth of the allantois is stalled until 65% of incubation is completed when rapid expansion of the allantoic vesicle, in conjunction with resorption of the isolated yolk mass, supplants the bilaminar omphalopleure. As a result, the chorioallantoic membrane completely envelopes the egg for the final 35% of incubation. This developmental event is coincident with published reports for the timing of increased growth and metabolism of embryos. As the isolated yolk mass regresses, intravitelline cells associated with the yolk cleft invade and resorb the yolk to form a large cavity. The wall of this cavity is a germinal epithelium that produces cells that fill the cavity.

{"title": "Matrix metalloproteinase-2 is required for the switch to the angiogenic phenotype in a tumor model.", "abstract": "Among the earliest and most important stages during tumorigenesis is the activation of the angiogenic process, an event that is termed the \"switch to the angiogenic phenotype.\" We have developed an in vivo system that can reliably recapitulate the stages in tumor development that represent this transition. Using this model, we have harvested and studied tumor nodules that can be distinguished from each other on the basis of their degree of vascularization. Angiogenic tumor nodules were characterized by the presence of capillary vessels as determined by factor VIII immunohistochemistry, and both angiogenic and proteolytic activities in vitro. In contrast, preangiogenic nodules were devoid of microvessels and showed little angiogenic or proteolytic activity in vitro. Addition of a specific metalloproteinase inhibitor resulted in the abrogation of both angiogenic and proteolytic activities of the angiogenic nodules in vitro. Comparative substrate gel electrophoresis detected the presence of a prominent matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2) in the angiogenic nodules when compared with the preangiogenic ones. Suppression of MMP-2 activity by antisense oligonucleotides in the vascular nodules resulted in the loss of angiogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Moreover, this suppression of MMP-2 activity in angiogenic nodules inhibited tumor growth in vivo by approximately 70%. These results strongly implicate the activity of MMP-2 as a requirement for the switch to the angiogenic phenotype and validate this model as a reliable and reproducible tool by which to study other cellular and biochemical factors involved in the acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2000-04-13", "authors": ["JFang", "YShing", "DWiederschain", "LYan", "CButterfield", "GJackson", "JHarper", "GTamvakopoulos", "M AMoses"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.97.8.3884"}
{"title": "Hot spot microvessel density and the mitotic activity index are strong additional prognostic indicators in invasive breast cancer.", "abstract": "Recent studies have drawn attention to intratumoral microvessel density (MVD) as a prognostic factor in invasive breast cancer. Various methods have been applied to assess MVD and the prognostic value of MVD in different studies varies considerably. Counting of microvessels in the most highly vascularized area (hot spot) of a tumour is the method most widely used. In this study we compared three counting methods.\nTo assess MVD in 112 cases of invasive breast cancer with long-term follow-up we performed microvessel counting in the hot spot of the tumour in four and 10 fields of vision (HS-MVD4 and HS-MVD10) and microvessel counting in 10 fields of vision distributed systematically over the whole tumour area (global MVD). The HS-MVD4, HS-MVD10 and global MVD showed good correlations with each other. HS-MVD4 provided the highest number of microvessels (median value 71) followed by HS-MVD10 and global MVD, with median values of 58 and 39, respectively. HS-MVD4 showed the best prognostic value for overall survival (P = 0.0001) whereas HS-MVD10 showed less (P = 0.01) and the global MVD showed no (P = 0.75) prognostic value. In univariate analysis, the HS-MVD4 was the second strongest prognostic factor after tumour size. In multivariate survival analysis, the HS-MVD4, mitotic activity index (MAI), lymph node status and tumour size were found to be independent prognostic factors. When combining MVD4 and MAI in lymph node negative patients, none of the patients with low MVD (< 71/mm2) and a low MAI (< 10 per 10 HPF) died, in contrast to patients with a high MVD or high MAI who have a 10-year survival of 57%.\nThese data suggest that the hot spot MVD in four fields of vision is a major independent prognostic factor for overall survival in invasive breast cancer. For the first time, it is shown that hot spot MVD provides additional prognostic information to well established factors like lymph node status and the MAI, and may therefore be useful for designing treatment strategies in invasive breast cancer.", "journal": "Histopathology", "date": "2000-04-12", "authors": ["J Sde Jong", "P Jvan Diest", "J PBaak"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-2559.2000.00850.x"}

Specimens were embedded in paraffin and serially sectioned (6 microm) after formalin fixation. Every 10th section was stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical staining for nerves (S100), smooth muscles (alpha-actin), blood vessels (factor VIII) and epithelium (cytokeratins 7, 14 and 18) were used on selected sections, with particular attention to the urethral plate. Masson's trichrome and Sirius Red stains were used to localize collagen.\nThere were extensive blood vessels, glands and smooth muscle under the urethral plate in the hypospadias specimens. These relatively well organized tissues corresponded to an abnormally formed corpus spongiosum. The glands underneath the urethral plate and adjacent to the normal urethra showed positive staining for cytokeratins 7 and 18, respectively (markers of endodermal origin) but were negative for cytokeratin 14 (a marker of ectodermal origin). Penile skin and urethral plate epithelium stained positively for cytokeratin 14 but not for cytokeratin 7 and 18. The urethral plate has a rich nerve supply, as determined by S100 staining. Collagen intensity under the urethral plate was no different from that in normal areas. Tunica albuginea stained intensely for type I and III collagen.\nThese results show that the urethral plate is well vascularized, has a rich nerve supply and an extensive muscular and connective tissue backing.

{"title": "Large arterioles in the control of blood flow: role of endothelium-dependent dilation.", "abstract": "Although it is generally assumed that small arterioles form the major site of vascular resistance, microcirculatory studies revealed that 40-55% of the total network resistance can reside in large arterioles and small arteries. Thus, the mechanisms that control smooth muscle tone in these vessels have a major impact on the overall conductance of the vascular network. These control mechanisms are different from those in small arterioles: Aside from an apparently reduced sensitivity to metabolites, the large resistance vessels are normally too far away from the capillary areas which they feed to be reached by diffusing metabolites from dependent cells within a reasonable period of time. Rather, recent intravital microscopic studies suggest that large resistance vessels are under tight control of endothelial factors such as nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF). Nitric oxide opposes myogenic constrictions of large arterioles that potentially would impair tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Moreover, nitric oxide and EDHF play an important role in the co-ordination of large and small resistance vessel behaviour that is pivotal for the adaptation of blood flow to altered tissue oxygen demands.", "journal": "Acta physiologica Scandinavica", "date": "2000-04-12", "authors": ["UPohl", "CDe Wit", "TGloe"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-201x.2000.00702.x"}
{"title": "Intestinal microvascular patterns during hemorrhagic shock.", "abstract": "While injuries due to a hypoxic state commonly appear later in both intestinal crypts and basal portion of the villi than in the apical portion, a nonhomogeneous distribution of blood flow in the intestinal mucosa may be supposed. The presence of two different microvascular plexuses inside the mucosa, corresponding to the cryptal plexus and the villous plexus, supports the above hypothesis. This work studies the intestinal microvasculature in shocked versus normal rats. Forty-five rats were divided into four groups to study the histological damage and the microvascular bed by ink injection, fluorescent microsphere infusion, and resin injection for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of vascular corrosion cast (VCC) observations. An infusion pressure of 100 +/- 5 mm Hg was used in control animals, while 30 +/- 5 mm Hg infusion pressure was adopted for controls as well as for shocked animals to simulate physiological or shock conditions. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by removing blood and maintaining a mean arterial pressure of 30 +/- 5 mm Hg for 45-120 mins. A close connection among the patterns of microvasculature obtained with VCC and ink injection technique can be appreciated. In normal rats the whole microvasculature was visualized, but in both normal and shocked animals injected at low pressure different patterns could be found, generally showing a highly incomplete visualization of the vascular network. A significant decrease of visualization of both the entire microvasculature and the villous plexus is present in shocked animals when compared to unshocked controls, while no difference in the cryptal plexus visualization was observed. These observations suggest that the cryptal plexus is perfused preferentially during hemorrhagic shock, as a consequence of its peculiar microvascular organization. This may explain the relative resistance of the crypts, compared to villi, to hypoxic injuries in order to sustain endocrine function and the regenerative capability of the mucosa after prolonged hypoperfusion conditions that can lead to villous damage and temporary loss of the intestinal barrier function.", "journal": "Digestive diseases and sciences", "date": "2000-04-12", "authors": ["SMorini", "WYacoub", "CRastellini", "EGaudio", "S CWatkins", "LCicalese"], "doi": "10.1023/a:1005491509832"}

The goal of this study was to create a biomaterial that combines inherent biological properties which can specifically trigger desired cellular responses (e.g., angiogenesis) with electrical properties which have been shown to improve the regeneration of several tissues including bone and nerve. To this end, composites of the biologically active polysaccharide hyaluronic acid (HA) and the electrically conducting polymer polypyrrole (PP) were synthesized and characterized. Electrical conductivity of the composite biomaterial (PP/HA) was measured by a four-point probe technique, scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize surface topography, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and reflectance infrared spectroscopy were used to evaluate surface and bulk chemistry, and an assay with biotinylated hyaluronic acid binding protein was used to determine surface HA content. PP/HA materials were also evaluated for in vitro cell compatibility and tissue response in rats. Smooth, conductive, HA-containing PP films were produced; these films retained HA on their surfaces for several days in vitro and promoted vascularization in vivo.

A phage epitope library was screened by affinity for membrane-expressed KDR or for an anti-VEGF neutralizing monoclonal antibody. Both strategies led to the isolation of peptides binding KDR specifically, but those isolated by KDR binding tended to display lower reactivities. Of the synthetic peptides corresponding to selected clones tested to determine their inhibitory activity, ATWLPPR completely abolished VEGF binding to cell-displayed KDR. In vitro, this effect led to the inhibition of the VEGF-mediated proliferation of human vascular endothelial cells, in a dose-dependent and endothelial cell type-specific manner.

{"title": "Involvement of nitric oxide in the modulation of dural arterial blood flow in the rat.", "abstract": "1. Nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed to be a key molecule in the pathogenesis of migraine pain and other headaches that are linked to vascular disorders. Several lines of evidence indicate that the meningeal vascularization is crucially involved in the generation of these headaches. In an experimental model in the rat a dominating role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in causing neurogenic vasodilatation and increased blood flow has been shown. The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of NO in this model with regard to the meningeal blood flow. 2. The blood flow in and around the medial meningeal artery (dural arterial flow) was recorded in the exposed parietal dura mater encephali of barbiturate anaesthetized rats using laser Doppler flowmetry. Local electrical stimulation of the dura mater (pulses of 0.5 ms delivered at 7.5 - 17.5 V and 5 or 10 Hz for 30 s) caused temporary increases in dural arterial flow for about 1 min that reached peaks of 1.6 - 2.6 times the basal flow. The effects of NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors on the basal flow and the electrically evoked increases in flow were examined. 3. Systemic (i. v.) administration of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) at cumulative doses of 10 and 50 mg kg(-1) lowered the basal flow to 87 and 72%, respectively, of the control and reduced the evoked increases in blood flow to 82 and 44% on an average. Both these effects could partly be reversed by 300 mg kg(-1) L-arginine. The systemic arterial pressure was increased by L-NAME at both doses. Injection of the stereoisomer D-NAME at same doses did not change basal flow and evoked increases in flow. 4. 4. Topical application of L-NAME (10(-4) - 10(-2) M) was effective only at the highest concentration, which caused lowering of the basal blood flow to 78% of the control; the evoked increases in flow were not changed. Topical application of 2-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,3-thiazine (AMT), a specific inhibitor of the inducible NOS, at concentrations of 10(-4) - 10(-2) M lowered the basal flow to 89, 87.5 and 85%, respectively, but did not significantly change the evoked flow increases. Same concentrations of 7-nitroindazole monosodium salt (7-NINA), a specific inhibitor of the neuronal NOS, had no significant effects on basal flow and evoked increases in flow. 5. It is concluded that NO is involved in the maintenance of the basal level of dural arterial blood flow as well as in the electrically evoked flow increases, which have been shown to be mainly mediated by CGRP released from dural afferent fibres. The most important source of NO is probably the endothelium of dural arterial vessels. The synergistic effect of NO and CGRP on the stimulated blood flow may be in part due to a NO mediated facilitation of the CGRP release.", "journal": "British journal of pharmacology", "date": "2000-04-01", "authors": ["KMesslinger", "ASuzuki", "MPawlak", "AZehnter", "R FSchmidt"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.bjp.0703220"}

{"title": "Limbal stem cells of the corneal epithelium.", "abstract": "Stem cells have certain unique characteristics, which include longevity, high capacity of self-renewal with a long cell cycle time and a short S-phase duration, increased potential for error-free proliferation, and poor differentiation. The ocular surface is made up of two distinct types of epithelial cells, constituting the conjunctival and the corneal epithelia. Although anatomically continuous with each other at the corneoscleral limbus, the two cell phenotypes represent quite distinct subpopulations. Stem cells for the cornea reside at the corneoscleral limbus. The limbal palisades of Vogt and the interpalisade rete ridges are believed to be repositories of stem cells. The microenvironment of the limbus is considered to be important in maintaining the stemness of stem cells. Limbal stem cells also act as a \"barrier\" to conjunctival epithelial cells and normally prevent them from migrating on to the corneal surface. Under certain conditions, however, the limbal stem cells may be partially or totally depleted, resulting in varying degrees of stem cell deficiency with resulting abnormalities in the corneal surface. Such deficiency of limbal stem cells leads to \"conjunctivalization\" of the cornea with vascularization, appearance of goblet cells, and an irregular and unstable epithelium. This results in ocular discomfort and reduced vision. Partial stem cell deficiency can be managed by removing the abnormal epithelium and allowing the denuded cornea, especially the visual axis, to resurface with cells derived from the remaining intact limbal epithelium. In total stem cell deficiency, autologous limbus from the opposite normal eye or homologous limbus from living related or cadaveric donors can be transplanted on to the affected eye. With the latter option, systemic immunosuppression is required.

Because the IL-2 tumours have an altered host cell composition, which could affect the interpretation of radiation sensitivity as measured by clonogenic cells, we employed flow cytometric analysis to determine the proportion of tumour cells vs host cells in each tumour type. Using this approach, we were able to correct the plating efficiency based on the number of actual tumour cells derived from tumours, making the comparison of the two types of tumours possible. We also excluded the possibility that cytotoxic T-cells present in EMT6/IL-2 tumours could influence the outcome of the clonogenic cell survival assay, by demonstrating that the plating efficiency of cells derived from EMT6/IL-2 tumours remained unchanged after depletion of Thy-1+ cells. The in vivo radiation response results demonstrated that IL-2-transfected tumours were more sensitive to radiation than parental EMT6 tumours. The hypoxic fraction of the EMT6/IL-2 tumours growing in vivo was markedly decreased relative to parental EMT6 tumours thus the increased sensitivity results from the increased vascularity we have previously observed in these tumours. These results indicate the potential therapeutic benefit of combining radiation and immunotherapy in the treatment of tumours.", "journal": "British journal of cancer", "date": "2000-03-25", "authors": ["JLee", "J PMoran", "B MFenton", "C JKoch", "J GFrelinger", "P CKeng", "E MLord"], "doi": "10.1054/bjoc.1999.1022"}

If one is to elucidate factors related to carcinogenesis, tumour biology, diagnostics and new treatment modalities of this malignant disease, then it is essential to develop a suitable animal model. In the present study we investigated rat pancreatic tumour growth after intrapancreatic injection of cultured pancreatic carcinoma cells (DSL-6A/C1), originally derived from an azaserine-induced tumour, as well as the features of tumour microcirculation using the microangiography technique. After intrapancreatic inoculation, tumours were detected in 64% of animals. A 1 cm3 tumour volume was reached within 20 weeks after inoculation. The tumours were ductal adenocarcinomas. Larger tumours showed invasive growth and spreading into the surrounding tissues, mainly into spleen and peritoneum. Microangiography revealed that the pancreatic tumours had an irregular and scanty vessel network and there were avascular areas in the center of the tumour. The area between normal pancreas and the induced tumour had dense vascularization. Intrapancreatic tumour induction with cultured pancreatic carcinoma cells produced a solid and uniformly growing tumour in Lewis rats and it thus provides a possible model for pancreatic cancer studies.", "journal": "British journal of cancer", "date": "2000-03-25", "authors": ["KM\u00e4kinen", "SLoimas", "PNuutinen", "MEskelinen", "EAlhava"], "doi": "10.1054/bjoc.1999.1017"}
{"title": "Experimental defect in rabbit urethra repaired with acellular aortic matrix.", "abstract": "Urethral reconstruction following failed hypospadias repair or post-traumatic chronic stricture requires adequate amounts of tissue. Many surgical techniques utilizing different types of biological tissues have been attempted: (a) vascularized skin flaps from the prepuce, scrotum or penile shaft; (b) full-thickness free skin grafts; (c) vesical or buccal mucosa grafts; (d) ureter; artery; vein and appendix tissue. More recently, biodegradable polymers have also been used as delivery vehicles of urothelial cells in animals. It has been demonstrated that the implant of an acellular tissue matrix in the bladder can guide the regeneration of urothelium, blood vessels, smooth muscle and nerves. The aim of this study was to create an experimental model of urethral defect, and then repair it by implanting homologous acellular aortic grafts as urethral substitutes. An acellular matrix was obtained by detergent enzymatic treatment of rabbit thoracic aorta. The growth of urethral epithelium was verified in vitro, and homologous acellular vessels were then implanted in rabbits, bridging a previous surgical urethral defect. The outcome of reconstructive surgery was evaluated histologically at 10 days, 3 weeks, 3 and 12 months. As the time after surgery increased, the neourothelium became less thick, signs of inflammatory response disappeared, and the orientation of collagen fibrils and smooth muscle fascicles resembled that of a normal urethra. The implants displayed abundant vascularization, and the luminal surface started to become irregular. Acellular blood vessels may represent a promising approach to urethral defect therapy for different reasons: (a) unlimited availability, (b) readily obtainable in different lengths and gauges, (c) the potential for being organized as tissue bank, and (d) that just one simple surgical procedure is needed. Nevertheless, before this technique can be applied in humans, it must be tested in more species and animals.", "journal": "Urological research", "date": "2000-03-25", "authors": ["P PParnigotto", "P GGamba", "M TConconi", "PMidrio"], "doi": "10.1007/s002400050009"}

However, it contains a skin component and other musculoskeletal tissues that complicate issues related to tolerance induction.\nTo study only aspects of vascularized bone marrow transplantation, we created a new isolated vascularized bone marrow transplant model in rats. The common iliac (or femoral) artery and vein were microsurgically anastomosed to the recipient abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava in an end-to-side fashion, respectively. Syngeneic male Lewis (RT1(1), n = 20) and allogeneic male BN (RT1(n), n = 10) donors were transplanted to female Lewis recipients. To establish rejection criteria, we examined histopathology and used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess microchimerism of donor male bone marrow cells in the peripheral blood of female recipients using rat Y chromosome (sex-determining region Y)-specific primers.\nAll recipients were healthy and remained stable without major complications for up to 300 days posttransplant. Morphologically, syngeneic male Lewis bone marrow showed a near-normal appearance. Allogeneic male BN bone marrow was clearly rejected. Male bone marrow cells were detected by PCR in the peripheral blood of all syngeneic recipients, but not in allogeneic blood specimens.\nA new surgical approach to bone marrow transplantation was established.

The effect of these surgical manipulations on the fibula has not been adequately investigated. This study was designed to study the effect of multiple segmental osteotomies and internal fixation techniques on blood flow in the vascularized pig fibula bone flap model. The hindlimbs of 15 Yorkshire pigs were randomized into 1 of 5 groups (n = 6 fibulae per group) consisting of: (1) a nonoperated, in situ fibula; (2) an elevated fibula flap; (3) an elevated fibula flap with two segmental osteotomies; (4) an elevated fibula with two segmental closing osteotomies rigidly fixed with 2-mm miniplates; (5) an elevated fibula with two segmental closing osteotomies rigidly fixed with 2-mm lag screws. Total and gradient blood flow was measured in the bone and soft-tissue components of these flaps using the 15-microm radioactive microsphere technique. The creation of two segmental osteotomies in the vascularized pig fibula bone flap model resulted in a significant decrease (p<0.05) in the gradient blood flow in the segment of bone distal to the second osteotomy. Application of miniplates or lag screws across closing osteotomies resulted in a significant decrease (p<0.05) in total and gradient blood flow to the bone component of the fibulae, as compared with the elevated and osteotomized fibulae groups. An increase in blood flow suggesting a hyperemic response was noted in the bone and soft tissue in the elevated and osteotomized flap groups as compared with the in situ, nonoperated controls. This study established the validity of the pig fibula as a suitable model for investigating the pathophysiology of blood flow changes in the face of standard surgical maneuvers necessary for the restoration of mandibular form and function. The results demonstrated that the creation of multiple segmental osteotomies and the application of internal fixation significantly decreases (p<0.05) blood flow to the distal portion of the flap.

These findings provide new insight into the activities of chemokines and indicate that these molecules have a more widespread cellular target than first envisaged.

In adult sheep, we developed a simple model of surgically designed 2 latissimus dorsi muscle leaflets by modifying the vascular supply to these leaflets. Three pockets with graded injury were established, and muscle morphology and vascular remodeling were monitored in 3 experimental groups: muscle leaflets without any treatment (Group 1, n = 6) that served as controls; muscle leaflets integrated with a fibrin interlayer (Group 2, n = 6); and leaflets integrated with fibrin and entrapped pyrrolostatin (Group 3, n = 6). We applied the fibrinogen and thrombin solutions, which polymerize to form a three-dimensional meshwork joining the tissues, creating a provisional matrix for angiogenesis, and acting as a delivery depot for agents aimed at minimizing ischemia-reperfusion lesion formation. After 2 months, the muscle leaflets biointegrated with the fibrin interface showed none of the signs of necrosis or ischemia-reperfusion lesions seen in the controls. Although no angiogenic factors were incorporated, the fibrin interlayer rapidly (<2 weeks) became a densely vascularized tissue replete with a voluminous capillary network. In contrast, controls showed poor bonding between the tissues, muscle fiber deterioration, and a compromised vascular network. Muscle structure was best preserved and angiogenesis was greatest when pyrrolostatin, a free radical scavenger, was added to the fibrin meshwork to reduce damage caused by overproduction of free radicals.

Representative retinas that had been scored positive (n = 10) and negative (n = 3) for NV and room air control retinas (n = 3) were embedded in paraffin. Each entire peripheral retinal quadrant was serially sectioned at 6 microm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Nuclei above the internal limiting membrane were then counted in a masked manner. The total number of nuclei counted per retina was defined as the nucleus count (704-938 sections per retina; 12,900 sections). Correlations were evaluated using Spearman rank coefficients.\nThe nucleus count was 0 to 44 in room air control retinas, 0 to 40 in negative OIR retinas, and 250 to 5634 in positive OIR retinas. The nucleus count was highly correlated with the clock hour score (r(s) = 0.95, P = 0.0001). For the paired retinas, there was a significant correlation between right and left eyes in the severity of NV (clock hours; r(s) = 0.76, P = 0.0001) and the ratio of retinal vascular area to total retinal area (r(s) = 0.81, P = 0.0001).\nThe more rapid method of counting clock hours in flatmounted ADPase-stained retinas is valid for quantifying NV in rat models of ROP. Incidence and severity of NV and vascularized areas were similar between left and right eyes, which permits the use of paired retinas for complementary research techniques.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2000-03-11", "authors": ["SZhang", "D ALeske", "J MHolmes"], "doi": null}

However, clinical results have shown that hydroxyapatite may require biological modification with a bone resorption-inhibiting agent which may be beneficial for maintenance of alveolar bone. We conducted experimental and clinical studies to evaluate the effect of highly bisphosphonate-complexed hydroxyapatite implants on osteoconduction and repair in alveolar bone.\nPorous hydroxyapatite implants were pre-incubated in 10(-2)M bisphosphonate solutions at pH 3.49. The implants had a diameter of 2.1 mm and a height of 2 mm and adsorbed 115 microg bisphosphonate. Five goats were implanted with 4 plain hydroxyapatite implants on each side of the mandible in root extraction sockets for the precision analysis of dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measurements. Ten goats were implanted with 4 bisphosphonate/hydroxyapatite implants on one side of the mandible and 4 plain hydroxyapatite implants on the opposite mandible. In a clinical study, 23 bisphosphonate/hydroxyapatite implants were placed in periodontally destroyed tooth root sockets and followed up during one year.\nThe range for the bone mineral density (BMD) measurement errors for goat histologic sections was 0.48% to 1.03%. There were large differences in peri-implant BMDs in the left and right mandible of the same goat, irrespective as to whether hydroxyapatite or bisphosphonate/hydroxyapatite implants were present. This was due to local anatomical differences typical of alveolar bone. These differences were not significant.

In patients peri-implant healing was clinically and radiographically comparable to plain hydroxyapatite implants. All implants were retained and no dehiscences developed. Radiographically, peri-implant radiolucencies disappeared and alveolar bone was deposited in close proximity to the implants.\nThis study contributes to the understanding of the biological properties of hydroxyapatite implants as carriers for the bone-modulating agent bisphosphonate.

{"title": "The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in pig fetal tissue and primary stromal-vascular cultures.", "abstract": "This study was designed to determine when peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is expressed in developing fetal adipose tissue and stromal-vascular adipose precursor cells derived from adipose tissue. In addition we examined developing tissue for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) expression to see if it was correlated with PPARgamma expression. Pituitary function and hormones involved with differentiation (dexamethasone and retinoic acid) were also tested for their effects on PPARgamma expression to determine if hormones known to affect differentiation also effect PPARgamma expression in vivo and in cell culture.\nDeveloping subcutaneous adipose tissues from the dorsal region of the fetal pig were collected at different gestation times and assayed using Western blot analysis to determine levels of PPARgamma and C/EBPbeta. Hypophysectomy was performed on 75-day pig fetuses and tissue samples were then taken at 105 days for Western blot analysis. Adipose tissue was also taken from postnatal pigs to isolate stromal-vascular (S-V) cells. These adipose precursor cells were grown in culture and samples were taken for Western blot analysis to determine expression levels of PPARgamma.\nOur results indicate that PPARgamma is expressed as early as 50 days of fetal development in adipose tissue and continues through 105 days. Expression of PPARgamma was found to be significantly enhanced in adipose tissue from hypophysectomized fetuses at 105 days of fetal development (p<0.05). C/EBPbeta was not found in 50- or 75-day fetal tissues and was found only at low levels in 105-day tissues. C/EBPbeta was not found in hypophysectomized (hypoxed) 105-day tissue where PPARgamma was elevated. S-V cells freshly isolated from adipose tissue of 5- to 7-day postnatal pigs showed the expression of PPARgamma1. When S-V cells were cultured, both PPARgamma1 and 2 were expressed after the first day and continued as cells differentiated. High concentrations of retinoic acid decreased PPARgamma expression in early S-V cultures (p<0.05).\nOur data indicate that PPARgamma is expressed in fetal adipose tissue very early before distinct fat cells are observed and can be expressed without the expression of C/EBPbeta. The increase in PPARgamma expression after hypophysectomy may explain the increase in fat cell size under these conditions. Adipose precursor cells (S-V cells) from 5- to 7-day postnatal pigs also express PPARgamma in the tissue before being induced to differentiate in culture. Thus S-V cells from newborn pig adipose tissue are probably more advanced in development than the 3T3-L1 cell model.

During the early hours of revascularization, there is a transitory \"congestion\" of the liver graft, which is evidence of an early phase that we have termed \"first cellular contact.\"\nWe have carried out by flow cytometry a prospective comparative study of the peak kinetics of lymphocyte subpopulations contained in: (a) peripheral blood and liver grafts at the time of multi-organ extraction from 14 brain-dead donors, (b) recipient peripheral blood before transplantation, and (c) recipient peripheral blood and liver grafts after (t=2 h) declamping and vascularization of the liver graft.\nBefore transplantation, the liver grafts contained large numbers of natural killer (NK) and NK-like cells with early lymphocyte activation. Immediately after revascularization, there was an influx of recipient NK and NK-like cells into the liver.\nNK and CD3+CD56+ (NK-like) cells flooding into the liver graft immediately after revascularization could rapidly destroy allogeneic cells. However, spontaneous tolerance and the persistence of donor lymphocytes after orthotopic liver transplant could be a result of donor TCRalphabeta NK1.1 liver graft lymphocytes, which may be involved in the destruction of CD8+ T lymphocytes that would have received the apoptosis signal, and to NK and NK-like cell inhibition via inhibitory NK receptors.

The hallmark of acute vascular rejection is diffuse intravascular coagulation; however, the pathogenesis of coagulation is a matter of controversy. One line of evidence points to activated endothelial cells and another to activated inflammatory cells as a source of tissue factor and thus as a primary cause of this lesion. The distinction between the two mechanisms inducing coagulation in the xenograft provides an opportunity for specific intervention.\nTo explore these mechanisms, we studied the expression of tissue factor mRNA by in situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in relation to the histopathologic manifestations of acute vascular rejection in guinea pig hearts transplanted into rats treated by cobra venom factor to avoid the hyperacute rejection.\nThree hours after transplantation and before the deposition of fibrin, tissue factor mRNA was expressed in the endothelial cells lining small and medium blood vessels and in smooth muscle cells of guinea pig cardiac xenografts. Sixteen hours after transplantation, while rat tissue factor mRNA was expressed only in occasional infiltrating cells, cardiac xenografts showed prominent deposits of fibrin in small vessels. Maximum expression of tissue factor on rat infiltrating cells was observed 48 hr after transplantation.\nThese results suggest that in acute vascular rejection, coagulation is initiated on the donor vascular system, while the procoagulant characteristics of infiltrating cells may reflect a response to tissue injury rather than a cause.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2000-03-09", "authors": ["TNagayasu", "SSaadi", "R AHolzknecht", "T BPlummer", "J LPlatt"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200002270-00003"}

Induction of tolerance by transplantation of composite thymokidneys to thymectomized recipients.", "abstract": "Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the presence of the thymus is essential for rapid and stable tolerance induction in allotransplant models. We now report an attempt to induce tolerance to kidney allografts by transplanting donor thymic grafts simultaneously with the kidney in thymectomized recipients. Recipients were thymectomized 3 wk before receiving an organ and/or tissues from a class I-mismatched donor. Recipients received 1) a kidney allograft alone, 2) a composite allogeneic thymokidney (kidney with vascularized autologous thymic tissue under its capsule), or 3) separate kidney and thymic grafts from the same donor. All recipients received a 12-day course of cyclosporine. Thymectomized animals receiving a kidney allograft alone or receiving separate thymic and kidney grafts had unstable renal function due to severe rejection with the persistence of anti-donor cytotoxic T cell reactivity. In contrast, recipients of composite thymokidney grafts had stable renal function with no evidence of rejection histologically and donor-specific unresponsiveness. By postoperative day 14, the thymic tissue in the thymokidney contained recipient-type dendritic cells. By postoperative day 60, recipient-type class I positive thymocytes appeared in the thymic medulla, indicating thymopoiesis. T cells were both recipient and donor MHC-restricted. These data demonstrate that the presence of vascularized-donor thymic tissue induces rapid and stable tolerance to class I-disparate kidney allografts in thymectomized recipients.

It is thought that most autoreactive T cells are deleted in the thymus during the process of negative selection. However, peripheral tolerance mechanisms also exist to prevent development of autoimmune diseases against peripheral self-Ags. It has been proposed that T cells develop tolerance to peripheral self-Ags encountered in the absence of inflammation or \"danger\" signals. We have used immunodeficient Rag 1-/- mice to study the response of T cells to neo-self peripheral Ags in the form of well-healed skin and vascularized cardiac allografts. In this paper we report that skin and cardiac allografts without evidence of inflammation are vigorously rejected by transferred T cells or when recipients are reconstituted with T cells at a physiologic rate by nude bone graft transplantation. These results provide new insights into the role of inflammation or \"danger\" in the initiation of T cell-dependent immune responses.

In experiment 2, 12 rats were classified into two groups according to the presence of mechanical loading. This involved vascularized bone grafts with external fixators, and vascularized bone grafts with external fixators removed after bone union. The bone dynamics of the grafts were investigated by several methods, including roentgenographic analysis, histologic studies, and fluorochrome labeling. In experiment 1, a slight bone formation was recognized in the conventional bone graft, while irregular bone formation with creeping substitution was observed in the cuff graft. The vascularized bone graft showed significant hypertrophy; hypertrophy of the vascularized bone with fracture was greater than that without fracture. In experiment 2, markedly circumferential bone formation was observed after removal of the external fixator, while slight new bone formation was observed during the late postoperative period in bone with an external fixator.

{"title": "Tissue interactions mediate early events in pulmonary vasculogenesis.", "abstract": "Extensive study has provided considerable insight into the mechanisms governing branching morphogenesis and developmental maturation of the pulmonary epithelium. The process by which the vascular tree arises in the mesodermal mesenchyme of the developing lung, however, is not known. Because normal epithelial branching and differentiation have been shown to be dependent on interactions with the lung mesenchyme, we hypothesized that the developing pulmonary vasculature is dependent on a reciprocal interaction with pulmonary epithelium. In this study we have defined the temporal and spatial expression of flk-1 mRNA, which encodes an endothelial cell-specific vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, in fetal and neonatal rat lung. Flk-1-positive cells were observed in the lung at every prenatal stage from fetal day 11 through birth, demonstrating that vascularization has been initiated as soon as the lung evaginates from the foregut epithelium. The spatial distribution of vascular precursors was distinct and consistent in early lung (fetal days 11-16): clusters of flk-1-positive cells were localized in the mesenchyme closely apposed to the developing epithelium. This spatial relationship between vascular precursors and the developing epithelium suggested that vascular development in the lung may be dependent on interactions between the two tissue types. To investigate this possibility, day-13 distal lung mesenchyme was cultured in the presence and absence of lung epithelium. Lung mesenchyme cultured in the absence of epithelium degenerated significantly, and few flk-1-positive cells were maintained. In contrast, lung mesenchyme recombined with lung epithelium contained abundant flk-1-positive cells, and their spatial distribution mimicked that observed in vivo.

{"title": "Remodeling of the vascular bed and progressive loss of capillaries in denervated skeletal muscle.", "abstract": "Very little is known regarding structural and functional responses of the vascular bed of skeletal muscle to denervation and about the role of microcirculatory changes in the pathogenesis of post-denervation muscle atrophy. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes of the anatomical pattern of vascularization of the extensor digitorum longus muscle in WI/HicksCar rats 1, 2, 4, 7, 12, and 18 months following denervation of the limb. We found that the number of capillaries related to the number of muscle fibers, i.e. the capillary-to-fiber ratio (CFR), decreased by 88%, from 1.55 +/- 0.35 to 0.19 +/- 0.04, during the first 7 months after denervation and then slightly declined at a much lower rate during the next 11 months of observation to 10% of the CFR in normal muscle. Between months 2 and 4 after denervation, the CRF decreased by 2.4 times, from 58% to 24% of the control value. The loss of capillaries during the first 4 months following nerve transection was nearly linear and progressed with an average decrement of 4.16% per week. Electron microscopy demonstrated progressive degeneration of capillaries following nerve transection. In muscle cells close to degenerating capillaries, the loss of subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar mitochondria, local disassembly of myofibrils and other manifestations of progressive atrophy were frequently observed. The levels of devascularization and the degree of degenerative changes varied greatly within different topographical areas, resulting in significant heterogeneity of intercapillary distances and local capillary densities within each sample of denervated muscle. Perivascular and interstitial fibrosis that rapidly developed after denervation resulted in the spatial separation of blood vessels from muscle cells and their embedment in a dense lattice of collagen. As a result of this process, diffusion distances between capillaries and the surfaces of muscle fibers increased 10-400 times. Eighteen months after denervation most of the capillaries were heavily cushioned with collagen, and on the average 40% of the muscle cells were completely avascular. Devascularization of the tissue was accompanied by degeneration and death of muscle cells that had become embedded in a dense lattice of collagen. Immunofluorescent staining for the vascular isoform of alpha-actin revealed preservation of major blood vessels and a greater variability in thickness of their medial layer. Hyperplastic growth of the medial layer in some blood vessels resulted in narrowing of their lumens. By the end of month 7 after denervation, large deposits of collagen around arterioles often exceeded their diameters. Identification of oxidative muscle fibers after immunostaining for slow-twitch myosin, as well as using ultrastructural criteria, has shown that after 2 months of denervation oxidative muscle fibers were less susceptible to atrophy than glycolytic fibers. The lower rate of atrophy of type I muscle fibers at early stages of denervation may be explained by their initially better vascularization in normal muscle and their higher capacity to retain capillaries shortly after denervation. Thus, degeneration and loss of capillaries after denervation occurs more rapidly than the loss of muscle fibers, which results in progressive decrease of the CFR in denervated muscle. The change of capillary number in denervated muscle is biphasic: the phase of a rapid decrease of the CFR during the first 7 months after nerve transection is followed by the phase of stabilization. The presence of areas completely devoid of capillaries in denervated muscle and the virtual absence of such areas in normal muscle indicate the development of foci of regional hypoxia during long-term denervation. The anatomical pattern of muscle microvascularization changes dramatically after nerve transection. Each muscle fiber in normal muscle directly contacts on average 3-5 capillaries.

{"title": "The molecular basis of lung morphogenesis.", "abstract": "To form a diffusible interface large enough to conduct respiratory gas exchange with the circulation, the lung endoderm undergoes extensive branching morphogenesis and alveolization, coupled with angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. It is becoming clear that many of the key factors determining the process of branching morphogenesis, particularly of the respiratory organs, are highly conserved through evolution. Synthesis of information from null mutations in Drosophila and mouse indicates that members of the sonic hedgehog/patched/smoothened/Gli/FGF/FGFR/sprouty pathway are functionally conserved and extremely important in determining respiratory organogenesis through mesenchymal-epithelial inductive signaling, which induces epithelial proliferation, chemotaxis and organ-specific gene expression. Transcriptional factors including Nkx2.1, HNF family forkhead homologues, GATA family zinc finger factors, pou and hox, helix-loop-helix (HLH) factors, Id factors, glucocorticoid and retinoic acid receptors mediate and integrate the developmental genetic instruction of lung morphogenesis and cell lineage determination. Signaling by the IGF, EGF and TGF-beta/BMP pathways, extracellular matrix components and integrin signaling pathways also directs lung morphogenesis as well as proximo-distal lung epithelial cell lineage differentiation. Soluble factors secreted by lung mesenchyme comprise a 'compleat' inducer of lung morphogenesis. In general, peptide growth factors signaling through cognate receptors with tyrosine kinase intracellular signaling domains such as FGFR, EGFR, IGFR, PDGFR and c-met stimulate lung morphogenesis. On the other hand, cognate receptors with serine/threonine kinase intracellular signaling domains, such as the TGF-beta receptor family are inhibitory, although BMP4 and BMPR also play key inductive roles. Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells differentiate earliest in gestation from among multipotential lung epithelial cells. MASH1 null mutant mice do not develop PNE cells. Proximal and distal airway epithelial phenotypes differentiate under distinct transcriptional control mechanisms. It is becoming clear that angiogenesis and vasculogenesis of the pulmonary circulation and capillary network are closely linked with and may be necessary for lung epithelial morphogenesis. Like epithelial morphogenesis, pulmonary vascularization is subject to a fine balance between positive and negative factors.

Specifically, we used Y-shaped grafts to assess the orientation pattern of regenerating axons in the distal stump tissue. Animal models were divided into four experimental groups. The proximal part of the Y-shaped conduit was sutured to a severed tibial nerve in all experiments. The two distal stumps were sutured to different targets: group A to two intact nerves (tibial and peroneal), group B to an intact nerve and an unvascularized tendon, group C to an intact nerve and a vascularized tendon, and group D to a nerve graft and an unvascularized tendon. Morphological evaluation by light and electron microscopy was conducted in the distal forks of the Y-shaped tube. Data showed that almost all regenerating nerve fibers spontaneously oriented towards the nerve tissue (attached or not to the peripheral innervation field), showing a good morphological pattern of regeneration in both the early and late phases of regeneration.

{"title": "Xenotransplantation model for vascularized musculoskeletal tissues in rodents.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to establish a model and to define the mechanism of rejection for the transplantation of vascularized musculoskeletal xenografts between C57BL/6j (B6) mice and Lewis rats. This was accomplished by using conventional skin xenografts to determine immunologic baseline data between these species and by performing musculoskeletal grafts from the B6 mice transplanted into Lewis rats. After the transplant, the xenografts were examined histologically and the recipients were assessed for immune reaction using in vitro assays to measure both cell-mediated and humoral responses. The results obtained from the skin xenografts showed activation of both cellular and humoral immunologic responses. All musculoskeletal xenografts were rejected between 3 and 4 postoperative days. Histologically, the grafts showed extensive vascular injury manifested by thrombosis and hemorrhage, suggesting an early humoral response. Anti-donor antibody production was detected in the recipient's sera soon after rejection of the xenogeneic tissue. The cell-mediated immune response, although detectable by the in vitro assays, was less pronounced than the humoral response and corroborated the histologic findings of mild lymphocyte infiltration in the rejected tissue. These results demonstrate that humoral rejection plays a predominant role in the rejection of vascularized musculoskeletal xenotransplants between concordant species. This mouse-to-rat vascularized xenograft model will be utilized for further studies on inducing tolerance to vascularized musculoskeletal xenografts.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2000-03-07", "authors": ["Y NTanabe", "M ARandolph", "AShimizu", "W PLee"], "doi": "10.1002/(sici)1098-2752(2000)20:2<59::aid-micr3>3.0.co;2-6"}
{"title": "Computer simulation of cytotoxic and vascular effects of radiosurgery in solid and necrotic brain metastases.", "abstract": "Solid and necrotic brain tumors respond to radiosurgery, although necrotic lesions often contain a significant proportion of hypoxic cells which cannot become reoxygenated during the short overall treatment time of single dose application. In addition to the direct cytotoxic action, delayed vascular occlusion followed by ischemic tumor cell death could contribute to the effect of radiosurgery.\nIn order to determine the impact of the two possible effects on tumor response, a 3-dimensional computer simulation was developed and fitted to response data obtained from 90 patients who were treated by LINAC radiosurgery for 1-3 brain metastases with median marginal doses of 20 Gy. Complete response rates were as follows: small, solid lesions (diameter 0.4-1 cm), 52% (12/23); large solid lesions (1.1-5.2 cm), 28% (17/60); large necrotic lesions, 12% (6/50). The 3-dimensional computer model simulated the growth of small solid and large, solid or necrotic tumors situated in a vascularized stroma. Oxygen supply, tumor cell division (cell cycle time 5 days), neovascularization, tumor cell kill by single dose irradiation (linear-quadratic model, alpha/beta=10 Gy, oxygen enhancement ratio 3.0) and time-dependent vascular occlusion (alpha/beta=3 Gy) were modeled by Monte-Carlo simulation techniques.\nIn the presence of neovascularization, solid tumors with a hypoxic fraction of 1-2% developed. Without neoangiogenesis, central necrosis occurred, and tumors had a hypoxic fraction of 20-25%. Assuming a pure cytotoxic effect of radiosurgery, neither the dose-response relationship for the solid lesions of different size nor that for the large lesions with solid or necrotic appearance could be reproduced for any given level of radiosensitivity. This was only possible by introducing a vascular effect that led to the occlusion of >/=99% of the vessels at the border of the target volume within 1 year after irradiation. In the presence of the vascular effect, the apparent radiosensitivity of the tumor cells was increased by 50-100%. Calculations of the dose-equivalent for the vascular effect show that it contributes 19-33% of the overall effect of single dose radiosurgery.\nThis simulation study suggests that the therapeutic effect of single radiosurgery in malignant brain tumors cannot be understood without the consideration of vascular effects. The computer model might serve as a basis for exploring new treatment modalities that modify both cytotoxic and vascular effects of radiosurgery.", "journal": "Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology", "date": "2000-03-04", "authors": ["MKocher", "HTreuer", "JVoges", "MHoevels", "VSturm", "R PM\u00fcller"], "doi": "10.1016/s0167-8140(99)00168-1"}

Average length of bone defect was 12 cm, and average length offibula harvested was 18.6 cm. Soft-tissue defect was always associated and ranged from 8 x 4 cm to 20 x 30 cm. The fibula was harvested with the lateral part of the soleus muscle in 10 cases and with the whole soleus muscle in 4 cases.

Although diffusion from the valve surface is the presumed source, the presence, distribution and importance of the aortic valve's vascular bed is unclear.\nSeventeen porcine hearts (51 cusps) were obtained at slaughter. The coronary circulation was pressure-rinsed with a heparin solution and filled with an Aquablack solution at physiological pressure. The cusps were subsequently dissected and fixed for viewing with an inverted microscope. The anterior leaflet of the mitral valve was evaluated as a control for the vessel filling protocol. Using Adobe Photoshop and captured images, whole cusps were reconstructed, a grid was overlaid and vascular distribution evaluated.\nOf the 15 porcine aortic valves that filled, 32/45 (71%) of the cusps contained vessels. Nine valves had vasculature in all three cusps and two valves were completely avascular. Vessels were found predominantly in the basal third of the cusps and extended in from the commissures almost to the level of the free edge. There was a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) between the appearance of vessels in the basal region and in the mid and free edge regions of the valve. No difference in vascularization pattern was noted between the left, right or non-coronary cusps.\nThe presence of a vasculature suggests that the metabolic activity of the cusp is greater than can be supported by diffusion from the cusp surface alone. The absence of functioning vessels might explain the failure associated with cryopreserved implants and may play a role in the durability problems faced by bioprosthetic valves. It will also be important to consider the role of this intrinsic circulation with the advent of tissue-engineered valves.", "journal": "The Journal of heart valve disease", "date": "2000-03-04", "authors": ["K LWeind", "C GEllis", "D RBoughner"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Neo-osseous flaps using demineralized allogeneic bone in a rat model.", "abstract": "Surgical reconstruction with revascularized bone grafts can be compromised by donor tissue limitations and may be refined by prefabrication of compound neoflaps using bone substitutes. The principal suitability of demineralized allogeneic bone (DALB) slabs in fabricating neo-osseous flaps based on the inferior epigastric vascular system was studied and compared with neoflaps with autologous bone (AUB). In 45 rats, the histological pattern of bone formation in response to angiogenesis induced by vessel implantation was assessed, and characteristics of vascularization of the neoflap were studied microangiographically at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. Histological techniques included decalcified and nondecalcified sections, as well as intravital polyfluorochrome labeling. Blood flow of the neoflap was also assessed quantitatively using 15-microm microspheres labeled with technetium 99-methylene diphosphate (99-MDP) 8 weeks after flap fabrication. Although the DALB neoflaps showed consistent bone formation and neovascularization, the bone regeneration process was delayed distinctly in comparison with AUB. Microangiographically, however, no differences between the two types of grafts became apparent during all time periods tested. Furthermore, the radioactivity of the DALB neoflap, which means bone blood flow per dry weight, was significantly higher than in AUB grafts and even more than that of intact iliac bone (p = 0.001). The exact meaning of elevated blood flow in DALB and similar degrees of vascularization corresponding to native AUB grafts remains to be determined, but may be a sign of ongoing bone formation resulting in a suitable DALB-containing neo-osseous flap in the long term.

Animals were killed on postoperative days 10, 15, 35, and 55. Adhesions to the SILASTIC (Dow Corning) patch were scored based on their extent, type, and tenacity. Angiogenesis was quantified digitally as the area of vascularized peritoneum over the patch.\nAt day 10, when TNP-470 was stopped, the percentage of vascularized peritoneum over the patch was less in treatment animals than in controls (P = .004). At day 35, the patch in treatment animals was completely covered by vascularized peritoneum, similar to controls. Adhesions in TNP-470 animals were reduced at day 10 compared with controls (P<.05) and remained reduced off treatment at day 55.\nAngiogenesis appears to play an important role in the development of intraabdominal adhesions, because the extent of early neovascularization correlates with adhesion formation.

The three most common indications for the use of these fixation devices were a displaced malleolar fracture, a chevron osteotomy for hallux valgus, and a displaced fracture of the radial head. In 107 patients, the reaction was elicited by a polyglycolic acid implant, and in one patient by a polylactic acid implant. The incidences were 5.3% (107 of 2037) and 0.2% (one of 491), respectively. The adverse tissue responses to polyglycolic acid were seen 11 weeks after the operation, on average, whereas the reaction to polylactic acid occurred 4.3 years after fixation of an ankle fracture. The mild reactions consisted of a painful erythematous papule of a few weeks' duration. Those of medium severity had a sinus that discharged remnants of the implant for up to 6 months. In the patients affected by severe reactions, extensive osteolytic lesions developed at the implant tracks. The histopathologic picture was that of a nonspecific foreign body reaction. In four patients with vigorous reactions, an arthrodesis of the wrist or ankle later was necessary because of severe osteoarthritis. Several markers of increased risk of the occurrence of a foreign body reaction were found. These included a poorly vascularized bone section such as scaphoid, use of a quinone dye as an additive in the polymer, and an implant geometry with large surface area (screw versus pin or rod). For polyglycolic acid implants, the risk of an adverse tissue response in a given clinical situation can be estimated from the findings of this study.

The current study constitutes the mean 8.8 years followup (range, 3-12.5 years) of a consecutive series of 55 proximal femoral allografts in 51 patients. In 46 patients the implant was cemented into the allograft and the distal femur, and the host proximal femur was resected at the time of reconstruction in all but seven patients. Five patients underwent revision surgery for acetabular failure, and six additional patients underwent revision surgery for failure of the proximal femoral allograft. Three patients underwent successful revision surgery and had additional proximal femoral allografts. Failure was caused by graft fracture in one patient, by deep infection in two patients, and by junctional nonunion in three patients. Junctional nonunion was seen in five patients (9%), two of whom were treated successfully with bone grafting and bone grafting and plating, respectively. Instability was observed in six patients (11%). Trochanteric nonunion was seen in 22 patients (43%) and trochanteric escape was seen in 14 patients (27%). The mean Harris hip score improved from 39 to 79 points. Resorption involving the full thickness of the allograft in at least one zone was seen in seven patients. This progressed rapidly and silently within the first 3 years but has yet to lead to the failure of any of the reconstructions. Infection was ruled out in every case. Allograft resorption was seen in seven patients and may be related to a combination of factors.

Although vascularized and cancellous autograft show optimum skeletal incorporation, host morbidity limits autograft availability. Experimental studies have confirmed an immune response to allograft bone, but the clinical significance of this response in humans still is unclear. Small amounts of cancellous allograft in humans usually are remodeled completely; large allografts become incorporated by limited, surface intramembranous bone formation suggesting that these graft are primarily osteoconductive. Several synthetic skeletal substitute materials also are osteoconductive, and may show remodeling characteristics similar to allograft. Demineralized bone matrix and some isolated or synthetic proteins can induce endochondral bone formation, and therefore are osteoinductive. The extent and distribution of remodeling of bone graft materials are influenced by many factors, including the quality of the host site and the local mechanical environment (strain).

All patients were treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy combined with induction (platinum- and 5-fluorouracil-based) or concurrent platinum chemotherapy. The follow-up of patients ranged from 6 to 108 months (median, 48 months). Nuclear TP expression was significantly associated with increased microvessel score (P < 0.0001, r = 0.45). A low percentage of cancer cells with nuclear TP expression in pretreatment biopsies was associated with a high rate of CR after combined chemoradiotherapy (P = 0.006) and induction chemotherapy (0.01).

The study of the blood-brain barrier and its various realms offers a myriad of opportunities for scientific exploration. This review focuses on two of these areas in particular: the induction of the blood-brain barrier and the molecular mechanisms underlying this developmental process. 2. The creation of the blood-brain barrier is considered a specific step in the differentiation of cerebral capillary endothelial cells, resulting in a number of biochemical and functional alterations. Although the specific endothelial properties which maintain the homeostasis in the central nervous system necessary for neuronal function have been well described, the inductive mechanisms which trigger blood-brain barrier establishment in capillary endothelial cells are unknown. 3. The timetable of blood-brain barrier formation is still a matter of debate, caused largely by the use of varying experimental systems and by the general difficulty of quantitatively measuring the degree of blood-brain barrier \"tightness.\" However, there is a general consensus that a gradual formation of the blood-brain barrier starts shortly after intraneural neovascularization and that the neural microenvironment (neurons and/or astrocytes) plays a key role in inducing blood-brain barrier function in capillary endothelial cells. This view stems from numerous in vitro experiments using mostly cocultures of capillary endothelial cells and astrocytes and assays for easily measurable blood-brain barrier markers. In vivo, there are great difficulties in proving the inductive influence of the neuronal environment. Also dealt with in this article are brain tumors, the least understood in vivo systems, and the induction or noninduction of barrier function in the newly established tumor vascularization. 4.

Four mice were grafted with explants of menstrual endometrium, four with explants of late proliferative endometrium, and seven with explants of late secretory-premenstrual endometrium. Typical endometrial glands and stroma were observed in 87% of cases 3 weeks after the transplantation. All the grafts revealed histological characteristics of the proliferative phase, even when the endometrial biopsy was taken during the late secretory phase. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the proliferation index was high, whatever the menstrual phase of the endometrial biopsy. An extensive vascular network developed at the interface between the graft and the surrounding tissue. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) positive stained cells were observed in all grafts, the VEGF score being significantly higher in epithelial cells than in stromal cells. In conclusion, human endometrial explants, cultured for 24 h, could be successfully transplanted into nude mice.

Marmoset corpora lutea were examined throughout the cycle, and natural regression was compared with induced luteolysis after administration of a prostaglandin F(2alpha) analogue or gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist. Steroidogenic and endothelial cells were positive for proliferation markers. Endothelial cell proliferation was highest during luteal formation, then decreased and remained low during the luteal phase and functional regression, however endothelial cell proliferation increased during structural regression. Endothelial cell proliferation was unchanged by induced regression. The area of vW immunostaining was highest during luteal formation, decreased thereafter and remained constant during the luteal phase and regression. Distribution of immunostaining indicated the presence of an extensive capillary network, but during structural regression the numbers of capillaries decreased and numbers of microvessels increased. These results suggest that vascular changes are concurrent with changes in the functional status of the marmoset corpus luteum.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2000-02-25", "authors": ["F MYoung", "F ERodger", "P JIllingworth", "H MFraser"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/15.3.557"}

{"title": "Evidence for progesterone receptors in the human fetoplacental vascular tree.", "abstract": "The presence of progesterone receptors (PR) throughout the human term fetoplacental vascular tree was investigated. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we showed expression of PR mRNAs in stem villi vessels, chorionic arteries and veins, and umbilical arteries and veins. Binding studies and Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of high-affinity binding sites for (3)H-R5020 (promegestone) in cytosolic extracts of all placental vessels, with K(d) values in the range of 2.5-4 nM. High levels of PR were detected in placental vessels compared to other vascular tissues. Thus, maximum binding capacities of stem villi vessels, chorionic arteries and veins, and umbilical arteries and veins were 247 +/- 25, 377 +/- 58, 295 +/- 40, 371 +/- 118, and 672 +/- 144 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Endothelial cell elimination in chorionic arteries did not significantly modify the number of PR. RT-PCR and binding studies also assessed PR expression in cultured placental vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from stem villi vessels. All these data suggested that most of the PR of fetoplacental vessels were from the media. In conclusion, we report here the first evidence of the presence of PR in the muscular layer of human term fetoplacental vessels. This finding, together with the high progesterone concentrations in cord blood, suggests that the interactions between the PR and its ligand may play a role in the physiology and physiopathology of human fetoplacental vascularization.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2000-02-24", "authors": ["CCudeville", "FMondon", "BRobert", "RRebourcet", "T MMignot", "CBenassayag", "FFerr\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod62.3.759"}

The functional parameter expressed in terms of half-time (t(1/2); time taken for the fluorescence to reach 50% of the peak in the systemic circulation), which is inversely proportional to blood flow, showed that in the tumor-free implants t(1/2) values decreased from 11.55 +/- 1 min at day 1 to 5.7 +/- 0. 44 min by day 14. In the tumor-bearing implants, this process was accelerated and maximum vascularization was achieved by day 7 (3 days after tumor cell inoculation). Increases in t(1/2) values were observed at days 10 and 14, which paralleled the tumor growth as indicated by wet weight. The hemoglobin content (microg Hb/mg wet weight) in the tumor-free group increased during the 14-day period. In contrast, in the tumor-bearing implants. Hb concentration decreased per unit of tissue weight. Dexamethasone treatment for 13 days prevented fibrovascular tissue infiltration in tumor-free implants, but was unable to delay tumor growth, indicating that this procedure can be used to exclude the inflammatory reaction induced by the implantation technique, thus allowing tumor angiogenesis to be studied without the confounding influence of the host inflammatory cells.

In order to elucidate the significance of angiogenesis in different stages of epithelial skin tumours, we analysed the vessel density in ten normal skin samples, 14 actinic keratosis (AK), 12 hypertrophic AKs, and in nine early- and 16 late-stage squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Mean vascular density was quantitated by counting the number of CD 31-immunostained blood vessels and by morphometric assessment of stained vessel area by computer-assisted image analysis. The results from both methods were well correlated. Mean vascular density was similar in normal dermis and in AK, and only slightly elevated in hypertrophic AKs and early SCC stages (tumour thickness < 2 mm). Only late-stage SCCs infiltrating the subcutis exhibited a significant increase in vascularization. Vessel density was independent of tumour localization, degree of proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration. Furthermore, tumour vascularization was not correlated with the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, a major angiogenic factor, as revealed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.

{"title": "Elevated matrix metalloprotease and angiostatin levels in integrin alpha 1 knockout mice cause reduced tumor vascularization.", "abstract": "Integrin alpha1beta1 is a collagen receptor abundantly expressed on microvascular endothelial cells. As well as being the only collagen receptor able to activate the Ras/Shc/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway promoting fibroblast cell proliferation, it also acts to inhibit collagen and metalloproteinase (MMP) synthesis. We have observed that in integrin alpha1-null mice synthesis of MMP7 and MMP9 was markedly increased compared with that of their wild-type counterparts. As MMP7 and MMP9 have been shown to generate angiostatin from circulating plasminogen, and angiostatin acts as a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation, we determined whether tumor vascularization was altered in the alpha1-null mice. Tumors implanted into alpha1-null mice showed markedly decreased vascularization, with a reduction in capillary number and size, which was accompanied by an increase in plasma levels of angiostatin due to the action of MMP7 and MMP9 on circulating plasminogen. In vitro analysis of alpha1-null endothelial cells revealed a marked reduction of their proliferation on both integrin alpha1-dependent (collagenous) and independent (noncollagenous) substrata. This reduction was prevented by culturing alpha1-null cells with plasma derived from plasminogen-null animals, thus omitting the source from which to generate angiostatin. Plasma from tumor-bearing alpha1-null animals uniquely inhibited endothelial cell growth, and this inhibition was relieved by the coaddition of either MMP inhibitors, or antibody to angiostatin. Integrin alpha1-deficient mice thus provide a genetically characterized model for enhanced angiostatin production and serve to reveal an unwanted potential side effect of MMP inhibition, increased tumor angiogenesis.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2000-02-19", "authors": ["APozzi", "P EMoberg", "L AMiles", "SWagner", "PSoloway", "H AGardner"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.040378497"}

{"title": "Embryonic vasculogenesis by endothelial precursor cells derived from lung mesenchyme.", "abstract": "During development, the lung mesenchyme has a dynamic relationship with the branching airway. Embryonic lung mesenchyme is loosely packed and composed of indistinguishable cells, yet it is the source of vascular progenitors that will become endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. In the lung, vessel development in the periphery proceeds first through vasculogenesis, the migration and assembly of cells into a primitive network, and subsequently, through angiogenesis, the sprouting of vessels from this network. As a way to assess the cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung vascularization, we have isolated and cloned cell lines from mouse fetal lung mesenchyme (MFLM). Two of these MFLM cell lines, MFLM-4 and MFLM-91U, display characteristics of an endothelial lineage. RNA analysis demonstrates transcripts for the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors R1 and R2, the receptor tyrosine kinases, Tie-1 and Tie-2, as well as the Tie-2 ligands, Ang-1 and -2. The MFLM cell lines form extensive networks of capillary-like structures with lumens when cultured on a reconstituted basement membrane. In vivo, following blastocyst injection, the MFLM cells chimerize endothelium of the lung and areas of the heart vasculature. The results from these studies suggest that MFLM-4 and MFLM-91U, derived from embryonic lung mesenchyme, can function in vitro and in vivo as endothelial precursors and as models of cardiopulmonary vascularization.

Several parameters (i.e., macrophages, giant cells, T-cells, B-cells, granulocytes, expression of MHC class II, stroma formation, and degradation and calcification of the biomaterial) were compared between wild-type (WT) and KO mice. Remarkably, the foreign-body reaction was very similar in WT and KO mice. In both, giant cells were formed, but in contrast to previous results in AO rats, phagocytosis of HDSC bundles occurred hardly at all up to 9 weeks, and MHC class II expression was minimal. Stroma formation and vascularization were high and calcification occurred. T-cells comprised less than 1%; a few plasma cells were present in the KO mice at later time points.

{"title": "Intussusceptive angiogenesis: its role in embryonic vascular network formation.", "abstract": "Intussusceptive angiogenesis is a novel mode of blood vessel formation and remodeling, which occurs by internal division of the preexisting capillary plexus without sprouting. In this study, the process is demonstrated in developing chicken eye vasculature and in the chorioallantoic membrane by methylmethacrylate (Mercox) casting, transmission electron microscopy, and in vivo observation. In a first step of intussusceptive angiogenesis, the capillary plexus expands by insertion of numerous transcapillary tissue pillars, ie, by intussusceptive microvascular growth. In a subsequent step, a vascular tree arises from the primitive capillary plexus as a result of intussusceptive pillar formation and pillar fusions, a process we termed \"intussusceptive arborization.\" On the basis of the morphological observations, a 4-step model for intussusceptive arborization is proposed, as follows: phase I, numerous circular pillars are formed in rows, thus demarcating future vessels; phase II, formation of narrow tissue septa by pillar reshaping and pillar fusions; phase III, delineation, segregation, growth, and extraction of the new vascular entity by merging of septa; and phase IV, formation of new branching generations by successively repeating the process, complemented by growth and maturation of all components. In contrast to sprouting, intussusceptive angiogenesis does not require intense local endothelial cell proliferation; it is implemented primarily by rearrangement and attenuation of the endothelial cell plates. In summary, transcapillary pillar formation, ie, intussusception, is a central and probably widespread process, which plays a role not only in capillary network growth and expansion (intussusceptive microvascular growth), but also in vascular plexus remodeling and tree formation (intussusceptive arborization).", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2000-02-19", "authors": ["VDjonov", "MSchmid", "S ATschanz", "P HBurri"], "doi": "10.1161/01.res.86.3.286"}

A free graft (skin on mucosa) is sutured around the stent and brought at the place of the endoscopically opened stricture where the graft is fixed with a suture through skin, bulbar muscles and spongiosum. A suprapubic diversion is left for 10 days. The stent keeps the graft in contact with surrounding well vascularized tissue where it can take. Other parts of the graft become necrotic. The stent hydrolyses in about 3 weeks.\n10 patients with bulbar strictures from 2 to 4 cm in length and failed previous urethrotomies were treated successfully with this technique.

Despite strong similarities in their activation mechanisms (e.g. they both undergo rapid hypoxia-induced protein stabilization, bind identical target DNA sequences, and induce synthetic reporter genes to similar degrees), they are both essential for embryo survival via distinct functions during vascularization (HIF-1alpha) or catecholamine production (HLF). It is currently unknown how such specificity of action is achieved. We report here that DNA binding by HLF, but not by HIF-1alpha, is dependent upon reducing redox conditions. In vitro DNA binding and mammalian two-hybrid assays showed that a unique cysteine in the DNA-binding basic region of HLF is a target for the reducing activity of redox factor Ref-1. Although the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of HIF-1alpha can function in the absence of Ref-1, we found that the C-terminal region containing the transactivation domain requires Ref-1 for full activity.

In the first part of the study, two radiologists independently evaluated the visibility of first-, second-, and third-order branch arteries in the neck. In the second part of the study, the number of feeding arteries for every paraganglioma was determined and compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), the standard of reference in this study.\nThree-dimensional TOF angiography was superior to the other MR angiography techniques studied (P < .05) for depicting branch arteries of the external carotid artery in the neck, but only first- and second-order vessels were reliably shown. DSA showed a total of 78 feeding arteries in the group of patients with 29 paragangliomas, which was superior to what was revealed by all MR angiography techniques studied.

Nineteen of the 25 experimental rats (76 percent) of the animals survived without complication from the surgery and there were no abnormalities in the liver biochemical tests of these animals.

Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of retinal vasculogenesis and in the development of retinal NV in ischemic retinopathies. However, insulin-like growth factor-I and possibly other growth factors also participate in the development of retinal NV and intraocular injections of VEGF antagonists only partially inhibit retinal NV. One possible conclusion from these studies is that it is necessary to block other growth factors in addition to VEGF to achieve complete inhibition of retinal NV. We recently demonstrated that a partially selective kinase inhibitor, PKC412, that blocks phosphorylation by VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors and several isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC), completely inhibits retinal NV. In this study, we have used three additional selective kinase inhibitors with different selectivity profiles to explore the signaling pathways involved in retinal NV. PTK787, a drug that blocks phosphorylation by VEGF and PDGF receptors, but not PKC, completely inhibited retinal NV in murine oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy and partially inhibited retinal vascularization during development. CGP 57148 and CGP 53716, two drugs that block phosphorylation by PDGF receptors, but not VEGF receptors, had no significant effect on retinal NV.

Animals were treated with subcutaneous injections of a cyclic alpha(v)-integrin antagonist (cRGDfV, 15 mg/kg body wt) or saline twice daily. Additional animals received intrastromal implants containing 400 ng bFGF together with either Lm609 (mAb, anti-alpha(v)beta(3)) or control antibody. Four days later, the animals were killed and the percentage of the surface area covered with vessels determined using digital image analysis.\nSystemic treatment with cRGDfV resulted in a significant reduction of corneal vessel growth in animals with bFGF-induced corneal vascularization. In corneas with silver nitrate burns, systemic cRGDfV treatment showed no significant reduction of vascularization compared with controls. Pellets containing bFGF and LM609 mAb induced significantly less neovascularization than pellets containing bFGF and control mAb.\nOur results suggest that in the rat cornea, alpha(v)beta(3) ligation does inhibit bFGF-induced neovascularization.

There is a familial predisposition, and an autosomal-dominant transmission is presumed. They are commonly located in the jugular region; in rare cases a polytopic manifestation is found. We describe the case of a 47-year-old male patient who was referred to our department because of a progressive swelling of the neck on both sides. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography had displayed soft tissue tumors in the jugular regions. We performed an operative exploration, which showed a highly vascularized tumor. Histopathologic analysis revealed the diagnosis of a paraganglioma. An angiography of the neck and thoracic region, furthermore, revealed an additional paraganglioma in the anterior mediastinum.

{"title": "Qualitative and quantitative analysis of embryonic pulmonary vessel formation.", "abstract": "Vessel formation in the lung has been described as occurring by two mechanisms: proximal, or branch, pulmonary arteries develop via angiogenesis; and distal, smaller vessels form by vasculogenesis. Connections between the proximal and distal vessels establish the final vascular network. The preponderance of vessel formation has been suspected to occur during the canalicular stage of lung development. To test these hypotheses, reporter gene expression under control of the regulatory domain of fetal liver kinase-1 (flk), an early endothelial cell-specific marker, was used to evaluate mouse lungs from embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) through 2 wk postnatal age. Morphologic assessment was performed after histochemical staining, and quantification of vessel development by a chemiluminescent assay was compared with overall embryonic lung growth. LacZ expression under flk promoter control allowed: (1) early identification of differentiating endothelial cells of the branch pulmonary arteries; (2) visualization of distal vessels forming in the lung mesenchyme (primary capillary network) with subsequent remodeling; (3) recognition of early continuity between proximal and distal vessels, occurring by E10.5; and (4) assessment of developing pulmonary veins and venous confluence. Quantitative analysis revealed increased flk regulated beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity of 12 ng beta-gal/lung at E12.5 to 3,215 ng beta-gal/lung at 2 wk, which corresponded to overall lung growth during this period as shown by an increase in total protein content per lung from 35 microg at E12.5 to 6,456 microg at 2 wk after birth. We identified endothelial cell precursors of the developing pulmonary vasculature before vessel lumen formation. Continuity between the proximal pulmonary artery and vessels forming in the distal mesenchyme was present even at the earliest stage evaluated, suggesting endothelial cell differentiation at the site of vessel formation (i.e., vasculogenesis) as occurs with development of the aorta. Finally, we demonstrated that lung vessel development was not accentuated during the canalicular stage, but occurred at all stages and directly corresponded to overall lung growth.", "journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "date": "2000-02-05", "authors": ["S KSchachtner", "YWang", "HScott Baldwin"], "doi": "10.1165/ajrcmb.22.2.3766"}

Although some have suggested that activation of coagulation in tumors is not linked to activation of platelets, no data exist to either support or refute this concept. However, platelet turnover in cancer patients is often increased, and platelets are carriers of angiogenic growth factors. We hypothesized that platelets are involved in tumor-associated angiogenesis. To obtain evidence supporting this hypothesis, we have studied whether the angiogenic and coagulation pathways and platelets are concomitantly activated in cancer patients with soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) using a novel method to detect activated platelets in tumor specimens. Twelve patients with STS were selected on the basis of having intratumoral accumulation of fluid, which was aspirated. These accumulations demonstrated very high concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor and coagulation factors (including thrombin-antithrombin-complex). Tumor specimens showed dense vascularization with intense vascular endothelial growth factor expression and the presence of activated platelets.

I: primary outcomes.", "abstract": "To determine the efficacy and safety of supplemental therapeutic oxygen for infants with prethreshold retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) to reduce the probability of progression to threshold ROP and the need for peripheral retinal ablation.\nPremature infants with confirmed prethreshold ROP in at least 1 eye and median pulse oximetry <94% saturation were randomized to a conventional oxygen arm with pulse oximetry targeted at 89% to 94% saturation or a supplemental arm with pulse oximetry targeted at 96% to 99% saturation, for at least 2 weeks, and until both eyes were at study endpoints. Certified examiners masked to treatment assignment conducted weekly eye examinations until each study eye reached ophthalmic endpoint. An adverse ophthalmic endpoint for an infant was defined as reaching threshold criteria for laser or cryotherapy in at least 1 study eye. A favorable ophthalmic endpoint was regression of the ROP into zone III for at least 2 consecutive weekly examinations or full retinal vascularization. At 3 months after the due date of the infant, ophthalmic findings, pulmonary status, growth, and interim illnesses were again recorded.\nSix hundred forty-nine infants (325 conventional and 324 supplemental) were enrolled from 30 centers over 5 years. Five hundred ninety-seven (92.0%) infants attained known ophthalmic endpoints, and 600 (92%) completed the ophthalmic 3-month assessment. The rate of progression to threshold in at least 1 eye was 48% in the conventional arm and 41% in the supplemental arm. After adjustment for baseline ROP severity stratum, plus disease, race, and gestational age, the odds ratio (supplemental vs conventional) for progression was.72 (95% confidence interval:.52, 1.01). Final structural status of all study eyes at 3 months of corrected age showed similar rates of severe sequelae in both treatment arms: retinal detachments or folds (4.4% conventional vs 4.1% supplemental), and macular ectopia (3.9% conventional vs 3.9% supplemental). Within the prespecified ROP severity strata, ROP progression rates were lower with supplemental oxygen than with conventional oxygen, but the differences were not statistically significant. A post hoc subgroup analysis of plus disease (dilated and tortuous vessels in at least 2 quadrants of the posterior pole) suggested that infants without plus disease may be more responsive to supplemental therapy (46% progression in the conventional arm vs 32% in the supplemental arm) than infants with plus disease (52% progression in conventional vs 57% in supplemental). Pneumonia and/or exacerbations of chronic lung disease occurred in more infants in the supplemental arm (8.5% conventional vs 13.2% supplemental). Also, at 50 weeks of postmenstrual age, fewer conventional than supplemental infants remained hospitalized (6.8% vs 12.7%), on oxygen (37.0% vs 46.8%), and on diuretics (24.4% vs 35. 8%). Growth and developmental milestones did not differ between the 2 arms.\nUse of supplemental oxygen at pulse oximetry saturations of 96% to 99% did not cause additional progression of prethreshold ROP but also did not significantly reduce the number of infants requiring peripheral ablative surgery. A subgroup analysis suggested a benefit of supplemental oxygen among infants who have prethreshold ROP without plus disease, but this finding requires additional study. Supplemental oxygen increased the risk of adverse pulmonary events including pneumonia and/or exacerbations of chronic lung disease and the need for oxygen, diuretics, and hospitalization at 3 months of corrected age. Although the relative risk/benefit of supplemental oxygen for each infant must be individually considered, clinicians need no longer be concerned that supplemental oxygen, as used in this study, will exacerbate active prethreshold ROP.", "journal": "Pediatrics", "date": "2000-02-02", "authors": [], "doi": "10.1542/peds.105.2.295"}

{"title": "A neurocutaneous island flap model: an experimental study in rats.", "abstract": "Neurocutaneous flaps have been popularized recently in clinical reconstructive surgery. However, controversies exist concerning their anatomy and physiology. The particular role of neural vasculature in the survival of these skin flaps is also quite undefined in the experimental setting, and additional studies on this subject are necessary. The goal of this study was to describe a neurocutaneous flap in a rat model and to investigate its blood supply. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300 to 350 g were used in this study, which was conducted in two stages. During the first stage, the lower extremities of 10 rats were dissected for the anatomic study of the neurocutaneous flap. A constant cutaneous nerve innervating the anterolateral thigh skin was exposed. It arose either from the saphenous nerve or the superficial epigastric nerve and was accompanied by a constant longitudinal arterial plexus. The tiny neural vessels were conveyed by the superficial fascia along their course. A 30 x 30-mm cutaneous island flap, which was based only on the cutaneous nerve with its accompanying vessels and a strip of superficial fascia, was raised on the anterolateral thigh skin using an operating microscope. The well-perfused skin territory was marked after sodium fluorescein injection. The stained skin territory was located centrally and medially on the whole island flap, and it was approximately 10 x 20 mm. This finding was confirmed by the qualitative assessment of the vascularity for this skin territory in microangiography. After studying the pedicle anatomy and determining the optimal viable skin island, the second stage of the study was performed. The remaining 20 rats were divided into two groups. In the experimental group (N = 10), a neurocutaneous island flap (10 x 20 mm) was outlined on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh at its middle third. It was designed in such a way that its short and long axes lay in the center of the distance between the anterior superior iliac spine and the anterior aspect of the knee joint. After identification and dissection of the neurovascular pedicle, the flap was raised in a lateral-to-medial direction without including the deep fascia. At this point the flap remained connected only by the pedicle and a strip of superficial fascia surrounding it. It was sutured in the same place. In the control group (N = 10), the pedicle of the flap was severed and the skin island was sutured back as a composite graft. All the experimental flaps survived well. In the control group, none of the flaps survived except one that was partially viable. The flaps in the experimental group were reelevated as neurocutaneous island flaps on day 7 for microangiographic study, and specimens were processed for histologic staining. Microangiography revealed the extent of neural vasculature and vascularization of the skin through cutaneous perforators. Histologic investigation demonstrated the neural vessels that were related closely to the superficial fascia. The authors propose a neurocutaneous island flap model in the lower extremity of the rat in which the survival of the flap depended mainly on the neural arterial supply. It was also demonstrated that the superficial fascia played a role as a connective tissue framework for conveying tiny neural blood vessels to reach the skin. This model may serve as a reproducible and reliable neurocutaneous island flap model for additional studies in this field.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2000-01-29", "authors": ["RG\u00fcr\u00fcnl\u00fco\u011flu", "MBayrami\u00e7li", "AS\u00f6nmez", "ANumano\u011flu"], "doi": "10.1097/00000637-200044010-00009"}

When compared to age-matched controls, hypoxic-reared animals displayed a significant increase in platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) protein levels, cerebral microvascular lumen diameter and number and density of vessels (number of capillaries per area). In control animals, ISH and immunohistochemistry revealed that localization of VEGF is restricted almost exclusively to cortical neurons at early stages of development. As the vascular bed begins to stabilize, predominant VEGF expression switches to maturing glial cells which invest vessels while neuronal expression is reduced to a basal level. In hypoxic animals, early localization of VEGF is also restricted to cortical neurons, however, during later developmental stages, glial cells express elevated levels of VEGF protein and high neuronal expression also persists.

It also exhibits an osteonecrosis of the femoral epiphysis that resembles the clinical features of Perthes' disease in humans. In this rat model, occlusion of the epiphyseal vessels occurs as a result of a breakdown of the mechanically vulnerable epiphysis. The postnatal development of the epiphysis recapitulates the serial events of the endochondral ossification (i.e., cartilage formation), chondrocyte hypertrophy, cartilage mineralization, vascularization, and introduction of osteoblasts that form the secondary ossification center within the epiphysis. In the present study, a detailed radiographic and histological analysis demonstrates that the osteonecrosis is preceded by a disturbance of the cartilage mineralization and a disturbance of the ossification, despite a normal hypertrophy of the epiphyseal cartilage. These observations suggest that abnormal development of the femoral epiphysis occurs much earlier than manifestation of the osteonecrosis. They lead us to a hypothesis that yet-unclarified transitional events between the cartilage hypertrophy and the cartilage mineralization may be affected in SHRs. Type X collagen is a developmentally regulated matrix molecule that is implicated in the mineralization of the hypertrophied chondrocytes. We show that the expression of type X collagen during epiphyseal ossification is delayed in SHRs (vs. normal controls), suggesting disturbed growth and/or differentiation of the epiphyseal chondrocytes. Postnatal growth and differentiation of the chondrocytes at least partly depend on insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which is produced by the chondrocytes in response to the pituitary growth hormone and stimulates cartilage growth in situ. The present study demonstrates an altered IGF-I expression during early postnatal life in SHRs and suggests that the altered IGF-I expression as well as the following delay in upregulation of type X collagen may cause the mechanical vulnerability of the femoral epiphysis in SHRs.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2000-01-26", "authors": ["MKikkawa", "SImai", "SHukuda"], "doi": "10.1359/jbmr.2000.15.1.111"}

Anti-BM-CSPG immunostaining was examined in the developing limb buds of 24 Sprague-Dawley rats at embryonic days 12 to 14 and 19. BM-CSPG immunostaining was present in 3 regions. The first region was located peripherally in the limb bud ectodermal basement membrane (BM) that separates ectoderm from mesoderm and was present at all embryonic stages examined. The second region was in the mesenchymal extracellular matrix independent of the vascular system. This staining pattern was diffuse, granular, and often homogeneous, except for clustering adjacent to developing vessels, and was observed distally in the limb bud. In the mesenchymal extracellular matrix adjacent to the distal BM this staining pattern formed fibrils that were perpendicular and connected to the limb bud BM and extended into the underlying mesenchyme. The third region was localized to the BM of developing blood vessels of the limb bud. Blood vessel staining allowed analysis of limb bud vessel formation. The early developing blood vessels at the proximal limb bud were organized differently from those located distally. Large central vessels were present proximally, whereas a rich plexus of smaller vascular channels was present at the distal margin. A subectodermal avascular zone was observed at the margin of the limb bud, except beneath the apical ectodermal ridge where immunostained blood vessels extended from the distal vascular plexus toward the apical ectodermal ridge. The formation of central larger vessels occurs proximally, whereas formation of peripheral smaller vessels seems to take place locally and distally under the influence of the apical ectodermal ridge.

{"title": "Bioabsorbable polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering capable of sustained growth factor delivery.", "abstract": "Engineering new tissues utilizing cell transplantation on biodegradable polymer matrices is an attractive approach to treat patients suffering from the loss or dysfunction of a number of tissues and organs. The matrices must maintain structural integrity during the process of tissue formation, and promote the vascularization of the developing tissue. A number of molecules (angiogenic factors) have been identified that promote the formation of new vascular beds from endothelial cells present within tissues, and the localized, controlled delivery of these factors from a matrix may allow an enhanced vascularization of engineered tissues. We have developed a gas foaming polymer processing approach that allows the fabrication of three-dimensional porous matrices from bioabsorbable materials (e.g., copolymers of lactide and glycolide [PLG]) without the use of organic solvents or high temperatures. The effects of several processing parameters (e.g., gas type, polymer composition and molecular weight) on the process were studied. Several gases (CO(2), N(2), He) were utilized in the fabrication process, but only CO(2) resulted in the formation of highly porous, structurally intact matrices. Crystalline polymers (polylactide and polyglycolide) did not form porous matrices, while amorphous copolymers (50:50, 75:25, and 85:15 ratio of lactide:glycolide) foamed to yield matrices with porosity up to 95%. The mechanical properties of matrices were also regulated by the choice of PLG composition and molecular weight. Angiogenic factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor) were subsequently incorporated into matrices during the fabrication process, and released in a controlled manner. Importantly, the released growth factor retains over 90% of its bioactivity. In summary, a promising system for the incorporation and delivery of angiogenic factors from three-dimensional, biodegradable polymer matrices has been developed, and the fabrication process allows incorporation under mild conditions.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2000-01-21", "authors": ["M HSheridan", "L DShea", "M CPeters", "D JMooney"], "doi": "10.1016/s0168-3659(99)00138-8"}

Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1995), and is of fundamental importance in understanding the processes by which a tumour achieves vascularization. Diffusible substances, collectively called tumour angiogenesis factors are released from the tumour to elicit a variety of responses from the surrounding tissues, most importantly the migration of endothelial cells (lining neighbouring vessels) towards the tumour. To facilitate locomotion, the cells exert appreciable traction forces upon the interstitial extracellular matrix which, in turn, influences the resulting direction of their migration. In this paper, we examine the role played by cellular traction during cell migration and the corresponding viscoelastic effects of the extracellular matrix.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2000-01-21", "authors": ["M JHolmes", "B DSleeman"], "doi": "10.1006/jtbi.1999.1038"}

T2-weighted spin echo and T1-weighted spin echo and gradient echo images were acquired before and 60 minutes after the intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-BOPTA. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the images were performed and correlated with histologic findings. The quantitative evaluation, performed on T1-weighted gradient echo images, looked at the percentage increase of liver enhancement after Gd-BOPTA administration, the lesion-to-liver contrast/noise (C/N) ratio before and after Gd-BOPTA administration, and the C/N variation after Gd-BOPTA administration. Qualitative assessment considered the morphologic features of the lesions as well as the visual variation of contrast before and after Gd-BOPTA administration. Finally, a histologic evaluation was made of the degree of differentiation of the lesions and of the presence of fatty metaplasia, necrosis, bile, or intratumoral peliosis.\nAmong the parameters affecting lesion identification were the extent of liver function, degree of vascularization, residual functionality of the tumor cells, and characteristics of the neoplastic tissue. Positive correlations (Spearman coefficients = 0.359 and 0.393, respectively) were observed precontrast between the degree of liver failure and the amount of contrast noise, and postcontrast between the amount of intralesional fatty metaplasia and the extent to which lesion conspicuity worsened after Gd-BOPTA administration. An inverse correlation (Spearman coefficient = -0.330) was observed between the degree of lesion differentiation and the visible appearance after Gd-BOPTA administration, with well-differentiated lesions tending toward worsened conspicuity postcontrast. A statistically significant difference (P = 0.001) was observed in the mean precontrast C/N ratio for lesions later showing unchanged conspicuity and worse conspicuity on postcontrast images, respectively. Marked variation (P = 0.019) was also observed between Child A and B cirrhotic patients for the degree of hepatic enhancement on postcontrast images.\nThe results suggest that liver parenchyma signal intensity is influenced by the extent to which liver function is compromised, that residual hepatocytic functionality permits Gd-BOPTA uptake by certain lesions and that this uptake might subsequently impair the observed C/N ratio on delayed images, and that the worsening of lesion conspicuity on postcontrast images is influenced also by high quantities of intralesional fatty metaplasia.", "journal": "Investigative radiology", "date": "2000-01-19", "authors": ["LGrazioli", "GMorana", "RCaudana", "ABenetti", "NPortolani", "GTalamini", "RColombari", "GPirovano", "M AKirchin", "ASpinazzi"], "doi": "10.1097/00004424-200001000-00003"}

Adenosine immunolocalization was performed on frozen sections with an antibody against adenosine conjugated to laevulinic acid using a streptavidin peroxidase technique. Triplicate room air control animals at different postnatal ages and triplicate oxygen-treated animals at different time points during or after hyperoxic insult were analyzed.

Adjacent sections were incubated for von Willebrand factor to label blood vessels.\nDuring normal vasculogenesis, AI was most prominent within the inner retina. The peak of immunoreactivity was located at the border of vascularized retina throughout the period of primary retinal vasculogenesis (1-15 days of age). At 22 days when vasculogenesis was complete, AI decreased within the inner retina. The highest 5'N activity was localized to inner Muller cell processes in inner retina and decreased after vasculogenesis was complete. In animals killed after 4 days of oxygen breathing, the vasoobliterative stage of OIR, AI and 5'N activity were reduced throughout the retina.

A histologically supported anatomic study was conducted for the reappraisal of the anatomic relationships and clinical application potentials of the data obtained. Anatomy of the temporoparietal fascia was investigated on 20 sides from 10 cadavers. After dissections, necropsies were obtained to demonstrate histologic features of the temporoparietal fascia. The outer part of the temporoparietal fascia is continuous with the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) in the inferior border and with orbicularis oculi and frontalis muscles in the anterior border. Therefore, plication of the temporoparietal fascia can increase tightness of the SMAS, orbicularis oculi, and frontalis muscle in rhytidectomy. The frontal branches of facial nerve were noted to course parallel to the frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery, lying deeper to the temporoparietal fascia within the innominate fascia. In the view of these findings, conventional subfascial dissection, which is performed to protect frontal branches of the facial nerve, is not reasonable during the temporal part of rhytidectomy. Careful subcutaneous dissection just under the hair follicles is more appropriate to avoid nerve injury and also provides excellent exposure of the temporoparietal fascia for plication in rhytidectomy with protection of the auriculotemporal nerve and the superficial temporal vessels. Furthermore, two layered structures of the temporoparietal fascia are very suitable to insert a framework into the temporoparietal fascia for ear reconstruction to eliminate some of the shortcomings of Brent's technique. A thin muscle layer was also noted within the outer part of the temporoparietal fascia below the temporal line; the term \"temporoparietal myofascial flap\" would, therefore, be more accurate than \"temporoparietal fascial flap.\" Finally, the innominate fascia and the deep temporal fascia can be elevated with the two layers of the temporoparietal myofascial flap to obtain a well-vascularized, four-layered myofascial flap based on the superficial temporal vessels.

{"title": "Defective glomerulogenesis in the absence of laminin alpha5 demonstrates a developmental role for the kidney glomerular basement membrane.", "abstract": "Laminins are major components of all basement membranes. They are a diverse group of alpha/beta/gamma heterotrimers formed from five alpha, three beta, and three gamma chains. Laminin alpha5 is a widely expressed chain found in many embryonic and adult basement membranes. During embryogenesis, alpha5 has a role in disparate developmental processes, including neural tube closure, digit septation, and placentation. Here, we analyzed kidney development in Lama5 mutant embryos and found a striking defect in glomerulogenesis associated with an abnormal glomerular basement membrane (GBM). This correlates with failure of the developmental switch in laminin alpha chain deposition in which alpha5 replaces alpha1 in the GBM at the capillary loop stage of glomerulogenesis. In the absence of a normal GBM, glomerular epithelial cells were in disarray, and endothelial and mesangial cells were extruded from within the constricting glomerulus, leading to a complete absence of vascularized glomeruli. In addition, a minority of Lama5 mutant mice lacked one or both kidneys, indicating that laminin alpha5 is also important in earlier kidney development. Our results demonstrate a dual role for laminin alpha5 in kidney development, illustrate a novel defect in glomerulogenesis, and indicate a heretofore unappreciated developmental role for the GBM in influencing the behavior of epithelial and endothelial cells.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2000-01-08", "authors": ["J HMiner", "CLi"], "doi": "10.1006/dbio.1999.9546"}

{"title": "Enhanced vascularization of cultured skin substitutes genetically modified to overexpress vascular endothelial growth factor.", "abstract": "Cultured skin substitutes have been used as adjunctive therapies in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds, but they are limited by lack of a vascular plexus. This deficiency leads to greater time for vascularization compared with native skin autografts and contributes to graft failure. Genetic modification of cultured skin substitutes to enhance vascularization could hypothetically lead to improved wound healing. To address this hypothesis, human keratinocytes were genetically modified by transduction with a replication incompetent retrovirus to overexpress vascular endothelial growth factor, a specific and potent mitogen for endothelial cells. Cultured skin substitutes consisting of collagen-glycosaminoglycan substrates inoculated with human fibroblasts and either vascular endothelial growth factor-modified or control keratinocytes were prepared, and were cultured in vitro for 21 d. Northern blot analysis demonstrated enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA in genetically modified keratinocytes and in cultured skin substitutes prepared with modified cells. Furthermore, the vascular endothelial growth factor-modified cultured skin substitutes secreted greatly elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor protein throughout the entire culture period. The bioactivity of vascular endothelial growth factor protein secreted by the genetically modified cultured skin substitutes was demonstrated using a microvascular endothelial cell growth assay. Vascular endothelial growth factor-modified and control cultured skin substitutes were grafted to full-thickness wounds on athymic mice, and elevated vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA expression was detected in the modified grafts for at least 2 wk after surgery. Vascular endothelial growth factor-modified grafts exhibited increased numbers of dermal blood vessels and decreased time to vascularization compared with controls.

{"title": "Targeting of the chemokine receptor CCR1 suppresses development of acute and chronic cardiac allograft rejection.", "abstract": "Although mononuclear cell infiltration is a hallmark of cellular rejection of a vascularized allograft, efforts to inhibit rejection by blocking leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion have proved largely unsuccessful, perhaps in part because of persistent generation of chemokines within rejecting grafts. We now provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that in vivo blockade of specific chemokine receptors is of therapeutic significance in organ transplantation. Inbred mice with a targeted deletion of the chemokine receptor CCR1 showed significant prolongation of allograft survival in 4 models. First, cardiac allografts across a class II mismatch were rejected by CCR1(+/+) recipients but were accepted permanently by CCR1(-/-) recipients. Second, CCR1(-/-) mice rejected completely class I- and class II-mismatched BALB/c cardiac allografts more slowly than control mice. Third, levels of cyclosporin A that had marginal effects in CCR1(+/+) mice resulted in permanent allograft acceptance in CCR1(-/-) recipients. These latter allografts showed no sign of chronic rejection 50-200 days after transplantation, and transfer of CD4(+) splenic T cells from these mice to naive allograft recipients significantly prolonged allograft survival, whereas cells from CCR1(+/+) mice conferred no such benefit. Finally, both CCR1(+/+) and CCR1(-/-) allograft recipients, when treated with a mAb to CD4, showed permanent engraftment, but these allografts showed florid chronic rejection in the former strain and were normal in CCR1(-/-) mice.

Both intermuscular space cutaneous arteries and intermuscular septal cutaneous arteries anastomosed by branches as arterial chains along the intermuscular spaces and septa where the stem arteries ran through. Arteries of each type gave off epi- and subfascial branches to the deep fascia, and the former were greater in number and larger in diameter. In the same way, the vascular network was thicker in the epifascial level than that in the subfascial level.

{"title": "Meniscal injuries: A critical review.", "abstract": "Although once perceived as an unimportant vestigial structure, the menisci of the knee are now known to be a common source of knee pain and disability. The medial meniscus is more vulnerable to injury to due to its intimate attachment to the medial collateral ligament. The moveable lateral meniscus is less prone to tear except when the ACL is injured. The medial and lateral menisci are usually injured as a result of sudden knee flexion with a component of knee internal or external rotation. However, older patients may present without a specific mechanism of injury as their meniscal injuries are often due to degenerative processes. Most meniscal injuries can be diagnosed with a thorough physical examination utilizing the McMurray, Apley, and ``bounce home'' maneuvers. Joint line tenderness and the presence of a knee effusion aid in the diagnosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become the test of choice in confirming injury. MRI also defines the type, location, and severity of meniscal injury. Some meniscal injuries, particularly peripheral, well-vascularized tears, may be more prone to healing with nonsurgical management. Typical initial management includes reduction of swelling and pain. Rehabilitation stresses tri-planar functional retraining. The final phases of rehabilitation incorporate a functional progression to sports or work specific activities. Arthroscopic knee surgery has become a prevalent treatment method for bucket handle tears and non-vascularized meniscal injuries. Meniscal repair is currently preferred over partial menisectomy to avoid premature osteoarthritis.

{"title": "[A Rare Fracture-dislocation of Talus.].", "abstract": "In the introduction the authors analyze the issues of the fractures of talus which is a key connection between the foot and the lower limb. For the prognosis of the healing of fractures of the talus they consider the most important its retrograde vascularization. Further they decribe types of fractures of the talus according to Hawkins. In their view a certain role is played also by the mechanism of the injury. The core of the work is a case report of a 34-year old mountaineer who sustained a very rare fracturedislocation of the talus which was treated by open reduction and fixation by means of K-wires. During the 18-month follow-up they recorded a full bone consolidation of the fracture without any symptoms of the feared avascular necrosis. In the conclusion they compare the data in literature with their own results. Key words: fractures of talus, typology of fractures after Hawkins, surgical treatment.", "journal": "Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca", "date": "2000-01-01", "authors": ["JMas\u00e1r", "IMudr\u00e1k"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Restrained chondrocyte proliferation and maturation with abnormal growth plate vascularization and ossification in human FGFR-3(G380R) transgenic mice.", "abstract": "Achondroplasia, the most common genetic form of human dwarfism, results from a point mutation (G380R) in the gene for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3). Heterozygotes for the mutation share disproportionate, proximal shortening of the limbs, mid-face hypoplasia and relative macrocephaly due to a failure in endochondral ossification. Here we have generated transgenic mice expressing the human mutant FGFR-3 under the transcriptional control of the mouse gene. Mice that are hemizygous for the mutant human gene display disproportionate dwarfism with skeletal phenotypes remarkably similar to those of human achondroplasia. Mice that are homozygous for the transgene suffer from a profound delay in skeletal development and die at birth, similar in that respect to humans homozygous for the achondroplasia mutant gene. Microscopic analysis of long bones demonstrates growth plate morphology compatible with that of human achondroplasia cases, sharing endochondral growth inhibition with restrained chondrocyte proliferation and maturation, penetration of ossification tufts and aberrant vascularization.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "1999-12-23", "authors": ["OSegev", "IChumakov", "ZNevo", "DGivol", "LMadar-Shapiro", "YSheinin", "MWeinreb", "AYayon"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/9.2.249"}
{"title": "Ventilatory mechanics and the effects of water depth on breathing pattern in the aquatic caecilian Typhlonectes natans.", "abstract": "The breathing pattern in the aquatic caecilian Typhlonectes natans was investigated by recording airflow via a pneumotachograph under unrestrained normal physiological conditions. Ventilatory mechanics were assessed using airflow and pressure measurements from the buccal cavity and trachea. The breathing pattern consisted of an expiratory phase followed by a series of 10-15 small buccal pumps to inflate the lung, succeeded by a long non-ventilatory period. T. natans separate the expiratory and inspiratory gases in the buccal cavity and take several inspiratory pumps, distinguishing their breathing pattern from that of sarcopterygians. Hydrostatic pressure assisted exhalation. The tracheal pressure was greater than the water pressure at that depth, suggesting that pleuroperitoneal pressure as well as axial or pulmonary smooth muscles may have contributed to the process of exhalation. The frequency of lung ventilation was 6.33+/-0.84 breaths h(-)(1), and ventilation occurred via the nares. Compared with other amphibians, this low ventilatory frequency suggests that T. natans may have acquired very efficient pulmonary respiration as an adaptation for survival in their seasonally fluctuating natural habitat. Their respiratory pathway is quite unique, with the trachea separated into anterior, central and posterior regions. The anterior region serves as an air channel, the central region is attached to the tracheal lung, and the posterior region consists of a bifurcated air channel leading to the left and right posterior lungs. The lungs are narrow, elongated, profusely vascularized and compartmentalized. The posterior lungs extend to approximately two-thirds of the body length. On the basis of their breathing pattern, it appears that caecilians are phylogenetically derived from two-stroke breathers.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "1999-12-23", "authors": ["K CPrabha", "D GBernard", "MGardner", "N JSmatresk"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.203.2.263"}
{"title": "Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1: mechanisms and consequences.", "abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor that plays essential roles in mammalian development and physiology. HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta subunits. The expression and activity of the HIF-1alpha subunit are tightly regulated by cellular O2 concentration. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 activates the transcription of genes encoding erythropoietin, glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, vascular endothelial growth factor, and other genes whose protein products increase O2 delivery or facilitate metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. HIF-1 is essential for embryonic vascularization and survival, neovascularization in ischemic myocardium, hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling, and tumor vascularization. HIF-1alpha is overexpressed in the majority of common human cancers and their metastases, due to the presence of intratumoral hypoxia and as a result of mutations in genes encoding oncoproteins and tumor suppressors. Pharmacologic manipulation of HIF-1 levels may provide a novel therapeutic approach to diseases that represent the most common causes of mortality in Western society, including cancer, chronic lung disease, and myocardial ischemia.", "journal": "Biochemical pharmacology", "date": "1999-12-22", "authors": ["G LSemenza"], "doi": "10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00292-0"}
{"title": "Dendritic cells genetically engineered to express Fas ligand induce donor-specific hyporesponsiveness and prolong allograft survival.", "abstract": "Polarization of an immune response toward tolerance or immunity is dictated by the interactions between T cells and dendritic cells (DC), which in turn are modulated by the expression of distinct cell surface molecules, and the cytokine milieu in which these interactions are taking place. Genetic modification of DC with genes coding for specific immunoregulatory cell surface molecules and cytokines offers the potential of inhibiting immune responses by selectively targeting Ag-specific T cells. In this study, the immunomodulatory effects of transfecting murine bone marrow-derived DC with Fas ligand (FasL) were investigated. In this study, we show that FasL transfection of DC markedly augmented their capacity to induce apoptosis of Fas+ cells. FasL-transfected DC inhibited allogeneic MLR in vitro, and induced hyporesponsiveness to alloantigen in vivo. The induction of hyporesponsiveness was Ag specific and was dependent on the interaction between FasL on DC and Fas on T cells. Finally, we show that transfusion of FasL-DC significantly prolonged the survival of fully MHC-mismatched vascularized cardiac allografts. Our findings suggest that DC transduced with FasL may facilitate the development of Ag-specific unresponsiveness for the prevention of organ rejection. Moreover, they highlight the potential of genetically engineering DC to express other genes that affect immune responses.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "1999-12-22", "authors": ["W PMin", "RGorczynski", "X YHuang", "MKushida", "PKim", "MObataki", "JLei", "R MSuri", "M SCattral"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.164.1.161"}
{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor as prognostic factor in renal cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been recognized as an important constituent of vascularization and growth of solid tumors. Serum VEGF levels were evaluated and correlated to clinicopathologic findings and clinical outcome in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).\nSerum samples were collected before surgery in 164 patients with RCC. Levels of VEGF165 protein in sera were measured using a quantitative ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.\nThe VEGF165 level in serum was significantly increased (p = 0.0001) in patients with RCC (median 343.4 pg./ml.) compared with the control patients (median 103.8 pg./ml.). The level of VEGF165 in serum correlated to clinical stage and histopathological grade. Patients with VEGF165 levels below median value had significantly longer survival time than patients with higher levels (p = 0.0001). This was also shown when VEGF165 was analyzed in univariate Cox regression (p = 0.0001). The impact of VEGF165 on survival was especially shown in patients having tumors with vein invasion (pT3b-c N0 M0) and in patients with clinical stages I - III (p = 0.0240 and p = 0.0023, respectively). When using multivariate analysis, only tumor stage and grade remained as independent prognostic variables.\nIn RCC, serum VEGF165 level was significantly correlated to tumor stage and grade. Increased levels were correlated to adverse survival. Although, VEGF did not remain as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis the levels of VEGF165 in serum was found useful for the identification of patients with potentially progressive disease especially for those with vein invasion.", "journal": "The Journal of urology", "date": "1999-12-22", "authors": ["JJacobsen", "TRasmuson", "KGrankvist", "BLjungberg"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Tissue-specific requirements for the proprotein convertase furin/SPC1 during embryonic turning and heart looping.", "abstract": "Furin, the mammalian prototype of a family of serine proteases, is required for ventral closure and axial rotation, and formation of the yolk sac vasculature. Here we show additionally that left-sided expression of pitx2 and lefty-2 are also perturbed in Furin-deficient embryos. These tissue abnormalities are preceded by a marked delay in the expansion of the definitive endoderm during gastrulation. Using a chimera approach, we show that Furin activity is required in epiblast derivatives, including the primitive heart, gut and extraembryonic mesoderm, whereas it is nonessential in the visceral endoderm. Thus, chimeric embryos, derived by injecting wild-type embryonic stem (ES) cells into fur(-/-) blastocysts, develop normally until at least 9.5 d.p.c. In contrast, Furin-deficient chimeras developing in the context of wild-type visceral endoderm fail to undergo ventral closure, axial rotation and yolk sac vascularization. Fur(-/-) cells are recruited into all tissues examined, including the yolk sac vasculature and the midgut, even though these structures fail to form in fur mutants. The presence of wild-type cells in the gut strikingly correlates with the ability of chimeric embryos to undergo turning. Overall, we conclude that Furin activity is essential in both extraembryonic and precardiac mesoderm, and in definitive endoderm derivatives.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "1999-12-22", "authors": ["D BConstam", "E JRobertson"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.127.2.245"}
{"title": "Clinical significance of MUC1 and E-cadherin expression, cellular proliferation, and angiogenesis at the deepest invasive portion of colorectal cancer.", "abstract": "We examined MUC1 and E-cadherin expression, cellular proliferation, and tumor vascularization at the deepest invasive portion of colorectal cancer in relation to prognosis. One hundred and ten surgically resected specimens of advanced colorectal carcinoma were studied. E-cadherin and MUC1 expression and Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) were examined immunohistochemically at the site of deepest tumor invasion. Tumor vascularization was also examined immunohistochemically using anti-CD34 antibody to determine the microvessel count (MVC). In curative resection, patients with a high Ki-67 LI, reduced E-cadherin expression, MUC1-positive and high MVC lesion showed a significantly poorer prognosis than those with a low Ki-67 LI, E-cadherin normal, MUC1-negative and low MVC lesion, respectively. Furthermore, patients with both a high Ki-67 LI and MVC lesion showed a significantly poorer prognosis than those with other Ki-67 LI and MVC relations. Patients with both a MUC1-positive and E-cadherin reduced lesion showed a significantly poorer prognosis than those with both a MUC1-negative and E-cadherin normal lesion. The significant risk factors in order of poorer prognosis by the multivariate analysis among these factors including routinely used clinicopathologic factors were the high MVC, E-cadherin reduced expression, and lymph node metastasis. These findings indicate a high MVC at the site of deepest tumor invasion to be the most important predictor of colorectal cancer prognosis among the factors studied here.", "journal": "International journal of oncology", "date": "1999-12-22", "authors": ["TKimura", "STanaka", "KHaruma", "KSumii", "GKajiyama", "FShimamoto", "NKohno"], "doi": "10.3892/ijo.16.1.55"}
