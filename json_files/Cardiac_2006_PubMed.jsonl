{"title": "Cardiac cell survival and reversibility of myocardial ischemia.", "abstract": "Because of a limited capacity for cell regeneration, the cardiac tissue, when submitted to ischemic stress, may activate endogenous mechanisms of cell survival resulting in physiological conditions of adaptation to ischemia, known as myocardial stunning, ischemic preconditioning and myocardial hibernation. These conditions result from a switch in gene and protein expression, which sustains cardiac cell survival in a context of oxygen deprivation and during the stress of reperfusion. Understanding how the molecular adaptation of the cardiac myocyte during stress sustains its survival in these conditions might help to define novel mechanisms of endogenous myocardial salvage, in order to expand the conditions of maintained cellular viability and functional salvage of the ischemic myocardium. This review summarizes recent progress made in the study of the molecular pathways controlling reversible ischemic dysfunction, and the unraveling of novel genomic paradigms. We also focus on the discovery and characterization of novel genes, which further increase our knowledge of myocardial ischemia and open novel therapeutic possibilities for ischemic heart disease.", "journal": "Archives des maladies du coeur et des vaisseaux", "date": "2008-10-24", "authors": ["ERashed", "CDepre"], "doi": null}

After eight weeks on their respective diets, the hearts were excised and subjected to 30 min of global ischemia and 45 min of reperfusion. Electrocardiogram traces were recorded throughout the experiment and were subsequently analyzed for QT interval duration, left ventricular pressure, arrhythmia incidence and arrhythmia duration. Plasma and cardiac tissue were analyzed for fatty acid content and composition.\nCholesterol-fed animals exhibited significantly higher PUFA levels in their plasma, but this did not directly translate into higher PUFA levels in their cardiac fractions. There were no significant differences among the groups in the incidence or duration of ischemia-derived arrhythmias. During reperfusion, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of fibrillation in the hearts obtained from cholesterol-fed and hempseed- plus cholesterol-fed rabbits compared with the hearts from delipidated hempseed-fed rabbits.\nDietary hempseed induced limited beneficial effects on cardiac function during ischemia/reperfusion challenge.

{"title": "DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR OF A PACED CARDIAC FIBER.", "abstract": "Consider a typical experimental protocol in which one end of a one-dimensional fiber of cardiac tissue is periodically stimulated, or paced, resulting in a train of propagating action potentials. There is evidence that a sudden change in the pacing period can initiate abnormal cardiac rhythms. In this paper, we analyze how the fiber responds to such a change in a regime without arrhythmias. In particular, given a fiber length L and a tolerance eta, we estimate the number of beats N = N(eta, L) required for the fiber to achieve approximate steady-state in the sense that spatial variation in the diastolic interval (DI) is bounded by eta. We track spatial DI variation using an infinite sequence of linear integral equations which we derive from a standard kinematic model of wave propagation. The integral equations can be solved in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials. We then estimate N by applying an asymptotic estimate for generalized Laguerre polynomials. We find that, for fiber lengths characteristic of cardiac tissue, it is often the case that N effectively exhibits no dependence on L. More exactly, (i) there is a critical fiber length L* such that, if L < L*, the convergence to steady-state is slowest at the pacing site, and (ii) often, L* is substantially larger than the diameter of the whole heart.", "journal": "SIAM journal on applied mathematics", "date": "2008-06-11", "authors": ["John WCain"], "doi": "10.1137/05063845X"}

{"title": "Two-Term Asymptotic Approximation of a Cardiac Restitution Curve.", "abstract": "If spatial extent is neglected, ionic models of cardiac cells consist of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which have the property of excitability, i.e., a brief stimulus produces a prolonged evolution (called an action potential in the cardiac context) before the eventual return to equilibrium. Under repeated stimulation, or pacing, cardiac tissue exhibits electrical restitution: the steady-state action potential duration (APD) at a given pacing period B shortens as B is decreased. Independent of ionic models, restitution is often modeled phenomenologically by a one-dimensional mapping of the form APD(next) = f(B - APD(previous)). Under some circumstances, a restitution function f can be derived as an asymptotic approximation to the behavior of an ionic model.In this paper, extending previous work, we derive the next term in such an asymptotic approximation for a particular ionic model consisting of two ODEs. The two-term approximation exhibits excellent quantitative agreement with the actual restitution curve, whereas the leading-order approximation significantly underestimates actual APD values.", "journal": "SIAM review.

Our algorithm estimates signal to noise ratio (SNR) from the power spectral density (PSD) for each pixel. This information is combined with information about the fluorescence intensity in each pixel, according to a user-selectable weighting factor. A threshold is then applied to the resulting combined measure. This approach resulted in an effective algorithm that is capable of automatically creating a \"mask\" that can be applied to the data to exclude parts of the data from further analysis.

{"title": "Monte Carlo simulation of 3D mapping of cardiac electrical activity with spinning slit confocal optics.", "abstract": "Optical techniques used to map transmembrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ activities of intact hearts are restricted to the surface and cannot resolve activity in deeper layers due to the lack of depth resolution. The recent development of spinning slit confocal optics offers advantages of depth resolution as well as high-speed confocal imaging which are necessary for millisecond-scale, depth-resolved mapping of membrane potential and/or intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Here, we show simulated confocal optics derived from confocal slits on a high-speed spinning disk using Monte Carlo method with a numerical heart tissue model and find that depth-resolved optical mapping is feasible down to around 800 microm below the surface using 670-nm excitation light. The numerical model shows that (1) a minimum slit separation, which is found to be a function of depth of the focal plane and the numerical aperture of the objective lens, for minimum background noise exists and (2) narrower slit widths result in slightly greater depth resolution but has a negative impact in significantly lower overall fluorescence intensity. An experimental test of this optics has been performed by imaging two overlapping layers of fluorescent beads and the result confirms the expected depth resolution in non-scattering medium.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism conditions were induced for five weeks by the administration of 0.05% benzythiouracile (BTU) and L-thyroxine sodium salt (0.0012%), in drinking water, respectively. No significant effect was observed on the rates of both lipid peroxidation and the vitamin E in hepatic and cardiac tissues of hypothyroidism rats compared to the controls, contrary to the hyperthyroidism rats, which expressed a pronounced increase. The increased glutathione peroxidase activity in rats suffering from hyperthyroidism was associated with a fall of the reduced glutathione in the homogenate and a marked increase in the glutathione reductase activity. An increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities was also recorded in hyperthyroidism. Our results explain the thyroid activity variation in relation to the lipid peroxidation and the tissular contents of the enzymatic and the non-enzymatic antioxidants.

{"title": "[Regulation of intracellular lipid metabolism by the preparation of omega-3 phospholipids from marine organisms in deficiency of essential fatty acids in rats].", "abstract": "It has been established that a deficit of essential fatty acids (EFA) in the animal organism induces specific modifications of composition of fatty acid (FA) of general phospholipids and plasmalogenic P1 in microsomal tissue membranes with various functions and affects the activity of phospholipase A2. It has been shown that arachidonic (AA), docosapentaenoic (DPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids in the composition of general phospholipids - phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PEA) and plasmalogens PC and PEA react to EFA deficit in the organism. Quantitative redistribution of AA, DPA, DHA of FA in general phospholipids and plasmalogenic microsomal membranes depending on their functions was found under EFA deficit in the organism. Deficit of DHA and plasmalogenic phospholipids evidences that the status of cell plasmalogens affects the level of PUFA at EFA deficit in the organism. AA and DHA can be a selective target for plasmalogens. The drug of omega-3 phospholipids, considerable amount of DHA and eicosapentaenoic (EPA)FA being present in their structure, increases the amount of plasmalogens and decreases the amount of AA in the brain, heart and reproductive organs. It was also found that EFA deficit in the organism favours the increase of lisoPEA, lisoPC, free FA (FFA) connected with the increase of activity of endogenic phospholippase A2 and plasmalogen-selective phospholipase A2. The omega-3 phospholipase from marine organisms at EFA defecit decreases the amount of FFA, lisophospholipids and activity of phospholipase A2 in the microsomas of the studied tissues. The drug of omega-3 phospholipids normalizes the state and functions of the brain, liver, and heart tissues, reproductive organs against a background of EFA defecit and regulates the synthesis of biologocically active metabolites of AA in the organism.", "journal": "Ukrains'kyi biokhimichnyi zhurnal (1999 )", "date": "2007-02-13", "authors": ["P VCherniavs'ky\u012d", "Z MDatsenko", "L HMoiseieva", "N VKanivets'", "O PKozulina", "A MBoroda", "O SAbakumova"], "doi": null}

Differentiation of bone marrow stem cells to cardiomyocyte-like cells have been observed under different culture conditions. The presence of resident cardiac stem cell population capable of differentiation into cardiomyocyte or vascular lineage suggests that these cells could be used for cardiac tissue repair, and represent a great promise for clinical application.

This study describes the changes in content of carnitine and GBB in rat plasma and heart tissues during long-term (28 days) treatment of mildronate [i.p. (intraperitoneal) 100 mg/kg/daily]. Obtained data show that in concert with a decrease in carnitine concentration, the administration of mildronate caused a significant increase in GBB concentration. We detected about a 5-fold increase in GBB contents in the plasma and brain and a 7-fold increase in the heart. In addition, we tested the cardioprotective effect of mildronate in isolated rat heart infarction model after 3, 7, and 14 days of administration. We found a statistically significant decrease in necrotic area of infarcted rat hearts after 14 days of treatment with mildronate. The cardioprotective effect of mildronate correlated with an increase in GBB contents.

Prior administration of 2% squalene in feed for 45 days significantly reduced the isoprenaline-induced elevation in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids in plasma and heart tissue of rats following myocardial infarction.

In the present study, the pretreatment with squalene significantly counteracted the isoprenaline-induced lipid peroxidation and maintained the rats at near normal status.

GLUT-4 translocates to the myocyte surface to increase glucose uptake in response to a number of stimuli. The mechanisms underlying ischemia- and insulin-mediated GLUT-4 translocation are known to be different, raising the possibility that the intracellular destinations of GLUT-4 following these stimuli also differ. Using immunogold labeling, we describe the cellular localization of these two transporters and investigate whether insulin and ischemia induce differential translocation of GLUT-4 to different cardiac membranes. Immunogold labeling of GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 was performed on left ventricular sections from isolated hearts following 30 min of either insulin, ischemia, or control perfusion. In control tissue, GLUT-1 was predominantly (76%) localized in the capillary endothelial cells, with only 24% of total cardiac GLUT-1 present in myocytes. GLUT-4 was found predominantly in myocytes, distributed between sarcolemmal and T tubule membranes (1.84 +/- 0.49 and 1.54 +/- 0.33 golds/microm, respectively) and intracellular vesicles (127 +/- 18 golds/microm(2)). Insulin increased T tubule membrane GLUT-4 content (2.8 +/- 0.4 golds/microm, P < 0.05) but had less effect on sarcolemmal GLUT-4 (1.72 +/- 0.53 golds/microm). Ischemia induced greater GLUT-4 translocation to both membrane types (4.25 +/- 0.84 and 4.01 +/- 0.27 golds/microm, respectively P < 0.05). The localization of GLUT-1 suggests a significant role in transporting glucose across the capillary wall before myocyte uptake via GLUT-1 and GLUT-4.

According to the aetiology of this disorder, surgical models are based on various methods allowing for the narrowing or occlusion of coronary arteries.

In this report, we present the first direct evidence for a protein pathway required for Na/Ca exchanger localization and stability in primary cardiomyocytes. We define the minimal structural requirements on ankyrin-B for direct Na/Ca exchanger interactions. Moreover, using ankyrin-B mutants that lack Na/Ca exchanger binding activity, and primary cardiomyocytes with reduced ankyrin-B expression, we demonstrate that direct interaction with the membrane adaptor ankyrin-B is required for the localization and post-translational stability of Na/Ca exchanger 1 in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. These results raise exciting new questions regarding potentially dynamic roles for ankyrin proteins in the biogenesis and maintenance of specialized membrane domains in excitable cells.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2006-12-21", "authors": ["Shane RCunha", "NainaBhasin", "Peter JMohler"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M607096200"}

But majority of experiments were carried out with using omega-3 PUFAs from marine fish oil. The purpose of this study was to determine effects of the plant-derived omega-3 PUFA (alpha-linolenic acid (a-LA) on postischemic myocardial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes activity. Male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were divided into 4 groups (n = 10-12 each). In control group (1) were intact rats. The hearts from 2-nd group of animal were exposed to 20 min of global ischemia followed by 40 min reperfusion according to the Langendorff technique. The 3-rd and 4-th groups of animal received of the plant-derived oil (a-LA), which is a precursor of eicosapentaenoic acid and was used as a dietary supplement in dose 0.1 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks. The hearts from 4-th group of animal were also exposed to ischemia/ reperfusion. Analysis of myocardial phospholipid fatty acid content showed that consumption of the plant-derived 6-LA for 4 weeks changes fatty acid profile through incorporation of b-LA in cell membranes. It also reduced content of omega-6 PUFAs in membrane phospholipids. In 3-rd group content of a-LA and EPA were increased by 1.5- and 3.5-times, respectively, whereas content of AA was reduced by 1.7-times. The development of ischemia/ reperfusion in 2-nd group caused increase of free AA content in heart tissue by 3.5-times, whereas in 4-th group this increase was only by 1.4-time. Ischemia/reperfusion of the isolated rat heart in 4-th group was accompanied by reduced leukotriene C4 and thromboxane B2 production in 3-times and 1.9-times, respectively in comparison to 2-nd group. The time of myocardial function recovery after ischemia (heart rate, left ventricular development pressure), was shorter compare to 2-nd group. Also in 4th group end-diastolic pressure and coronary perfusion pressure during reperfusion period were significantly lower. Dietary omega-3 PUFAs resulted in remarkable decrease of reperfusion arrhythmias in 4-th group (in 3.8-times) and limited the oxidative stress through decrease free radical and lipid peroxidation production. In this group of animals the activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) after ischemia/reperfusion were higher than in 2-nd group.

Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that alternans at the single cell level can be caused by unstable membrane voltage (V(m)) dynamics linked to steep APD-restitution, or unstable intracellular calcium (Ca) cycling linked to high sensitivity of Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load. Identifying which of these two mechanisms is the primary cause of cellular alternans, however, has remained difficult since Ca and V(m) are bidirectionally coupled. Here, we use numerical simulations of a physiologically detailed ionic model to show that the origin of alternans can be inferred by measuring the length scales over which APD and Ca(i) alternans reverse phase during spatially discordant alternans. The main conclusion is that these scales are comparable to a few millimeters and equal when alternans is driven by APD restitution, but differ markedly when alternans is driven predominantly by unstable Ca cycling. In the latter case, APD alternans still reverses phase on a millimeter tissue scale due to electrotonic coupling, while Ca alternans reverses phase on a submillimeter cellular scale. These results show that experimentally accessible measurements of Ca(i) and V(m) in cardiac tissue can be used to shed light on the cellular origin of alternans.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2006-12-19", "authors": ["DaisukeSato", "YohannesShiferaw", "ZhilinQu", "AlanGarfinkel", "James NWeiss", "AlainKarma"], "doi": "10.1529/biophysj.106.100982"}

The aim was to establish if taurine reduces acute hyperglycaemia-induced endothelial cell apoptosis and leucocyte interactions and associated cardiac abnormalities.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (190-250 g) were randomised to control, hyperglycaemia, and hyperglycaemia plus taurine pre-treated groups.

Using intravital microscopy, mesenteric post-capillary venules were examined for leucocyte rolling, adhesion and migration every 30 min from baseline. Endothelial cell apoptosis and intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) expression were assessed. In a separate experiment, blood pressure, pulse rate, cardiac injury marker (troponin T), cardiac tissue injury and oedema were also assessed.\nHyperglycaemia significantly increased leucocyte adhesion and migration.

The four regioisomeric eicosanoids, 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) of AA metabolites derived by P450 epoxygenases have shown to possess potent biological effects in numerous tissues. In the coronary circulation the EETs are leading candidates for endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factors that hyperpolarize vascular smooth muscle cells by opening Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Recently, the effects of the CYP pathways and their metabolites on cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury have been evaluated in animal models. Some of these AA metabolites are cardioprotective and some are detrimental. However, EETs appear to be cardioprotective in CYP2J2 transgenic mice and in a canine ischemic model. Multiple effects of EETs on cardiac ion channels have been observed, such as activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels in cardiomyocytes and inhibition of cardiac Na+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels reconstructed in planar lipid bilayers.

In the current study, we investigated whether sphingolipid metabolism can account for mediating MAO-A- and reactive oxygen species-dependent cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, MAO-A-dependent reactive oxygen species generation led to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, along with sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) inhibition. These phenomena were associated with generation of proapoptotic ceramide and decrease in prosurvival sphingosine 1-phosphate. These events were mimicked by inhibition of SphK1 with either pharmacological inhibitor or small interfering RNA, as well as by extracellular addition of C(2)-ceramide or H(2)O(2). In contrast, enforced expression of SphK1 protected H9c2 cells from serotonin- or H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Analysis of cardiac tissues from wild-type mice subjected to ischemia/reperfusion revealed significant upregulation of ceramide and inhibition of SphK1. It is noteworthy that SphK1 inhibition, ceramide accumulation, and concomitantly infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were significantly decreased in MAO-A-deficient animals. In conclusion, we show for the first time that the upregulation of ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate ratio is a critical event in MAO-A-mediated cardiac cell apoptosis. In addition, we provide the first evidence linking generation of reactive oxygen species with SphK1 inhibition.

Dox-PLN were prepared by dispersing Dox in stearic acid and tristearin, with subsequent addition of a novel anionic polymer HPESO (hydrolyzed polymer of epoxidized soybean oil) to enhance the drug incorporation in the lipids. Solid tumors were obtained by injecting EMT6 mouse mammary cancer cells intramuscularly into the hind legs of BALB/c mice. Dox-PLN, blank PLN or surfactant formulations were injected intratumorally (IT) when tumors reached approximately 0.3 g. In vivo efficacy of treatment was measured by tumor growth delay (TGD), defined as the delay in time for the tumor to grow to 1.13 g relative to the untreated control. Signs of unwanted drug toxicity, the histology and morphology of tumor and heart tissues, and the IT distribution of Dox-PLN after IT treatment were examined or monitored. IT-administered Dox-PLN resulted in 70% and 100% TGD (p<0.01) for Dox doses of 0.1 and 0.2 mg, respectively. Dox-PLN treated tumors developed substantially larger central necrotic regions than the untreated tumors, with Dox-PLN residues extensively distributed among the dead cell debris, suggesting that the anticancer effect of Dox-PLN was mainly a combined result of IT nanoparticle distribution and short-ranged, sustained drug release. Except for two of fifteen mice receiving the higher 0.2 mg Dox dose showing transient fur-roughing, all Dox-PLN treated mice showed no signs of toxicity.

Animals (estuarine crocodiles, Crocodylus porosus) acclimated to cold (N=8) conditions had significantly lower maximum and mean daily body temperatures after 33 days than warm-acclimated animals (N=9), despite performing characteristic thermoregulatory behaviours. Concomitant with behavioural changes, maximum sustained swimming speed (U(crit)) shifted to the respective mean body temperatures during acclimation (cold=20 degrees C, warm=29 degrees C), but there was no difference in the maxima between acclimation groups. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption changed significantly during acclimation, and maximum respiratory control ratios coincided with mean body temperatures in liver, muscle and heart tissues. There were significant changes in the activities of regulatory metabolic enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, cytochrome c oxidase) and these were tissue specific.

Blowfly cardiac activity consists of a fast, high-frequency signal phase alternating with a slow, low-frequency signal phase triggered by pacemakers located in the posterior abdominal heart and anterior thoracocephalic aorta, respectively. Mechanisms underlying FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs) effects on heart contractions are not well understood. Here, we report antisera generated to a FaRP, dromyosuppressin (DMS, TDVDHVFLRFamide), recognized neuronal processes that innervated the blowfly Protophormia terraenovae heart and aorta. Dromyosuppressin caused a reversible cardiac arrest. High- and low-frequency signals were abolished after which they resumed; however, the concentration-dependent resumption of the fast phase differed from the slow phase. Dromyosuppressin decreased the frequency of cardiac activity in a dose-dependent manner with threshold values between 5 fM and 0.5 fM (fast phase), and 0.5 fM and 0.1 fM (slow phase). Dromyosuppressin structure-activity relationship (SAR) for the decrease of the fast-phase frequency was not the same as the SAR for the decrease of the slow-phase frequency. The alanyl-substituted analog TDVDHVFLAFamide ([Ala9] DMS) was inactive on the fast phase, but active on the slow phase, a novel finding. FaRPs including myosuppressins are reported to require the C-terminal RFamide for activity.

The current report demonstrates that one reason for lack of reproducibility is the myriad of ATP concentrations, many of them excessive, which have been used to stimulate peptidase activity. The chymotrypsin-like or caspase-like activities of 26S-proteasome in cardiac tissue isolates were determined using Suc-LLVY-AMC or Z-LLE-AMC, respectively, over a range of ATP concentrations up to 2 mmol/L. The optimal ATP concentration to assess both peptidase activities was found to be in the low micromolar range (from 6 to 100 micromol/L) depending on the cardiac tissue isolate protein (10 to 90 microg protein) contained in the reaction. Increasing ATP beyond the optimal range was inhibitory. In general, chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities could be stimulated 2- to 2.5-fold and 1.4- to 1.8-fold, respectively, over basal (ATP, 0 micromol/L), and could be effectively inhibited with lactacystin or Z-Pro-Nle-Asp-CHO, respectively.

The high systemic blood pressure is caused, therefore, by a thicker ventricular wall surrounding the cavum arteriosum rather than differences in the intrinsic properties of the cardiac tissues. Similarly, there were no differences between the contractile properties of right and left atria. Force production was similar in atria and ventricle but the atria contracted and relaxed much faster than the ventricle. Graded hypoxia markedly reduced twitch force of all four cardiac tissues, and this was most pronounced when PO(2) was below 40 kPa. In contrast, the four cardiac tissues were insensitive to acidosis during normoxia although acidosis increased the sensitivity to hypoxia.

The ability of the hESC-CMs to integrate structurally and functionally with host cardiomyocytes in both in vitro and in vivo studies will be described as well as their ability to restore the myocardial electromechanical function in animal models of diseased hearts. We will next present detailed in vitro, in vivo, and computer simulation studies performed in our laboratory testing the hypothesis that cell grafts, engineered to express specific ion channels, can be used to modify the myocardial electrophysiological properties of cardiac tissue. The potential and drawbacks of this novel approach for the treatment of both tachyarrhythmias (using cell grafts expressing potassium channels) and bradyarrhythmias (using hESC coaxed to differentiate into pacemaking cells or conducting tissue) will be described.", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "date": "2006-11-30", "authors": ["LiorGepstein"], "doi": "10.1196/annals.1380.030"}

In order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this increase, the present article investigates changes in the postshock behavior of the myocardium upon stretch. A two-dimensional electro-mechanical model of cardiac tissue incorporating heterogeneous fiber orientation was used to explore the effect of sustained stretch on postshock behavior via (a) recruitment of mechanosensitive channels (MSC) and (b) tissue deformation and concomitant changes in tissue conductivities. Recruitment of MSC had no influence on vulnerability to electric shocks as compared to control, but increased the complexity of postshock VF patterns.

{"title": "Role of cellular compartmentation in the metabolic response to stress: mechanistic insights from computational models.", "abstract": "The mechanisms controlling ATP generation in the transition from normal resting conditions to either high work states or ischemia are poorly understood. ATP generation depends upon compartmentation between the mitochondria and cytosol of metabolic pathways and key energy transfer species that cannot be easily assessed experimentally. We developed a multicompartment mathematical model of cardiac metabolism to simulate the metabolic responses to ischemia and increased workload. The model is based on mass balances, transport, and metabolic processes in cardiac tissue, and has three distinct compartments (blood, cytosol, and mitochondria). In addition to distinguishing between cytosol and mitochondria, the model includes a cytosolic subcompartment for glycolytic metabolic channeling. The model simulations predict the rapid activation of glycogenolysis and lactate production at the onset of ischemia, and support the concept of localization of glycolysis to a cytosolic subcompartment. In addition, simulations show that mitochondrial NADH/NAD(+) is primarily determined by oxygen consumption during ischemia, while cytosolic NADH/NAD(+) and lactate production are largely a function of glycolytic flux during the initial phase, and is controlled by mitochondrial NADH/NAD(+) and the malate-aspartate shuttle during the steady state. Finally, the model predicts that metabolic activation with an abrupt increase in workload requires parallel activation of ATP hydrolysis, glycolysis, mitochondrial dehydrogenases, the electron transport chain, and ADP phosphorylation. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the importance of metabolic compartmentation in the regulation of cardiac energetics in response to acute stress, and they highlight the usefulness of computational models in this line of investigation.", "journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "date": "2006-11-30", "authors": ["LufangZhou", "XinYu", "Marco ECabrera", "William CStanley"], "doi": "10.1196/annals.1380.012"}
{"title": "Embryonic heart induction.", "abstract": "We have characterized two signaling pathways that induce heart tissue during embryonic development. The first is initiated by the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) and involves the homeodomain transcription factor Hex. Other Wnt antagonists are less effective and the potency of Dkk1 might be due to synergy between Wnt antagonizing and another, novel activity emanating from its amino terminal cysteine-rich domain. The second signal is initiated by Nodal and its co-receptor Cripto. Importantly, both the Dkk1/Wnt antagonism and Nodal pathways act on the endoderm that underlies the future heart to control secretion of diffusible factors that induce cardiogenesis in adjacent mesoderm. In this article, we summarize data that Dkk1 induces cardiogenic differentiation cell non-autonomously through the action of the homeodomain transcription factor Hex. We also discuss recent data showing that Nodal also acts indirectly through stimulation of the secreted protein Cerberus, which is a member of the differential-screening selected aberrant in neuroblastoma (DAN) family of secreted proteins.

A current challenge is to understand how FGF signalling generates such diverse outcomes. A key FGF downstream pathway is the Ras-MAPK/Erk1/2 cascade, which culminates in the phosphorylation of target proteins, such as the Ets family of transcription factors. To begin to assess specificity downstream of FGF in the chick embryo we have characterised the patterns of Fgfr1-4 expression and Erk1/2 activation, as well as expression of the Erk1/2 specific phosphatase, Mkp3 and of three Ets factor genes (Erm, Pea3 and Er81) from early blastula to the 10 somite stage. We identify new sites of Fgfr expression and show that nearly all regions of Erk1/2 activity are within Fgfr expression domains and require FGF signalling. Differences in intensity, duration, distribution and sub-cellular localisation of activated Erk1/2 are observed in distinct cell populations within the embryo and during wound healing. With few exceptions, a tight correspondence between Erk1/2 activation and Mkp3 expression is found, while specific combinations of Ets factors are associated with distinct regions of Erk1/2 activation.

{"title": "Multiple functions of Cerberus cooperate to induce heart downstream of Nodal.", "abstract": "The TGFbeta family member Nodal has been implicated in heart induction through misexpression of a dominant negative version of the type I Nodal receptor (Alk4) and targeted deletion of the co-receptor Cripto in murine ESCs and mouse embryos; however, whether Nodal acts directly or indirectly to induce heart tissue or interacts with other signaling molecules or pathways remained unclear. Here we present Xenopus embryological studies demonstrating an unforeseen role for the DAN family protein Cerberus within presumptive foregut endoderm as essential for differentiation of cardiac mesoderm in response to Nodal. Ectopic activation of Nodal signaling in non-cardiogenic ventroposterior mesendoderm, either by misexpression of the Nodal homologue XNr1 together with Cripto or by a constitutively active Alk4 (caAlk4), induced both cardiac markers and Cerberus. Mosaic lineage tracing studies revealed that Nodal/Cripto and caAlk4 induced cardiac markers cell non-autonomously, thus supporting the idea that Cerberus or another diffusible factor is an essential mediator of Nodal-induced cardiogenesis. Cerberus alone was found sufficient to initiate cardiogenesis at a distance from its site of synthesis. Conversely, morpholino-mediated specific knockdown of Cerberus reduced both endogenous cardiomyogenesis and ectopic heart induction resulting from misactivation of Nodal/Cripto signaling. Since the specific knockdown of Cerberus did not abrogate heart induction by the Wnt antagonist Dkk1, Nodal/Cripto and Wnt antagonists appear to initiate cardiogenesis through distinct pathways. This idea was further supported by the combinatorial effect of morpholino-medicated knockdown of Cerberus and Hex, which is required for Dkk1-induced cardiogenesis, and the differential roles of essential downstream effectors: Nodal pathway activation did not induce the transcriptional repressor Hex while Dkk-1 did not induce Cerberus. These studies demonstrated that cardiogenesis in mesoderm depends on Nodal-mediated induction of Cerberus in underlying endoderm, and that this pathway functions in a pathway parallel to cardiogenesis initiated through the induction of Hex by Wnt antagonists. Both pathways operate in endoderm to initiate cardiogenesis in overlying mesoderm.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2006-11-25", "authors": ["Ann CFoley", "OksanaKorol", "Anjuli MTimmer", "MarkMercola"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.10.033"}

A group of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were distributed evenly into four groups that were fed for 12 wk a normal rat chow supplemented with hempseed (5% and 10%), palm oil (1%), or a 10% partially delipidated hempseed that served as a control. Plasma ALA and gamma-linolenic acid levels were significantly elevated in the rats that were fed a 5% or 10% hempseed-supplemented diet, but in heart tissue only ALA levels were significantly elevated in the rats fed these diets compared with control. After the dietary interventions were completed, postischemic heart performance was evaluated by measuring developed tension, resting tension, the rates of tension development and relaxation, and the number of extrasystoles. Hearts from rats fed a hempseed-supplemented diet exhibited significantly better postischemic recovery of maximal contractile function and enhanced rates of tension development and relaxation during reperfusion than hearts from the other groups. These hearts, however, were not protected from the occurrence of extrasystoles, nor were the increases in resting tension altered during ischemia or reperfusion as a function of any dietary intervention.

Adriamycin is an effective cancer chemotherapeutic drug whose use is limited by cardiotoxicity. Adriamycin induces oxidative stress and production of HNE in cardiac tissue, which may contribute to cardiomyopathy. We investigated the role of Mrp1 in Adriamycin-induced oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. Mice were treated with Adriamycin (20 mg/kg, i.p.), and heart homogenate and sarcolemma membranes were assayed for Mrp1 expression and ATP-dependent transport activity. Expression of Mrp1 was increased at 6 and 24 hours after Adriamycin treatment compared with saline treatment. HNE-adducted proteins were significantly increased (P < 0.001) in the homogenates at 6 hours after Adriamycin treatment and accumulated further with time; HNE adduction of a 190-kDa protein was evident 3 days after Adriamycin treatment. Mrp1 was localized predominately in sarcolemma as shown by confocal and Western blot analysis. Sarcolemma membrane vesicles transported leukotriene C(4) with a K(m) and V(max) of 51.8 nmol/L and 94.1 pmol/min/mg, respectively, and MK571 (10 micromol/L) inhibited the transport activity by 65%.

There is a direct correlation between myocardial function and myocardial TNF levels in humans. TNF may induce local inflammation to exert tissue injury. On the other hand, suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins have been shown to inhibit proinflammatory signaling. However, it is unknown whether TNF mediates myocardial inflammation via STAT3/SOCS3 signaling in the heart and, if so, whether this effect is through the type 1 55-kDa TNF receptor (TNFR1). We hypothesized that TNFR1 deficiency protects myocardial function and decreases myocardial IL-6 production via the STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in response to TNF. Isolated male mouse hearts (n = 4/group) from wild-type (WT) and TNFR1 knockout (TNFR1KO) were subjected to direct TNF infusion (500 pg.ml(-1).min(-1) x 30 min) while left ventricular developed pressure and maximal positive and negative values of the first derivative of pressure were continuously recorded. Heart tissue was analyzed for active forms of STAT3, p38, SOCS3 and SOCS1 (Western blot analysis), as well as IL-1beta and IL-6 (ELISA). Coronary effluent was analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. As a result, TNFR1KO had significantly better myocardial function, less myocardial LDH release, and greater expression of SOCS3 (percentage of SOCS3/GAPDH: 45 +/- 4.5% vs. WT 22 +/- 6.5%) after TNF infusion. TNFR1 deficiency decreased STAT3 activation (percentage of phospho-STAT3/STAT3: 29 +/- 6.4% vs. WT 45 +/- 8.8%).

Using computer simulations, we investigated the effects of a structural barrier on the onset of spatially concordant and discordant alternans. We used two-dimensional tissue geometry with heterogeneity in selected potassium conductances to mimic known apex-base gradients. Although we found that the actual onset of alternans was similar with and without the structural barrier, the increase in alternans magnitude with faster pacing was steeper with the barrier--giving the appearance of an earlier alternans onset in its presence. This is consistent with both experimental structural barrier findings and the clinical observation of T-wave alternans occurring at slower pacing rates in patients with structural heart disease. In ionically homogeneous tissue, discordant alternans induced by the presence of the structural barrier arose at intermediate pacing rates due to a source-sink mismatch behind the barrier. In heterogeneous tissue, discordant alternans occurred during fast pacing due to a barrier-induced decoupling of tissue with different restitution properties.

Vacuole formation, mitochondrial deformation and degeneration, and disordered myofibrillary structures were detected ultrastructurally in the epirubicin-treated group. The degeneration was reduced in the heart tissues of the epirubicin+melatonin group. Epirubicin increased the nitrite/nitrate production, but did not change the MDA and GSH levels significantly. Melatonin treatment lowered the nitrite/nitrate concentrations, while increasing the GSH levels, which exceeded the levels in epirubicin+melatonin-treated rats. We conclude that the epirubicin increased the nitrozative stress, not the oxidative stress, in heart tissue, and the cardioprotective effect of melatonin was partially attributed to the suppression of epirubicin-induced nitrozative stress.

{"title": "Prevention of angiotensin II-induced cardiac remodeling by angiotensin-(1-7).", "abstract": "Cardiac remodeling, which typically results from chronic hypertension or following an acute myocardial infarction, is a major risk factor for the development of heart failure and, ultimately, death. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has previously been established to play an important role in the progression of cardiac remodeling, and inhibition of a hyperactive RAS provides protection from cardiac remodeling and subsequent heart failure. Our previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) prevents cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy during chronic infusion of angiotensin II (ANG II). This, coupled with the knowledge that ACE2 is a key enzyme in the formation of ANG-(1-7), led us to hypothesize that chronic infusion of ANG-(1-7) would prevent cardiac remodeling induced by chronic infusion of ANG II. Infusion of ANG II into adult Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in significantly increased blood pressure, myocyte hypertrophy, and midmyocardial interstitial fibrosis. Coinfusion of ANG-(1-7) resulted in significant attenuations of myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, without significant effects on blood pressure. In a subgroup of animals also administered [d-Ala(7)]-ANG-(1-7) (A779), an antagonist to the reported receptor for ANG-(1-7), there was a tendency to attenuate the antiremodeling effects of ANG-(1-7). Chronic infusion of ANG II, with or without coinfusion of ANG-(1-7), had no effect on ANG II type 1 or type 2 receptor binding in cardiac tissue. Together, these findings indicate an antiremodeling role for ANG-(1-7) in cardiac tissue, which is not mediated through modulation of blood pressure or altered cardiac angiotensin receptor populations and may be at least partially mediated through an ANG-(1-7) receptor.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The purpose of this investigation was to explore by in vitro techniques the use of this biomaterial as a scaffold for cardiac tissue regeneration. To this end neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultivated in PEGylated fibrinogen constructs. The cell-seeding density and biomaterial composition were optimized to obtain maximum spontaneous contraction of the constructs. Quantitative characterization of the contraction pattern was accomplished by video image analysis. It was possible to demonstrate an inverse correlation between the material stiffness and the amplitude of contraction of the tissue constructs by changing the modulus of the matrix using different compositions of PEG and fibrinogen. The relationship between matrix stiffness, cell density and tissue contraction also provided some insight into the mechanism of cellular remodeling that ultimately leads to synchronized contraction of the constructs. These findings indicate that PEGylated fibrinogen hydrogels can be used as a scaffold for cardiomyocytes, and offer the possibility of controlling cellular remodeling via simple compositional modifications to the matrix.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2006-11-14", "authors": ["KerenShapira-Schweitzer", "DrorSeliktar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2006.09.003"}

The purpose of this study was to determine whether NIRSI can reliably differentiate among a range of cardiac oxygenation states, using ischemia and hypoxia models independently. An ischemia-reperfusion model was applied to isolated, beating, blood-perfused porcine hearts, in which the left anterior descending (LAD) artery was cannulated. LAD flow was decreased stepwise to approximately 50, 20, and 0% of normal flow and was completely restored between ischemic episodes. Upon completion of the ischemia-reperfusion protocol, the hearts were further subjected to periods of increasingly severe global hypoxia. Regional oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (myoglobin) levels were derived from spectroscopic images (650 to 1050 nm) acquired at each step. Oxygenation maps vividly highlighted the area at risk for all degrees of ischemia. Oxygenation values differed significantly for different LAD flow rates, regardless of whether intermediate reperfusion was applied, and oxygenation values during progressive hypoxia correlated well with blood oxygen saturation. These results suggest that NIRSI is well suited, not only to identify ischemic or hypoxic regions of cardiac tissue, but also to assess the severity of deoxygenation.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical optics", "date": "2006-11-10", "authors": ["Stephen PNighswander-Rempel", "Valery VKupriyanov", "R AnthonyShaw"], "doi": "10.1117/1.2357601"}

A slight decrease in cardiac uptake of MIBG has also been reported in some patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). However, the pathophysiological mechanism accounting for the slight decrease in MIBG uptake in MSA remains to be elucidated. For confirmation, we examined cardiac tissue and sympathetic ganglia from patients with MSA. We immunohistochemically examined each specimen of 15 patients with MSA together with 10 control subjects using antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neurofilament (NF). The number of TH-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the epicardium was preserved in 8 of 15 patients with MSA as well as in 10 control subjects. The number of TH-immunoreactive, but not of NF-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the epicardium was mildly or moderately decreased in six patients with MSA, of whom four showed a decrease of TH immunoreactivity in the neuronal somata in the sympathetic ganglia. Moreover, TH- and NF-immunoreactive nerve fibers almost entirely disappeared in the heart of one patient with MSA, in whom Lewy body pathology was present in the sympathetic ganglia. These findings suggest that mild degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve can occur in MSA which is closely related to the pathological change of neurons in the sympathetic ganglia, accounting for the slight decrease in cardiac uptake of MIBG. Moreover, concurrent Lewy body pathology in the sympathetic ganglia might accelerate cardiac sympathetic denervation even in MSA.", "journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "date": "2006-11-08", "authors": ["SatoshiOrimo", "ToshiroKanazawa", "AyakoNakamura", "ToshikiUchihara", "FumiakiMori", "AkiyoshiKakita", "KoichiWakabayashi", "HitoshiTakahashi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00401-006-0160-y"}

Higher levels of oxidized protein end-products were found in failing hearts compared with donor heart samples. On the other hand, no differences in tyrosine nitration (a marker of peroxynitrite generation) were detected. Activation of PARP was demonstrated in the failing hearts by an increased abundance of poly-ADP ribosylated proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PARP activation was localized to the nucleus of the cardiomyocytes from the failing hearts. The expression of full-length PARP-1 was not significantly different in donor and failing hearts. The expression of caspase-9, in contrast, was significantly higher in the failing than in the donor hearts. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to detect the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. We found no significant translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) into the nucleus.

Drifting spiral waves can become pinned to anatomic obstacles and thus attain stability and persistence. Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic agent commonly used to treat ventricular tachycardia clinically. We examined the ability of small obstacles to anchor spiral waves and the effect of lidocaine on their attachment.\nSpiral waves were electrically induced in confluent monolayers of cultured, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Small, circular anatomic obstacles (0.6 to 2.6 mm in diameter) were situated in the center of the monolayers to provide an anchoring site. Eighty reentry episodes consisting of at least 4 revolutions were studied. In 36 episodes, the spiral wave attached to the obstacle and became stationary and sustained, with a shorter reentry cycle length and higher rate. Spiral waves could attach to obstacles as small as 0.6 mm, with a likelihood for attachment that increased with obstacle size. After attachment, both conduction velocity of the wave-front tip and wavelength near the obstacle adapted from their pre-reentry values and increased linearly with obstacle size. In contrast, reentry cycle length did not correlate significantly with obstacle size. Addition of lidocaine 90 mumol/L depressed conduction velocity, increased reentry cycle length, and caused attached spiral waves to become quasi- attached to the obstacle or terminate.\nAnchored spiral waves exhibit properties of both unattached spiral waves and anatomic reentry.

{"title": "Why are mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists cardioprotective?", "abstract": "Two clinical trials, the Randomized ALdosterone Evaluation Study (RALES) and the EPlerenone HEart failure and SUrvival Study (EPHESUS), have recently shown that mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists reduce mortality in patients with heart failure on top of ACE inhibition. This effect could not be attributed solely to blockade of the renal MR-mediated effects on blood pressure, and it has therefore been proposed that aldosterone, the endogenous MR agonist, also acts extrarenally, in particular in the heart. Indeed, MR are present in cardiac tissue, and possibly aldosterone synthesis occurs in the heart. This review critically addresses the following questions: (1) is aldosterone synthesized at cardiac tissue sites, (2) what agonist stimulates cardiac MR normally, and (3) what effects are mediated by aldosterone/MR in the heart that could explain the beneficial effects of MR blockade in heart failure? Conclusions are that most, if not all, of cardiac aldosterone originates in the circulation (i.e., is of adrenal origin), and that glucocorticoids, in addition to aldosterone, may serve as the endogenous agonist of cardiac MR. MR-mediated effects in the heart include effects on endothelial function, cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy, oxidative stress, cardiac inotropy, coronary flow, and arrhythmias. Some of these effects occur via or in synergy with angiotensin II, and involve a non-MR-mediated mechanism.

It has been effective in subchronic and acute dosing regimens after parenteral administration, and recently published data in rats demonstrate that oral cardioprotection is also readily achieved. Myocardial salvage in the canine can reach 100% with a 4-day subchronic dosing regimen; single-dose I.V. cardioprotection, when given 2 hours before experimental coronary occlusion, is on average two-thirds of that achieved with the subchronic regimen in dogs. In conscious animals, no effects on hemodynamic parameters have been observed. Recently, the beneficial properties of this prototypical astaxanthin conjugate have been extended to include second- and third-generation compounds with improved pharmacokinetic and/or potency profiles. The primary mechanism of cardioprotection appears to be antioxidant activity: potent direct scavenging of the lynchpin radical in ischemia-reperfusion injury, superoxide anion, has been documented in appropriate model systems. In addition, modulation of serum complement activity, reduction of the levels of deposition of C-reactive protein (CRP) and the membrane attack complex (MAC) in infarcted tissue, and reduction in oxidative stress markers from the arachidonic acid and linoleic acid pathways also suggest a significant anti-inflammatory component to the mechanism of cardioprotection. Favorable plasma protein binding has been demonstrated in vitro for several astaxanthin conjugates; this binding capacity overcomes the supramolecular assembly of the compounds that occurs in aqueous solution, which in itself improves the stability and shelf-life of aqueous formulations. Astaxanthin readily populates cardiac tissue after metabolic hydrolysis of both oral and parenteral administration of the astaxanthin ester derivates, providing a reservoir of cardioprotective agent with a significant half-life due to favorable ADME in mammals.

In particular, spatially discordant alternans has been observed in which regions with a large-small-large action potential duration (APD) alternate out-of-phase adjacent to regions of small-large-small APD. However, the underlying mechanisms that lead to the initiation of discordant alternans and govern its spatiotemporal properties are not well understood. Using mathematical modeling, we show that dynamic changes in the spatial distribution of discordant alternans can be used to pinpoint the underlying mechanisms.

It predisposes patients to heart failure, QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Angiotensin II (Ang II) exerts direct actions on cardiac tissue inducing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and electro-mechanical dysfunction. However, a direct association between Ang II and cardiomyocyte electrical remodeling has yet to be demonstrated. Transgenic TG1306/1R (TG) mice with cardiac-specific Ang II overproduction demonstrate blood pressure-independent cardiac hypertrophy and exhibit significant increase in sudden death associated with mechanical dysfunction. The present study makes use of TG mice to evaluate the direct effects of high levels of intracardiac Ang II on cardiac electrophysiology. Surface-limb ECG measurements were recorded on 50- to 60-week-old TG and wild-type (WT) mice. QT interval was significantly prolonged (+20%) in TG mice relative to WT. TG mice also showed an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. QT prolongation was associated with prolongation of cardiomyocyte action potential at 90% repolarization (APD90). The change in APD90 correlated with a reduction in IK1 potassium current density in TG vs. WT cardiomyocytes (at -70 mV: 0.3+/-0.1 pA/pF vs. 0.8+/-0.2 pA/pF, P<0.05). In TG mice, reduction in IK1 was associated with a significant reduction (-50%) of the mRNA encoding Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 subunits of IK1-related KCNJ2 and KCNJ12 potassium channels.

To test our ability to obtain high quality RNA from biopsy-sized cardiac specimens, amplification was performed on RNA from biopsy-sized samples of left ventricle (LV) tissue from one explanted failing human heart and one non-failing heart. Two methods were used: one-cycle (1C) amplification of 1.6 microg of RNA, and two-cycle (2C) amplification of 50 ng of RNA. The resulting cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. Over 65% of all differentially expressed genes for failing vs non-failing hearts were concordant between 1C and 2C RNA amplification.

{"title": "Diabetes-induced extracellular matrix protein expression is mediated by transcription coactivator p300.", "abstract": "Increased fibronectin expression is a key feature of diabetic angiopathy. We have previously shown that nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) mediates fibronectin expression in endothelial cells and in organs affected by diabetes complications. p300, a transcription coactivator, may regulate NF-kappaB activity via poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation. Hence, we examined the role of p300 in fibronectin expression in diabetes. High glucose induced fibronectin expression in the endothelial cells, which was associated with increased p300, PARP activity, and NF-kappaB activation. This p300 alteration is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase C and B. We then used p300 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and showed decreased fibronectin and PARP expression, as well as NF-kappaB activation, in the endothelial cells. Examination of the heart tissues of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice revealed increased fibronectin and p300 mRNA. Intravenous injection of p300 siRNA resulted in decreased p300 levels and normalized fibronectin expression in the heart. We further investigated retinal tissues from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats treated with intravitreal p300 siRNA injection. Similar to the heart, p300 siRNA inhibited fibronectin expression in the retina of the diabetic animals. These results indicate that transcriptional coactivator p300 may regulate fibronectin expression via PARP and NF-kappaB activation in diabetes.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2006-10-27", "authors": ["HarkiranKaur", "ShaliChen", "XipingXin", "JaneChiu", "Zia AKhan", "SubrataChakrabarti"], "doi": "10.2337/db06-0519"}

A therapeutic LV that delivers the alpha-gal A cDNA has been synthesized. In vitro studies established efficient transduction of the H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes and showed overexpression of enGFP (control) and alpha-gal A. In in vivo studies, the enGFP cDNA was transferred into C57BL/6 mouse hearts by direct intraventricular injection. Next, in a mouse model of Fabry disease, the recombinant therapeutic construct was delivered analogously. In cardiac tissue, alpha-gal A activity rose to 23% of normal levels at day 7 after LV injection, which is encouraging because levels of correction approximating 5% of normal may be curative for this disorder. There was also a corresponding reduction in globotriaosylceramide accumulation.

{"title": "Heritability and tissue specificity of expression quantitative trait loci.", "abstract": "Variation in gene expression is heritable and has been mapped to the genome in humans and model organisms as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We applied integrated genome-wide expression profiling and linkage analysis to the regulation of gene expression in fat, kidney, adrenal, and heart tissues using the BXH/HXB panel of rat recombinant inbred strains. Here, we report the influence of heritability and allelic effect of the quantitative trait locus on detection of cis- and trans-acting eQTLs and discuss how these factors operate in a tissue-specific context. We identified several hundred major eQTLs in each tissue and found that cis-acting eQTLs are highly heritable and easier to detect than trans-eQTLs. The proportion of heritable expression traits was similar in all tissues; however, heritability alone was not a reliable predictor of whether an eQTL will be detected. We empirically show how the use of heritability as a filter reduces the ability to discover trans-eQTLs, particularly for eQTLs with small effects. Only 3% of cis- and trans-eQTLs exhibited large allelic effects, explaining more than 40% of the phenotypic variance, suggestive of a highly polygenic control of gene expression. Power calculations indicated that, across tissues, minor differences in genetic effects are expected to have a significant impact on detection of trans-eQTLs. Trans-eQTLs generally show smaller effects than cis-eQTLs and have a higher false discovery rate, particularly in more heterogeneous tissues, suggesting that small biological variability, likely relating to tissue composition, may influence detection of trans-eQTLs in this system.

{"title": "ACE2 of the heart: From angiotensin I to angiotensin (1-7).", "abstract": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), a bioactive peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS), plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the Ang II forming enzyme, or specific blockade of Ang II binding to angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) through which it exerts its deleterious effects, were shown to provide some protection against progression of CVD. The ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis has been challenged over the last few years with RAAS components able to counterbalance the effects of the main axis. The ACE homologue ACE2 efficiently hydrolyses Ang II to form Ang (1-7), a peptide that exerts actions opposite to those of Ang II. In contrast to the Ang II axis, the role of the ACE2-Ang (1-7) axis in cardiac function is largely obscure. Ang (1-7) is present in the viable myocardium, and its formation depends on Ang II as a substrate. The expression of this peptide is associated with cardiac remodeling: it is lost in the infarcted area and significantly increased in the border area. Low doses of Ang (1-7) improve cardiac output and antagonize Ang II-induced vasoconstriction. The type of Ang (1-7) biological activity is tissue specific and dose dependent. These findings point to a possible protective role for Ang (1-7) in abating the Ang II-induced actions. The elevated expression of Ang (1-7) in failing heart tissue paralleled the expression of its forming enzyme, ACE2. Several observations and experimental evidence suggest a beneficial role for ACE2 in cardiovascular function. Elevated ACE2 expression at the initial stage of several pathologies which decline with progression of disease might indicate a protective role for ACE2. Genetic manipulation of ACE2 expression, either targeted disruption or overexpression, point to the possible significance of this enzyme in cardiac function. Based on the above, a therapeutic approach that will amplify the ACE2-Ang (1-7) axis could provide further protection against the development of CVD. It turns out that the merits of currently used drugs--ACE inhibitors, AT1R blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRB) - lay beyond their direct effects on suppression of the ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis as they also increase cardiac ACE2 and Ang (1-7) significantly.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2006-10-20", "authors": ["ShlomoKeidar", "MarielleKaplan", "AvivaGamliel-Lazarovich"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.09.006"}

This study hypothesized that implantation of a BMMNC-seeded PGCL scaffold into the epicardial surface in a rat MI model would be biocompatible, induce BMMNC migration into infarcted myocardium, and effectively improve left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. One week after the implantation of a BMMNC-seeded PGCL scaffold, BMMMC showed migration into the epicardial region. Four weeks after implantation, augmented neovascularization was observed in infarcted areas and in infarct border zones. Some BMMNCs exhibited the presence of alpha-MHC and troponin I, markers of differentiation into cardiomyocytes. In echocardiographic examinations, BMMNC-seeded PGCL scaffold and non-cell-seeded simple PGCL scaffold groups effectively reduced progressive LV dilatation and preserved LV systolic function as compared to control rat MI groups. Thus, BMMNC-seeded PGCL scaffolding influences BMMNC migration, differentiation to cardiomyocytes, and induction of neovascularization, ultimately effectively lessening LV remodeling and progressive LV systolic dysfunction.

Moreover, in response to ischemia/reperfusion injury, an active release of myotrophin from adult rat myocardium was not observed. Furthermore, protein synthesis studies in rat neonatal myocytes indicated that exogenous myotrophin did not induce hypertrophy.

We suggest that effective protection of azidothymidine-induced cardiopathology can be expected from drugs that are capable of targeting mitochondria. Therefore the present study in mice was carried out with mildronate, a cardioprotective drug of the aza-butyrobetaine class, which previously has been shown to act as a highly potent protector of mitochondrial processes. In our study, saline (control), azidothymidine (50 mg/kg), mildronate (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg), and azidothymidine + mildronate (at the doses mentioned) were injected intraperitoneally daily in separate groups of mice for two weeks. At the termination of the experiment, mice were sacrificed, the hearts were removed and cardiac tissue was examined morphologically and immunohistochemically. It was found that azidothymidine, compared to control and mildronate groups, induced major morphologic changes in cardiac tissue, which were manifestated as degeneration and inflammation. These changes were prevented when mildronate was co-administered with azidothymidine. Mildronate also reduced the azidothymidine-induced expression of nuclear factor kappaBp65 (NF-kappaBp65). The obtained data demonstrate a high ability of mildronate of preventing azidothymidine-induced cardiopathologic changes, and suggest mildronate's indirect action on azidothymidine-caused oxidative stress reactions leading to mitochondrial dysfunction.

Although decameric vanadate is unstable in the assay medium, it decomposes with a half-life time of 16 allowing studying its effects not only in vitro but also in vivo. After 1, 6 and 12h upon decavanadate administration the increase of vanadium in blood plasma, red blood cells and in cardiac mitochondria and cytosol is not affected in comparison to the administration of a metavanadate solution containing labile oxovanadates. Cardiac tissue lipid peroxidation increases up to 20%, 1, 6 and 12h after metavanadate administration, whilst for decavanadate no effects were observed except 1h after treatment (+20%). Metavanadate administration clearly differs from decavanadate by enhancing, 12h after exposure, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (+115%) and not affecting catalase (CAT) activity whereas decavanadate increases SOD activity by 20% and decreases (-55%) mitochondrial CAT activity. At early times of exposure, 1 and 6h, the only effect observed upon decavanadate administration was the increase by 20% of SOD activity. In conclusion, decavanadate has a different response pattern of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress markers, in spite of the same vanadium distribution in cardiac cells observed after decavanadate and metavanadate administration. It is suggested that once formed decameric vanadate species has a different reactivity than vanadate, thus, pointing out that the differential contribution of vanadium oligomers should be taken into account to rationalize in vivo vanadate toxicity.", "journal": "Journal of inorganic biochemistry", "date": "2006-10-13", "authors": ["S SSoares", "HMartins", "R ODuarte", "J J GMoura", "JCoucelo", "CGuti\u00e9rrez-Merino", "MAureliano"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2006.08.002"}

Heart tissue sections revealed neither significant hypertrophy nor ventricular dilation in cTnI(193His) mice.

The cardiac ejection fraction (EF) was not significant changed in 6- to 8-week-old cTnI(193His) mice, however, the EF was significantly decreased in cTnI(193His) mice at age of 11 months.

In this study, the functional implications of cTnI proteolysis were investigated in human cardiac tissue for the first time. The predominant human cTnI degradation product (cTnI(1-192)) and full-length cTnI were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, reconstituted with the other cardiac troponin subunits, troponin T and C, and subsequently exchanged into human cardiac myofibrils and permeabilized cardiomyocytes isolated from healthy donor hearts. Maximal isometric force and kinetic parameters were measured in myofibrils, using rapid solution switching, whereas force development was measured in single cardiomyocytes at various calcium concentrations, at sarcomere lengths of 1.9 and 2.2 mum, and after treatment with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) to mimic beta-adrenergic stimulation. One-dimensional gel electrophoresis, Western immunoblotting, and 3D imaging revealed that approximately 50% of endogenous cTnI had been homogeneously replaced by cTnI(1-192) in both myofibrils and cardiomyocytes. Maximal tension was not affected, whereas the rates of force activation and redevelopment as well as relaxation kinetics were slowed down. Ca(2+) sensitivity of the contractile apparatus was increased in preparations containing cTnI(1-192) (pCa(50): 5.73+/-0.03 versus 5.52+/-0.03 for cTnI(1-192) and full-length cTnI, respectively). The sarcomere length dependency of force development and the desensitizing effect of PKA were preserved in cTnI(1-192)-exchanged cardiomyocytes.

This study aimed to detect cardiac aldosterone by use of a liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric method and to assess the effects of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade on hypertensive DHF. Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed 8% NaCl diet from 7 wk (hypertensive DHF model) were divided at 13 wk into three groups: those treated with subdepressor doses of eplerenone (12.5 or 40 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) and an untreated group. Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed 0.3% NaCl diet served as controls. Cardiac aldosterone was detected in the DHF rats but not in the control rats, with increased ventricular levels of mineralocorticoid receptor. Cardiac levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and 11-dehydrocorticosterone were not different between the control and DHF rats, but the tissue level of corticosterone that has an affinity to mineralocorticoid receptor was 1,000 times as high as that of aldosterone. Aldosterone synthase activity and CYP11B2 mRNA were undetectable in the ventricular tissue of the DHF rats. Administration of eplerenone attenuated ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular fibrosis, myocardial stiffening, and relaxation abnormality, leading to the prevention of overt DHF. In summary, the myocardial aldosterone level increased in the DHF rats. However, its value was extremely low compared with corticosterone, and no evidence for enhancement of intrinsic myocardial aldosterone production was found. The upregulation of mineralocorticoid receptor may play a central role in the pathogenesis of DHF, and blockade of mineralocorticoid receptor is likely an effective therapeutic regimen of DHF.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "The cardiomyocyte cell cycle.", "abstract": "Many forms of cardiac disease are characterized by cardiomyocyte death due to necrosis, apoptosis and/or oncosis. Recently, the notion of promoting cardiac regeneration as a means to replace damaged heart tissue has engendered considerable interest. One approach to accomplish heart muscle regeneration entails promoting cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in the surviving myocardium. Genetically modified mice have provided useful model systems to test the efficacy of specific pathways to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation in normal and diseased hearts. For example, expression of a heart-restricted dominant interfering version of p193 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase also known as Cul7) resulted in an induction of cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity at the infarct border zone and ventricular septum 4 weeks after permanent coronary artery occlusion. A concomitant reduction in hypertrophic cardiomyocyte growth was also observed in this model, suggesting that cell cycle activation partially counteracted the adverse ventricular remodelling that occurs post-infarction. In other studies, targeted expression of cyclin D2 promoted cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in adult hearts. The level of cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity increased after myocardial infarction, ultimately resulting in a marked increase in cardiomyocyte number and a concomitant regression of infarct size. Collectively, these data suggest that modulation of cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity can be exploited to promote regenerative growth in injured hearts.", "journal": "Novartis Foundation symposium", "date": "2006-10-06", "authors": ["Pascal J ELafontant", "Loren JField"], "doi": "10.1002/0470029331.ch12"}

This was followed by an enzymatic dissociation with collagenase in calcium-free medium and yielded individual contractile rod-shaped cardiomyocytes. Subsequent addition of Ca2+ caused the cardiomyocytes to round up which was an essential pre-condition for drawing them into glass transfer pipettes for delivery into the perivitelline space and for efficient electrofusion with cytoplasts derived from in vitro matured bovine oocytes. The use of cardiomyocytes maintained at 37 degrees C in nuclear transfer, resulted in a significantly reduced proportion of blastocysts compared to adult fibroblasts (14.0% versus 32.7%).

As expected, hypoxia exposure (300 min at 2 mg/l dissolved oxygen) resulted in a bradycardia and plasma lactate accumulation, but glucose uptake rates did not change in heart, brain, gill, spleen, and white muscle. Plasma glucose-to-intracellular glucose ratios indicated that glucose uptake was the rate-limiting step in glucose utilization.

During hypoxia, the cholinergic blocker atropine resulted in tachycardia but did not significantly change tissue glucose uptake rates or heart and brain adenosine levels.

Furthermore, processed OPA1 was observed in heart tissue derived from heart-specific TFAM knock-out mice suffering from mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and in skeletal muscles from patients suffering from mitochondrial myopathies such as myopathy encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. Dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential leads to fast induction of proteolytic processing of OPA1 and concomitant fragmentation of mitochondria. Recovery of mitochondrial fusion depended on protein synthesis and was accompanied by resynthesis of large isoforms of OPA1. Fragmentation of mitochondria was prevented by overexpressing OPA1. Taken together, our data indicate that proteolytic processing of OPA1 has a key role in inducing fragmentation of energetically compromised mitochondria.

To search for functional cis-acting polymorphisms, we determined allelic expression ratios for total CACNA1C mRNA and several splice variants using marker single nucleotide polymorphisms in exon 4 and exon 30.\nTotal CACNA1C mRNA levels varied approximately 50-fold. Substantial splicing occurred in six loci generating two or more splice variants, some with known functional differences. Splice patterns varied broadly between individuals. Two heart tissues expressed predominantly the dihydropyridine-sensitive smooth muscle isoform of CACNA1C (containing exon 8), rather than the cardiac isoform (containing exon 8a). Lack of significant allelic expression imbalance, observed with total mRNA and several splice variants, argued against CACNA1C polymorphisms as a cause of variability. Taken together, highly variable splicing can cause profound phenotypic variations of CACNA1C function, potentially associated with disease susceptibility and response to L-type calcium channel blockers.", "journal": "Pharmacogenetics and genomics", "date": "2006-09-27", "authors": ["DanxinWang", "Audrey CPapp", "Philip FBinkley", "Julie AJohnson", "WolfgangSad\u00e9e"], "doi": "10.1097/01.fpc.0000230119.34205.8a"}
{"title": "Overexpression of GRK2 in Alzheimer disease and in a chronic hypoperfusion rat model is an early marker of brain mitochondrial lesions.", "abstract": "Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are cytosolic proteins that are known to contribute to the adaptation of the heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and to regulate downstream signals through these receptors. GPCRs mediate the action of messengers that are key modulators of cardiac and vascular cell function, such as growth and differentiation. GRKs are members of a multigene family, which are classified into three subfamilies and are found in cardiac, vascular and cerebral tissues. Increasing evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that vascular damage is an early contributor to the development of Alzheimer disease (AD) and/or other pathology that can mimic human AD. Based on this hypothesis, and since kinases of this family are known to regulate numerous receptor functions both in the brain, myocardium and elsewhere, we explored cellular and subcellular localization by immunoreactivity of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), also known as beta-adrenergic receptor kinase-1(betaARK1), in the early pathogenesis of AD and in ischemia reperfusion injury models of brain hypoperfusion. In the present study, we used the two-vessel carotid artery occlusion model, namely the 2-VO system that results in chronic brain hypoperfusion (CBH) and mimics mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and vascular changes in AD pathology. Our findings demonstrate the early overexpression of GRK2 member kinase in the cerebrovasculature, especially endothelial cells (EC) following CBH, as well as in select cells from human AD tissue. We found a significant increase in GRK2 immunoreactivity in the EC of AD patients and after CBH, which preceded any amyloid deposition. Since GRK2 activity is associated with certain compensatory changes in brain cellular compartments and in ischemic cardiac tissue, our findings suggest that chronic hypoperfusion initiates oxidative stress in these conditions and appears to be the main initiating injury stimulus for disruption of brain and cerebrovascular homeostasis and metabolism.", "journal": "Neurotoxicity research", "date": "2006-09-27", "authors": ["Mark EObrenovich", "Mark ASmith", "Sandra LSiedlak", "Shu GChen", "Jack Cde la Torre", "GeorgePerry", "GjumrakchAliev"], "doi": "10.1007/BF03033333"}

Nucleic acid-based interventional strategies against various viruses, including CVB3, have shown promise experimentally, but limited stability and inefficient delivery in vivo remain as obstacles to their potential as therapeutics. We employed phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) conjugated to a cell-penetrating arginine-rich peptide, P007 (to form PPMO), to address these issues. Eight CVB3-specific PPMO were evaluated with HeLa cells and HL-1 cardiomyocytes in culture and in a murine infection model. One of the PPMO (PPMO-6), designed to target a sequence in the 3' portion of the CVB3 internal ribosomal entry site, was found to be especially potent against CVB3. Treatment of cells with PPMO-6 prior to CVB3 infection produced an approximately 3-log(10) decrease in viral titer and largely protected cells from a virus-induced cytopathic effect. A similar antiviral effect was observed when PPMO-6 treatment began shortly after the virus infection period. A/J mice receiving intravenous administration of PPMO-6 once prior to and once after CVB3 infection showed an approximately 2-log(10)-decreased viral titer in the myocardium at 7 days postinfection and a significantly decreased level of cardiac tissue damage, compared to the controls.

The fact that cells originating from skeletal muscle have different electrophysiological properties than cardiomyocytes, however, may considerably limit the success of this therapy and, in addition, cause side effects. Indeed, a major problem observed after myoblast transplantation is the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. The most often transient nature of these arrhythmias may suggest that, once transplanted into cardiac tissue, skeletal muscle cells adopt more cardiac-like electrophysiological properties. To test whether a cardiac cell environment can indeed modify electrophysiological parameters of skeletal muscle cells, we treated mouse C(2)C(12) myocytes with medium preconditioned by primary cardiocytes and compared their functional sodium current properties with those of control cells. We found this treatment to significantly alter the activation and inactivation properties of sodium currents from \"skeletal muscle\" to more \"cardiac\"-like ones. Sodium currents of cardiac-conditioned cells showed a reduced sensitivity to block by tetrodotoxin. These findings and reverse transcription PCR experiments suggest that an upregulation of the expression of the cardiac sodium channel isoform Na(v)1.5 versus the skeletal muscle isoform Na(v)1.4 is responsible for the observed changes in sodium current function. We conclude that cardiomyocytes alter sodium channel isoform expression of skeletal muscle cells via a paracrine mechanism.

Such long-range signaling of hedgehog is in perfect agreement with current insight that in mammals hedgehog signaling is not terminated after gestation has been completed but remains active throughout life, mediating among others revascularization of adult ischemic cardiac tissue. In agreement, hedgehog gene therapy is highly effective in experimental rodents for limiting the damage after coronary occlusion. If indeed hedgehog is transported on lipoproteins in mammals, an interesting change of paradigm might emerge for LDL.

The present study was designed to explore the diversity of mAChR subtypes in human hearts and determine whether these subtypes are able to interact themselves. Expression of mRNAs encoding all five subtypes was readily detected by RT-PCR reaction in both atrial (A) and ventricle (V) samples. Immunoblotting, MABA and ELISA with subtype-specific antibodies confirmed the presence of M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 proteins in membrane preparations from both A and V. Kinetic characterization using [(3)H]-QNB shown: (1) atrium had greater B(max) than did the ventricle, (2) [(3)H]-QNB behave as an allosteric modulator, inducing cooperativity at high and disclosing heterogeneity at low concentrations, (3) heterogenity was observed in pirenzepine, biperiden and tropicamide competition curves, being the high affinity sites compatible with M1 and M4 muscarinic receptor subtypes and (4) methoctramine competition curves in presence of selective muscarinic receptor subtypes antagonist displayed heterogeneity profile still maintaining cooperativity (n(H)>1), indicating muscarinic receptors subtypes are able to form homo- and hetero-oligomers.

{"title": "Acute administration of vitamin E triggers preconditioning via K(ATP) channels and cyclic-GMP without inhibiting lipid peroxidation.", "abstract": "Vitamin E (VitE) is considered an antioxidant agent. One or more brief periods of ischemia (isc), followed by short reperfusion (rep), increase the tolerance of the heart to a subsequent prolonged ischemia, a phenomenon known as ischemic preconditioning (PC). Mitochondrial KATP channels (mitoKATP), cyclic-GMP (cGMP), and free radicals are involved in the mechanism of PC, whereas some antioxidants abolish this benefit. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of VitE on infarct size, PC, and the oxidative status in vivo. Male rabbits were divided into seven groups and were subjected to myocardial ischemia (isc) and reperfusion (rep) with the following interventions: (1) control (no intervention); (2) E150 (iv VitE at a dose of 150 mg/kg for 75 min, starting 40 min before index isc and lasting through 5 min of rep); (3) E300 (iv VitE 300 mg/kg as previously described); (4) PC (two cycles of 5 min isc and 10 min rep), (5) combined E150-PC; and (6) combined E300-PC. In the last two groups VitE was given 40 min before index ischemia. Blood samples were taken for malondialdehyde (MDA) and conjugated dienes (CDs) measurement. In a second series of experiments heart tissue samples were taken at the time of long ischemia for MDA and CD determination and for cGMP assay. In order to test whether combined treatment with VitE (as the E150 group) and the mitoKATP blocker 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5-HD) changes the infarct size, an additional group was assessed in the first series of experiments. Tissue VitE concentration was evaluated in myocardium. VitE at both doses reduced the infarct size (19.7 +/- 2.8% for E150 and 18.8 +/- 4.9% for E300 vs 47.4 +/- 2.6% in control, P < 0.05) without attenuating the effect of PC (10.2 +/- 3.1% for E150-PC, 12.4 +/- 2.2% for E300-PC, vs 13.5 +/- 3.3% for PC). Combined VitE and 5-HD treatment abrogates this benefit (37.4 +/- 6.5%, P < 0.05 vs E150 and NS vs control). VitE increases intracellular cGMP and CDs levels (P < 0.05 vs control) to the same extent as PC (P < 0.05 vs control), with no effect on MDA (P = NS between all the groups). Peripheral markers of oxidative stress are increased during reperfusion in all groups (P < 0.05 vs baseline).

{"title": "Heart fatty acid binding protein in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction: where do we stand today?", "abstract": "Heart fatty acid binding protein (hFABP) is a novel small cytosolic protein that is abundant in the heart. It is highly cardiac-specific (i.e. expressed primarily in cardiac tissue), but is also expressed at low concentrations in tissues outside the heart. After myocardial ischemic damage, hFABP can be detected in the blood as early as 1-3 h after onset of chest pain, with peak values reached at 6-8 h and plasma levels returning to normal within 24-30 h. hFABP's clinical diagnostic value is very limited in the presence of renal failure and skeletal muscle diseases as it is completely renally eliminated. In these conditions, the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may be overestimated. The combination of initial hFABP release after symptom onset, rapid kidney clearance from the circulation and high cardiac specificity suggests great potential for clinical use. Serial measurements of hFABP in the first 24 h after onset of symptoms in AMI patients can: (a) identify patients who are susceptible to reperfusion strategies, (b) detect perioperative AMIs, (c) distinguish patients who reperfuse their infarct-related artery from those who do not, as early as 30 min after starting thrombolytic treatment, (d) detect re-infarction if it occurs within 10 h after symptom onset, and (e) permit an accurate estimation of myocardial infarct size providing important prognosis information.", "journal": "Cardiology", "date": "2006-09-09", "authors": ["AndreaColli", "MiguelJosa", "Jose LuisPomar", "Carlos AlbertoMestres", "TizianoGherli"], "doi": "10.1159/000095594"}

Ibogaine and noribogaine were quantified in tissues and fluids using a fully validated liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry method.

Very low concentrations of the two drugs were found in the prostatic tissue. Both ibogaine and noribogaine are secreted in the bile and cross the blood-brain barrier. Four other compounds were detected in most of the studied matrices. One of them was identified as ibogamine.

{"title": "Dependence of cardiac 11C-meta-hydroxyephedrine retention on norepinephrine transporter density.", "abstract": "The norepinephrine analog (11)C-meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED) is used with PET to map the regional distribution of cardiac sympathetic neurons. HED is rapidly transported into sympathetic neurons by the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and stored in vesicles. Although much is known about the neuronal mechanisms of HED uptake and retention, there is little information about the functional relationship between HED retention and cardiac sympathetic nerve density. The goal of this study was to characterize the dependence of HED retention on nerve density in rats with graded levels of cardiac denervation induced chemically with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA).\nThirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups, and each group was administered a different dose of 6-OHDA: 0 (controls), 7, 11, 15, 22, and 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally. One day after 6-OHDA injection, HED (3.7-8.3 MBq) was injected intravenously into each animal and HED concentrations in heart and blood at 30 min after injection were determined. Heart tissues were frozen and later processed by tissue homogenization and differential centrifugation into a membrane preparation for in vitro measurement of cardiac NET density. A saturation binding assay using (3)H-mazindol as the radioligand was used to measure NET density (maximum number of binding sites [B(max)], fmol/mg protein) for each heart.\nIn control animals, NET B(max) was 388 +/- 23 fmol/mg protein and HED heart uptake (HU) at 30 min was 2.89% +/- 0.35 %ID/g (%ID/g is percentage injected dose per gram tissue). The highest 6-OHDA dose of 100 mg/kg caused severe cardiac denervation, decreasing both NET B(max) and HED HU to 8% of their control values. Comparing values for all doses of 6-OHDA, HED retention had a strong linear correlation with NET density: HU = 0.0077B(max) -0.028, r(2) = 0.95.\nHED retention is linearly dependent on NET density in rat hearts that have been chemically denervated with 6-OHDA, suggesting that HED retention is a good surrogate measure of NET density in the rat heart.

Cardiac tissue responds to a variety of stimuli by hypertrophic growth. Molecular mechanisms resulting in the hypertrophic response indicate similarity and overlap with those involved in both cell growth and death. We hypothesized cell cycle control to be the key event in progression regulation of heart valve degeneration followed by tissue mineralization. Human post-operative tissue samples of native non-rheumatic stenosed aortic valves were categorized according to absence (group 1) or presence of calcification (group 2). The samples were ex vivo examined for cell density and presence of macrophage (CD68), as well as expression of two checkpoint genes, p21WAF1/CIP1 and 14-3-3 sigma, arresting the G1 and G2 cell cycle phases, respectively. Expression rates were measured by \"Real-Time\"-PCR on transcriptional level. Target protein expression was measured and their co-localization in different kinds of valvular cells was tested using immunohistochemical analysis. Whereas macrophages were localized predominantly in sub-endothelial layer of valvular fibrosis, p21WAF1/CIP1 and 14-3-3 sigma expression was observed also in the valvular spongiosa co-localized with alpha-actin positive cells. Significantly higher cell density and inflammation grade were observed in group 2 versus group 1. Accordingly, p21WAF1/CIP1 and 14-3-3 sigma expression was several fold higher in group 1 versus group 2 on both transcription and translation levels. The present findings on degenerated aortic valves show that increased cell density accompanied with consequent calcification might be attributed to the down-regulation of both G1 and G2 checkpoint genes.", "journal": "Amino acids", "date": "2006-09-06", "authors": ["OGolubnitschaja", "KYeghiazaryan", "DSkowasch", "HSchild", "GBauriedel"], "doi": "10.1007/s00726-006-0365-3"}

Microscopic examination of both myectomy specimens from patients bearing genetic defects in metavinculin and vinculin showed a marked reduction of vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated disc, but normal expression in the Z-disc. Given that distinct functional domains were altered by the metavinculin and vinculin mutations, we hypothesized that the intercalated disc-specific reduction of vinculin may stem from left ventricular tract obstruction in general rather than rarely observed perturbations in VCL-encoded vinculin. To test this hypothesis, we examined the localization of vinculin/metavinculin in hypertrophied human heart tissue from patients with cardiovascular conditions associated with obstruction and hemodynamic overload using an immunohistochemistry approach. Tissue specimens derived from patients with obstructive HCM and aortic stenosis (AS) showed a universal defect of vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated disc but preserved expression in the cardiac Z-disc, whereas tissue specimens derived from patients with either DCM, hypertensive heart disease (HTN), or pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) exhibited normal expression of vinculin/metavinculin in both the Z- and the intercalated disc despite being associated with hypertrophy. Results of this study suggest that cardiac hypertrophy may be associated with different expression of the marker vinculin/metavinculin depending on the underlying pathophysiology; hemodynamic overload may not affect the localization whereas obstructive disease substantially reduces the expression of vinculin preferentially in the intercalated disc.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2006-09-05", "authors": ["Vlad CVasile", "William DEdwards", "Steve ROmmen", "Michael JAckerman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.08.106"}

Cyclosporine A (CsA) is the most widely used immunosuppressive drug, but its therapeutic use has several side effects including, i.e. nephrotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. This study was designed to examine the beneficial effects of melatonin in preventing CsA-induced cardiotoxicity. Additionally, we investigated the ability of melatonin to protect the rat heart via melatonin receptor. In one group of Wistar rats, melatonin (1 mg/kg/day i.p.) was administered concurrently with CsA (15 mg/kg/day s.c.) for 21 days. In another group of animals, melatonin was injected with CsA and luzindole, an antagonist of melatonin receptors. Oxidative stress in heart tissue homogenates was estimated using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione levels and antioxidant enzyme activities including catalase and superoxide dismutase. CsA administration for 21 days produced elevated levels of TBARS, marked depletion of cardiac antioxidant enzymes and caused morphological alterations in myocardial fibers. Melatonin markedly reduced TBARS levels, increased the antioxidant enzyme levels and normalized altered cardiac morphology. The protective effects of melatonin were lost when the animals received the melatonin receptor antagonist. In conclusion our study shows that, (a) melatonin significantly reduces CsA cardiotoxicity, and (b) the reduction in CsA-induced cardiotoxicity was mediated by the binding of melatonin to its membrane receptors.", "journal": "Journal of pineal research", "date": "2006-09-05", "authors": ["RitaRezzani", "Luigi FRodella", "FrancescaBonomini", "SandraTengattini", "RossellaBianchi", "Russel JReiter"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-079X.2006.00368.x"}

It was found to be a potent free radical scavenger and antioxidant recently. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of CAPE on cadmium (Cd)-induced hypertension and cardiomyopathy in rats. In particular, nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to the pathophysiology of Cd induced cardiac impairment. Malondialdehyde (MDA, an index of lipid peroxidation) levels and nitric oxide (NO, a vasodilator) levels were used as markers Cd-induced cardiac impairment and the success of CAPE treatment. Also, the findings have been supported by the histopathologic evidences. The rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups each (12), as follows: the control group, Cd-treated group (Cd) and Cd plus CAPE-treated group (Cd+CAPE). CdCl(2) in 0.9% NaCl was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a dose of 1mg/kg/day. CAPE was co-administered i.p. a dose of 10 microM/kg for 15 days. Hypertension was found to be induced by intraperitoneal administration of Cd in a dose of 1mg/kg/day on the measurements taken 15 days later. MDA levels were increased (p<0.001) in cardiac tissue and NO levels were decreased (p<0.05) in serum in the Cd group than those of the control group had. On the other hand, there was a slight difference (increase) in MDA levels in the Cd+CAPE group than the ones in the control group (p<0.003). In addition, MDA levels were decreased and NO levels were increased in the Cd+CAPE group compared with the Cd group (p<0.001, p<0.0001, respectively). As a result, treatment with CAPE significantly reversed the increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) product, MDA, and decreased NO levels in Cd treated animals. In the histopathologic examination, a significant hypertrophy in atrial and ventricular myofibrils was observed in only Cd administered group, in comparison with the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the CAPE given and control groups by means of atrial and ventricular myofibril diameters.

ATS is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with ventricular arrhythmias that uncommonly degenerate into the lethal arrhythmia torsade de pointes. We simulated the cellular and tissue effects of a potent disease-causing mutation D71V K(ir)2.1 with mathematical models of human ventricular myocytes and a bidomain model of transmural conduction. The D71V K(ir)2.1 mutation caused significant action potential duration prolongation in subendocardial, midmyocardial, and subepicardial myocytes but did not significantly increase transmural dispersion of repolarization. Simulations of the D71V mutation at shorter cycle lengths induced stable action potential alternans in midmyocardial, but not subendocardial or subepicardial cells. The action potential alternans was manifested as an abbreviated QRS complex in the transmural ECG, the result of action potential propagation failure in the midmyocardial tissue. In addition, our simulations of D71V mutation recapitulate several key ECG features of ATS, including QT prolongation, T-wave flattening, and QRS widening.

To determine whether this effect correlates with inhibition of TGH activity, we investigated the ability of URB597 to inhibit triolein hydrolysis in rat liver and heart tissues, which are rich in TGH, as well as white adipose tissue (WAT), which is rich in adipose triacylglycerol lipase (TGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase. The results show that URB597 does not affect triolein hydrolysis in any of these tissues at concentrations as high as 10microM, whereas it inhibits FAAH activity at low nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of URB597 at doses that maximally inhibit FAAH in vivo (0.3-3mgkg(-1)) exerts no effect on triolein hydrolysis and tissue triacylglycerol (TAG) levels in rat liver, heart or WAT. The results indicate that URB597, while potent at inhibiting FAAH, does not affect TGH and TGL activities in rat tissues.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2006-08-29", "authors": ["Jason RClapper", "AndreaDuranti", "AndreaTontini", "MarcoMor", "GiorgioTarzia", "DanielePiomelli"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2006.06.008"}
{"title": "Cardiac mitochondrial damage and loss of ROS defense after burn injury: the beneficial effects of antioxidant therapy.", "abstract": "Mechanisms of burn-related cardiac dysfunction may involve defects in mitochondria. This study determined 1) whether burn injury alters myocardial mitochondrial integrity and function; and 2) whether an antioxidant vitamin therapy prevented changes in cardiac mitochondrial function after burn. Sprague-Dawley rats were given a 3 degrees burn over 40% total body surface area and fluid resuscitated. Antioxidant vitamins or vehicle were given to sham and burn rats. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared from heart tissues at several times postburn. In mitochondria, lipid peroxidation was measured to assess oxidative stress, mitochondrial outer membrane damage and cytochrome-c translocation were determined to estimate mitochondrial integrity, and activities of SOD and glutathione peroxidase were examined to evaluate mitochondrial antioxidant defense. Cardiac function was measured by Langendorff model in sham and burn rats given either vitamins or vehicle. Twenty-four hours postburn, mitochondrial outer membrane damage was progressively increased to approximately 50%, and cytosolic cytochrome-c gradually accumulated to approximately three times more than that measured in shams, indicating impaired mitochondrial integrity. Maximal decrease of mitochondrial SOD activity occurred 8 h postburn ( approximately 63.5% of shams), whereas maximal decrease in glutathione peroxidase activity persisted 2-24 h postburn ( approximately 60% of shams). In burn animals, lipid peroxidation in cardiac mitochondria increased 30-50%, suggesting burn-induced oxidative stress. Antioxidant vitamin therapy prevented burn-related loss of membrane integrity and antioxidant defense in myocardial mitochondria and prevented cardiac dysfunction. These data suggest that burn-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of reactive oxygen species defense may play a role in postburn cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "date": "2006-08-26", "authors": ["QunZang", "David LMaass", "JeanWhite", "Jureta WHorton"], "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.00359.2006"}
{"title": "Washout of heme-containing proteins dramatically improves tetrazolium-based infarct staining.", "abstract": "Methods to determine infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion injury include gross staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and perfusion of colored dyes to demarcate the non-ischemic zone. Infarcted tissue (INF) can typically appear a mottled tan to brownish color, making a border between INF and TTC-positive tissue difficult to discern. Previous work in our lab indicated that following TTC staining, prolonged washing of thick sections dramatically sharpened this boundary.\nAdult rats underwent 30 min ischemia via LAD ligation and reperfusion/recovery over 24 h. Hearts were then harvested, thick-sectioned, and stained with TTC. Stained sections were stored in PBS at 4 degrees C for up to 3 weeks.\nHistology on thin sections from infarcted hearts fixed directly after harvest revealed extensive hemorrhage within the INF. However, this hemorrhage is washed out when hearts are stored in PBS for 3 weeks. SDS-PAGE of PBS samples taken at 1, 2, and 3 weeks showed a low molecular weight band appearing over time. Peptide sequencing revealed the presence of several proteins including the heme-containing proteins (HCPs) hemoglobin, cytochrome c, and myoglobin. The loss of HCPs from thick sections to PBS corresponded with the blanching of the previously mottled INF within each section. HPLC analysis of these samples confirmed the loss of HCPs contributes to INF whitening. Further, analysis of infarct size values derived from heart slices with or without HCPs showed a significant decrease in measurement error when values were derived from slices without HCPs.\nThese data suggest that HCPs in the heart tissue contribute to the non-uniform and discolored appearance of the INF, and that washout of these proteins produces an INF more easily distinguished from neighboring non-infarcted tissue. This method greatly reduces the error associated with infarct measurements and improves the analysis of the effects of drug treatments and other interventions designed to impact ischemia reperfusion injury.", "journal": "Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods", "date": "2006-08-26", "authors": ["Kelly RPitts", "AnnStiko", "BernardBuetow", "FredLott", "PingGuo", "DukeVirca", "Christopher FToombs"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vascn.2006.06.005"}
{"title": "Increased cyclooxygenase-2 expression and prostaglandin-mediated dilation in coronary arterioles of patients with diabetes mellitus.", "abstract": "Based on findings of experimental models of diabetes mellitus (DM) showing increased expression of vascular cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), we hypothesized that in patients with DM changes in COX-2-dependent prostaglandin synthesis affect vasomotor responses of coronary arterioles. Arterioles were dissected from the right atrial appendages obtained at the time of cardiac surgery of patient with DM(+) or without documented diabetes DM(-). Isolated arterioles (89+/-15 microm in diameter) were cannulated and pressurized (at 80 mm Hg), and changes in diameter were measured with video microscopy. After spontaneous tone developed [DM(-): 32+/-7%; DM(+): 37+/-5%; P=NS], arteriolar responses to bradykinin were investigated. Dilations to bradykinin (0.1 nmol/L to 1 micromol/L) were significantly (P<0.05) greater in DM(+) than DM(-) patients (10 nmol/L: 77+/-10% versus 38+/-14%). In both groups, dilations were similar to the NO-donor, sodium nitroprusside. In arterioles of DM(+), but not those of DM(-), patients' bradykinin-induced dilations were reduced by the nonselective COX inhibitor indomethacin or by the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (DM(+) at 10 nmol/L: to 20+/-4% and 29+/-7%, respectively). Correspondingly, a marked COX-2 immunostaining was detected in coronary arterioles of DM(+), but not in those of DM(-) patients. We conclude that in coronary arterioles of diabetic patients bradykinin induces enhanced COX-2-derived prostaglandin-mediated dilation. These findings are the first to show that in humans diabetes mellitus increases COX-2 expression and dilator prostaglandin synthesis in coronary arterioles, which may serve to increase dilator capacity and maintain adequate perfusion of cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2006-08-19", "authors": ["Tam\u00e1sSzerafin", "N\u00f3raErdei", "TiborF\u00fcl\u00f6p", "Eniko TPasztor", "Istv\u00e1nEdes", "AkosKoller", "ZsoltBagi"], "doi": "10.1161/01.RES.0000241051.83067.62"}

Mutations in 6 genes, including 4 encoding desmosomal proteins (Junctional plakoglobin (JUP), Desmoplakin (DSP), Plakophilin 2, and Desmoglein 2), have been identified in patients with ARVD/C. Mutation analysis of 66 probands identified 4 variants in DSP; V30M, Q90R, W233X, and R2834H. To establish a cause and effect relationship between those DSP missense mutations and ARVD/C, we performed in vitro and in vivo analyses of the mutated proteins. Unlike wild-type (WT) DSP, the N-terminal mutants (V30M and Q90R) failed to localize to the cell membrane in desomosome-forming cell line and failed to bind to and coimmunoprecipitate JUP. Multiple attempts to generate N-terminal DSP (V30M and Q90R) cardiac-specific transgenes have failed: analysis of embryos revealed evidence of profound ventricular dilation, which likely resulted in embryonic lethality. We were able to develop transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of the C-terminal mutant (R2834H) or WT DSP. Whereas mice overexpressing WT DSP had no detectable histologic, morphological, or functional cardiac changes, the R2834H-Tg mice had increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and lipid accumulation, along with ventricular enlargement and cardiac dysfunction in both ventricles. These mice also displayed interruption of DSP-desmin interaction at intercalated discs (IDs) and marked ultra-structural changes of IDs.

However, little information is available about the time course of homing and differentiation of systemically delivered MSCs after acute myocardial ischemia (MI). In the present study, MSCs were isolated from male rat bone marrow and expanded in vitro. Female rats were divided randomly into three groups. Three hours after coronary ligation, the transplanted group received an infusion of MSCs through the tail vein; at the same time, a coronary-ligated control group was injected with culture medium, and a normal (unligated) group received MSCs. Homing of MSCs to the heart was assessed by expression of the Y chromosome sry gene using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) at 3 days, 1, 4, and 8 weeks after transplantation. Immunofluorescent staining was used to examine markers for cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Hemodynamics in the hearts was also measured to assess cardiac function. At each time point, sry-positive cells were present in the cardiac tissue in transplanted group but not in the hearts of normal and control group animals. The number of sry-positive cells was significantly higher at 1 week compared to 3 days after transplantation. No significant difference was found in the number of sry-positive cells among those of 1, 4, and 8 weeks after transplantation. At 3 days and 1 week after transplantation, the sry-positive cells in the transplanted group lacked troponin, desmin, smooth muscle alpha-actin, and CD31. At the later time points, cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells bearing sry were identified in the transplanted group. The cardiac function in transplanted group showed higher improvement at 4 and 8 weeks compared to 1 week after transplantation. Our data suggest that intravenously delivered MSCs are capable of homing toward the ischemic myocardium, and the fastigium of homing appeared around 1 week after MI.

{"title": "Association of 14-3-3 proteins to beta1-adrenergic receptors modulates Kv11.1 K+ channel activity in recombinant systems.", "abstract": "We identify a new mechanism for the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR)-mediated regulation of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel (Kv11.1). We find that the previously reported modulatory interaction between Kv11.1 channels and 14-3-3epsilon proteins is competed by wild type beta(1)AR by means of a novel interaction between this receptor and 14-3-3epsilon. The association between beta(1)AR and 14-3-3epsilon is increased by agonist stimulation in both transfected cells and heart tissue and requires cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity. The beta(1)AR/14-3-3epsilon association is direct, since it can be recapitulated using purified 14-3-3epsilon and beta(1)AR fusion proteins and is abolished in cells expressing beta(1)AR phosphorylation-deficient mutants. Biochemical and electrophysiological studies of the effects of isoproterenol on Kv11.1 currents recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp demonstrated that beta(1)AR phosphorylation-deficient mutants do not recruit 14-3-3epsilon away from Kv11.1 and display a markedly altered agonist-mediated modulation of Kv11.1 currents compared with wild-type beta(1)AR, increasing instead of inhibiting current amplitudes. Interestingly, such differential modulation is not observed in the presence of 14-3-3 inhibitors.

As assessed by phase-contrast and confirmed by confocal microscopy, coculturing of healthy cardiocytes with cardiocytes rendered apoptotic via extrinsic pathways revealed a clearance mechanism that to our knowledge has not previously been described. Cultured fetal cardiocytes expressed phosphatidylserine receptors (PSRs), as did cardiac tissue from a fetus with congenital heart block (CHB) and an age-matched control.

However, this phenomenon is not completely understood. It is known that alternans at the cellular level can be caused by dynamical instabilities arising from either membrane voltage (V(m)) attributable to steep APD restitution or to calcium (Ca) cycling. Here, we used a mathematical model of intracellular Ca cycling, coupled with membrane ion currents, to investigate the dynamics of V(m) and Ca(i) transient alternans in an isolated cell, in two electrotonically coupled cells, and in 1D spatially homogeneous tissue. Our main finding is a novel instability mechanism in which the bidirectional coupling of V(m) and Ca(i) can drive the Ca(i) transient of two neighboring cells to be out of phase. This instability is manifested in cardiac tissue by the dynamical formation of spatially discordant alternans. In this case, Ca(i) transient alternans can reverse phase over a length scale of one cell, whereas APD alternans reverses phase over a much longer length scale set by the electrotonic coupling. We analyze this mechanism in detail and show that it is a robust consequence of experimentally established properties of the bidirectional coupling between Ca cycling and V(m) dynamics.

Twenty four male Wistar rats, 200 g, were divided into the following 4 groups (n = 6): control (C), OO group that received extra-virgin olive oil (7.5 mL/kg), OA group was treated with oleic acid (3.45 mL/kg), and the DPE group that received the polyphenol DPE (7.5 mg/kg). These components were administered by gavage over 30 days, twice a week. All animals were provided with food and water ad libitum. The results show that olive oil was more effective than its isolated components in improving lipid profile, elevating high-density lipoprotein, and diminishing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Olive oil induced decreased antioxidant Mn-superoxide dismutase activity and diminished protein carbonyl concentration, indicating that olive oil may exert direct antioxidant effect on myocardium. DPE, considered as potential antioxidant, induced elevated aerobic metabolism, triacylglycerols, and lipid hydroperoxides concentrations in cardiac muscle, indicating that long-term intake of this polyphenol may induce its undesirable pro-oxidant activity on myocardium.", "journal": "Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology", "date": "2006-08-12", "authors": ["Luciane AFaine", "Hosana GRodrigues", "Cristiano MGalhardi", "Geovana M XEbaid", "Yeda SDiniz", "Carlos RPadovani", "Ethel L BNovelli"], "doi": "10.1139/y05-124"}

Heart affection is the most common cause of death in patients with iron overload. Although the beneficial effects of deferoxamine (DFO) on iron-associated mortality are well documented, the role of deferiprone in the management of transfusional iron overload is controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the protective effect of iron chelators (DFO and deferiprone) individually and in combination with the anti-oxidant (vitamin C) in the prevention of myocardial damage. Sixty albino rats were divided into six groups: two control groups (noniron-loaded and iron-loaded) and four iron-loaded groups classified as follows: DFO group, DFO combined with vitamin C group, deferiprone group and deferiprone combined with vitamin C group. Heart tissue and blood samples were taken for histopathological examination of the heart, determination of total iron-binding capacity, 8-OH-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), myocardial lipid peroxidation and glutathione (GSH) content. Less histopathological cardiac changes and a significant decrease in all biochemical parameters, except myocardial GSH, were observed in the deferiprone group.

The influence of lidocaine on serum, heart and liver propranolol levels in Wistar rats after liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride CCl4 0.4 ml/kg x 2/wkl, was investigated. 40 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (I, II, III, IV; n=10), Group I animals received only propranolol (labelled + cold substance) 40 mg/kg/12 h p.o., group II propranolol plus lidocaine in a single dose of 4mg/kg s.c., group III was treated with CCl4 for 6 weeks and received propranolol x2 at the same dosage as group I, while group VI was treated with CCl4 and the same drug dosage as group II. The simultaneous administration of H3-propranolol and lidocaine increased propranolol levels in the serum and tissues. The liver in damaged animals showed an increase of propranolol level under lidocaine co-administration, probably due to CCl4 induced liver enzyme activity, resulting in a rapid propranolol metabolism or to competition between both drug protein binding sites. The increased propranolol levels in the heart after lidocaine administration were probably due to attributed to its high affinity for heart tissue. Consequently, as regards the therapeutic approach for patients with liver disease receiving propranolol their propranolol dosage should be reduced when lidocaine is co-administered.", "journal": "European journal of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics", "date": "2006-08-11", "authors": ["AKotsiou", "MTsamouri", "SAnagnostopoulou", "MTzivras", "EVairactaris", "CTesseromatis"], "doi": "10.1007/BF03191125"}

Here we evaluate the efficacy of this peptide and its derivatives first in vitro and then in an animal model of lethal viral infection with the encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. Deletion of the NLS region from the IFN-gamma mimetic peptide IFN-gamma(95-133) resulted in loss of antiviral activity. However, the NLS region does not have antiviral activity in itself. Replacing the NLS region of IFN-gamma(95-133) with the NLS region of the simian virus 40 large T antigen retains the antiviral activity in tissue culture. IFN-gamma(95-133) prevented EMC virus-induced lethality in mice in a dose-dependent manner compared to controls. Mice treated with IFN-gamma(95-133) had no or low EMC virus titers in their internal organs, whereas control mice had consistently high viral titers, especially in the heart tissues. Injection of B8R protein, which is encoded by poxviruses as a defense mechanism to neutralize host IFN-gamma, did not inhibit IFN-gamma(95-133) protection against a lethal dose of EMC virus, whereas mice treated with rat IFN-gamma were not protected.

Short-term activation (2 wk) of Akt1 resulted in completely reversible hypertrophy with maintained contractility. In contrast, chronic Akt1 activation (6 wk) induced extensive cardiac hypertrophy, severe contractile dysfunction, and massive interstitial fibrosis. The focus of this study was to create a transcript expression profile of the heart as it undergoes reversible Akt1-mediated hypertrophy and during the transition from compensated hypertrophy to heart failure. Heart tissue was analyzed before transgene induction, 2 wk after transgene induction, 2 wk of transgene induction followed by 2 days of repression, 6 wk after transgene induction, and 6 wk of transgene induction followed by 2 wk of repression. Acute overexpression of Akt1 (2 wk) leads to changes in the expression of 826 transcripts relative to noninduced hearts, whereas chronic induction (6 wk) led to changes in the expression of 1,611, of which 65% represented transcripts that were regulated during the pathological phase of heart growth. Another set of genes identified was uniquely regulated during heart regression but not growth, indicating that nonoverlapping transcription programs participate in the processes of cardiac hypertrophy and atrophy.

Using an antibody that specifically recognizes Cx43 phosphorylated at serine residues 325, 328 and/or 330 (pS325/328/330-Cx43), we show that labeling of this form of Cx43 as well as of total Cx43 is restricted to the intercalated disk region of normal ventricular tissue. In ischemic heart, significant relocalization of total Cx43 to the lateral edges of myocytes was evident; however pS325/328/330-Cx43 remained predominately at the intercalated disk. Western blots indicated a eightfold decrease in pS325/328/330-Cx43 in ischemic tissue. Peptide-binding- and competition-experiments indicated that our antibody mainly detected Cx43 phosphorylated at S328 and/or S330 in heart tissue. To evaluate how this change in Cx43 phosphorylation contributes to ischemia-induced downregulation of intercellular communication, we stably transfected Cx43(-/-) cells with a Cx43 construct in which serine residues 325, 328 and 330 had been mutated to alanine (Cx43-TM). Cx43-TM was not efficiently processed to isoforms that have been correlated with gap junction assembly. Nevertheless, Cx43-TM cells were electrically coupled, although development of coupling was delayed. Fully opened channels were only rarely observed in Cx43-TM cells, and Lucifer-Yellow-dye-coupling was significantly reduced compared with wild-type cells.

Male NMRI mice (6-10 weeks old) underwent laparotomy, proximal ligation of the cecum, and double perforation with a 19-gauge needle (cecal ligation and puncture). Mice were randomly treated with saline (control) or dexamethasone at doses of 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg ip.

Sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture produced a marked increase in MIF and cytokine levels in plasma and peritoneal fluid. Treatment with dexamethasone 10 mg/kg decreased MIF levels in plasma after 18 h, but there was no effect of dexamethasone on MIF production locally in the peritoneal cavity or in the liver, lungs, heart, or kidneys.

To better understand the role of Atg4B in rat tissue cells, we prepared antibodies against Atg4B, and PC12 cells in which the expression of Atg4B was knocked down by RNA interference. In the RNA interference-treated PC12 cells, for which the expression of Atg4B was 10% of wild-type PC12 cells, the expression of cytosolic LC3-I was similar to that in wild-type cells. Knockdown cell lysates, however, suppressed the cleavage of recombinant proLC3 to LC3-I. Moreover, the expression of Atg4B protein and mRNA was ubiquitous in rat tissues; however, the expression levels were not identical, but were dependent on the tissue, with the expression high in brain and testicular tissue, and low in muscular and heart tissue. In brain tissue, the expression of Atg4B protein and mRNA was higher in neurons, especially in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, as evidenced by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated gene delivery has emerged as a realistic method for the treatment of such disorders. Here, we demonstrate and compare the natural affinity of specific AAV serotype capsids for transduction of cardiac tissue. We compared the previously accepted optimal rAAV serotype for transduction of skeletal muscle, rAAV2/1, with rAAV2/8 and the newer rAAV2/9 vectors carrying the CMV-lacZ construct in their respective abilities to transcend vasculature and transduce myocardium following intravenous delivery of 1x10(11) vector genomes in neonatal mice. We found that both rAAV2/8 and rAAV2/9 are able to transduce myocardium at approximately 20- and 200-fold (respectively) higher levels than rAAV2/1. Biodistribution analysis revealed that rAAV2/9 and rAAV2/8 demonstrate similar behavior in extracardiac tissue. Vector genome quantification showed an increase in genome copy numbers in cardiac tissue for several weeks following administration, which corresponds to expression data. In addition, we intravenously administered 1x10(11) vector genomes of rAAV2/9-CMV-lacZ into adult mice and achieved an expression biodistribution profile similar to that found following delivery to newborns. Although higher doses of virus will be necessary to approach those levels observed following neonatal injections, adult myocardium is also readily transduced by rAAV2/9.

These cRMs and 6 cTnI-positive human serum pools were shipped to manufacturers of 15 cTnI assays. Commutability of the materials was examined by determining the numerical relationship for the cRM preparations between each manufacturer-specified field method and each of the other 14 field methods. These relationships were then compared with the corresponding numerical relationships for the human serum pools. Harmonization of methods was accomplished by determining regression parameters relative to the analytical system yielding values closest to the median for each serum pool. These regression parameters were used to recalculate pool values to harmonize the assays. Interassay CVs before and after harmonization were determined.\nCharacterization of the CIT and CI cRMs showed that these materials were of specified composition.

Lipid treatment resulted in more rapid loss of bupivacaine from heart tissue (P < .0016). Late lipid infusion, 75 seconds after bupivacaine infusion ended, increased the release of bupivacaine measured in effluent for the first 15-second interval compared with controls (183 vs. 121 nmol, n = 5 for both groups, P < .008).\nLipid emulsion speeds loss of bupivacaine from cardiac tissue while accelerating recovery from bupivacaine-induced asystole. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that bupivacaine partitions into the emulsion and supports the concept of a \"lipid sink.\" However, the data do not exclude other possible mechanisms of action.", "journal": "Regional anesthesia and pain medicine", "date": "2006-07-22", "authors": ["Guy LWeinberg", "RichardRipper", "PatriciaMurphy", "Lucas BEdelman", "WilliamHoffman", "GaryStrichartz", "Douglas LFeinstein"], "doi": "10.1016/j.rapm.2005.02.011"}

Due to the updating of genome data, much of the genome information with which the chips were designed is out-of-date and it has been reported that many of the genes/transcripts on the chips differ from their original definition when mapping the probes to the new genome information. Dai et al. have reported that the updated definition can cause as much as 30-50% discrepancy in the genes selected as differentially expressed on a heart tissue expression profiling dataset. Understanding the nature of this difference is therefore very important for the utilization of the data. In this work, with a large cancer dataset as an example, we compared two major definitions and investigated their effects on classification, clustering, discovery of differentially expressed genes and gene-set-based analysis. Results show that the two definitions agree well on clustering and classification results but genes and gene sets discovered as differentially expressed or enriched can be very different.

Recent studies indicate that curcumin, a potent antioxidant, may be beneficial in preventing diabetes-induced oxidative stress and subsequent secondary complications. We have investigated the effects of curcumin on the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in cardiac tissues and cultured cells.\nStreptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with curcumin for a period of one month. Heart tissues were then analyzed for endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression. Oxidative protein and DNA damage were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of nitrotyrosine and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Heart tissues were further subjected to endothelin-1 (ET-1) mRNA expression. In order to further characterize the effects of curcumin, we assayed microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs). Cultured MVECs, exposed either to glucose or glucose and varying concentrations of curcumin, were assessed for alterations of NOS expression and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activating protein-1 (AP-1). Oxidative stress and ET-1 expression levels were also assayed.\nOur results indicate that one month of diabetes causes an upregulation of both eNOS and iNOS mRNA levels, and nitrotyrosine and 8-OHdG immunoreactivity in the heart. Treatment of diabetic rats with curcumin reduced eNOS and iNOS levels in association with reduced oxidative DNA and protein damage. Interestingly, curcumin further increased vasoconstrictor ET-1 in the heart. Exposure of MVECs to high glucose increased both eNOS and iNOS levels and oxidative stress. Curcumin prevented NOS alteration and oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner which was mediated by nuclear factor-kappaB and activating protein-1. Exposure to curcumin also increased ET-1 levels in the MVECs.\nOur studies indicate the differential effects of curcumin in vasoactive factor expression in the heart and indicate the importance of tissue microenvironment in the treatment of diabetic complications.", "journal": "Nutrition & metabolism", "date": "2006-07-20", "authors": ["HanaFarhangkhoee", "Zia AKhan", "ShaliChen", "SubrataChakrabarti"], "doi": "10.1186/1743-7075-3-27\n10.1056/NEJM199309303291401\n10.1038/414813a\n10.1001/jama.288.20.2579\n10.2174/157016106775203081\n10.1097/00075197-200209000-00016\n10.1016/S0891-5849(03)00499-4\n10.1016/0167-5273(94)90329-8\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00115-7\n10.1055/s-2004-814489\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(200002)190:3<244::AID-PATH575>3.0.CO;2-8\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2003.09.007\n10.1023/A:1013106527829\n10.1080/10408690490424702\n10.1074/jbc.270.42.24995\n10.1080/15604280214281\n10.1159/000046319\n10.1248/bpb.26.725\n10.1007/s00125-005-1801-8\n10.1139/y04-052\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.06.018\n10.1007/s00418-004-0678-9\n10.1016/S0891-5849(03)00401-5\n10.1016/S0006-2952(00)00489-5\n10.1006/bbrc.1995.1076\n10.1016/S1089-8603(03)00030-2\n10.1093/molehr/gah040\n10.1210/jc.85.6.2345"}

However, the alteration of MMP-2 and MMP-9 from post MI left ventricle remodeling to heart failure remains to be clarified. The purpose of this study is to investigate the serum concentrations and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the developing heart failure from post MI patients. Twenty eight patients with MI without heart failure (Killip FC I) (group A; compensated) and twenty seven MI patients with heart failure (Killip II-III) (group B; decompensated) were collected to evaluate the serum levels and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by ELISA and Zymography, respectively. It was observed that the both serum levels and activities of MMP-9 significantly increased (P < 0.01) in decompensated group compared to compensated group, but there was no significant difference of serum MMP-2 levels and activities between two groups. The highly elevated serum MMP-9 concentration of decompensated patients is not related with inflammatory or localized infarct area of myocardium and the real mechanisms remain to be revealed.

At the end of this period, all the rats, except the normal untreated rats that served as the control group, were administered ISO, 85 mg kg(-1) subcutaneously, for 2 consecutive days to induce myocardial injury. After 48 h, rats (n=6 per group) were anaesthetized with anesthetic ether, sacrificed and the levels of biochemical and histological observations of the heart tissues were performed.\nOur results suggest that prior administration of GSP maintained the levels of the marker enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH and CK) in all the treatment groups (GSP-50-ISO, GSP-100-ISO and GSP-150-ISO) when compared to ISO-injected rats. The entire baseline groups also showed no significant alterations in serum marker enzyme levels in comparison to that of control group. Interestingly, in this study, there was no significant change in the basal levels of myocardial TBARS, GST, SOD and CAT on administration of GSP in all the three dosages (GSP-50-BL, GSP-100-BL and GSP-150-BL). However, a significant decrease occurred in the levels of GSH and GPx in group GSP-50-BL, which in the absence of any cellular injury (as evidenced by histological studies), is considered to be non-lethal. In the ISO-injected group there was a significant rise in TBARS and a significant decrease in GSH, GPx, GST, SOD and CAT when compared to group control. The administration of GSP maintained the activities of these enzymes close to normal levels when compared to group ISO, which proves the stress stabilizing action of GSP. The biochemical and histological evidence from this study shows that 100 and 150 mg kg(-1) of GSP protected against ISO-induced myocardial injury.\nThis study demonstrates that GSP has a significant effect in the protection of heart against MI induced by ISO.

Such images can be obtained using high-speed charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras and photodiode arrays with time resolution up to 0.5 ms. To test the method, we simulate optical signals produced by point sources and propagating ellipsoidal waves in 1-cm-thick slabs of myocardial tissue. Solutions of the optical diffusion equation are constructed by employing the method of images with Robin boundary conditions. The coordinates of point sources as well as of the centers of expanding waves can be accurately determined using the proposed algorithm. The method can be extended to depth estimations of the outer boundaries of the expanding wave. The depth estimates are based on ratios of spatially integrated images. The method shows high tolerance to noise and can give accurate results even at relatively low signal-to-noise ratios.

Four weeks after transplantation, the myocardial tubes demonstrated spontaneous and synchronous pulsations independent of the host heartbeat. Independent graft pressures with a magnitude of 5.9+/-1.7 mm Hg due to their independent pulsations were also observed (n=4). Additionally, histological examination and transmission electron microscopy indicated that the beating tubes were composed of cardiac tissues that resemble the native heart. Finally, when myocardial tubes used for aortic replacement were compared with grafts implanted in the abdominal cavity (n=7), we observed significantly increased tissue thickness, as well as expression of brain natriuretic peptide, myosin heavy chain-alpha, and myosin heavy chain-beta.\nFunctional myocardial tubes that have the potential for circulatory support can be created with cell sheet engineering.

Seven- to 8-week-old Dahl salt sensitive rats were fed normal diet (0.3% NaCl) or high-salt diet (8% NaCl) with or without high potassium (8% KCl) for 8 weeks. Left ventricular relaxation was evaluated by the deceleration time of early diastolic filling obtained from Doppler transmitral inflow, the slope of the pressure curve, and the time constant at the isovolumic relaxation phase. High-salt loading induced a significant elevation of blood pressure and impaired left ventricular relaxation, accompanied by augmentation of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity in the cardiac tissue, measured by the lucigenin chemiluminescence method. Blood pressure lowering by hydralazine could not ameliorate NADPH oxidase activity and resulted in no improvement of left ventricular relaxation. Interestingly, although the blood pressure remained high, potassium supplementation as well as treatment with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-N-oxyl, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, not only reduced the elevated NADPH oxidase activity but also improved the left ventricular relaxation.

{"title": "ACE and ACE2 activity in diabetic mice.", "abstract": "ACE-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2) may counterbalance the angiotensin (ANG) II-promoting effects of ACE in tissues where both enzymes are found. Alterations in renal ACE and ACE2 expression have been described in experimental models of diabetes, but ACE2 activity was not assessed in previous studies. We developed a microplate-based fluorometric method for the concurrent determination of ACE and ACE2 activity in tissue samples. Enzymatic activity (relative fluorescence unit [RFU] . microg protein(-1) . h(-1)) was examined in ACE and ACE2 knockout mice and in two rodent models of diabetes, the db/db and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. In kidney cortex, preparations consisting mainly of proximal tubules and cortical collecting tubules, ACE2 activity had a strong positive correlation with ACE2 protein expression (90-kDa band) in both knockout models and their respective wild-type littermates (r = 0.94, P < 0.01). ACE activity, likewise, had a strong positive correlation with renal cortex ACE protein expression (170-kDa band) (r = 0.838, P < 0.005). In renal cortex, ACE2 activity was increased in both models of diabetes (46.7 +/- 4.4 vs. 22.0 +/- 4.7 in db/db and db/m, respectively, P < 0.01, and 22.1 +/- 2.8 vs. 13.1 +/- 1.5 in STZ-induced diabetic versus untreated mice, respectively, P < 0.05). ACE2 mRNA levels in renal cortex from db/db and STZ-induced diabetic mice, by contrast, were not significantly different from their respective controls. In cardiac tissue, ACE2 activity was lower than in renal cortex, and there were no significant differences between diabetic and control mice (db/db 2.03 +/- 0.23 vs. db/m 1.85 +/- 0.10; STZ-induced diabetic 0.42 +/- 0.04 vs. untreated 0.52 +/- 0.07 mice). ACE2 activity in renal cortex correlated positively with ACE2 protein in db/db and db/m mice (r = 0.666, P < 0.005) as well as in STZ-induced diabetic and control mice (r = 0.621, P < 0.05) but not with ACE2 mRNA (r = -0.468 and r = -0.522, respectively). We conclude that in renal cortex from diabetic mice, ACE2 expression is increased at the posttranscriptional level.

Whether stem cell therapy can prevent this process and regenerate cardiac tissue is the issue of many research projects at present. Some studies investigate mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from bone marrow, which are known to have the potential to differentiate into various tissues. Under certain conditions the formation of cardiomyocytes was observed in vitro and in vivo, which, however, is a controversial issue. Nevertheless many investigators found an improvement of cardiac function after transplantation of MSC into damaged heart tissue. Since only few cells survive mid-term after transplantation, the impact of real cell replacement might be limited. Instead of or besides the replacement of lost cells by transdifferentiated MSC, the secretion of paracrine factors by MSC may be important for functional improvement. Thus, MSC show promising experimental results, and may be of therapeutic value for heart disease in the future.

We used the Ca(2+)-sensitive dye indo-1 AM to study Ca(2+) handling in isolated canine pulmonary vein and left atrial myocytes.

A detailed solution method, based on Fourier Series and a simple one-dimensional finite difference scheme, for the governing equations for electric potential in the tissue and the blood, is also presented. This method has the advantage that the potential can be calculated only at points where it is required, such as the measuring electrodes. The model is then used to study various electrode configurations which have been proposed to determine cardiac tissue conductivity parameters. Three electrode configurations are analysed in terms of electrode spacing, placement position and the effect of including fibre rotation: the usual surface four-electrode configuration; a single vertical analogue of this and a two probe configuration, which has the current electrodes on one probe and the measuring electrodes on the other, a fixed distance away. It is found that including fibre rotation has no effect on the potentials measured in the first two cases; however, in the two probe case, non-zero fibre rotation causes a significant drop in the voltage measured. This leads to the conclusion that it is necessary to include the effects of fibre rotation in any model which involves the use of multiple plunge electrodes.", "journal": "Mathematical biosciences", "date": "2006-06-27", "authors": ["Barbara MJohnston", "Peter RJohnston", "DavidKilpatrick"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mbs.2006.04.004"}

{"title": "Analysis of electrode configurations for measuring cardiac tissue conductivities and fibre rotation.", "abstract": ": This paper describes a multi-electrode grid, which could be used to determine cardiac tissue parameters by direct measurement. A two pass process is used, where potential measurements are made, during the plateau phase of the action potential, on a subset of these electrodes and these measurements are used to determine the bidomain conductivities. In the first pass, the potential measurements are made on a set of 'closely-spaced' electrodes and the parameters are fitted to the potential measurements in an iterative process using a bidomain model and a solver based on a modified Shor's r-algorithm. This first pass yields the extracellular conductivities. The second pass is similar except that a 'widely-spaced' electrode set is used and this time the intracellular conductivities are recovered. In addition, it is possible to determine the fibre rotation throughout the tissue, since the bidomain model used here is able to include the effects of fibre rotation. In the simulation studies presented here, the model is solved with known conductivities, on each of the two subsets of electrodes, to generate two sets of 'measured potentials.' Conductivities are then recovered by solving an inverse problem based on the measured potentials, to which various levels of noise are added. For example, simulations in the first pass are performed using an electrode spacing of 500 mum, for a situation where the longitudinal and transverse space constants are 769 and 308 mum, respectively. These give very accurate average percentage relative errors for the longitudinal and transverse extracellular conductivities, over five simulations with 1% noise added, of 0.3 and 0.2%. Twenty-five second pass simulations, on a 1 mm grid, yield average percentage relative errors of 3.8, 2.6 and 1.4% for the corresponding intracellular values and the fibre rotation angle, respectively.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2006-06-20", "authors": ["Barbara MJohnston", "Peter RJohnston", "DavidKilpatrick"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-006-9098-4"}

Reconstitution of the Frank-Starling mechanism is an important milestone for producing functional heart tissue constructs. Spontaneously contracting engineered heart tissues (EHTs) were reconstituted by growing dissociated chicken embryo cardiomyocytes in collagen matrices. Twitch and baseline tensions were recorded at precisely controlled levels of tissue strain. The EHTs showed a steep increase in twitch tension from 0.47 +/- 0.02 to 0.91 +/- 0.02 mN/mm2 as they were stretched at a constant rate (2.67% per min) from 86% to 100% of the length at which maximum twitch force was exerted. In response to a sudden stretch (3.3%), the twitch tension increased gradually (approximately 60 s) in a Gd3+-sensitive manner, suggesting the presence of stretch-activated Ca2+ channels. A large difference in baseline tension between lengthening (loading) and shortening (unloading) was also recorded. Disruption of nonsarcomeric actin filaments by cytochalasin D and latrunculin B decreased this difference. A simple mechanical model interprets these results in terms of mechanical connections between myocytes and nonmuscle cells.

{"title": "Exposure to anthracyclines during childhood causes cardiac injury.", "abstract": "The use of anthracyclines in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is limited by associated cardiotoxic effects, which can result in cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure, and may be irreversible. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in long-term survivors of childhood cancer is characterized by reduced left ventricular wall thickness and mass, which is indicative of decreased cardiac muscle and depressed left ventricular contractility which is indicative of unhealthy heart muscle. Risk factors for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity include high cumulative anthracycline doses, high anthracycline dose intensity, and radiotherapy. Radiotherapy in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines can exacerbate anthracycline-induced cardiac tissue damage. Several studies have shown that cardiomyopathy disease progression can be delayed in adults by using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as enalapril. Studies in long-term survivors of pediatric cancer showed that enalapril has significant benefits in preventing cardiac functional deterioration on a short-term basis, but this is not sustained. Anthracycline-associated cardiotoxic effects can be combatted by preventing cardiac injury during chemotherapy administration. There is evidence that dexrazoxane significantly reduces the cardiotoxicity associated with anthracyclines such as daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and epirubicin in adult patients with a wide range of tumor types. A study of the efficacy of dexrazoxane in reducing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in children and adolescents with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia, showed that significantly fewer dexrazoxane-treated patients (21%) had elevated serum cardiac troponin (a biomarker of acute myocardial injury) levels than patients treated with chemotherapy alone (50%; P <.001).

The mechanism and physiological function of this zinc metallopeptidase in mammals are not yet fully understood. Non-mammalian vertebrate models offer attractive and simple alternatives that could facilitate the exploration of ACE2 function. In this paper we report the in silico analysis of Ace2 genes from the Gallus (chicken), Xenopus (frog), Fugu and Tetraodon (pufferfish) genome assembly databases, and from the Danio (zebrafish) cDNA library. Exon ambiguities of Danio and Xenopus Ace2s were resolved by RT-PCR and 3'RACE. Analyses of the exon-intron structures, alignment, phylogeny and hydrophilicity plots, together with the conserved synteny among these vertebrates, support the orthologous relationship between mammalian and non-mammalian ACE2s. The putative promoters of Ace2 from human, Tetraodon and Xenopus tropicalis drove the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) specifically in the heart tissue of transgenic Xenopus thus making it a suitable model for future functional genomic studies.

Therapies employed for treating these diseases are aimed at promoting increased blood flow to cardiac tissue. Pharmacological induction of new coronary growth has recently been explored, however, clinical trials with known proangiogenic factors have been disappointing. To identify novel therapeutic targets, we have explored signaling pathways that govern embryonic coronary development. Using a combination of genetically engineered mice and an organ culture system, we identified novel roles for fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and Hedgehog (HH) signaling in coronary vascular development. We show that FGF signals promote coronary growth indirectly by signaling to the cardiomyoblast through redundant function of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2. Myocardial FGF signaling triggers a wave of HH activation that is essential for vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf)-A, Vegf-B, Vegf-C, and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) expression. We demonstrate that HH is necessary for coronary vascular development and activation of HH signaling is sufficient to promote coronary growth and to rescue coronary defects due to loss of FGF signaling. These studies implicate HH signaling as an essential regulator of coronary vascular development and as a potential therapeutic target for coronary neovascularization. Consistent with this, activation of HH signaling in the adult heart leads to an increase in coronary vessel density.", "journal": "Genes & development", "date": "2006-06-17", "authors": ["Kory JLavine", "Andrew CWhite", "ChangwonPark", "Craig SSmith", "KyungheeChoi", "FanxinLong", "Chi-chungHui", "David MOrnitz"], "doi": "10.1101/gad.1411406"}

Two days later, rat isolated perfused hearts were subjected to global, no-flow ischemia (20 min), and reperfusion (120 min).

Tissue levels of the endocannabinoid arachidonylethanolamide (anandamide) remained unchanged (19.8 +/- 3.9 pmol/g vs. 19.5 +/- 4.8 pmol/g). 2-AG (1 microM) or its metabolically stable derivative noladinether (0.1 microM), given 30 minutes before ischemia/reperfusion in unpreconditioned hearts, mimicked the cardioprotective effects of PC and reduced infarct size. We conclude that delayed PC through transdermal nitroglycerin application increases the production of the endocannabinoid 2-AG which elicits protective effects against myocardial infarction via CB1 cannabinoid receptors which represents one new mechanism of NO-mediated PC.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2006-06-16", "authors": ["Jens AWagner", "MarcoAbesser", "JudithHarvey-White", "GeorgErtl"], "doi": "10.1097/01.fjc.0000211752.08949.eb"}

The objectives of the present study were to confirm the findings from clinical trials using an animal model of MI in which dietary intake could be closely controlled and to utilize the model to investigate molecular mechanisms for the beneficial effects of (n-3) PUFAs. Male rats were subjected to coronary ligation to induce MI and were randomly assigned to diets high in (n-6) (58% of lipid) or (n-3) (28% of lipid) PUFAs for 6 mo. A diet high in (n-3) PUFAs was associated with an improvement in 6-mo survival (89.2% vs. 64.9%, P = 0.013) compared with rats consuming a diet high in (n-6) PUFAs (n = 37/group). In a separate study (n = 5 rats/diet group), the (n-3) PUFA diet decreased the (n-6):(n-3) PUFA ratio in plasma (0.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 7.9 +/- 1.8, P < 0.05) and cardiac tissue (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 11.8 +/- 1.6, P < 0.05) of rats fed for 4 wk.

{"title": "Developmental regulation of cardiac MAP4 protein expression.", "abstract": "It has been shown that the level of expression of microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4) mRNAs changes throughout neonatal heart development [Chapin SJ, et al. 1995. Biochemistry 34:2289]. In the present study, both immunofluorescence and western blotting methods were used to monitor MAP4 protein expression levels in the developing heart. By both methods, it was shown that the levels of total MAP4 protein were maximal during the first postnatal week, and then declined progressively to adulthood. In addition, four major electrophoretic species that reacted with MAP4-specific antibodies (called bands 1-4) were observed in all heart tissue samples. Three of the four bands decreased in abundance throughout postnatal development, but at different rates. The fourth band remained relatively constant in abundance with increasing postnatal age. To determine if phosphorylation events might contribute to this heterogeneity, western blotting experiments using phospho-specific antibodies and phosphatase digestion of extract samples were performed. No phosphorylation-specific antibody staining was observed and no significant changes were demonstrated in the bands after phosphatase treatment, implying that the observed complexity was due mainly to alternative start site or differential isoform expression. Finally, it was discovered that cardiomyocyte MAP4 associated with drug- and cold-stable microtubules in early neonatal myocytes. Thus, the complex regulation of MAP4 protein expression may play a key role in the functional differentiation of myocyte microtubules during heart development.", "journal": "Cell motility and the cytoskeleton", "date": "2006-06-13", "authors": ["Daniel RWebster", "Jason MBratcher"], "doi": "10.1002/cm.20140"}
{"title": "Role of T-type Ca2+ channels in the heart.", "abstract": "After the first demonstration 30 years ago that Ca2+ could permeate through two different channels, the occurrence and role of T-type Ca2+ current, ICaT have been the matter of hundreds of publications, including the two 1985' reports in various cardiac tissues and species. Except for its specific biophysical characteristics, ICaT is no longer so easily distinguished from the L-type Ca2+ current, ICaL, since it is also sensitive to multiple compounds and various neuromediators including the beta-adrenergic agonists. Changes in ICaT occur during development, so that while it is recorded in all embryonic and neonatal cells investigated, ICaT has been reported in adult ventricular cells of only few species in control. However, under various pathological conditions, ICaT is often recorded at some phases of remodelling at least in some localized area and one or more of the three channel proteins, Cav3.1-3.3 are clearly re-expressed under the influence of IGF-1, endothelin, and angiotensin II. ICaT contributes to the control of electrical activity including pacemaker and arrhythmia. Furthermore ICaT, and its low-depolarisation window current, participate in Ca2+ entry, so that ICaT has been involved in the release of Ca2+ from internal stores, the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism, although at much lower level than ICaL. ICaT contributes also to Ca2+-dependent hormonal secretion.

Three hours after ligation of left anterior descending artery, the transplanted group received an infusion of MSCs through the tail vein. At the same time, a coronary-ligated control group was injected with culture medium. Homing of MSCs to the heart was assessed by expression of the Y chromosome sry gene using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). At 1 week or 8 weeks after transplantation, sry positive cells were present in cardiac tissue in the transplanted group, but not in the hearts of control group. Cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells that bore sry gene were identified in transplanted group at 8 weeks after transplantation. Ultrastructural observation revealed that a large number of capillary and some immature myocytes were found to survive in the ischemia region. MSCs transplantation also decreased LVEDP pressure and -dP/dt, but increased LVSP and +dP/dt. The cardiac infarct size was significantly smaller in transplanted group than in control group.

The right atrial biopsy samples were taken before CPB, before ACC and at 15 min after ACC release from all patients. Human heart tissues were obtained from patients of TEA+GA group and GA group. The number of Bcl-2 positive cardiomyocytes was counted in multiple tissue sections of biopsies of 80 patients using light microscopy (magnification x 40) with an ocular micrometer system (Olympus).\nIn the TEA+GA group, the Bcl-2 positive cardiomyocytes were distinctly statistically increased compared to the GA group (P<0.001). In addition, the intensity of the immunostaining was also increased in the TEA+GA compared with the GA group. The number of immunoreactive cardiomyocytes is as follows: before CPB, TEA+GA group 396+/-61, GA group 92+/-41, before ACC, TEA+GA group 333+/-47, GA group 94+/-18, at 15 min after ACC release, TEA+GA group 346+/-68.8, GA group 85+/-9.5.

The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of berberine on diabetes in rats and its possible mechanisms. Diabetes was induced by tail vein injection with alloxan in Wistar rats. The amount of alloxan administered was 55 mg/kg. Diabetic rats were fed with a high-cholesterol diet. The fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), nitric oxide (NO) levels in serum and malondialdehyde (MDA),superoxide dismutase (SOD),glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) contents in heart tissue were assayed by spectrophotometry. Pancreas samples collected after 3 weeks of alloxan treatment were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and examined under a light microscope, and scored. Intragastric administration of berberine (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly decreased fasting blood glucose levels, serum content of TC, TG, LDL-c, and effectively increased HDL-c, NO level in diabetic rats. Furthermore, berberine treatment significantly blocked the increase of MDA, increased SOD and GSH-px levels in diabetic rats. Histopathological scores showed that berberine had restored the damage of pancreas tissues in rats with diabetes mellitus.

{"title": "Silencing of ZnT-1 expression enhances heavy metal influx and toxicity.", "abstract": "ZnT-1 reduces intracellular zinc accumulation and confers resistance against cadmium toxicity by a mechanism which is still unresolved. A functional link between the L-type calcium channels (LTCC) and ZnT-1 has been suggested, indicating that ZnT-1 may regulate ion permeation through this pathway. In the present study, immunohistochemical analysis revealed a striking overlap of the expression pattern of LTCC and ZnT-1 in cardiac tissue and brain. Using siRNA to silence ZnT-1 expression, we then assessed the role of ZnT-1 in regulating cation permeation through the L-type Ca(2+) channels in cells that are vulnerable to heavy metal permeation. Transfection of cortical neurons with ZnT-1 siRNA resulted in about 70% reduction of ZnT-1 expression and increased Ca(2+) influx via LTCC by approximately fourfold. Moreover, ZnT-1 siRNA transfected neurons showed approximately 30% increase in synaptic release, monitored using the FM1-43 dye. An increased cation influx rate, through the LTCC, was also recorded for Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) in cells treated with the ZnT-1 siRNA. Furthermore, Cd(2+)-induced neuronal death increased by approximately twofold after transfection with ZnT-1 siRNA. In addition, ZnT-1 siRNA transfection of the ovarian granulosa cell line, POGRS1, resulted in a twofold increase in Cd(2+) influx rate via the LTCC. Finally, a robust nimodipine-sensitive Cd(2+) influx was observed using a low extracellular Cd(2+) concentration (5 muM) in neurons and testicular slice cultures, attesting to the relevance of the LTCC pathway to heavy metal toxicity.

FN has also been reported to undergo alternative splicing to produce the extra domain-B (ED-B) containing isoform, which is exclusively expressed during embryogenesis, tissue repair, and tumoral angiogenesis. The present study was aimed at elucidating the role and mechanism of endothelins (ETs) in FN and ED-B FN expression in diabetes. We investigated vitreous samples for ED-B FN expression from patients undergoing vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Our results show increased FN and ED-B FN expression in the vitreous of diabetic patients in association with augmented ET-1. Using an antibody specific to the ED-B segment of FN, we show an increase in serum ED-B FN levels in patients with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. We further examined retinal tissues, as well as renal and cardiac tissues, from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes increased FN and ED-B FN in all three organs, which was prevented by ET antagonist bosentan. To provide insight into the mechanism of glucose-induced and ET-mediated ED-B FN upregulation, we assayed endothelial cells (ECs). Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase with pharmacological inhibitors and protein kinase B with dominant negative transfections prevented glucose- and ET-1-mediated FN and ED-B FN expression. Furthermore, treatment of cells exposed to high levels of glucose with ET antagonist prevented the activation of all signaling pathways studied and normalized glucose-induced ED-B FN expression. We then determined the functional significance of ED-B in ECs and show that ED-B FN is involved in vascular endothelial growth factor expression and cellular proliferation.

To analyze which proteins do interact with these second messenger molecules, we developed a chemical proteomics approach using cAMP and cGMP immobilized onto agarose beads, via flexible linkers in the 2- and 8-position of the nucleotide. Optimization of the affinity pull-down procedures in lysates of HEK293 cells revealed that a large variety of proteins could be pulled down specifically. Identification of these proteins by mass spectrometry showed that many of these proteins were indeed genuine cAMP or cGMP binding proteins. However, additionally many of the pulled-down proteins were more abundant AMP/ADP/ATP, GMP/GDP/GTP, or general DNA/RNA binding proteins. Therefore, a sequential elution protocol was developed, eluting proteins from the beads using solutions containing ADP, GDP, cGMP, and/or cAMP, respectively. Using this protocol, we were able to sequentially and selectively elute ADP, GDP, and DNA binding proteins. The fraction left on the beads was further enriched, for cAMP/cGMP binding proteins. Transferring this protocol to the analysis of the cGMP/cAMP \"interactome\" in rat heart ventricular tissue enabled the specific pull-down of known cAMP/cGMP binding proteins such as cAMP and cGMP dependent protein kinases PKA and PKG, several phosphodiesterases and 6 AKAPs, that interact with PKA.

In transgenic rats with extra copy of mouse renin gene a marked increase of prepro-TRH expression in the heart was noted but the relative difference between left atrium and left ventricle persisted. The swelling stimulated TRH release from both left auricle and left ventricle and this stimulation could not be inhibited by bumetanide. Angiotensin II (10 nmol L-1) added into medium significantly decreased basal secretion of TRH. The inhibiting effect of Angiotensin II was prevented by 1 micromol L-1 losartan, an angiotensin II AT1 receptor blocker. When angiotensin II and hypotonicity were applied simultaneously, swelling-induced secretion persisted.\nTRH secretion from heart slices has attributes of regulated secretion--depending on the stimulus it could be either stimulated or inhibited. Renin positively affects prepro-TRH expression in the heart. Angiotensin II inhibits TRH secretion from heart tissue by a mechanism involving AT1 receptors.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), and proadrenomedullin peptide (PAMP) were calculated by radioimmunoassay kit.\nAfter 11 weeks of shunt, compared with sham group, SPAP increased by 48.63% (P < 0.01 ) and RV/ (LV + SP) increased by 21.95% (P < 0.01). Plasma H2S decreased significantly (P < 0.01). The percentage of MA increased significantly (P < 0.01); RMT increased significantly (P < 0.01). The changes of ultra-structure of pulmonary arteries showed that endothelial cells became swollen and desquamation, internal elastic lamina became irregular, and smooth muscular cells increased in size, showing synthetic phenotype. After the rats with shunt was administered with NaHS for 11 weeks, plasma H2S increased significantly (P < 0.01). SPAP decreased by 19.82% and RV/(LV + SP) decreased by 7.31% (P < 0.01). The percentage of MA decreased significantly and RMT decreased significantly (P < 0.01). The changes of ultra-structure of the pulmonary arteries showed lighten significantly. Plasma ET-1, ANP, and CGRP decreased significantly (all P < 0.01), whereas PAMP increased significantly than that of shunt group (P < 0.01).\nThe reduced production of endogenous H2S is one of mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular structure remodeling in rats with high pulmonary blood flow. H2S plays an important regulatory effect on vasoactive peptide ET-1,+ ANP, CGRP and PAMP.", "journal": "Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

Therefore, this study investigated whether nebivolol may induce an eNOS activation in cardiac tissue. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed using specific antibodies against eNOS translocation and eNOS serine(1177) phosphorylation in rat isolated cardiomyocytes, human right atrial tissue (coronary bypass-operation), left ventricular non-failing (donor hearts) and failing myocardium after application of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers nebivolol, metoprolol and carvedilol, as well as after application of BRL 37344, a specific beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist. BRL 37344 (10 microM) significantly increased eNOS activity in all investigated tissues (either via translocation or phosphorylation or both). None of the beta-blockers (each 10 microM), including nebivolol, increased either translocation or phosphorylation in any of the investigated tissues. In human failing myocardium, nebivolol (10 microM) decreased eNOS activity. In conclusion, nebivolol shows a tissue-specific eNOS activation. Nebivolol does not activate the endothelial eNOS in end-stage human heart failure and may thus reduce inhibitory effects of NO on myocardial contractility and on oxidative stress formation.

The first and second groups were used as subacute and subchronic control groups. FA gas was generated from paraformaldehyde and pumped to a closed glass chamber. Rats were exposed to atmosphere containing 10 and 20 ppm FA (8 h/day, five days per week) during a four and 13 weeks period. After heart tissues were obtained and homogenized, thiobarbituric acid-reactant substances (TBARS) and nitric oxide (NO) levels, as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, were measured. There were statistically significant findings in SOD and CAT activities in the study groups compared to the control group. Heart tissue SOD level was increased in the group exposed to subacute 10 and 20 ppm FA inhalation compared to the control group (P < 0.011 and <0.0001). In addition, heart tissue SOD level was increased in the group exposed to subchronic 10 and 20 ppm FA inhalation compared to the corresponding control group (P < 0.001). On the other hand, there were statistically significant decreases in CAT activity in subacute 10 and 20 ppm groups compared to the corresponding control group (P < 0.012 and < 0.039, respectively). Although not significant, TBARS levels were increased in both subacute 10 ppm (P = 0.100) and subchronic 20 ppm (P = 0.053) groups compared to their corresponding control groups. Tissue NO levels were unchanged upon FA inhalation. In the correlation analyses, a meaningful relationship between SOD and CAT activities in subchronic 10 ppm group (r = -0.685, P < 0.029); SOD activity and TBARS level in subchronic 20 ppm group (r = -0.675, P < 0.032); and CAT activity and NO level in subchronic 20 ppm group (r = -0.810, P < 0.005) were found.\nFrom the findings of our study, it can be interpreted that subacute and subchronic FA inhalation may stimulate oxidative stress and thus, some secondary toxic effects in cardiac cells and tissue. This increase in the oxidative stress could not induce lipid peroxidation in the membranous structure of cardiac cells. An increased SOD enzyme activity was thought to be secondary to decreased CAT activity, as a compensation mechanism, preventing heart tissue from destruction induced by FA.", "journal": "Toxicology and industrial health", "date": "2006-05-24", "authors": ["MukaddesG\u00fcle\u00e7", "AhmetSongur", "SemsettinSahin", "Oguz AOzen", "MustafaSarsilmaz", "OmerAkyol"], "doi": "10.1191/0748233706th248oa"}

To clarify the role of chymase-dependent transforming growth factor-beta activation, we evaluated whether chymase inhibition prevents cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction in rats. Myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. One day after the ligation, rats were randomized into 2 groups: 1) a chymase-treated group that received 10 mg/kg per day of the chymase inhibitor NK3201 orally for 4 weeks; and 2) a vehicle group of non-treated rats with myocardial infarction. We also included a control group who underwent sham-operation and no treatment. Four weeks after ligation, echocardiography revealed that chymase inhibitor treatment reduced the akinetic area and increased fractional area change but did not significantly change left ventricular end-diastolic area. Chymase inhibition significantly reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, increased the maximal end-systolic pressure-volume relationship and decreased the time constant of left ventricular relaxation. Chymase activity in the non-infarcted myocardium was significantly increased in the vehicle group, but it was significantly reduced by chymase inhibitor treatment. The fibrotic area in the cardiac tissues and the mRNA levels of collagen I and collagen III were also significantly lower in the chymase inhibitor-treated group than in the vehicle group. Therefore, the pathway forming chymase-dependent transforming growth factor-beta may play an important role in myocardial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction rather than left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension", "date": "2006-05-24", "authors": ["HideoKanemitsu", "ShinjiTakai", "HiroshiTsuneyoshi", "TakeshiNishina", "KatsuhiroYoshikawa", "MizuoMiyazaki", "TadashiIkeda", "MasashiKomeda"], "doi": "10.1291/hypres.29.57"}

{"title": "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation produces heart-specific transcriptional and toxic responses in developing zebrafish.", "abstract": "Proper regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, is required for normal vertebrate cardiovascular development. AHR hyperactivation by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) during zebrafish (Danio rerio) development results in altered heart morphology and function, culminating in death. To identify genes that may cause cardiac toxicity, we analyzed the transcriptional response to TCDD in zebrafish hearts. Zebrafish larvae were exposed to TCDD for 1 h at 72 h after fertilization (hpf), and the hearts were extracted for microarray analysis at 1, 2, 4, and 12 h after exposure (73, 74, 76, and 84 h postfertilization). The remaining body tissue was also collected at each time for comparison. TCDD rapidly induced expression in 42 genes within 1 to2hof exposure. These genes function in xenobiotic metabolism, proliferation, heart contractility, and pathways that regulate heart development. Furthermore, these expression changes preceded signs of cardiovascular toxicity, characterized by decreased stroke volume, peripheral blood flow, and a halt in heart growth. This identifies strong candidates for important AHR target genes. It is noteworthy that the TCDD-induced transcriptional response in the hearts of zebrafish larvae was substantially different from that induced in the rest of the body tissues. One of the biggest differences included a cluster of genes that were down-regulated 12 h after exposure in heart tissue, but not in the body samples. More than 70% of the transcripts in this heart-specific cluster promote cellular growth and proliferation. Thus, the developing heart stands out as being responsive to TCDD at both the level of toxicity and gene expression.", "journal": "Molecular pharmacology", "date": "2006-05-23", "authors": ["Sara ACarney", "JingChen", "C GeoffreyBurns", "Kong MXiong", "Richard EPeterson", "WarrenHeideman"], "doi": "10.1124/mol.106.025304"}

An additional study was performed in order to assess the postprandial effect of these extracts on plasma antioxidant capacity. The ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were determined in plasma. For lipid peroxidation study of heart tissue, homogenates were prepared and TBARS were measured after lipid peroxidation induced by FeSO4-ascorbate.\nAfter 8 weeks of dietary treatment, total antioxidant capacity in plasma was significantly higher in the GE and PE groups as compared with the other two groups. Plasma TBARS concentrations and heart susceptibility to peroxidation were not significantly different between the groups. In the postprandial state, by comparing plasma antioxidant capacity 2 hours after ingestion of the different procyanidin-rich extracts (500 mg/kg body weight), we observed that FRAP values were higher in the procyanidin-rich extracts groups as compared with the control group.

The current study investigated whether steroid-induced inotropism in electrically paced (0.5 Hz, 14 degrees C) ventricle strips at 90% Lmax (1) has a metabolic requirement for exogenous glucose and (2) is associated with enhanced intracellular Ca2+ storage and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We also explored whether sex differences exist in extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o) or cardiac sensitivity to Ca2+o. In the absence or at low concentrations (1 or 2 mmol l-)) of exogenous glucose, resting tension and relaxation time were increased selectively in cardiac tissue from females. Increasing glucose promoted twitch force in a bell-shaped manner, with 5 mmol l-1 representing the optimal concentration for both sexes. The positive inotropic effects of physiological concentrations of testosterone (T) and 17beta-estradiol (E2) in male and female trout ventricle strips, respectively, developed slowly (10-45 min) and were not apparent in glucose-free medium, in medium containing iodoacetate (IAA), an inhibitor of glycolysis, or medium containing 5 mmol l-) lactate or pyruvate. Male ventricle strips had increased inotropic responses to glucose and T compared with female strips exposed to glucose and E2. Furthermore, sexually maturing males showed a greater inotropic response than immature males or females. Pretreatment with ryanodine (a specific blocker of SR Ca2+ release) also eliminated the inotropic effects of sex steroids and exogenous glucose and reduced the post-rest potentiation of contractile force (a marker of SR Ca2+ storage). By contrast, the inotropic effects of epinephrine (Epi) or elevated Ca2+o were faster (developing within 1-3 min) and were not diminished by the presence or absence of glucose or by pretreatment with IAA or ryanodine. Sex differences were also found in responsiveness to caffeine (males>females) and the relationship between Ca2+ concentration and force development above baseline. The Ca2+50 was lower in female cardiac tissue than males, suggesting greater Ca2+ sensitivity, and although plasma albumin was higher in females, total and ionized plasma Ca2+ did not differ between the sexes. For the first time, our study highlights the importance of extracellular glucose, glycolytic activity and SR Ca2+ storage and release for sex steroid-induced inotropism in the trout ventricle. Conversely, the inotropes Epi and elevated [Ca2+o] do not require the presence or metabolism of exogenous glucose or the SR for signaling their positive effects on contractility. These results also demonstrate novel sex-related differences in cardiac reliance on exogenous glucose, Ca2+ sensitivity and SR function and thus should be considered in future studies.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2006-05-20", "authors": ["Richard SFarrar", "Pavan KBattiprolu", "Nicholas SPierson", "Kenneth JRodnick"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.02241"}
{"title": "Nerve growth factor decreases potassium currents and alters repetitive firing in rat sympathetic neurons.", "abstract": "The sympathetic nervous system is an essential regulator of the cardiovascular system and interactions with target tissue regulate sympathetic neuronal properties. The heart produces nerve growth factor (NGF), which promotes sympathetic noradrenergic innervation of cardiac tissue and affects sympathetic synaptic strength. Neurotrophins, including NGF, are important modulators of synaptic plasticity and membrane electrical properties. Here we show that acute application of NGF causes a change in the repetitive firing pattern of cultured sympathetic neurons of the rat superior cervical ganglion. Neurons fire fewer action potentials in NGF, but with increased frequency, demonstrating an NGF-dependent change from a tonic to a phasic firing pattern. Additionally, NGF decreases the spike time variance, making spikes more tightly time locked to stimulus onset. NGF causes a decrease in the amplitude of both calcium-dependent and -independent potassium currents, and inhibition of calcium-dependent potassium currents using CdCl(2) reproduces some, but not all, of the firing properties induced by NGF. This study suggests that NGF release from cardiac tissue may act to modulate the repetitive firing properties of sympathetic neurons to tune their output to meet the physiological needs of the organism.", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "date": "2006-05-19", "authors": ["Jason ALuther", "Susan JBirren"], "doi": "10.1152/jn.01078.2005"}

Haemodynamic parameters viz. systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded throughout the experimental period. Hearts were subsequently excised and processed for histopathological and infarct size evaluation and for biochemical estimation of cardiac specific enzyme creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and myocardial malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker. Myocardial ischaemic reperfusion resulted in severe myocardial injury, depression of haemodynamic function, significant increase in malondialdehyde levels and decline in CK-MB isoenzyme activity in the heart tissue. Administration of bosentan (3 mg/kg, intravenously) slightly improved haemodynamic effects, decreased myocardial oxygen consumption, significantly (P<0.01) attenuated the rise in malondialdehyde levels and loss of myocardial CK-MB isoenzyme activity compared to the CON group, whereas bosentan administration significantly reduced the percentage area of fiber loss and infarct area.

The rationale derives from the disclosure that apoptosis and regeneration occur at the myocardial level and stem cells migrate from bone marrow to repopulate the damaged cardiac tissue. 2) Which are the most appropriate cells, delivery methods and therapeutic purposes? Adult stem cells can be mobilized or directly transplanted in human hearts to accomplish myocardioneogenesis, neoangiogenesis and/or paracrine effects. 3) Where should we transplant these cells? The infarct border zone seems to be the best place to home and differentiate transplanted cells hampering post-ischemic cardiac remodeling. 4) When should we perform cell therapy?

{"title": "AMPK alterations in cardiac physiology and pathology: enemy or ally?", "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has emerged as a key regulator of energy metabolism in the heart. The high energy demands of the heart are primarily met by the metabolism of both fatty acids and glucose, both processes being regulated by AMPK. During myocardial ischaemia a rapid activation of AMPK occurs, resulting in an activation of both glucose uptake and glycolysis, as well as an increase in fatty acid oxidation. This activation of AMPK has the potential to increase energy production and to inhibit apoptosis, thereby protecting the heart during the ischaemic stress. However, at clinically relevant high levels of fatty acids, ischaemic-induced activation of AMPK also stimulates fatty acid oxidation during and following ischaemia. This can contribute to ischaemic injury secondary to an inhibition of glucose oxidation, which results in a decrease in cardiac efficiency. In a number of other non-cardiac tissues, AMPK has been shown to have pro-apoptotic effects. As a result, the question of whether AMPK activation benefits or harms the ischaemic heart remains controversial. The role of AMPK in cardiac hypertrophy is also controversial. Activation of AMPK inhibits protein synthesis, and may be an adaptive response to pathological cardiac hypertrophy. However, none of mouse models of AMPK deficiency (excluding those that may involve the gamma2 subunit mutations) demonstrate increased cardiac mass, suggesting that AMPK is not essential for restriction of cardiac growth. In addition to the potential effects of AMPK on myofibrillar hypertrophy associated with pressure overload, there is also controversy with respect to the cardiac hypertrophy associated with the gamma2 subunit mutations. In the cardiac hypertrophy associated with glycogen overload, both activating and inactivating mutations of AMPK in mice are associated with a marked cardiac hypertrophy. This review will address the issue of whether AMPK activation acts as an enemy or ally to the ischaemic and hypertrophied heart. Resolving this issue has important implications as to whether therapeutic approaches to protect the ischaemic heart should be developed which either activate or inhibit AMPK.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2006-05-13", "authors": ["Jason R BDyck", "Gary DLopaschuk"], "doi": "10.1113/jphysiol.2006.109389"}

WTN significantly suppressed BMS-induced Akt phosphorylation, whereas 5-HD had no effect on Akt phosphorylation in cytosol, and the effect of BMS on apoptosis was abolished. It is concluded that the cardioprotective effect by mitoK(ATP) channels is attributed to the translocation of phosphorylated Akt from cytosol to mitochondria.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Molecular control of cardiac sodium homeostasis in health and disease.", "abstract": "Cardiac myocytes utilize three high-capacity Na transport processes whose precise function can determine myocyte fate and the triggering of arrhythmias in pathological settings. We present recent results on the regulation of all three transporters that may be important for an understanding of cardiac function during ischemia/reperfusion episodes.\nRefined ion selective electrode (ISE) techniques and giant patch methods were used to analyze the function of cardiac Na/K pumps, Na/Ca exchange (NCX1), and Na/H exchange (NHE1) in excised cardiac patches and intact myocytes. To consider results cohesively, simulations were developed that account for electroneutrality of the cytoplasm, ion homeostasis, water homeostasis (i.e., cell volume), and cytoplasmic pH. The Na/K pump determines the average life-time of Na ions (3-10 minutes) as well as K ions (>30 minutes) in the cytoplasm. The long time course of K homeostasis can determine the time course of myocyte volume changes after ion homeostasis is perturbed. In excised patches, cardiac Na/K pumps turn on slowly (-30 seconds) with millimolar ATP dependence, when activated for the first time. In steady state, however, pumps are fully active with <0.2 mM ATP and are nearly unaffected by high ADP (2 mM) and Pi (10 mM) concentrations as may occur in ischemia. NCX1s appear to operate with slippage that contributes to background Na influx and inward current in heart. Thus, myocyte Na levels may be regulated by the inactivation reactions of the exchanger which are both Na- and proton-dependent. NHE1 also undergo strong Na-dependent inactivation, whereby a brief rise of cytoplasmic Na can cause inactivation that persists for many minutes after cytoplasmic Na is removed. This mechanism is blocked by pertussis toxin, suggesting involvement of a Na-dependent G-protein. Given that maximal NCX1- and NHE1-mediated ion fluxes are much greater than maximal Na/K pump-mediated Na extrusion in myocytes, the Na-dependent inactivation mechanisms of NCX1 and NHE1 may be important determinants of cardiac Na homeostasis.\nNa/K pumps appear to be optimized to continue operation when energy reserves are compromised. Both NCX1 and NHE1 activities are regulated by accumulation of cytoplasmic Na. These principles may importantly control cardiac cytoplasmic Na and promote myocyte survival during ischemia/reperfusion episodes by preventing Ca overload.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology", "date": "2006-05-12", "authors": ["Donald WHilgemann", "AlpYaradanakul", "YongWang", "DanielFuster"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1540-8167.2006.00383.x"}
{"title": "N-acetylcysteine prevents nitrosative stress-associated depression of blood pressure and heart rate in streptozotocin diabetic rats.", "abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that cardiovascular abnormalities such as depressed blood pressure and heart rate occur in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats. Chronic diabetes, which is associated with increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and oxidative stress, may produce peroxynitrite/nitrotyrosine and cause nitrosative stress. We hypothesized that nitrosative stress causes cardiovascular depression in STZ diabetic rats and therefore can be corrected by reducing its formation. Control and STZ diabetic rats were treated orally for 9 weeks with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant and inhibitor of iNOS. At termination, the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate (HR) were measured in conscious rats. Nitrotyrosine and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and iNOS expression were assessed in the heart and mesenteric arteries by immunohistochemistry and Western blot experiments. Untreated diabetic rats showed depressed MABP and HR that was prevented by treatment with NAC. In untreated diabetic rats, levels of 15-F(2t)-isoprostane, an indicator of lipid peroxidation increased, whereas plasma nitric oxide and antioxidant concentrations decreased. Furthermore, decreased eNOS and increased iNOS expression were associated with elevated nitrosative stress in blood vessel and heart tissue of untreated diabetic rats. N-acetylcysteine treatment of diabetic rats not only restored the antioxidant capacity but also reduced the expression of iNOS and nitrotyrosine and normalized the expression of eNOS to that of control rats in heart and superior mesenteric arteries. The results suggest that nitrosative stress depress MABP and HR following diabetes.

Hypertensive and normotensive groups were assigned to an exercise training protocol on a level treadmill over a 10-wk period or were assigned to remain sedentary. After the exercise training protocol, blood pressure and cardiac tissue weight were assessed. The responsiveness of endothelium-denuded thoracic aortic rings to [Ru(CO)3Cl2]2 was evaluated by isometric contractions recordings.\nSystolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures were significantly increased in hypertensive rats compared with control rats. Exercise training did not significantly alter blood pressure but decreased pulse pressure in hypertensive animals compared with sedentary hypertensive rats. In all groups, application of [Ru(CO)3Cl2]2 induced relaxation in precontracted aortic rings. Compared with normotensive rats, CO-induced relaxation was significantly decreased in hypertensive rats. Nevertheless, training exercise increased relaxation markedly in response to [Ru(CO)3Cl2]2 application in hypertensive rats, whereas it remained without effect in control rings. Pretreatment with TEA, a nonselective K+ channel inhibitor, decreased [Ru(CO)3Cl2]2-induced relaxation in all groups that became similar. In trained hypertensive rats, iberiotoxin had effects similar to those of TEA.\nThis finding supports the concept that the CORM [Ru(CO)3Cl2]2 can induce relaxation in both normotensive and hypertensive rats with an impairment of the CO-induced relaxation during hypertension. However, exercise training improves the aorta's ability to relax in response to [Ru(CO)3Cl2]2 during hypertension, probably by increasing K+ channel activity.", "journal": "Medicine and science in sports and exercise", "date": "2006-05-09", "authors": ["JulienBoissiere", "Marie-ChristineLemaire", "DanielAntier", "DanielCourteix", "PierreBonnet"], "doi": "10.1249/01.mss.0000210205.17823.74"}

{"title": "Producing diffuse ultrasound reflections from medical instruments using a quadratic residue diffuser.", "abstract": "Simultaneous visualization of tissue and surgical instruments is necessary during ultrasound-guided medical procedures. Standard minimally invasive instruments are typically metallic and act as strong specular scatterers. As a result, such instruments saturate the image or disappear according to the angle of incidence, obscuring nearby tissue and making it difficult to determine the instrument's precise location. The objective of this study was to produce diffusive reflections from the surface of surgical instruments for improved visualization in ultrasound. A surface profile based on a 2D quadratic residue diffuser (QRD) was employed, which has been demonstrated to reduce specular reflection in other acoustic applications. The backscattered echo amplitude from the diffusive surface at various angles of insonation was measured and compared to that from unmodified metal surfaces and heart tissue surfaces. The QRD resulted in an 8 dB reduction of the specular signal. Furthermore, the dynamic range for angles up to 75 degrees was less than 20 dB for the QRD and more than 65 dB for a flat surface. The QRD surface produces two beneficial results for the simultaneous imaging of instruments and tissue. First, the conspicuity of diffusive surfaces in ultrasound images is markedly improved in comparison with unmodified metal surfaces. Secondly, the echo amplitude of diffusive metal surfaces differs in mean and standard deviation from that of tissue facilitating image enhancement and segmentation.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2006-05-09", "authors": ["JinlanHuang", "Pierre EDupont", "AdityaUndurti", "John KTriedman", "Robin OCleveland"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2006.03.001"}

Aim of the study was to investigate specific stages of the biochemical and molecular cascade which takes place in cytoprotective mechanisms of ischemic and reperfused cardiac cell.\nWe examined human left ventricle samples obtained from 20 patients undergoing elective valve surgery before aortic cross-clamping, 20+/-2 min (prolonged ischemia), 58+/-5 min after cross-clamping (intermittent ischemia) and 21+/-4 min after reconstitution of coronary blood flow (reperfusion). Cyt.OX activity was determined by spectrophotometric method and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content using bioluminescent assay. Malondialdehyde (MDA) assumed as reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation marker was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography method. On the same cardiac samples mitochondrial encoded Cyt.OX subunit 2 expression was examined by immunoblot analysis and blu native gel electrophoresis method. Statistical study of obtained data was performed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).\nProlonged as well intermittent ischemia caused reduction of Cyt.OX activity and ATP, a moderate accumulation of ROS and down-regulation of Cyt.OX subunit 2. When reperfused the cardiomyocytes showed a progressive increase of Cyt.OX activity, ATP pools and Cyt.OX subunit 2 expression. ROS generation was significantly increased by the rapid oxygen re-immission in the cardiac cell.\nThese data confirm the suggestion that prolonged as well as intermittent ischemia induces activation of cytoprotective mechanisms crucial for cardiac cell survival. Indeed, co-ordinated down-regulation of Cyt.OX activities, ATP pools and mitochondrial encoded Cyt.OX subunit 2 are in favour of an ischemia-activated adaptive mechanism leading to transient and reversible oxidative injury.

During the initial days of incubation, embryonic cardiac explants will thrive as beating three-dimensional tissue aggregates. However, within the first week of culture, cardiac aggregates lose their contractile function and flatten. After 2 weeks of incubation, the cardiac cells will have spread out into a homogeneous monolayer and dedifferentiated to a noncardiac phenotype. In contrast, when the embryonic heart tissue was co-cultured with a noncardiac cell layer obtained from adult bone marrow, the cardiac aggregates maintained their contractile function, three-dimensional tissue morphology, and myocyte phenotype for a full month of incubation. The capacity of this noncardiac cell layer to sustain the phenotype and morphology of the cardiac explants was partially replicated by treatment of the heart tissue with conditioned media from bone marrow cells.

We model the effects of coloading with a dye that absorbs excitation or fluorescence light on the radius and depth of the interrogated region with specific illumination and collection techniques. Results indicate radii and depths of interrogation are larger for transillumination versus epi-illumination, an effect that is more pronounced for broad-field excitation versus laser scanner. Coloading with a fluorescence absorber lessens interrogated depth for epi-illumination and increases it for transillumination, which is confirmed with measurements using transillumination of heart tissue slices. Coloading with an absorber of excitation light consistently decreases the interrogated depths. Transillumination and coloading also decrease the intensities of collected fluorescence.

Because allopurinol, itself, may be generating superoxide radicals, we currently studied the reaction of allopurinol with xanthine oxidase and confirmed that allopurinol does produce superoxide radicals during its conversion to oxypurinol. At pH 6.8 and 25 degrees C in the presence of 0.02 U/ml of XO, 10 and 20 microM allopurinol both produced 10 microM oxypurinol and 2.8 microM superoxide radical (determined by cytochrome C reduction). The 10 microM allopurinol was completely converted to oxypurinol, while the 20 microM allopurinol required a second addition of xanthine oxidase to complete the conversion. Fourteen percent of the reducing equivalents donated from allopurinol or xanthine reacted with oxygen to form superoxide radicals. Superoxide dismutase prevented the reduction of cytochrome C by these substrates. At higher xanthine oxidase concentrations, or at lower temperatures, more of the 20 microM allopurinol was converted to oxypurinol during the initial reaction. At lower xanthine oxidase concentrations, or higher temperatures, less conversion occurred. At pH 7.8, the amount of superoxide radicals produced from allopurinol and xanthine was nearly doubled.

Fibroblasts, obligatory components of the extracellular matrix, represent the majority of cells in the normal heart, and their number increases with aging and during disease. The myocyte network, coupled by gap junctions, is generally believed to be electrically isolated from fibroblasts in vivo. In culture, however, the heterogeneous cell types form functional gap junctions, which can provide a substrate for electrical coupling of distant myocytes, interconnected by fibroblasts only. Whether similar behavior occurs in vivo has been the subject of considerable debate. Recent electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and dye-coupling data confirmed the presence of direct electrical coupling between the two cell types in normal cardiac tissue (sinoatrial node), and it has been suggested that similar interactions may occur in post-infarct scar tissue. Such heterogeneous cell coupling could have major implications on in vivo electrical impulse conduction and the transport of small molecules or ions in both the normal and pathological myocardium.

{"title": "Rapid pacing of embryoid bodies impairs mitochondrial ATP synthesis by a calcium-dependent mechanism--a model of in vitro differentiated cardiomyocytes to study molecular effects of tachycardia.", "abstract": "Tachycardia may cause substantial molecular and ultrastructural alterations in cardiac tissue. The underlying pathophysiology has not been fully explored. The purpose of this study was (I) to validate a three-dimensional in vitro pacing model, (II) to examine the effect of rapid pacing on mitochondrial function in intact cells, and (III) to evaluate the involvement of L-type-channel-mediated calcium influx in alterations of mitochondria in cardiomyocytes during rapid pacing. In vitro differentiated cardiomyocytes from P19 cells that formed embryoid bodies were paced for 24 h with 0.6 and 2.0 Hz. Pacing at 2.0 Hz increased mRNA expression and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and caused cellular hypertrophy, indicated by increased protein/DNA ratio, and oxidative stress measured as loss of cellular thiols. Rapid pacing additionally provoked structural alterations of mitochondria. All these changes are known to occur in vivo during atrial fibrillation. The structural alterations of mitochondria were accompanied by limitation of ATP production as evidenced by decreased endogenous respiration in combination with decreased ATP levels in intact cells. Inhibition of calcium inward current with verapamil protected against hypertrophic response and oxidative stress. Verapamil ameliorated morphological changes and dysfunction of mitochondria. In conclusion, rapid pacing-dependent changes in calcium inward current via L-type channels mediate both oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The in vitro pacing model presented here reflects changes occurring during tachycardia and, thus, allows functional analyses of the signaling pathways involved.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2006-04-29", "authors": ["LorenzSchild", "AlicjaBukowska", "AndreasGardemann", "PamelaPolczyk", "GerburgKeilhoff", "MichaelT\u00e4ger", "Samuel CDudley", "Helmut UKlein", "AndreasGoette", "UweLendeckel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbadis.2006.03.005"}

In most cases the heart tissue suffers from an ischemic injury that causes a decrease in the velocity of electrical excitation propagation in it and influences the shape of the excitation wave front that spreads over the injured area. It is reflected in a more complex shape of the registered epicardial electrogram as compared to normal. A method for quantitative evaluation of the complexity of the shape of the epicardial electrogram based on the principal component analysis is here proposed for evaluation of the ischemic injury of the cardiac tissue. A minimal, yet sufficient, number of the principal components (the optimal basis functions) for truncated expansion of the epicardial electrogram signals could be used as an estimate of signal complexity. The method for determination of such a minimal, yet sufficient, number of principal components were developed by using epicardial electrograms registered during in situ experiments on dogs in which local ischemia was evoked by ligation of a coronary vessel.", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "date": "2006-04-29", "authors": ["AlgimantasKrisciukaitis", "MindaugasTamosiunas", "PovilasJakuska", "RomualdasVeteikis", "RaimundasLekas", "ViktorasSaferis", "RimantasBenetis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2006.03.002"}

We now studied the short-term cardio-protective effect of CAPE in an I/R rat heart model.\nWistar rats were divided into four groups: (i) sham-operated, (ii) I/R, (iii) I/R+CAPE, and (iv) I/R+glutathione. CAPE (10 micromol/kg) was infused i.v. 10 min before occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (8 min) followed by reperfusion (8 min).\nSOD (p < 0.010) and CAT (p < 0.014) activities were increased and GSH-Px (p < 0.019) activity decreased in the I/R group in cardiac tissues compared with the sham-operated group. There were no effects of CAPE on antioxidant enzyme activities after I/R. Glutathione administration led to decreased SOD activity (p < 0.024) and increased GSH-Px (p < 0.014) activity after I/R. The most prominent effects of CAPE were seen in XO and ADA activities, which were increased after I/R compared with the sham-operated group (p < 0.029 and p < 0.001, respectively). When CAPE was administered, XO and ADA activities were decreased compared with the I/R group (p < 0.045 and p < 0.001). ADA activity was also decreased in the I/R+glutathione group compared with the I/R group. No differences in basal heart rate or systolic or diastolic pressure were noted among the experimental groups.\nThis study demonstrates that CAPE exerts cardio-protective effects in short-term I/R of rat heart.

Growth measurements and whole heart tissue were obtained at 55 days gestational age (dGA), 90 dGA, and 135 dGA (term = 145 dGA) in fetuses from control (C) and hyperthermic (HT) pregnant sheep. Additionally, in 135 dGA animals, arterial blood was obtained and Doppler ultrasound was used to determine umbilical artery systolic (S) and diastolic (D) flow velocity waveform profiles to calculate pulsatility (S - D/mean) and resistance (S - D/S) indices. Myocardial Glut-1, Glut-4, insulin signal transduction proteins involved in Glut-4 translocation, and glycogen content were measured. Compared to age-matched controls, HT 90-dGA fetal body weights and HT 135-dGA fetal weights and gross heart weights were lower. Heart weights as a percent of body weights were similar between C and HT sheep at 135 dGA. HT 135-dGA animals had (i) lower fetal arterial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, (ii) lower arterial blood oxygen content and higher plasma lactate concentrations, (iii) higher myocardial Glut-4 plasma membrane (PM) protein and insulin receptor beta protein (IRbeta ) concentrations, (iv) higher myocardial glycogen content, and (v) higher umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility and resistance indices. The HT ovine fetal myocardium adapts to reduced circulating glucose and insulin concentrations by increasing plasma membrane Glut-4 and IRbeta protein concentrations.

The rats were divided into eight groups: Control, isoproterenol, ferulic acid alone, ascorbic acid alone, ferulic acid+ascorbic acid, ferulic acid+isoproterenol, ascorbic acid+isoproterenol and ferulic acid+ascorbic acid+isoproterenol. Ferulic acid (20 mg/kg b.w.t.) and ascorbic acid (80 mg/kg b.w.t.) both alone and in combination was administered orally for 6 days and on the fifth and the sixth day, isoproterenol (150 mg/kg b.w.t.) was injected intraperitoneally to induce myocardial injury to rats. Induction of rats with isoproterenol resulted in a significant increase in the levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, free fatty acids, free and ester cholesterol in both serum and cardiac tissue. A rise in the levels of phospholipids, lipid peroxides, low density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol was also observed in the serum of isoproterenol-intoxicated rats. Further, a decrease in the level of high density lipoprotein in serum and in the phospholipid levels, in the heart of isoproterenol-intoxicated rats was observed, which was paralleled by abnormal activities of lipid metabolizing enzymes: total lipase, cholesterol ester synthase, lipoprotein lipase and lecithin: cholesterol acyl transferase. Pre-cotreatment with the combination of ferulic acid and ascorbic acid significantly attenuated these alterations and restored the levels to near normal when compared to individual treatment groups.

It is characterized by significant epi-, endo- and myocarditis, as well as myositis, particularly involving red skeletal muscle. The aetiology of HSMI is currently unresolved, though a viral cause is suspected. Since its discovery in 1999, HSMI has become an increasing problem for the Norwegian farming industry, with some farms experiencing yearly outbreaks and subsequent economic losses. In the present study an Atlantic salmon farm was studied from December 2003 to April 2005. Samples from apparently healthy as well as clinically diseased fish were collected monthly and examined histopathologically. The first fish to be diagnosed with HSMI was sampled in May, 8 months after transfer to sea. A clinical outbreak of HSMI followed in June, when all fish in the sample had lesions consistent with HSMI. Subsequent samples revealed that cardiac lesions decreased in severity 2 months after the start of the outbreak, but that multiple foci of cellular infiltration and necrosis persisted throughout the year. There appeared to be a shift in lesion location from being most severe in the compact myocardium in early stages of disease to a greater involvement of the atrium and spongy layer of the ventricle in later samples. Late samples also showed increased fibrosis of cardiac tissue. In conclusion, HSMI appears to be a severe disease with elevated mortality, morbidity close to 100% and prolonged duration.", "journal": "Journal of fish diseases", "date": "2006-04-26", "authors": ["R TKongtorp", "MHalse", "TTaksdal", "KFalk"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2761.2006.00710.x"}
{"title": "[Effects of aldosterone receptor blocker therapy on cardiac remodeling].", "abstract": "Cardiac remodeling is a physiologic or pathologic condition that occurs after myocardial infarction, pressure overload, myocardial inflammatory diseases, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy or volume overload. In spite of different etiologies, molecular, biochemical and mechanical processes are the same. The change in left ventricular function brings about a complex neuro-hormonal disorder, and disease progression is due to the combined action of several biological factors with toxic effects on the heart and vessels. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is very important in this process, through the effects on hydro-saline balance or through direct processes on myocardium. A direct effect of aldosterone in myocardial fibrosis after the detection of heart tissue aldosterone production has been demonstrated. In the past, the attention of physicians and researchers was focused on angiotensin II inhibition; and therefore, on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, considering them sufficient to antagonize the effects of aldosterone. Nevertheless, this theory has been confuted in recent studies, with the evidence of elevated plasmatic aldosterone levels in patients treated with ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. This phenomenon probably is due to the activation of secondary ACTH mediated pathways of trial aldosterone production. It has been demonstrated that aldosterone receptor inhibition is effective in reducing cardiac remodeling and mortality. AREA-IN CHF is the first multicentric, double blind, randomized, placebo control study to compare canrenone, an aldosterone receptor blocker, with placebo. The primary end point is the echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular remodeling. Secondary end points are left ventricular end-systolic volume, ejection fraction, diastolic filling patterns, NYHA functional class, and mortality and hospitalizations of cardiac origin. In addition, bio-humoral effects of aldosterone receptor blocker therapy will be investigated.

{"title": "Can optical recordings of membrane potential be used to screen for drug-induced action potential prolongation in single cardiac myocytes?", "abstract": "Potential-sensitive dyes have primarily been used to optically record action potentials (APs) in whole heart tissue. Using these dyes to record drug-induced changes in AP morphology of isolated cardiac myocytes could provide an opportunity to develop medium throughout assays for the pharmaceutical industry. Ideally, this requires that the dye has a consistent and rapid response to membrane potential, is insensitive to movement, and does not itself affect AP morphology.\nWe recorded the AP from isolated adult guinea-pig ventricular myocytes optically using di-8-ANEPPS in a single-excitation dual-emission ratiometric system, either separately in electrically field stimulated myocytes, or simultaneously with an electrical AP recorded with a patch electrode in the whole-cell bridge mode. The ratio of di-8-ANEPPS fluorescence signal was calibrated against membrane potential using a switch-clamp to voltage clamp the myocyte.\nOur data show that the ratio of the optical signals emitted at 560/620 nm is linearly related to voltage over the voltage range of an AP, producing a change in ratio of 7.5% per 100 mV, is unaffected by cell movement and is identical to the AP recorded simultaneously with a patch electrode. However, the APD90 recorded optically in myocytes loaded with di-8-ANEPPS was significantly longer than in unloaded myocytes recorded with a patch electrode (355.6+/-13.5 vs. 296.2+/-16.2 ms; p<0.01). Despite this effect, the apparent IC50 for cisapride, which prolongs the AP by blocking IKr, was not significantly different whether determined optically or with a patch electrode (91+/-46 vs. 81+/-20 nM).\nThese data show that the optical AP recorded ratiometrically using di-8-ANEPPS from a single ventricular myocyte accurately follows the action potential morphology. This technique can be used to estimate the AP prolonging effects of a compound, although di-8-ANEPPS itself prolongs APD90. Optical dyes require less technical skills and are less invasive than conventional electrophysiological techniques and, when coupled to ventricular myocytes, decreases animal usage and facilitates higher throughput assays.", "journal": "Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods", "date": "2006-04-25", "authors": ["M E LHardy", "C LLawrence", "N BStanden", "G CRodrigo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vascn.2006.02.013"}

Comparing mtDNA copy levels in different tissues revealed that cardiac muscle had the highest, while the cortex cerebelli showed the lowest copy number of mtDNA in every donor. Intriguingly, mtDNA copy number showed no changes during aging. In heart tissue, the amount of 4977 bp mtDNA deletion increased in an age-dependent manner showing significant differences at the age of 40 years and older (p<0.005). In vitro studies analyzing human normal cells transfected with telomerase (BJ-T) revealed that oxidative stress (OS)--a well accepted promoter of aging--induced 4977 bp deletion and point mutations as demonstrated by real-time PCR and DHPLC analysis. Interestingly, OS induced apoptosis only in transformed human fibroblasts by activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial-mediated) signalling pathway as indicated by morphological damage of mitochondria, DNA laddering and increase of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In conclusion, in heart tissue, the amount of the 4977 bp deletion increased in an age-dependent manner and it was more detectable after the 4th decade of life, although there was some scatter in the data.

We then generated engineered fetal cardiac tissue (EFCT) from HH stage 40 (day 14) fetal ventricular cells for direct comparison with EEECT. Tissue architecture was similar in EEECT and EFCT. EEECT maintained high cell proliferation patterns by culture day 12, whereas EFCT decreased cell proliferation rate by culture day 9 (P < 0.05). EEECT increased active contractile force from culture day 7 to day 12. The culture day 12 EEECT contractile response to the beta-adrenergic stimulation was less than culture day 9 EFCT (P < 0.05). Cyclic mechanical stretch stimulation induced myocardial hyperplasia in EEECT. Results indicate that EEECT retains the proliferative and contractile properties of developing embryonic myocardium and shows potential as a robust in vitro model of developing embryonic myocardium.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "TNF receptor deficiency reveals a translational control mechanism for adriamycin-induced Fas expression in cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "Adriamycin, ADR, a potent chemotherapeutic agent, has been demonstrated to cause cardiomyocyte apoptosis, in part, via the Fas/Fas ligand-mediated cell death pathway. Our previous studies suggested that TNF-alpha receptors may mediate cardioprotection against ADR toxicity by the suppression of the Fas-mediated pathway. However, the role of TNF-alpha receptors in this process is unclear. In the present study, we extended our initial observation to determine the molecular mechanisms by which ADR induced Fas expression in the presence and absence of TNF receptors. Our results demonstrated that ADR-mediated p53 and AP-1 interaction and increased Fas mRNA levels independent of TNF receptors. However, the levels of Fas proteins only increased in the cardiac tissues of TNF receptor-deficient mice. These results demonstrated that the suppression of ADR-induced Fas expression by TNF receptors was not regulated at transcriptional levels, but may be regulated at a translational level.", "journal": "Cytokine", "date": "2006-04-18", "authors": ["Yu-ChinLien", "ChotirosDaosukho", "Daret KSt Clair"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cyto.2006.02.001"}
{"title": "Beneficial role of aminoguanidine on acute cardiomyopathy related to doxorubicin-treatment.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is a broad-spectrum anthracycline antibiotic that has cardiotoxicity as a major side effect. One mechanism of this toxicity is believed to involve the reactive oxygen radical species (ROS); these agents likely account for the pathophysiology of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. Aminoguanidine (AG) is an effective antioxidant and free radical scavenger which has long been known to protect against ROS formation. We investigated the effects of AG on DOX-induced changes in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. The rats were divided into four groups:1) Control; 2) DOX group; injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with DOX 20 mg/kg in a single dose 3) AG-treated group; injected i.p. in single dose of 20 mg/kg DOX plus 100 mg/kg AG 1 h before the DOX for 3 days, 4) AG group; injected i.p. with AG 100 mg/kg for 3 days. DOX administration to control rats increased TBARS and decreased GSH levels. AG administration before DOX injection caused significant decrease in TBARS and increase in GSH levels in the heart tissue when compared with DOX only. Morphological changes, including severe myocardial fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration were clearly observed in the DOX-treated heart. AG reversed the DOX-induced heart damage. Therefore AG could protect the heart tissue against free radical injury. The application of AG during cancer chemotherapy may attenuate tissue damage and improve the therapeutic index of DOX.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biochemistry", "date": "2006-04-14", "authors": ["YilmazCigremis", "HakanParlakpinar", "AlaadinPolat", "CemilColak", "FeralOzturk", "EnginSahna", "NecipErmis", "AhmetAcet"], "doi": "10.1007/s11010-005-9072-8"}
{"title": "Aldosterone receptor antagonists and cardiovascular disease: do we need a change of the guard?", "abstract": "Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid primarily produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland. For many years, aldosterone (Aldo) was thought to have its sole site of action in the kidney, where it regulated sodium excretion and potassium reabsorption. It is now known that Aldo is produced in cardiovascular tissues, and has been implicated in the development of ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. The precise mechanisms whereby Aldo acts in cardiac tissues are diverse. It was assumed that Aldo production could be limited by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, but serial measurements during therapy reveal only a transient decrease in Aldo levels. Moreover, the effects of Aldo on cardiac tissues occur even when angiotensin II (Ang II) has been suppressed or eliminated. Multiple investigators have examined effects of Aldo receptor blockade in human subjects and various animal models using the two Aldo receptor antagonists (ARAs), spironolactone and eplerenone. Major clinical trials involving spironolactone (RALES) and eplerenone (EPHESUS) ARAs have shown significant benefits in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF). In RALES, patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV systolic heart failure treated with spironolactone had a 30% relative risk decrease in mortality. Although spironolactone is an effective competitive inhibitor of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), progestational and antiandrogenic side effects limit its use in some patients. Eplerenone, a more selective ARA, lacks these undesirable side effects. Although eplerenone is 20-fold less potent at the MR, it demonstrates efficacy similar to spironolactone, possibly due to decreased protein binding. Eplerenone has fewer side effects than spironolactone, which has been attributed to the low cross-reactivity with androgen and progesterone receptors. In EPHESUS, patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction [Ejection Fraction (EF) <40%] and CHF following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), were treated with eplerenone, resulting in a 17% reduction in cardiovascular mortality. However, these studies were limited in that diastolic function was not evaluated, although approximately 1/2 of CHF is due to diastolic dysfunction alone. To date, neither ARA has been studied for the treatment of diastolic dysfunction in a major clinical trial. However, numerous animal studies employing ARAs have shown a decrease in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, indicating the potential benefits of these agents in the treatment of diastolic heart failure.

{"title": "Endogenous driving and synchronization in cardiac and uterine virtual tissues: bifurcations and local coupling.", "abstract": "Cardiac and uterine muscle cells and tissue can be either autorhythmic or excitable. These behaviours exchange stability at bifurcations produced by changes in parameters, which if spatially localized can produce an ectopic pacemaking focus. The effects of these parameters on cell dynamics have been identified and quantified using continuation algorithms and by numerical solutions of virtual cells. The ability of a compact pacemaker to drive the surrounding excitable tissues depends on both the size of the pacemaker and the strength of electrotonic coupling between cells within, between, and outside the pacemaking region. We investigate an ectopic pacemaker surrounded by normal excitable tissue. Cell-cell coupling is simulated by the diffusion coefficient for voltage. For uniformly coupled tissues, the behaviour of the hybrid tissue can take one of the three forms: (i) the surrounding tissue electrotonically suppresses the pacemaker; (ii) depressed rate oscillatory activity in the pacemaker but no propagation; and (iii) pacemaker driving propagations into the excitable region. However, real tissues are heterogeneous with spatial changes in cell-cell coupling. In the gravid uterus during early pregnancy, cells are weakly coupled, with the cell-cell coupling increasing during late pregnancy, allowing synchronous contractions during labour. These effects are investigated for a caricature uterine tissue by allowing both excitability and diffusion coefficient to vary stochastically with space, and for cardiac tissues by spatial gradients in the diffusion coefficient.", "journal": "Philosophical transactions.

In certain pathological conditions such as ischaemia, current sinks can develop in the diseased cardiac tissue. In this study, we investigate the effects of changing the amount of heterogeneity and intercellular coupling on wavefront stability in a cardiac cell culture system and a mathematical model of excitable media. In both systems, we observe three types of behaviour: plane wave propagation without breakup, plane wave breakup into spiral waves and plane wave block. In the theoretical model, we observe a linear decrease in propagation velocity as the number of heterogeneities is increased, followed by a rapid, nonlinear decrease to zero. The linear decrease results from the heterogeneities acting independently on the wavefront. A general scaling argument that considers the degree of system heterogeneity and the properties of the excitable medium is used to derive a dimensionless parameter that describes the interaction of the wavefront with the heterogeneities.", "journal": "Philosophical transactions.

Spatially uniform control of alternans was possible when alternans amplitude was small. However, control became attenuated spatially as alternans amplitude increased.

It has been suggested that menopause is a risk factor for the induction of several cardiovascular disorders. In the present study we analyzed the effects of ovarian hormone depletion by ovariectomy (OVX) in a model of oxidative stress and cardiopathy induced by adriamycin (AD). To evaluate these effects, we measured parameters related to cardiac damage (creatinine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione, nitric oxide and carbonyl proteins) in cardiac tissue and erythrocytes. OVX was found to alter all markers of oxidative stress and cell damage in cardiac tissue. Similarly, the OVX-derived loss of ovarian hormones enhanced cardiac damage and oxidative stress induced by AD. Our results suggest that antioxidant status in cardiac tissue and erythrocytes is seriously compromised by OVX during the cardiomyopathy induced by AD in experimental animals. In conclusion, the absence of hormones caused by OVX or menopause may induce or accelerate pre-existing cardiovascular dysfunctions.", "journal": "Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology", "date": "2006-04-11", "authors": ["Juan RafaelMu\u00f1oz-Casta\u00f1eda", "JordiMuntan\u00e9", "CarmenHerencia", "Maria CMu\u00f1oz", "InmaculadaBujalance", "PedroMontilla", "IssacT\u00fanez"], "doi": "10.1080/09513590500490249"}

These models may not accurately reflect the mechanisms responsible for human angiogenesis.\nWe hypothesized that fragments of human myocardial tissue would develop an angiogenic response from the cut edges of vessels contained within the tissue. To test these hypotheses, we obtained human atrial appendage tissue at the time of cardiac bypass. Fragments of atrial tissue were then incorporated into fibrin thrombin clots. Tissue fragments were observed, and the percent of wells that developed neovessel invasion into the clot was calculated (%I). The subsequent growth of cardiac-derived microvessels was rated and scored over time (Angiogenic Index).\nThere were 20 human atrial appendages plated (n = 24 to 60 wells/specimen) and evaluated in this model. Out of the 20, 16 (80%) atrial appendages developed an angiogenic response in the majority (>50%) of wells plated.

The mean angiogenic index of all specimens was 8.59 +/- 0.91.\nThis human cardiac tissue-based assay might be useful to screen compounds designed for use in human trials or provide highly vascularized cardiac tissue for autotransplantation.

{"title": "Blockade of histamine H2 receptors protects the heart against ischemia and reperfusion injury in dogs.", "abstract": "We have previously reported that histamine H(2) blockers may be cardioprotective in patients with chronic heart failure. Since both endogenous histamine and histamine H(2) receptors are present in heart tissue, we tested the hypothesis that the blockade of histamine H(2) receptors mediates protection against reversible or irreversible ischemia and reperfusion injury. In open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 90 minutes, followed by reperfusion for 6 hours. Administration of famotidine and cimetidine from 10 minutes before occlusion until after 1 hour of reperfusion reduced infarct size (17.0 +/- 4.1% and 17.8 +/- 2.9% vs. 36.9 +/- 5.9% of the solvent group, respectively) Famotidine administration only during the reperfusion period for 1 hour also attenuated infarct size (22.5 +/- 3.5%). There were no differences in either area at risk or collateral flow among the groups. In another set of experiments, we decreased coronary perfusion pressure in dogs so that the coronary blood flow decreased to 50% of the non-ischemic level. In such conditions, we observed the increases in histamine release compared with non-ischemic conditions (0.04 +/- 0.03 to 0.28 +/- 0.13 ng/ml, p < 0.05). Famotidine improved anaerobic myocardial metabolism gauged by both lactate extraction ratio and myocardial oxygen consumption.

Forty-eight myoabalated female C57BL/6J mice (20-25 g) received 1 x 10(6) BMC from transgenic GFP+ male mice.

Blood vessel density was markedly enhanced in group 4 as compared with groups 1 and 2 in peri-infarct area. Fibrotic area was significantly reduced with improved LV-contractile function in group 2 and 4. LV-systolic and diastolic functions were well-preserved in group 4 as indicated by +dP/dt, -dP/dt and Tau (glantz).

Recent studies with GSK-3beta-null mice showed impaired NFkappaB-mediated survival responses. Because NFkappaB serves a dual role as a key regulator of cytokine-induced inflammatory gene expression and apoptosis, we investigated whether modulation of GSK-3beta expression affects cytokine-induced and NFkappaB-mediated inflammatory gene expression. We observed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) treatment of primary cultures of human microvascular cells reduced net endogenous active GSK-3beta protein levels while inducing inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)) expression. Interestingly, inhibition of GSK-3beta by antisense oligonucleotides or pharmacological agent (10 mm lithium) potentiated TNF-induced expression of IL-6 and MCP-1 by 2-6-fold suggesting that inhibition of GSK-3beta under inflammatory conditions (exposure to TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) may contribute to enhanced cytokine expression. Overexpression of GSK-3beta in endothelial cells, in contrast, significantly inhibited (by 70%, p < 0.01) both TNF-alpha and IL-1beta-induced expression of IL-6, MCP-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Using adenoviruses in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mice, overexpression of GSK-3beta significantly decreased TNF-alpha expression in lung and heart tissues (38 and 15%, respectively), further confirming the anti-inflammatory role of GSK-3beta. Overexpression of GSK-3beta did not affect the TNF-alpha-induced nuclear translocation of NFkappaB but reduced the nuclear half-life of TNF-alpha-induced NFkappaB considerably (by as much as 9 h) and enhanced phosphorylation (by as much as 33%). Interestingly, neither endothelial cell survival nor NFkappaB-mediated expression of anti-apoptotic genes was affected by GSK-3beta overexpression.

Combination arsenic/imatinib treatment extensively increased GPx activity and MDA production levels compared with imatinib treatment alone. Moreover, rats treated with arsenic or imatinib, or both, showed a significant increase in serum bilirubin, creatinine and urea levels. Histopathological examination of cardiac tissue of the combination-treated group revealed fibroblastic proliferation, myocardial disorganization and myocardial necrosis.

Prolonged ischemia-reperfusion produced a selective defect in complex I function distal to the NADH dehydrogenase component. PARP-1 inhibition and PARP-1 gene disruption conferred equivalent protection against mitochondrial complex I injury and were strongly associated with improvement in myocardial energetics, contractility, and tissue viability. Interestingly, ischemic preconditioning abolished cardioprotection stimulated by PARP-1 gene disruption. Treatment with the antioxidant N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine or xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol restored the function of preconditioned PARP-1 knockout hearts. This investigation establishes a strong association between PARP-1 hyperactivity and mitochondrial complex I dysfunction in cardiac myocytes.

The oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring the O(2)(-) production using the lucigenin method.\nIncreases in blood pressure, in aortic O(2)(-) production, in glucose or insulin levels, and in insulin resistance, as well as the decrease in PPAR-gamma protein levels in aorta and heart tissues were prevented or attenuated in glucose-treated rats fed with lipoic acid. Chronic treatment with pioglitazone prevented the marked increase in O(2)(-) production in cultured SMCs chronically treated with high insulin combined or not with high glucose levels.\nThe combined therapy with the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid restored PPAR-gamma levels in cardiovascular tissues and attenuated or prevented the development of insulin resistance and hypertension in chronically glucose-fed rats.

Echocardiographic strain and SR imaging has been applied to the assessment of resting ventricular function, the assessment of myocardial viability using low-dose dobutamine infusion, and stress testing for ischemia. Resting function assessment has been applied in both the left and the right ventricles, and may prove particularly valuable for identifying myocardial diseases and following up the treatment response. Although the evidence base is limited, SR imaging seems to be feasible and effective for the assessment of myocardial viability. The use of the technique for the detection of ischemia during stress echocardiography is technically challenging and likely to evolve further.

In contrast to the conventional approach of seeding cells onto 3-D biodegradable scaffolds, we have explored a novel technology called cell sheet engineering, which layers cell sheets to construct functional tissue grafts. In this study, in vivo survival, function, and morphology of myocardial tissue grafts were examined. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were noninvasively harvested as contiguous cell sheets from temperature-responsive culture dishes simply by reducing the culture temperature. Cardiomyocyte sheets were then layered and transplanted into the subcutaneous tissues of athymic rats. The microvasculature of the grafts was rapidly organized within a few days with macroscopic graft beatings observed 3 days after transplantation and preserved up to one year. Size, conduction velocity, and contractile force of transplanted grafts increased in proportion to the host growth. Histological studies showed characteristic structures of heart tissue, including elongated cardiomyocytes, well-differentiated sarcomeres, and gap junctions within the grafts.

However, very little is known about the effect of regional myocardial ischemia-reperfusion on nitric oxide release. In an animal model mimicking off-pump bypass, male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-450 g) were mechanically ventilated under general anesthesia. After left lateral thoracotomy, the animals underwent occlusion of either the left anterior descending artery (for 3, 5, 75, 10, 12.5, 15, or 20 minutes) or the circumflex artery (for 5, 10, or 15 minutes). Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, heart tissue was stained for determination of the area at risk and the infarcted area. Blood samples obtained before ischemia, 10 minutes after reperfusion, and 24 hours after reperfusion were analyzed for plasma concentrations of nitric oxide. After occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, the size of the infarcted area increased dramatically as the duration of occlusion increased, and was significantly larger after 12.5, 15, or 20 minutes of occlusion than after 3 minutes. After occlusion of the circumflex artery, the size of the infarcted area increased steadily and was significantly larger after 15 minutes of occlusion than after 5 minutes. There was no significant correlation between the duration of coronary occlusion and the plasma concentration of nitric oxide: 10 minutes after reperfusion, this concentration was significantly lower than that before ischemia, but it was twice the baseline level 24 hours after reperfusion. We concluded that the duration of regional ischemia did not affect the plasma concentration of nitric oxide in the systemic circulation.", "journal": "Texas Heart Institute journal", "date": "2006-04-01", "authors": ["KokiNakamura", "SharifAl-Ruzzeh", "CarolineGray", "MagdiYacoub", "MohamedAmrani"], "doi": null}
{"title": "The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice.", "abstract": "Despite its well-known cardiotoxicity, the anthracyclin doxorubicin (DOX) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent. DOX-induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX. Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system. The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) showed cardioprotection against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties. Because of the relatively short final half-life of monoHER (about 30 min), it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect.\nSix groups of 6 BALB/c mice were treated with saline, DOX alone or DOX (4 mg/kg i.v.) preceded by monoHER (500 mg/kg i.p.) with an interval of 10, 30, 60 or 120 min. After a 6-week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks, the mice were sacrificed. Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy, after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham (in Cancer Treat Rep 62(6):865-872, 1978). Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group (P<0.001).\nThe number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9.6-fold (95% CI 4.4-21.0) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group. The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 (mean 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, P=0.019). The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4.4-fold reduction (P<0.001, 95% CI 2.3-8.2) of abnormal cardiomyocytes. This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration (P=0.345).\nThe results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX.", "journal": "Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology", "date": "2006-03-28", "authors": ["Anna M EBruynzeel", "Paula P NMul", "JohannesBerkhof", "AaltBast", "Hans W MNiessen", "Wim J Fvan der Vijgh"], "doi": "10.1007/s00280-006-0206-9"}

{"title": "Alternans and spiral breakup in a human ventricular tissue model.", "abstract": "Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is one of the main causes of death in the Western world. According to one hypothesis, the chaotic excitation dynamics during VF are the result of dynamical instabilities in action potential duration (APD) the occurrence of which requires that the slope of the APD restitution curve exceeds 1. Other factors such as electrotonic coupling and cardiac memory also determine whether these instabilities can develop. In this paper we study the conditions for alternans and spiral breakup in human cardiac tissue. Therefore, we develop a new version of our human ventricular cell model, which is based on recent experimental measurements of human APD restitution and includes a more extensive description of intracellular calcium dynamics. We apply this model to study the conditions for electrical instability in single cells, for reentrant waves in a ring of cells, and for reentry in two-dimensional sheets of ventricular tissue. We show that an important determinant for the onset of instability is the recovery dynamics of the fast sodium current. Slower sodium current recovery leads to longer periods of spiral wave rotation and more gradual conduction velocity restitution, both of which suppress restitution-mediated instability. As a result, maximum restitution slopes considerably exceeding 1 (up to 1.5) may be necessary for electrical instability to occur. Although slopes necessary for the onset of instabilities found in our study exceed 1, they are within the range of experimentally measured slopes. Therefore, we conclude that steep APD restitution-mediated instability is a potential mechanism for VF in the human heart.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of in vivo myocardial ischemia-reperfusion on the level and distribution of caveolin-1 and -3 and cholesterol as well as MAPK activation in caveolin-enriched fractions. Adult male rats were subjected to in vivo regional myocardial ischemia induced by 25 min of coronary artery occlusion and 10 min (n = 5) or 2 h (n = 4) of reperfusion. Another group of rats served as appropriate nonischemic time controls (n = 4). A discontinuous sucrose density gradient was used to isolate caveolae/lipid rafts from ischemic and nonischemic heart tissue. Caveolin-1 and -3, as well as cholesterol, were enriched in the light fractions. A redistribution of caveolin-3 and a reduction in caveolin-1 and cholesterol levels in the light fractions occurred after 10 min of reperfusion. The ERKs were activated in ischemic zone light and heavy fractions by 10 min of reperfusion. p44 ERK was activated after 2 h of reperfusion only in the light fractions, whereas p42 ERK phosphorylation was increased in the light and heavy fractions. Although no p38 MAPK activation occurred after 10 min of reperfusion, 2 h of reperfusion caused significant activation of p38 MAPK in nonischemic zone light and heavy fractions. These results show the importance of caveolar membrane/lipid rafts in MAPK signaling and suggest that subcellular compartmentation of p44/p42 ERKs and p38 MAPK may play distinct roles in the response to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Wnt signal transduction and the formation of the myocardium.", "abstract": "Soon after fertilization, vertebrate embryos grow very rapidly. Thus, early in gestation, a sizeable yet underdeveloped organism requires circulating blood. This need dictates the early appearance of a contractile heart, which is the first functional organ in both the avian and mammalian embryo. The heart arises from paired mesodermal regions within the anterior half of the embryo. As development proceeds, these bilateral precardiac fields merge at the midline to give rise to the primary heart tube. How specific areas of nondifferentiated mesoderm organize into myocardial tissue has been a question that has long intrigued developmental biologists. In recent years, the regulation of Wnt signal transduction has been implicated as an important event that initiates cardiac development. While initial reports in Drosophila and the bird had implicated Wnt proteins as promoters of cardiac tissue formation, subsequent findings that the WNT inhibitors Dkk1 and crescent possess cardiac-inducing activities led to the contrary hypothesis that WNTs actively inhibit cardiogenesis. This seeming contradiction has been resolved, in part, by more recent information indicating that Wnts stimulate multiple signal transduction pathways. In this review, we will examine what is presently known about the importance of regulated Wnt activity for the formation of the heart and the development of the myocardium and discuss this information in context of the emerging complexity of Wnt signal transduction.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2006-03-28", "authors": ["Leonard MEisenberg", "Carol AEisenberg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.02.014"}

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that increased formation of reactive nitrogen species in biliary cirrhosis causes nitration of cardiac proteins and leads to impaired chronotropic function. Bile duct-ligated (rats with cirrhosis) or sham-operated rats were injected daily with either saline, N(G)-L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), or N-acetylcysteine for 7 days from week 3 to week 4 after surgery. Cardiac chronotropic responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation was assessed in vitro using spontaneous beating isolated atria. Nitration of cardiac proteins was measured by mass spectrometry and located by immunogold electron microscopy. Marked impairment of chronotropic responses of isolated atria to isoproterenol was seen in rats with cirrhosis, which normalized after the administration of N-acetylcysteine or L-NAME. The levels of protein-bound nitrotyrosine in atrial tissue increased from 16 +/- 1 to 23 +/- 3 pg/microg tyrosine in rats with cirrhosis, and decreased to 15 +/- 1 and 17 +/- 1 pg/microg after treatment with L-NAME and N-acetylcysteine, respectively (P < .05). Immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated increased nitration of mitochondrial proteins in the atria of rats with cirrhosis. The plasma nitrite/nitrate levels were elevated in rats with biliary cirrhosis, and decreased after administration of L-NAME but were unchanged by N-acetylcysteine. In conclusion, abnormal cardiac chronotropic function in cirrhosis is associated with increased nitration of cardiac proteins. Two independent treatments (N-acetylcysteine and L-NAME) that decrease nitration of cardiac proteins led to normalization of cardiac responses.

In separate experiments, chimeric mice generated by reconstitution of radioablated WT mice with bone marrow from enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgenic mice underwent identical protocols.

Echocardiographically, LV function was improved in G-CSF+FL- and G-CSF+SCF-treated but not in G-CSF-treated mice, whereas LV end-diastolic dimensions were smaller in all three groups. Morphometrically, cytokine-treated hearts had smaller LV diameter and volume. Numerous EGFP-positive cardiomyocytes, capillaries, and arterioles were noted in the infarcted region in cytokine-treated chimeric mice treated with G-CSF+FL or G-CSF+SCF, but the numbers were much smaller in G-CSF-treated mice. G-CSF+FL therapy mobilized bone marrow-derived cells exhibiting increased expression of surface antigens (CD62L and CD11a) that facilitate homing.

Upregulation of the inducible isoform of HO-1 and increase its activity after treatment of animals with hemin 24 h before ischemia ameliorated myocardial function (raised left ventricular developed pressure, decreased end-diastolic pressure, attenuated vasoconstriction) and reduced oxydative stress in cardiac tissue during reperfusion of isolated hearts. Zinc protoporphyrin IX, an inhibitor of heme oxygenase activity, completely abolished the HO-1 expression in left ventricles of myocardium and increased postischemic myocardial dysfunction. Likewise, cardiac tissue injury was exacerbated by treatment with zinc protoporphyrin IX through significant inhibition of HO activity and increasing of hydroxyl radical production on reperfusion. The treatment of animals with hemin and following ischemia/reperfusion resulted in 5-6-times increase of HO-1 expression in the left ventricle of myocardium whereas in right ventricle only in 3-times.

Whether an imbalance in HDAC/HAT system plays a role in hemorrhage/resuscitation is unknown. The goals of this study were to determine whether hemorrhage results in deacetylation of cardiac histones and whether this can be corrected through the application of different resuscitation strategies or specific HDAC inhibitors.\nIn the first experiment, rats (n = 6 per group) were subjected to volume-controlled hemorrhage and resuscitated with racemic lactated Ringer's solution, L-lactated Ringer's solution, 7.5% hypertonic saline solution, ketone Ringer's solution, and pyruvate Ringer's solution.

Heart tissue was collected at the end of resuscitation. Isolated subcellular protein fractions were used in Western blotting to analyze the patterns of total protein acetylation and histone acetylation specifically. HDAC and HAT activity was measured in tissue extracts.\nHemorrhage led to partial histone deacetylation. Resuscitation resulted in protein hyperacetylation in nuclear fractions only. A detailed analysis of histones (on 10 acetylation sites) revealed that ketone Ringer's solution hyperacetylated histones H2B, H3, and H4. The addition of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid hyperacetylated histones more effectively than other resuscitation strategies, presumably by direct inhibition of HDAC activity.\nHemorrhage/resuscitation is associated with HDAC/HAT activity misbalance, and the acetylation status of cardiac histones is influenced by the choice of resuscitation strategy.

Because increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in tissue and/or plasma have been observed in virtually all forms of cardiac injury, we investigated whether tamoxifen prevents cardiac injury in a murine model of acute TNFalpha challenge. Five- to six-week-old female mice were injected (ip) with tamoxifen at 0.25 mg/kg daily for 3 or 7 days before receiving an injection of TNFalpha. Ultrastructural examination of cardiac tissues revealed remarkable protection against TNFalpha-induced mitochondrial damage in tamoxifen pretreated mice. Tamoxifen treatment significantly improved the mitochondrial respiratory function and enhanced superoxide-scavenging activity of mitochondria. These findings reveal a novel mitochondria-mediated mechanism by which tamoxifen exerts its cardiac protection effect against acute TNFalpha-induced heart injury.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2006-03-21", "authors": ["YunfengZhao", "Li-mingWang", "LuksanaChaiswing", "Hsiu-chuanYen", "Terry DOberley", "Yu-chinLien", "Shu-meiLin", "Mark PMattson", "DaretSt Clair"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.11.009"}

Due to the interspecies differences known to exist in the properties of the delayed rectifier K+ currents, the effect of L-364,373 on I(Ks) was studied and compared with that of another I(Ks) activator mefenamic acid in canine ventricular myocytes. Mefenamic acid (100 microM) significantly increased the amplitude of the fully activated I(Ks) current, as well as the I(Ks) current tails, by shifting the voltage dependence of its activation towards negative voltages and increased the time constant for deactivation. In contrast, L-364,373, up to concentrations of 3 microM, failed to augment I(Ks) at any membrane potential studied, but slightly increased the time constant of deactivation.

Acute infarction of the anterior LV wall was induced in 12 chronically instrumented dogs by permanent occlusion of the LAD coronary artery. Four hours after occlusion, rAAV-VEGF165 or rAAV-LacZ (n=6 each; 5x10(12) viral particles per animal) was directly injected with an echo-guided needle into the dysfunctional cardiac wall. LV and arterial pressure, dP/dtmax, and ejection fraction were not significantly different between the two groups over time. In contrast, in the infarcted region, at four weeks after infarction, fractional shortening was 75+/-18% and -3+/-15% of baseline and length-pressure area was 54+/-15% and 0.8+/-15% of baseline in VEGF165 versus LacZ, respectively (P<0.05).

The aim of this study was to analyse the distribution between FAT/CD36 present in cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells. We therefore developed a method to purify FAT/CD36 from total rat heart and isolated cardiomyocytes, and used the proteins as standards in an immunochemical assay. Two steps, chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and anion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose fast flow, were sufficient for obtaining the protein in a > 95% pure form. When used to isolate FAT/CD36 from total heart tissue, the FAT/CD36 yield of the method was 9% and the purification factor was 64. Purifying FAT/CD36 from isolated cardiomyocytes yielded the same 88 kDa protein band on SDS-PAGE gels and reactivity of this band on western blots was comparable to that of the FAT/CD36 isolated from total hearts. Quantifying FAT/CD36 contents by western blotting showed that the amounts of FAT/CD36 that are present in isolated cardiomyocytes (10 +/- 3 microg/mg protein) and total hearts (14 +/- 4 microg/mg protein) are of comparable magnitude. Immunofluorescence labelling showed that at least a part of the FAT/CD36 present in the cardiomyocyte is associated with the sarcolemma.

We developed and evaluated a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for I. hoferi using primers specific to the parasite's small subunit rDNA. The test has a minimum detection limit of approximately 10(-5) parasite spores per reaction and does not cross-react with the closely related salmon parasites Dermocystidium salmonis or Sphaerothecum destruens. Sensitivity and specificity of the PCR test used on somatic muscle and heart tissue for detecting infected fish were determined using 334 Chinook salmon collected from the Yukon River at 2 locations (Tanana and Emmonak) in 2003 and 2004. The true infection status of the fish was determined by testing somatic muscle, heart and kidney tissue using histological evaluation, culture, and PCR. The severity of infection was grouped into 2 categories, light and heavy infection. The probability of detecting a heavily infected fish (sensitivity of the test) was generally much higher than the probability of detecting light infection, suggesting that more than one tissue and/or method should be used to accurately detect light or early infection by I. hoferi.

At 24 hours after infection, nearly 80% of the Adv-GFP-infected myocytes expressed GFP.

Early clinical results have been obtained from phase I studies with autologous adult stem cells such as skeletal myoblasts and bone marrow mononuclear cells.

{"title": "Vitamin E deficiency accelerates nitrate tolerance via a decrease in cardiac P450 expression and increased oxidative stress.", "abstract": "Organic nitrates, such as nitroglycerin (NTG), have been used to relieve the symptoms of angina pectoris. However, their biochemical mechanisms of action, particularly in relation to the development of tolerance, are incompletely defined. It has been reported that supplemental antioxidants such as vitamin E attenuate the development of nitrate tolerance. Therefore, we examined the role of vitamin E in the regulation of nitrate tolerance. Continuous NTG infusion induced nitrate tolerance in rats after 48 h, and vitamin E concentrations decreased in a time-dependent manner in tissues and plasma. Vitamin E supplementation (0.5 g/kg diet) maintained higher concentrations of vitamin E during NTG infusion. The onset and extent of the tolerance, estimated by the decrease in blood pressure following NTG bolus injection during the infusion of NTG, were accentuated in the vitamin E-deficient group. Vitamin E supplementation inhibited nitrate tolerance 48 h after NTG infusion. Cardiac P450 expression (CYP1A2) assessed by immunoblotting, markedly decreased 48 h after NTG administration in control rats. The supplementation of vitamin E significantly attenuated the decrease in P450. Treatment of NTG enhanced vascular superoxide production (L-012 chemiluminescence, DHE fluorescence). The peak of lipid peroxidation and free radical generation in the heart was reached before tolerance developed. In contrast, vitamin E-deficient hearts had lower P450 expression and higher free radical generation than control hearts. To evaluate other vitamin E-inhibitable mechanisms of nitrate tolerance, we studied the NO-cGMP pathway. NTG markedly reduced the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) serine 239 phosphorylation (specific substrate of cGMP-activated protein kinase I; cGK-I) in tolerant hearts. Vitamin E inhibited the depletion of pVASP. In conclusion, because continuous NTG infusion causes vitamin E depletion as well as nitrate tolerance, vitamin E deficiency may further accelerate nitrate tolerance via an increase in oxidative stress, the reduced bioconversion because of decreased P450 expression, and impairment of the NO/cGMP pathway in tolerant heart tissues.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2006-03-08", "authors": ["YukikoMinamiyama", "ShigekazuTakemura", "SeikanHai", "ShigefumiSuehiro", "ShigeruOkada"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.10.038"}

Our results show positive correlations between 8OHdG and 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) for liver, brain and kidney measured by HPLC-UV-ECD (electrochemical detector) and EIA methods, respectively. However, heart tissues show a negative correlation. The mitochondrial membrane potential of old rat lymphocytes records significant decrease compared with the young lymphocytes.

In contrast, this number increased to >25% of the cardiac neurons after 72 h in explant culture. This increase in the number of CARTp neurons in cultured cardiac ganglia explants was accompanied by an increase in CARTp transcript levels as assessed by real time polymerase chain reaction. Treatment of cardiac ganglia cultures with neurturin or glial-derived trophic factor (both at 10 ng/ml) for 72 h prevented the increase in neurons that exhibited CARTp immunoreactivity. In contrast, treatment with ciliary neurotrophic factor (50 ng/ml) for 72 h produced a small significant increase in the percentage of CARTp-immunoreactive cardiac neurons and treatment with nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) had no effect. Neurturin treatment also decreased cardiac neuron CARTp levels after 72 h in explant culture. Cardiac neurons exhibited immunoreactivity to the neurturin receptor GFRalpha2 whereas non-neural cells preferentially exhibited immunoreactivity to the glial-derived neurotrophic factor receptor GFRalpha1 and neurturin transcripts were detected in cardiac tissue extracts. We hypothesize that a target-derived inhibitory factor, very likely neurturin, is a critical factor suppressing the expression of CARTp in guinea-pig cardiac neurons.

The synthesized peptides were purified by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and cross-linked with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) by sodium metaperiodate. Rabbits were immunized with conjugated peptides for 3 times (400 microg/rabbit). The polyclonal antibodies were purified by Protein G from the collected antiserum.\nNH(2)-terminal peptides of human CXCR3-B with the purity of 98%, 88.54%, and 80%, respectively, were prepared. The titers of purified polyclonal antibodies were 1:32,000 (0.1 mg/L), 1:4,000 (3 mg/L), and 1:1,000 (10 mg/L), respectively. Western blot results showed that the antibodies could recognize the protein with molecular weight of 50,000 in the total lysates of human fetal heart, whereas the antibodies against the peptides of No.1-19 amino acids could also recognize an additional protein (40,000). The antigens recognized by the antibodies were localized in the vascular endothelial cells of human fetal heart tissues.\nThe polyclonal antibodies against NH(2)-terminal peptides generated and identified in the present work are specific to CXCR3-B protein and therefore can be useful tools for the functional study of human CXCR3-B.", "journal": "Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology", "date": "2006-03-02", "authors": ["YuanGao", "Jin-juYang", "Xiao-lanLiu", "LiLiu", "Chao-yanLiu", "Gian PaoloVisentin", "Jian-enGao", "Qi-hongSun"], "doi": null}

The present study tested the hypothesis that increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha signaling via its receptors protects against Adriamycin-induced cardiac injury. We used mice in which both TNF receptor I and II have been selectively inactivated (DKO) with wild-type mice as controls. Morphometric studies of cardiac tissue following Adriamycin treatment revealed greater ultrastructural damage in cardiomyocyte mitochondria from DKO mice. Biochemical studies of cardiac tissues showed cytochrome c release and the increase in proapoptotic protein levels, suggesting that lack of TNF-alpha receptor I and II exacerbates Adriamycin-induced cardiac injury. The protective role of TNF receptor I and II was directly confirmed in isolated primary cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, following Adriamycin treatment, the levels of Fas decreased in the wild-type mice. In contrast, DKO mice had an increase in Fas levels and its downstream target, mitochondrial truncated Bid. These results suggested that TNF-alpha receptors play a critical role in cardioprotection by suppression of the mitochondrial-mediated associated cell death pathway.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2006-03-01", "authors": ["Yu-ChinLien", "Shu-MeiLin", "RamaneeyaNithipongvanitch", "Terry DOberley", "TeresaNoel", "QingZhao", "ChotirosDaosukho", "Daret KSt Clair"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0390"}

{"title": "The utility of magnetic resonance imaging in cardiac tissue regeneration trials.", "abstract": "The past decade has seen the emergence of paradigm shifts in concepts involving cardiovascular tissue regeneration, including the idea that adult stem cells originate in hematopoietic or bone marrow cells, the belief that even adult organs, such as the heart and nervous system, are capable of post-mitotic regeneration, and the concept of inherent plasticity in cells that have undergone limited lineage differentiation. There has consequently been a flurry of proposed regenerative strategies, and safety and limited efficacy data from both animal and limited human trials have been presented. The drive to push these advances from the bench to the bedside has created a unique environment where the therapeutic agents, delivery approaches, and methods of measuring efficacy (often imaging technology) are evolving practically in parallel. The encouraging results of recent cell-therapy trials should therefore be assessed cautiously and in consonance with an understanding of the advantages and limitations of delivery strategies and end points. Arguably, the use of imaging technologies to evaluate surrogate end points might help overcome the difficulty posed by large sample sizes required for hard end point trials in cardiovascular therapeutics. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is one of the most sensitive techniques available to assess spatial and temporal changes following local or systemic therapies, and the availability of a bevy of complementary techniques enables interrogation of physiology, morphology, and metabolism in one setting. We contend that cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is ideally suited to assess response to myocardial regeneration therapy and can be exploited to yield valuable insights into the mechanism of action of myocardial regeneration therapies.", "journal": "Nature clinical practice.

{"title": "Neurotensin-induced myocardial noradrenergic effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", "abstract": "Although increases in myocardial synaptic norepinephrine concentrations contribute toward the progression to heart failure in hypertension, the stimuli for norepinephrine release are unclear. In this study we explored whether neurotensin, a neuropeptide found in heart tissue, could modify myocardial norepinephrine release in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Prior to the development of cardiac decompensation, baseline coronary effluent norepinephrine concentrations were higher in isolated heart preparations of spontaneously hypertensive rats than in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) control rat hearts. Neurotensin increased coronary effluent norepinephrine concentrations and induced positive inotropic responses, effects that were enhanced in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with Wistar Kyoto rats. Although the neurotensin receptor antagonist, SR 48692, did not modify either baseline coronary effluent norepinephrine concentrations or left ventricular systolic function in spontaneously hypertensive rats, it dose dependently abolished neurotensin-induced cardiac norepinephrine release and contractile responses. Neurotensin-mediated inotropic responses were also abolished by co-administration of the beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, propranolol and atenolol. Inotropic responses to exogenous norepinephrine were similar in SHR and WKY rats. In summary, in the hypertensive heart there is an increased sensitivity to neurotensin's actions on myocardial norepinephrine release and subsequent contractile changes. Therefore, neurotensin receptor blockade may represent a novel therapeutic target in preventing the progression to heart failure in hypertension.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2006-02-24", "authors": ["OlegOsadchii", "AngelaWoodiwiss", "DawnDeftereos", "GavinNorton"], "doi": "10.1097/01.fjc.0000200988.85868.f8"}

In this study, we looked at mechanisms to explain the increase in inflammation in the absence of MyD88. We found that MyD88-deficient mice infected with B. burgdorferi did not show increased inflammation at sites typically associated with Lyme disease (joints and heart). However, there was markedly increased inflammation in the muscles, kidneys, pancreas, and lungs of deficient animals. Muscle inflammation was typically seen perivascularly and perineuronally similar to that seen in infected humans. Chemotactic chemokines and cytokines were greatly increased in the muscle and kidneys of MyD88-deficient animals but not in the joints or heart tissue, suggesting that MyD88-independent pathways for recognizing B. burgdorferi and inducing these chemokines are present in the muscle and kidneys.

To enhance electromechanical coupling, tissue constructs were induced to contract by applying electrical signals mimicking those in native heart. Over only eight days of cultivation, the biomimetic approach resulted in tissue constructs which contained electromechanically coupled cells expressing cardiac differentiation markers and cardiac-like ultrastructure and contracting synchronously in response to electrical stimulation.

The global APD restitution properties in cardiac patients are unknown. We report a combined clinical electrophysiology and computer modelling study to: (1) determine global APD restitution properties in cardiac patients; and (2) examine the interaction of the observed APD restitution with known arrhythmia mechanisms. In 14 patients aged 52-85 years undergoing routine cardiac surgery, 256 electrode epicardial mapping was performed. Activation-recovery intervals (ARI; a surrogate for APD) were recorded over the entire ventricular surface. Mono-exponential restitution curves were constructed for each electrode site using a standard S1-S2 pacing protocol. The median maximum restitution slope was 0.91, with 27% of all electrode sites with slopes<0.5, 29% between 0.5 and 1.0, and 20% between 1.0 and 1.5. Eleven per cent of restitution curves maintained slope>1 over a range of diastolic intervals of at least 30 ms; and 0.3% for at least 50 ms. Activation-recovery interval restitution was spatially heterogeneous, showing regional organization with multiple discrete areas of steep and shallow slope. We used a simplified computer model of 2-D cardiac tissue to investigate how heterogeneous APD restitution can influence vulnerability to, and stability of re-entry. Our model showed that heterogeneity of restitution can act as a potent arrhythmogenic substrate, as well as influencing the stability of re-entrant arrhythmias. Global epicardial mapping in humans showed that APD restitution slopes were organized into regions of shallow and steep slopes.

The etiology of cell degeneration in diabetes mellitus (DM)-induced cardiomyopathy is unclear. The transition between apoptotic degeneration and cell proliferation under stress conditions is regulated at cell-cycle checkpoints. This study was aimed at elucidating the role of a potent cellular stress-response system of the p53-dependent checkpoint genes, i.e. P21WAF1/CIP1 and 14-3-3 sigma, in the heart in diabetes.\nTarget gene expression levels were analyzed ex vivo in cardiomyocytes of streptozotocin-induced rats by Western blots and two-dimensional immunoblots. The levels of DNA damage/repair in diabetic cardiomyocytes were evaluated by \"comet assay\" and compared with a control group.\nWhereas no detectable expression of 14-3-3 sigma and only traces of both p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 were found in cardiomyocytes of the controls, high expression rates of all three genes were observed in the DM group. Individual levels of DNA breakage were significantly lower in diabetic than in non-diabetic cardiomyocytes.\nWe propose a dual role for cell-cycle regulation under diabetic conditions: the expressions of both p21WAF1/CIP1 and 14-3-3 sigma genes, activated via p53 function, trigger cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair, preventing replication of mutated DNA and increasing stress resistance of heart tissue at least in early diabetes.

However, inappropriate electrical coupling between grafted SMs and host cardiomyocytes may be responsible for the arrhythmias observed in clinical trials of SM transplantation. Whether functional gap junctions occur between the two cell types remains controversial. We have studied the ability of SMs to electrically couple with isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes (CMs) and assessed whether connexin43 (Cx43) overexpression enhanced gap junctional conductance (Gj). C2C12 myoblast lines overexpressing Cx43 were generated by gene transfection and clonal selection. CMs were cocultured with either SMs overexpressing Cx43 (CM-SM(Cx43)) or control SMs (CM-SM(WT)) in vitro. Gj between pairs of SMs and CMs was quantified with dual whole cell patch clamping. Formation of Gj occurred between 22% of CM-SM(WT) pairs (n=73) and 48% of CM-SM(Cx43) pairs (n=71, P<0.001).

We have evaluated the possibility of promoting significantly allograft survival in a vascularized cardiac allograft model by performing ex vivo gene transfer. We used a lentiviral vector encoding the chemokine antagonist RANTES 9-68 that is capable of competing with native RANTES.\nThe Fisher donor/Lewis recipient rat strain combinations were used and all animals received for the first 5 days posttransplantation a subtherapeutic dose of cyclosporine A (1.5 mg/kg). Ex vivo gene transfer into heart allograft was performed by multiple injections of the SIN.cPPT lentiviral vector, which corresponds to the multiply attenuated, self-inactivating lentivector derived from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1.\nAbout 6% of the cardiac tissue had integrated lentiviral vector, which closely matches the mean in vivo RANTES antagonist expression of 5% obtained by immunohistochemistry. In vivo RANTES 9-68 expression has significantly prolonged graft survival (median [25%-75%]: 20 [17-26] days), compared to the control 15 ([14-15] days; P=0.0007). Furthermore, hearts transduced with RANTES 9-68 showed a significant (P<0.05) reduction in cell infiltration and intragraft expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, endogenous RANTES, and TGF-beta.\nLentiviral gene transfer of RANTES 9-68 antagonist attenuates significantly the inflammatory response and delays allograft rejection, despite low levels of transduction.

To achieve the ultimate goal of this study, a total of 60 adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into six groups. The first three groups were injected intraperitoneally with normal saline, PLC (500 mg kg(-1)), and d-carnitine (500 mg kg(-1)) respectively, for 10 successive days. The 4th, 5th, and 6th groups were injected intraperitoneally with the same doses of normal saline, PLC and D-carnitine, respectively, for 5 successive days before and after a single dose of CDDP (7 mg kg(-1)). On day 6 after CDDP treatment, animals were sacrificed, serum as well as hearts were isolated and analyzed. CDDP resulted in a significant increase in serum creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total nitrate/nitrite (NO(x)) and a significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH), total carnitine, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content in cardiac tissues. In the carnitine-depleted rat model, CDDP induced dramatic increase in serum cardiomyopathy enzymatic indices, CK-MB and LDH, as well as progressive reduction in total carnitine and ATP content in cardiac tissue. Interestingly, PLC supplementation resulted in a complete reversal of the increase in cardiac enzymes, TBARS and NO(x), and the decrease in total carnitine, GSH and ATP, induced by CDDP, to the control values. Moreover, histopathological examination of cardiac tissues confirmed the biochemical data, where PLC prevents CDDP-induced cardiac degenerative changes while d-carnitine aggravated CDDP-induced cardiac tissue damage. In conclusion, data from this study suggest for the first time that carnitine deficiency and oxidative stress are risk factors and should be viewed as mechanisms during development of CDDP-related cardiomyopathy and that carnitine supplementation, using PLC, prevents the progression of CDDP-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2006-01-27", "authors": ["Abdulhakeem AAl-Majed", "Mohamed MSayed-Ahmed", "Abdulaziz AAl-Yahya", "Abdulaziz MAleisa", "Salim SAl-Rejaie", "Othman AAl-Shabanah"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2005.12.005"}

Atypical AS was detected from fish by a combination of bacterial cultivation and polymerase chain reaction techniques. A detection level of 17 aAS cells per 100 mg intestine tissue sample was obtained. Concomitant bacterial exposure did not enhance the severity of grayling eye rupture and nuclear extrusion induced by D. spathaceum, but D. spathaceum invasion into grayling increased the proportion of fish carrying aAS in their heart tissue. However, the number of aAS cells detected in heart tissue was low. Atypical AS did not cause acute disease or mortality during 15 days post-exposure. There was a higher prevalence of aAS in grayling heart samples than in intestinal samples, indicating that the intestine is not favoured by aAS. We suggest that heart tissue would be a good organ from which to isolate aAS when tracing latent carrier fish.

S1P influences differentiation, proliferation, and migration during vascular development. However, the effects of S1P signaling on early cardiac development are not well understood. To address this issue, we examined the expression of S1P regulatory enzymes and S1P receptors during cardiac development. We observed that enzymes that regulate S1P levels, sphingosine kinase and sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase, are expressed in the developing heart. In addition, RT-PCR revealed that four of the five known S1P receptors (S1P(1-4)) are also expressed in the developing heart. Next, effects of altered S1P levels on whole embryo and atrioventricular (AV) canal cultures were investigated. We demonstrate that inactivation of the S1P producing enzyme, sphingosine kinase, leads to cell death in cardiac tissue which is rescued by exogenous S1P treatment. Other experiments reveal that increased S1P concentration prevents alterations in cell morphology that are required for cell migration. This effect results in reduced cell migration and inhibited mesenchymal cell formation in AV canal cushion tissue. These data indicate that S1P, locally maintained within a specific concentration range, is an important and necessary component of early heart development.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2006-01-26", "authors": ["Christopher CWendler", "Scott ARivkees"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.12.013"}

Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulate these receptors and have been traditionally studied by (32)PO(4) labeling of transfected cells. However, this approach cannot be used to determine the phosphorylation state of receptors isolated from unlabeled sources. Here, we use Pro-Q Diamond and SYPRO Ruby dyes to quantify the phosphorylation status and protein levels, respectively, of natriuretic peptide receptors from tissues and cells. Strong Pro-Q Diamond signals for NPR-A and NPR-B were obtained when receptors were isolated from lung tissue, liver tissue and overexpressing cells. The level of NPR-A Pro-Q staining was also high in kidney but was much lower in heart tissue. In contrast, the SYPRO Ruby protein signal was weaker and more variable. In a direct comparison, Pro-Q Diamond staining was as sensitive as but more specific than the (32)PO(4) labeling method. The two approaches were highly correlated (R(2) = 0.98). We exploited these techniques to measure the effect of cGMP-dependent protein kinase Ialpha on the phosphate content and guanylyl cyclase activity of NPR-A. Neither value was significantly affected in cells overexpressing cGK-Ialpha or in tissues from mice lacking cGK-I. We conclude that cGK-I does not regulate the cyclase activity or phosphorylation state of NPR-A. Furthermore, we find that Pro-Q Diamond staining is a sensitive method for measuring the phosphate levels of natriuretic peptide receptors, but protein levels are best detected by Western blot analysis, not SYPRO Ruby staining.", "journal": "Biochemistry", "date": "2006-01-25", "authors": ["Paula MBryan", "DmitriSmirnov", "AlbertSmolenski", "SusanneFeil", "RobertFeil", "FranzHofmann", "SuzanneLohmann", "Lincoln RPotter"], "doi": "10.1021/bi051253d"}

Genetic susceptibility may play a role in the differential survival of severe CCC patients. Given the role of TNF-alpha in the progression of heart failure, and the increased TNF-alpha plasma and heart tissue levels observed in these patients, we chose TNF as a candidate gene for increased mortality in severe CCC patients. We typed the TNFa microsatellite and the -308 TNF promoter polymorphism and then analyzed the survival curves of 42 patients with severe ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction<or=40%) according to the presence of the TNF2 promoter allele or the TNFa2 microsatellite allele, both previously associated with high TNF-alpha production. Multivariate regression analysis (Cox proportional hazards model) revealed the TNF genotype and age of onset of severe CCC as independent predictors of mortality in severe CCC. We showed that patients positive for TNF2 or TNFa2 alleles display a significantly shorter survival time compared to those carrying other alleles; the median survival times were 2.9 and 8 months, respectively (HR(adj)=2.28, p=0.020).

Immunohistological staining of the left ventricular tissue were performed employing anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -CD14, and HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies. Intracellular expression of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha in peripheral CD4+T lymphocytes was determined using flow cytometry. The severity of heart insufficiency was determined by measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and the NYHA class. On the basis of HLA expression in the heart, the patients were divided into three groups: Group I (mild-to-none), Group II (moderate), and Group III (strong-to-very strong).\nOf the 54 patients included in this study, 33 (61%) patients were diagnosed as having idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 10 (18.5%) borderline or healing myocarditis according to the Dallas criteria. Both patient groups were found in all three HLA-DR groups. There was no difference in BNP level or NYHA class between the three groups.

We tested whether L1 overexpression is mechanistically involved in postischemic myocardial damage. Isolated, perfused rat hearts were treated with antisense or scrambled oligonucleotides (ODNs) against L1 for 60 min and exposed to 40 min of ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Functional recovery and infarct size were measured. Effective nuclear uptake was determined by FITC-labeled ODNs, and downregulation of L1 transcription was confirmed by RT-PCR. Immunoblot analysis was used to assess changes in expression levels of the L1-encoded proteins ORF1p and ORF2p. Immunohistochemistry was performed to localize ORF1/2 proteins in cardiac tissue. Effects of ODNs on prosurvival protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) expression and activity were also determined. Antisense ODNs against L1 prevented L1 burst after ischemia-reperfusion. Inhibition of L1 increased Akt/PKBbeta expression, enhanced phosphorylation of PKB at serine 473, and markedly improved postischemic functional recovery and decreased infarct size. Antisense ODN-mediated protection was abolished by LY-294002, confirming the involvement of the Akt/PKB survival pathway. ORF1p and ORF2p were found to be expressed in rat heart. ORF1p showed a predominantly nuclear localization in cardiomyocytes, whereas ORF2p was exclusively present in endothelial cells. ORF1p levels increased in response to ischemia, which was reversed by antisense ODN treatment. No significant changes in ORF2p were noted.

{"title": "Bone marrow cells transdifferentiate to cardiomyocytes when introduced into the embryonic heart.", "abstract": "Since rates of cardiomyocyte generation in the embryo are much higher than within the adult, we explored whether the embryonic heart would serve as useful experimental system for examining the myocardial potential of adult stem cells. Previously, we reported that the long-term culturing of adult mouse bone marrow produced a cell population that was both highly enriched for macrophages and cardiac competent. In this study, the myocardial potential of this cell population was analyzed in greater detail using the embryonic chick heart as recipient tissue. Experiments involving the co-incubation of labeled bone marrow cells with embryonic heart tissue showed that bone marrow (BM) cells incorporated into the myocardium and immunostained for myocyte proteins. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the heart tissue induced bone marrow cells to express the differentiated cardiomyocyte marker alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain. The cardiomyocyte conversion of the bone marrow cells was verified by harvesting donor cells from mice that were genetically labeled with a myocardial-specific beta-galactosidase reporter. Embryonic hearts exposed to the transgenic bone marrow in culture exhibited significant numbers of beta-galactosidase-positive cells, indicating the presence of bone marrow-derived cells that had converted to a myocardial phenotype. Furthermore, when transgenic mouse BM cells were injected into living chick embryos, donor cells incorporated into the developing heart and exhibited a myocardial phenotype. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that donor BM cells exhibiting myocyte markers contained only nuclei from mouse cells, indicating that differentiation and not cell fusion was the predominant mechanism for the acquisition of a myocyte phenotype. These data confirm that adult mouse bone marrow contain cells with the ability to form cardiomyocytes. In addition, the predominance of the macrophage phenotype within the donor bone marrow cell population suggests that transdifferentiation of immune response cells may play a role in cellular regeneration in the adult.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2006-01-18", "authors": ["Carol AEisenberg", "John B EBurch", "Leonard MEisenberg"], "doi": "10.1634/stemcells.2005-0128"}

The expressions of ADAM10, ADAM12, ADAM15, and ADAM17, TIMP-3, and integrin receptors beta1D and beta3 were determined by quantitative immunoblotting. Integrin shedding was assessed by the ratio of integrin cleavage products to intact protein abundance. Confocal microscopy was performed. Dilated cardiomyopathy was characterized by increased ADAM10 and ADAM15 expression and reduced TIMP-3 expression. The integrin beta1D cleavage ratio was elevated, indicating receptor shedding. ADAM10 and ADAM15 expressions correlated with the cleavage ratio. ADAM10 colocalized with integrin beta1D by confocal microscopy. ADAM10 expression correlated with clinical indices of chamber dilatation and systolic dysfunction.

{"title": "New near-infrared optical probes of cardiac electrical activity.", "abstract": "Styryl voltage-sensitive dyes (e.g., di-4-ANEPPS) have been widely and successfully used as probes for mapping membrane potential changes in cardiac cells and tissues. However, their utility has been somewhat limited because their excitation wavelengths have been restricted to the 450- to 550-nm range. Longer excitation/emission wavelength probes can minimize interference from endogenous chromophores and, because of decreased light scattering and lower absorption by endogenous chromophores, improve recording from deeper tissue layers. In this article, we report efforts to develop new potentiometric styryl dyes that have excitation wavelengths ranging above 700 nm and emission spectra extending to 900 nm. Three dyes for cardiac optical mapping were investigated in depth from several hundred dyes containing 47 variants of the styryl chromophores. Absorbance and emission spectra in ethanol and multilamellar vesicles, as well as voltage-dependent spectral changes in a model lipid bilayer, have been recorded for these dyes. Optical action potentials were recorded in typical cardiac tissues (rat, guinea pig, pig) and compared with those of di-4-ANEPPS. The voltage sensitivities of the fluorescence of these new potentiometric indicators are as good as those of the widely used ANEP series of probes. In addition, because of molecular engineering of the chromophore, the new dyes provide a wide range of dye loading and washout time constants.

Here we examine the feasibility of measuring the movement, which is useful for the study of cardiac function, by subtracting this ratiometric signal from the red or green fluorescence signal. The results of this subtraction show tissue movement and its relative changes during cardiac ischemia and perfusion with an electromechanical uncoupling agent. By incorporating the spatial variations in fluorescence intensity from the heart, tissue movement can be qualitatively mapped to examine relative changes, however, with limited ability to quantify absolute displacement.

{"title": "Advanced electrophysiologic mapping systems: an evidence-based analysis.", "abstract": "To assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and demand in Ontario for catheter ablation of complex arrhythmias guided by advanced nonfluoroscopy mapping systems. Particular attention was paid to ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF).\nTachycardia Tachycardia refers to a diverse group of arrhythmias characterized by heart rates that are greater than 100 beats per minute. It results from abnormal firing of electrical impulses from heart tissues or abnormal electrical pathways in the heart because of scars. Tachycardia may be asymptomatic, or it may adversely affect quality of life owing to symptoms such as palpitations, headaches, shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, and syncope. Atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained arrhythmia, affects about 99,000 people in Ontario. It is associated with higher morbidity and mortality because of increased risk of stroke, embolism, and congestive heart failure. In atrial fibrillation, most of the abnormal arrhythmogenic foci are located inside the pulmonary veins, although the atrium may also be responsible for triggering or perpetuating atrial fibrillation. Ventricular tachycardia, often found in patients with ischemic heart disease and a history of myocardial infarction, is often life-threatening; it accounts for about 50% of sudden deaths. Treatment of Tachycardia The first line of treatment for tachycardia is antiarrhythmic drugs; for atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation drugs are also used to prevent stroke. For patients refractory to or unable to tolerate antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation of the arrhythmogenic heart tissues is the only option. Surgical ablation such as the Cox-Maze procedure is more invasive. Catheter ablation, involving the delivery of energy (most commonly radiofrequency) via a percutaneous catheter system guided by X-ray fluoroscopy, has been used in place of surgical ablation for many patients. However, this conventional approach in catheter ablation has not been found to be effective for the treatment of complex arrhythmias such as chronic atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Advanced nonfluoroscopic mapping systems have been developed for guiding the ablation of these complex arrhythmias.\nFour nonfluoroscopic advanced mapping systems have been licensed by Health Canada: CARTO EP mapping System (manufactured by Biosense Webster, CA) uses weak magnetic fields and a special mapping/ablation catheter with a magnetic sensor to locate the catheter and reconstruct a 3-dimensional geometry of the heart superimposed with colour-coded electric potential maps to guide ablation. EnSite System (manufactured by Endocardial Solutions Inc., MN) includes a multi-electrode non-contact catheter that conducts simultaneous mapping. A processing unit uses the electrical data to computes more than 3,000 isopotential electrograms that are displayed on a reconstructed 3-dimensional geometry of the heart chamber. The navigational system, EnSite NavX, can be used separately with most mapping catheters. The LocaLisa Intracardiac System (manufactured by Medtronics Inc, MN) is a navigational system that uses an electrical field to locate the mapping catheter. It reconstructs the location of the electrodes on the mapping catheter in 3-dimensional virtual space, thereby enabling an ablation catheter to be directed to the electrode that identifies abnormal electric potential. Polar Constellation Advanced Mapping Catheter System (manufactured by Boston Scientific, MA) is a multielectrode basket catheter with 64 electrodes on 8 splines. Once deployed, each electrode is automatically traced. The information enables a 3-dimensional model of the basket catheter to be computed. Colour-coded activation maps are reconstructed online and displayed on a monitor. By using this catheter, a precise electrical map of the atrium can be obtained in several heartbeats.\nA systematic search of Cochrane, MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted to identify studies that compared ablation guided by any of the advanced systems to fluoroscopy-guided ablation of tachycardia. English-language studies with sample sizes greater than or equal to 20 that were published between 2000 and 2005 were included. Observational studies on safety of advanced mapping systems and fluoroscopy were also included. Outcomes of interest were acute success, defined as termination of arrhythmia immediately following ablation; long-term success, defined as being arrhythmia free at follow-up; total procedure time; fluoroscopy time; radiation dose; number of radiofrequency pulses; complications; cost; and the cost-effectiveness ratio. Quality of the individual studies was assessed using established criteria. Quality of the overall evidence was determined by applying the GRADE evaluation system. (3) Qualitative synthesis of the data was performed. Quantitative analysis using Revman 4.2 was performed when appropriate. Quality of the Studies Thirty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. These comprised 18 studies on CARTO (4 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 14 non-RCTs), 3 RCTs on EnSite NavX, 4 studies on LocaLisa Navigational System (1 RCT and 3 non-RCTs), 2 studies on EnSite and CARTO, 1 on Polar Constellation basket catheter, and 7 studies on radiation safety. The quality of the studies ranged from moderate to low. Most of the studies had small sample sizes with selection bias, and there was no blinding of patients or care providers in any of the studies. Duration of follow-up ranged from 6 weeks to 29 months, with most having at least 6 months of follow-up. There was heterogeneity with respect to the approach to ablation, definition of success, and drug management before and after the ablation procedure.\nEvidence is based on a small number of small RCTS and non-RCTS with methodological flaws.Advanced nonfluoroscopy mapping/navigation systems provided real time 3-dimensional images with integration of anatomic and electrical potential information that enable better visualization of areas of interest for ablationAdvanced nonfluoroscopy mapping/navigation systems appear to be safe; they consistently shortened the fluoroscopy duration and radiation exposure.Evidence suggests that nonfluoroscopy mapping and navigation systems may be used as adjuncts to rather than replacements for fluoroscopy in guiding the ablation of complex arrhythmias.Most studies showed a nonsignificant trend toward lower overall failure rate for advanced mapping-guided ablation compared with fluoroscopy-guided mapping.Pooled analyses of small RCTs and non-RCTs that compared fluoroscopy- with nonfluoroscopy-guided ablation of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter showed that advanced nonfluoroscopy mapping and navigational systems:Yielded acute success rates of 69% to 100%, not significantly different from fluoroscopy ablation.Had overall failure rates at 3 months to 19 months of 1% to 40% (median 25%).Resulted in a 10% relative reduction in overall failure rate for advanced mapping guided-ablation compared to fluoroscopy guided ablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.Yielded added benefit over fluoroscopy in guiding the ablation of complex arrhythmia. The advanced systems were shown to reduce the arrhythmia burden and the need for antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with complex arrhythmia who had failed fluoroscopy-guided ablationBased on predominantly observational studies, circumferential PV ablation guided by a nonfluoroscopy system was shown to do the following:Result in freedom from atrial fibrillation (with or without antiarrhythmic drug) in 75% to 95% of patients (median 79%). This effect was maintained up to 28 months.Result in freedom from atrial fibrillation without antiarrhythmic drugs in 47% to 95% of patients (median 63%).Improve patient survival at 28 months after the procedure as compared with drug therapy.Require special skills; patient outcomes are operator dependent, and there is a significant learning curve effect.Complication rates of pulmonary vein ablation guided by an advanced mapping/navigation system ranged from 0% to 10% with a median of 6% during a follow-up period of 6 months to 29 months.The complication rate of the study with the longest follow-up was 8%.The most common complications of advanced catheter-guided ablation were stroke, transient ischemic attack, cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary vein stenosis. A small number of cases with fatal atrial-esophageal fistula had been reported and were attributed to the high radiofrequency energy used rather than to the advanced mapping systems.\nAn Ontario-based economic analysis suggests that the cumulative incremental upfront costs of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation guided by advanced nonfluoroscopy mapping could be recouped in 4.7 years through cost avoidance arising from less need for antiarrhythmic drugs and fewer hospitalization for stroke and heart failure. Expert Opinion Expert consultants to the Medical Advisory Secretariat noted the following: Nonfluoroscopy mapping is not necessary for simple ablation procedures (e.g., typical flutter). However, it is essential in the ablation of complex arrhythmias including these:Symptomatic, drug-refractory atrial fibrillationArrhythmias in people who have had surgery for congenital heart disease (e.g., macro re-entrant tachycardia in people who have had surgery for congenital heart disease).Ventricular tachycardia due to myocardial infarctionAtypical atrial flutterAdvanced mapping systems represent an enabling technology in the ablation of complex arrhythmias. The ablation of these complex cases would not have been feasible or advisable with fluoroscopy-guided ablation and, therefore, comparative studies would not be feasible or ethical in such cases.

{"title": "Ablation for atrial fibrillation: an evidence-based analysis.", "abstract": "To review the effectiveness, safety, and costing of ablation methods to manage atrial fibrillation (AF). The ablation methods reviewed were catheter ablation and surgical ablation.\nAtrial fibrillation is characterized by an irregular, usually rapid, heart rate that limits the ability of the atria to pump blood effectively to the ventricles. Atrial fibrillation can be a primary diagnosis or it may be associated with other diseases, such as high blood pressure, abnormal heart muscle function, chronic lung diseases, and coronary heart disease. The most common symptom of AF is palpitations. Symptoms caused by decreased blood flow include dizziness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Some patients with AF do not experience any symptoms. According to United States data, the incidence of AF increases with age, with a prevalence of 1 per 200 people aged between 50 and 60 years, and 1 per 10 people aged over 80 years. In 2004, the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) estimated that the rate of hospitalization for AF in Canada was 582.7 per 100,000 population. They also reported that of the patients discharged alive, 2.7% were readmitted within 1 year for stroke. One United States prevalence study of AF indicated that the overall prevalence of AF was 0.95%. When the results of this study were extrapolated to the population of Ontario, the prevalence of AF in Ontario is 98,758 for residents aged over 20 years. Currently, the first-line therapy for AF is medical therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). There are several AADs available, because there is no one AAD that is effective for all patients. The AADs have critical adverse effects that can aggravate existing arrhythmias. The drug selection process frequently involves trial and error until the patient's symptoms subside.\nAblation has been frequently described as a \"cure\" for AF, compared with drug therapy, which controls AF but does not cure it. Ablation involves directing an energy source at cardiac tissue. For instance, radiofrequency energy uses heat to burn tissue near the source of the arrhythmia. The purpose is to create a series of scar tissue, so that the aberrant electrical pathways can no longer exist. Because the pulmonary veins are the predominant source of AF initiation, the primary goal of ablation is to isolate the pulmonary veins from the left atria through the creation of a conduction block. There are 2 methods of ablation: catheter ablation and surgical (operative) ablation. Radiofrequency energy is most commonly used for ablation. Catheter ablation involves inserting a catheter through the femoral vein to access the heart and burn abnormal foci of electrical activity by direct contact or by isolating them from the rest of the atrium. The surgical ablation is performed minimally invasively via direct visualization or with the assistance of a special scope for patients with lone AF.\nIn March 2006, the following databases were searched: Cochrane Library International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (first quarter 2006), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (first quarter 2006), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (first quarter 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2006), MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-indexed Citations (1966 to March 1, 2006), and EMBASE (1980 to 2006 week 9). The Medical Advisory Secretariat also searched Medscape on the Internet for recent reports on trials that were unpublished but that were presented at international conferences. In addition, the Web site Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com) was searched for ongoing trials investigating ablation for atrial fibrillation. Search terms included: radiofrequency ablation, catheter ablation and atrial fibrillation.\nSixteen RCTs were identified that compared ablation methods in patients with AF. Two studies were identified that investigated first-line therapy for AF or atrial flutter. Seven other studies examined patients with drug-refractory, lone AF; and the remaining 7 RCTs compared ablation plus heart surgery to heart surgery alone in patients with drug-refractory AF and concomitant heart conditions. First-line Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter Both studies concluded that catheter ablation was associated with significantly improved long-term freedom from arrhythmias and quality of life compared with medical therapy. These studies included different patient populations (those with AF in one pilot study, and those with atrial flutter in the other). Catheter ablation as first-line treatment is considered experimental at this time. Catheter Ablation Versus Medical Therapy in Patients With Drug-Refractory, Lone Atrial Fibrillation In this review, catheter ablation had success rates (freedom from arrhythmia) that ranged from 42% to 90% (median, 74%) in patients with drug-refractory, lone AF. All 3 of the RCTs comparing catheter ablation to medical therapy in patients with drug-refractory, lone AF found a significant improvement in terms of freedom from arrhythmia over a minimum of 12 months follow-up (P<.05). Ablation Plus Heart Surgery Versus Heart Surgery Alone in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation It is clear that patients with drug-refractory AF who are undergoing concomitant heart surgery (usually mitral valve repair or replacement) benefit significantly from surgical ablation, in terms of long-term freedom from AF, without substantial additional risk compared to open heart surgery alone. This group of patients represents about 1% of the patients with atrial fibrillation, thus the majority of the burden of AF lies within the patients with lone AF (i.e. those not requiring additional heart surgery).\nCatheter ablation appears to be an effective treatment for patients with drug-refractory AF whose treatment alternatives are limited.

ICR mice were infected with 500 T. cruzi blood trypomastigotes and treated during the acute or chronic phases with two 100 microg doses of DNA vaccine.

Also, there was a rapid increase in T. cruzi-specific IFNgamma-producing CD8+ T cells following treatment during the chronic phase.

However, a possible alteration in gene expression has not been fully examined. The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of Cu deficiency on protein profiles in rat heart tissue with the combination of the isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) method and Western blotting analysis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets that were either Cu-adequate (6.0 microg Cu/g diet n=6) or Cu-deficient (0.3 microg Cu/g diet n=6) for 5 week. The ICAT analysis suggested that high-salt buffer (HSB) protein profiles from heart tissue of Cu-deficient rats were different from those of Cu-adequate rats; seven major protein species differed by more than a 100% increase or a 50% decrease. With three available antibodies, our Western blotting analysis confirmed that there was an 85% increase in fibulin-5 (also known DANCE/EVEC) and a 71% decrease in cytochrome C oxidase (CCO) VIb subunit, but no change in succinate dehydrogenase complex (also known complex II) IP subunit in Cu-deficient rat heart.

Cell DNA synthesis was examined by 3H thymidine incorporation. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and TUNEL. hU-II increased the 3H thymidine incorporation into DNA in a concentration-dependent manner. hU-II inhibited endothelial apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal (5.74+/-0.64% versus 13.20+/-1.96%, P<0.01) and TNFalpha (6.76+/-0.70% versus 13.80+/-1.02%, P<0.01). The data from flow cytometry and TUNEL are consistent. Further studies showed that hU-II caused the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinasep42/44 (MAPKp42/44) in a concentration-dependent manner and this effect of hU-II was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with the MEK inhibitor (PD98059, 10muM). In addition, the use of PD98059 also attenuated 3H thymidine incorporation and anti-apoptotic effect elicited by hU-II (both P<0.01 versus hU-II alone).\nOur observations provide evidence that hU-II promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in HUVECs, and MAPKp42/44 activation may play a signal transduction role in this process.", "journal": "Atherosclerosis", "date": "2005-12-14", "authors": ["LibinShi", "WenghuiDing", "DayuanLi", "ZhijianWang", "HongfengJiang", "JunhuaZhang", "ChaoshuTang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2005.10.044"}

To identify the contribution of the different vascular compartments in the diabetic impairment of vascularization, we employed streptozotocin- and control-treated 3-mo-old C57Bl/6 mice in an isogeneic pinnal cardiac allograft model, revealing a significant delay in vascularization of wild-type cardiac tissue transplanted into diabetic mice. To investigate the basis of this impairment, the function of diabetic bone marrow cells was tested by transplantation of bone marrow cells isolated from diabetic and control mice into intact, unirradiated 18-mo-old C57Bl/6 mice, which have impaired function of both EPCs and peripheral endothelial cells. Importantly, cells derived from control, but not diabetic, bone marrow integrated into transplanted cardiac allografts. To assess the contribution of diabetic changes in the local vasculature, diabetic mice were treated with pinnal injections of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB, which promotes cardiac angiogenesis in wild-type mice. However, whereas PDGF-AB enhanced allograft function in control mice, the activity of the cardiac transplants in the PDGF-AB-treated diabetic mice was significantly decreased. To decipher the potential interactions between systemic bone marrow-derived cells and local vascular pathways, diabetic mice were transplanted with wild-type bone marrow cells with or without PDGF-AB pinnal pretreatment, resulting in improved allograft function and donor cell recruitment only in the combination treatment arm.

As a result, the detection of these critical points can lead to correct understanding and effective therapy of the tachycardia. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this problem. The proposed approach includes four stages: image smoothing, motion estimation, motion decomposition, and detection of the critical points. In the image smoothing stage, the noisy cardiac optical data are smoothed using anisotropic diffusion equation. The conduction velocity fields of the cardiac electrical patterns can then be estimated from two consecutive smoothed images. Using the recently developed discrete Hodge-Helmholtz motion decomposition technique, the curl-free and divergence-free potential surfaces of an estimated velocity field are extracted. Finally, hierarchically searching the minima and maxima on the potential surfaces, the sources, sinks, and rotational centers are located with high accuracy.

In isolated cardiac tissues, we found that brazilein exhibited a positive inotropic action in a concentration-dependent manner with little effect on heart rate and coronary perfusion. To study its possible mode of action, isolated rat hearts were treated with propranolol. This treatment did not alter the cardiotonic effect of brazilein, suggesting that this effect does not involve stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. On the other hand, an analysis of the interaction between Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and brazilein was carried out. Albino guinea pig erythrocytes (mainly alpha1-Na(+),K(+)-ATPase isoforms) enriched with Na(+),K(+)-ATPase isoforms were utilized to compare the inhibition promoted by brazilein with that of classical inhibitors such as the cardiac glycoside deslanoside. Analysis of inhibition curves revealed that unlike deslanoside, brazilein had a relatively low affinity for erythrocyte isoforms and failed to completely inhibit the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. The extent of the maximum inhibition rate was about 50%. The inhibitory effect of brazilein was not antagonized by 10 mmol/l K(+), as observed with deslanoside. Electrocardiogram research in vivo showed that brazilein did not induce the ventricular arrhythmias observed with deslanoside, suggesting that brazilein might have a less adverse effect and higher therapeutic index than cardiac glycosides. In light of all the above-mentioned observations, it can be concluded that brazilein, a molecule with a non-steroidal skeleton, produced its positive inotropic effect through inhibiting Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and could thus serve as a structural paradigm to develop new inotropic drugs.", "journal": "Pharmacology", "date": "2005-12-02", "authors": ["Yu NanZhao", "YangPan", "Jia LinTao", "Dong MingXing", "Li JunDu"], "doi": "10.1159/000089721"}

Previously the interaction of ArfGAP1 with the Golgi was allocated to a portion of the non-catalytic, carboxyl part of the protein, but the mechanism of this interaction has not been established. In this study we identify a short stretch in the non-catalytic part of ArfGAP1 (residues 204-214) in which several hydrophobic residues contribute to Golgi localization. Even single alanine replacement of two of these residues (Leu-207 and Trp-211) strongly diminished Golgi localization. Mutations in the hydrophobic residues also diminished the in vitro activity of ArfGAP1 on Arf1 bound to Golgi membranes. The stretch containing the hydrophobic residues was recently shown to mediate the binding of ArfGAP1 to loosely packed lipids of highly curved liposomes (Bigay, J., Casella, J.

{"title": "Cardiac lipoprotein lipase: metabolic basis for diabetic heart disease.", "abstract": "The heart has a limited potential to synthesize fatty acid (FA), and, therefore, FA is supplied from several sources: lipolysis of endogenous cardiac triglyceride (TG) stores or from exogenous sources in the blood. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), synthesized in cardiomyocytes, catalyzes the breakdown of the TG component of lipoproteins to provide FA to the heart. It is the vascular endothelial-bound LPL that determines the rate of plasma TG clearance, and, hence, it is also called heparin-releasable (HR) \"functional\" LPL. Functional LPL is regulated by numerous dietary and hormonal factors and is sensitive to pathophysiological alterations like those observed during diabetes. In this condition, absolute or relative lack of insulin impairs cardiac glucose transport and oxidation, resulting in FA becoming the preferred means of energy supply. To make available this increased requirement of the heart for FA, the diabetic heart upregulates its luminal LPL activity by posttranslational mechanisms. Chronically elevated cardiac LPL can result in abnormal FA supply and utilization by the heart tissue that could potentially initiate and sustain cardiac dysfunction during diabetes. As effective blood glucose control is difficult during diabetes, it is conceivable that a parallel increase in functional cardiac LPL activity may predispose people with diabetes to premature death from cardiac disease. By gaining more insight into the initial metabolic processes in the diabetic heart, we can attempt to piece together a part of the cascade of events leading to diabetic heart disease.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2005-11-26", "authors": ["ThomasPulinilkunnil", "BrianRodrigues"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.09.017"}

We tested the ability of CEPO to protect cardiac tissue from toxin-induced and oxidative stress in vitro and ischemic damage in vivo and compared these effects with the effects of EPO. CEPO reduced by 50% the extent of staurosporine-induced apoptosis in isolated rats' cardiomyocytes and increased by 25% the reactive oxygen species threshold for induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition. In an experimental model of myocardial infarction induced by permanent ligation of a coronary artery in rats, similarly to EPO, a single bolus injection of 30 mug/kg b.wt. of CEPO immediately after coronary ligation reduced apoptosis in the myocardial area at risk, examined 24 h later, by 50%. Left ventricular remodeling (ventricular dilation) and functional decline (fall in ejection fraction) assessed by repeated echocardiography were significantly and similarly attenuated in CEPO- and EPO-treated rats. Four weeks after coronary ligation, the myocardial infarction (MI) size in CEPO- and EPO-treated rats was half of that in untreated coronary-ligated animals.

Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, determined as a measure of lipid peroxidation, were increased in SHR compared with WKY rats, and PLC treatment decreased these values not only in hypertensive rats but also in normotensive ones. The content of carnitine in serum, liver and heart was higher in PLC-treated rats, but PLC did not prevent the hypertension development in young SHR. In addition, triglyceride levels, which were lower in SHR than WKY rats, were reduced by chronic PLC treatment in both rat strains. These results demonstrate: i) the hypotriglyceridemic effect of PLC and ii) the antioxidant capacity of PLC in SHR and its beneficial use protecting tissues from hypertension-accompanying oxidative damage.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2005-11-03", "authors": ["Luc\u00edaG\u00f3mez-Amores", "AlfonsoMate", "ElisaRevilla", "ConsueloSanta-Mar\u00eda", "Carmen MV\u00e1zquez"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2005.08.023"}
{"title": "Ischemic preconditioning preserves proton leakage from mitochondrial membranes but not oxidative phosphorylation during heart reperfusion.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of mitochondria in the recovery of cardiac energetics induced by ischaemic preconditioning at reperfusion. Isolated rat hearts were aerobically perfused (control), subjected to global ischaemia and reperfusion (reperfusion), or subjected to 3 brief cycles of ischaemia/reperfusion and then to the protocol of reperfusion (preconditioning). At the end of the perfusion, antimycin A was delivered to the heart for 25 min, to inhibit mitochondrial respiration and stimulate glycolysis. The increased amount of lactate released in the coronary effluent was correlated with the number of viable cells producing this end-product of glycolysis. Preconditioned hearts released 18% more lactate than reperfused hearts (p < 0.05). This result indicates that preconditioning partially preserved cell viability, as was also evidenced by the MTT assay performed on cardiac biopsies. The difference between antimycin A-stimulated and basal lactate concentration, representing the contribution of mitochondria to the overall energetics of cardiac tissue, was also 18% more elevated in the preconditioned hearts than in the reperfused hearts (p < 0.01). The study of the respiratory function of mitochondria isolated at the end of perfusion, showed that preconditioning did not improve the oxygen-dependent production of ATP (state 3 respiration, ADP/O). On the contrary, state 4 respiration, which is related to proton leakage, was 35.0% lower in the preconditioned group than reperfusion group (p < 0.05). Thus, preconditioning ameliorates cardiac energetics by preserving cell death, but without affecting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria can contribute to cell survival by the attenuation of proton leak from inner membrane.", "journal": "Cell biochemistry and function", "date": "2005-10-26", "authors": ["ClaudioMuscari", "FrancescaBonaf\u00e8", "ChiaraGamberini", "EmanueleGiordano", "GiorgioLenaz", "Claudio MarcelloCaldarera"], "doi": "10.1002/cbf.1294"}

The patch-clamp technique was used to investigate effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline on L-type Ca2+ current in human atrial myocytes.\nCarvedilol was a 13-fold more potent competitive antagonist of the effects of adrenaline at beta2-adrenoceptors (-logKB=10.13+/-0.08) than of noradrenaline at beta1-adrenoceptors (-logKB=9.02+/-0.07) in human right atrium. Chronic carvedilol treatment of patients with non-terminal heart failure reduced the inotropic sensitivity of atrial trabeculae to noradrenaline and adrenaline 5.6-fold and 91.2-fold, respectively, compared to beta1-blocker-treated patients, consistent with persistent preferential blockade of beta2-adrenoceptors. In terminal heart failure carvedilol treatment reduced 1.8-fold and 25.1-fold the sensitivity of right ventricular trabeculae to noradrenaline and adrenaline, respectively, but metoprolol treatment did not reduce the sensitivity to the catecholamines. Increases of current (ICa,L) produced by noradrenaline and adrenaline were not different in atrial myocytes obtained from non-terminal heart failure patients treated with metoprolol or carvedilol, consistent with dissociation of both beta-blockers from the receptors.\nCarvedilol blocks human cardiac beta2-adrenoceptors more than beta1-adrenoceptors, thereby conceivably contributing to the beneficial effects in heart failure. The persistent blockade of beta-adrenoceptors is attributed to accumulation of carvedilol in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2005-10-18", "authors": ["PeterMolenaar", "TorstenChrist", "UrsulaRavens", "AlbertoKaumann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.08.024"}

In whole-mount preparations, VIP-immunoreactive (IR) fibers were present in about 70% of the cardiac ganglia. VIP was co-localized with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in fibers innervating the intrinsic ganglia but was not present in fibers immunoreactive for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), tyrosine hydroxylase, or substance P. A small number of the intrinsic ChAT-IR cardiac ganglia neurons (approximately 3%) exhibited VIP immunoreactivity. These few VIP-IR cardiac neurons also exhibited nNOS immunoreactivity. After explant culture for 72 h, the intraganglionic VIP-IR fibers degenerated, indicating that they were axons of neurons located outside the heart. In cardiac tissue sections, VIP-IR fibers were present primarily in the atria and in perivascular connective tissue, with the overall abundance being low. VIP-IR fibers were notably sparse in the sinus node and conducting system and generally absent in the ventricular myocardium. Virtually all VIP-IR fibers in tissue sections exhibited immunoreactivity to nNOS. A few VIP-IR fibers, primarily those located within the atrial myocardium, were immunoreactive for both nNOS and ChAT indicating they were derived from intrinsic cardiac neurons. We suggest that, in the guinea pig, the majority of intraganglionic and cardiac tissue VIP-IR fibers originate outside of the heart. These extrinsic VIP-IR fibers are also immunoreactive for nNOS and therefore most likely are a component of the afferent fibers derived from the vagal sensory ganglia.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2005-10-13", "authors": ["Rodney LParsons", "Sarah ALocknar", "Beth AYoung", "Jennifer LHoard", "Donald BHoover"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-005-0074-3"}

To study the effect of plant derived triterpene, lupeol and its ester lupeol linoleate, on blood lipid status and oxidant stress in heart and hemolysate, male albino Wistar rats were fed high cholesterol diet (normal rat chow supplemented with 4% cholesterol and 1% cholic acid; HCD) for 30 days. A significant increase (p<0.05) in plasma total cholesterol (4.22 fold) and triglycerides (1.7 fold) was observed in HCD fed rats, along with elevated LDL (3.56 fold) and VLDL (1.99 fold) cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol (34.14%). Treatment with lupeol and its derivative normalized the lipid profile. The significant increase (p<0.05) in lipid peroxidation (LPO) was paralleled by significantly diminished (p<0.05) activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) and decreased (p<0.05) concentration of antioxidant molecules (GSH, Vit C and Vit E) in cardiac tissue and hemolysate of HCD fed rats. The oxidative tissue injury in hypercholesterolemic rats was substantiated by the increase in cardiac marker, serum CPK and the drop in its activity in the heart tissue. Lupeol and lupeol linoleate treatment decreased the LPO levels and increased enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants. CPK activity in the treated group was comparable with that of the control.

{"title": "Immunohistochemical expression of activated caspase-3 in human myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "There is mounting evidence that apoptosis is important in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI). One of the key events in the process of apoptosis is activation of caspase-3. Much attention has been recently paid to caspase inhibition as a potential treatment for ischemic cardiac disease. To predict the long-term effect of such treatment, it is essential to understand the significance of caspase-3 in the evolution of MI. Our aim was therefore to analyze immunohistochemical expression of activated caspase-3 in MI. Our study included autopsy samples of infarcted heart tissue from 50 patients with MI. Immunohistochemistry was performed by a sensitive peroxidase-streptavidin method on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, using monoclonal antibodies against activated (cleaved) caspase-3. We found caspase-3-positive myocytes in 18 MI less than 24 h old and in 3 MI that were presumably 48 h old. Their density (number of labeled myocytes/mm(2)) was greater in patients who received reperfusion treatment (mean 0.160+/-0.373 vs 0.025+/-0.037, p=0.06). In MI older than 48 h, positive reaction was observed in neutrophil granulocytes in the interstitium and, in subacute MI, it was observed in mononuclear inflammatory cells, myofibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells. Our results suggest that apoptosis of myocytes is an important mode of cell death in the early MI, being enhanced in patients who received reperfusion treatment. After 48 h, apoptosis is an important mechanism of the clearance of neutrophil granulocytes and other inflammatory cells and of scar formation. Treatment with caspase inhibitors therefore will not only affect myocyte loss but will also interfere with the clearance of neutrophils and with the transformation of granulation tissue into a scar.", "journal": "Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology", "date": "2005-10-06", "authors": ["NinaZidar", "ZvezdanaDolenc-Strazar", "JeraJeruc", "DusanStajer"], "doi": "10.1007/s00428-005-0073-5"}

The AhRR shares structural similarities with Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT). The AhRR is thought to be involved in transcriptional control of AhR-regulated genes by sequestering ARNT. Most of the knowledge of regulation and function of the AhRR is from studies in cell lines. Here, we report the tissue distribution of AhRR in AhR deficient and wild type C57BL/6 mice. In addition, the inducibility of the AhRR and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 in response to benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) (10 mg/kg bw i.p.) was investigated. The results show that the AhRR mRNA expression pattern in untreated C57BL/6 mice varies across tissues with high levels in hearts and brains. In other tissues, AhRR mRNA expression was low. In contrast to wild-type animals, the tissue levels in AhR-/- mice were about two to three orders of magnitude lower. Treatment of wild-type animals with B(a)P resulted in an induced AhRR expression in liver, spleen, lung and ovary. No significant induction of AhRR mRNA was found in brain and heart tissues, which have a constitutively high level of AhRR expression. Simultaneous measurements of CYP1A1 and AhRR mRNA expression do not strongly support the view that the AhRR tissue pattern triggers the tissue specific responsiveness of AhR-regulated genes to B(a)P treatment.", "journal": "Archives of toxicology", "date": "2005-10-06", "authors": ["ThorstenBernshausen", "BettinaJux", "CharlotteEsser", "JosefAbel", "EllenFritsche"], "doi": "10.1007/s00204-005-0025-5"}

The fructose/green tea extract group showed a reversal in all of these metabolic defects, including an improvement in glucose levels during a glucose tolerance test. Triglyceride content was also examined in various tissues and compared to the control fructose group; supplementation of the green tea extract (300 mg/kg) reduced triglyceride content in liver and heart tissues. There was molecular evidence of improved lipid and glucose homeostasis based on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) protein expression. Compared to the control fructose group, supplementation of the green tea extract (300 mg/kg) significantly increased PPARalpha and PPARgamma protein expression.

This study investigated whether access to physical activity outside a standard laboratory animal cage affected cognitive performance as measured by navigation of a spatial maze. It also examined gene expression in heart tissue for genes associated with cardiovascular function given recent reports of cognitive impairment associated with hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, we measured expression of neural-regulatory genes typically expressed in brain, but also found in cardiac tissue. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 72) were separated into three groups having different access to physical activity: none outside a standard cage, twice-weekly physical activity, and every other day exercise on a running wheel. Compared with a sedentary group, spatial maze performance was enhanced in animals that had access to physical activity, either twice-weekly in a large box or every other day on a running wheel. Both the cardiovascular and neural-related genes expressed in the heart were distinguished by access to physical activity. Several genes that are associated with heart rate, cholesterol biosynthesis, blood pressure, and cell adhesion regulation, including GJA1, FDFT1, EDN1, and CD36, differed in animals based on access to physical activity. Neural-related genes expressed in cardiac tissue associated with neurite outgrowth, neuroplasticity, and neurogenesis including RTN4, HOMER2, ACTB, NCDN, KIF5B, and HMGB2, were expressed differently among the three groups.

The symptoms and mortality after zinc powder treatment were recorded. The effects of particles on the blood-element, the serum biochemical level and the blood coagulation were studied after 2 weeks of administration. The organs were collected for histopathological examination. The N-Zn treated mice showed more severe symptoms of lethargy, vomiting and diarrhea in the beginning days than the M-Zn mice. Deaths of two mice occurred in the N-Zn group after the first week of treatment. The mortalities were confirmed by intestinal obstruction of the nanoscale zinc aggregation. The biochemical liver function tests of serum showed significantly elevated ALT, AST, ALP, and LDH in the M-Zn mice and ALT, ALP, and LDH in the N-Zn mice compared with the controls (P<0.05), which indicated that the liver damage was probably induced by both micro- and nano-scale zinc powders. The clinical changes were observed in the two treated group mice as well. The levels of the above enzymes were generally higher in the M-Zn mice than in the N-Zn mice, which implied that M-Zn powder could induce more severe liver damage than N-Zn. The biochemical renal function tests of serum BUN and CR in the M-Zn mice markedly increased either compared with the N-Zn mice or with the controls (P<0.05), but no significant difference was found between the N-Zn and the control mice. However, severe renal lesions were found by the renal histopathological examination in the N-Zn exposed mice. Therefore, we concluded that severe renal damage could occur in the N-Zn treated mice, though no significant change of blood biochemical levels occurred. Blood-element test showed that in the N-Zn mice, PLT and RDW-CV significantly increased, and HGB and HCT significantly decreased compared to the controls, which indicated that N-Zn powder could cause severe anemia.

In general, the formation of calcific vascular lesions involves complex physicochemical and molecular events. Calcification (hydroxyapatite) is initiated by injury and is progressed by promoter factors and/or the deficit of inhibitory signals. Myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (phytate, InsP6) is found in organs, tissues and fluids of all mammals and exhibits an important capacity as a crystallization inhibitor of calcium salts in urine and soft tissues. The levels found clearly depend on the dietary intake but it can also be absorbed topically. In this paper, the capacity of InsP6 as a potential inhibitor of cardiovascular calcifications was assessed in Wistar rats. Three groups were included, a control group, an InsP6 treated group (subjected to calcinosis induction by Vitamin D and nicotine and treated with standard cream with a 2% of InsP6 as potassium salt) and an InsP6 non-treated group (only subjected to calcinosis induction). All rats were fed AIN 76-A diet (a purified diet in which InsP6 is undetectable). Animals were monitorized every 12 hours. After 60 hours of calcinosis treatment, all rats of the InsP6 non-treated group died and the rest were sacrificed. Aortas and hearts were removed. A highly significant increase in the calcium content of aorta and heart tissue was observed in the InsP6 non-treated rats (21 +/- 1 mg calcium/g dry aorta tissue, 10 +/- 1 mg calcium/g dry heart tissue) when compared with controls (1.3 +/- 0.1 mg calcium/g dry aorta tissue, 0.023 +/- 0.004 mg calcium/g heart dry tissue) and InsP6 treated (0.9 +/- 0.2 mg calcium/g dry aorta tissue, 0.30 +/- 0.03 mg calcium/g dry heart tissue) animals.

{"title": "Soft tissue impact characterisation kit (STICK) for ex situ investigation of heart rhythm responses to acute mechanical stimulation.", "abstract": "Both mechanical induction and mechanical termination of arrhythmias have been reported in man. Examples include pre-cordial impacts by sports implements (baseballs, pucks) that can trigger arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, or via the so-called pre-cordial thump, used as an emergency resuscitation measure to convert arrhythmias to normal sinus node rhythm. These interventions have been partially reproduced in experimental studies on whole animals. Relating observations at the system's level to underlying mechanisms has been difficult, however, largely because of: (i) a deficit in efficient and affordable pharmacological agents to selectively target (sub-)cellular responses in whole animal studies, and (ii) the lack of suitable experimental models to study the above responses at intermediate levels of functional and structural integration, such as the isolated heart or cardiac tissue. This paper presents a soft tissue impact characterisation kit (STICK), suitable for quantitative investigations into the effects of acute mechanical stimulation on cardiac electro-mechanical function in rodent isolated heart or tissue preparations. The STICK offers independent control over a range of relevant biophysical parameters, such as impact location and energy, pre-impact projectile speed and contact area, as well as over the timing of a mechanical stimulus relative to the cardiac cycle (monitored via electrocardiogram, ECG, here recorded directly from the cardiac surface). Projectile deceleration upon interaction with the tissue is monitored, contact-free, with a resolution of 175 microm, providing information on tissue deformation dynamics, force, pressure and work of the mechanical intervention. In order to study functional effects of cardiac mechanical stimulation in the absence of tissue damage, impacts must be limited (for juvenile Guinea pig heart) to 2-2.5 mJ in the slack left ventricle (diastolic impact) and 5-10 mJ in contracture (systolic impact), as confirmed by enzyme assay and histological investigation. Impacts, timed to coincide with the early T-wave of the ECG, are capable of triggering short runs of ventricular fibrillation. Thus, the STICK is a suitable tool for the study of acute cardiac mechano-electric feedback effects, caused by short impulse-like mechanical stimulation, at the level of the isolated organ or tissue.", "journal": "Progress in biophysics and molecular biology", "date": "2005-08-30", "authors": ["Patricia JCooper", "AviEpstein", "Iain AMacleod", "Sarah T MSchaaf", "JudithSheldon", "ChristianBoulin", "PeterKohl"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2005.07.004"}

However, previous studies have only examined the role of beta-ARs in the macrolevel regulation of HR. We employed three knockout (KO) mouse lines, beta1-KO, beta2-KO, and beta1/beta2 double KO (DL-KO), to examine the role that beta-AR subtypes play in HR variability (HRV) and in the sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs into HR control. Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) in frequency domain methods of ECG spectral analysis was used to resolve HRV into high- and low-frequency (HF and LF) powers.

The EF5 positive tissues were also specifically positive for nuclear-localized hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), the oxygen-sensitive component of the hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) heterodimer. The pattern of the most intensely EF5-stained myocardial regions of the atria and IVS resemble the pattern of the major coronary vessels that form in later stages within or immediately adjacent to these particular regions. These vessels include the sinoatrial nodal artery that is a branch of the right coronary artery within the atrial wall and the anterior/posterior interventricular vessels of the IVS. These findings indicate that a portion of the developing central conduction system and the patterning of coronary vessels may be subject to a level of regulation that is dependent on differential oxygen concentration within cardiac tissues and subsequent HIF-1 regulation of gene expression.", "journal": "Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists", "date": "2005-07-20", "authors": ["JamieWikenheiser", "Yong-QiuDoughman", "Steven AFisher", "MichikoWatanabe"], "doi": "10.1002/dvdy.20499"}
{"title": "Cardiovascular and blood coagulative effects of pulmonary zinc exposure.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular damage induced by pulmonary exposure to environmental chemicals can result from direct action or, secondarily from pulmonary injury. We have developed a rat model of pulmonary exposure to zinc to demonstrate cardiac, coagulative, and fibrinolytic alterations. Male Wistar Kyoto rats were instilled intratracheally with saline or zinc sulfate, 131 microg/kg (2 micromol/kg); the alterations were determined at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h postexposure. High-dose zinc enabled us to show changes in circulating levels of zinc above normal and induce significant pulmonary inflammation/injury such that cardiac impairments were likely. At 1-24 h postexposure, plasma levels of zinc increased to nearly 20% above the base line. Significant pulmonary inflammation and injury were determined by analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and histopathology in zinc-exposed rats at all time points. Starting at 4 h postexposure, pulmonary damage was accompanied by persistently increased gene expressions of tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), but not thrombomodulin (TM). Cardiac tissues demonstrated similar temporal increases in expressions of TF, PAI-1, and TM mRNA following pulmonary instillation of zinc. In contrast to extensive pulmonary edema and inflammation, only mild, and focal acute, myocardial lesions developed in a few zinc-exposed rats; no histological evidence showed increased deposition of fibrin or disappearance of troponin. At 24 and 48 h postexposure to zinc, increases occurred in levels of systemic fibrinogen and the activated partial thromboplastin time. These data suggest that cardiovascular blood coagulation impairments are likely following pulmonary zinc exposure and associated pulmonary injury and inflammation.", "journal": "Toxicology and applied pharmacology", "date": "2005-07-12", "authors": ["Peter SGilmour", "AbrahamNyska", "Mette CSchladweiler", "John KMcGee", "J GraceWallenborn", "Judy HRichards", "Urmila PKodavanti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.taap.2005.06.002"}
