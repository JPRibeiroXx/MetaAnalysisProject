Major social and psychological consequences due to difficulty with diagnosis and management resulting in inappropriate tests and therapeutic treatment were prescribed due to these issues. Noncontrast magnetic resonance lymphography revealed complete lymphatic vessel blockage in the hand and wrist. A vascularized lymph node flap harvested at the groin level was transferred to the elbow level 1 month after local dermolipectomy. These procedures resulted in the restoration of lymphatic flow. Both patients were definitely cured, and they returned to normal life within 6 months after surgery.

While alternative, degradable materials that facilitate tissue growth have been examined. These materials can still trigger a foreign body inflammatory response that can lead to complications and discomfort.\nIn this report, our objective was to determine the effect of placing a pedicled omental flap under a biodegradable, microfibrous polyurethane scaffold serving as a full-wall thickness replacement of the rat abdominal wall. It was hypothesized that the presence of the omental tissue would stimulate greater vascularization of the scaffold and act to reduce markers of elevated inflammation in the patch vicinity. For control purposes, a polydimethylsiloxane sheet was placed as a barrier between the omental tissue and the overlying microfibrous scaffold. Both groups were sacrificed 8\u00a0wk after the implantation, and immunohistological and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assessments were performed.\nThe data showed omental tissue placement to be associated with increased vascularization, a greater local M2/M1 macrophage phenotype response, and mRNA levels reduced for inflammatory markers but increased for angiogenic and antiinflammatory factors.\nFrom a clinical perspective, the familiarity with utilizing omental flaps for an improved healing response and infection resistance should naturally be considered as new tissue engineering approaches that are translated to tissue beds where omental flap application is practical.

The improved survival of even the most vulnerable low body weight preterm infants has, despite improving health outcomes, led to the resurgence in preterm complications including one of the major causes for blindness in children, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The current mainstay in ROP therapy is laser photocoagulation and the injection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies in the late stages of the disease after the onset of neovascularization. Both are proven options for ophthalmologists to treat the severe forms of late ROP. However, laser photocoagulation destroys major parts of the retina, and the injection of VEGF antibodies, although rather simple to administer, may cause a systemic suppression of normal vascularization, which has not been studied in sufficient depth. However, the use of neither VEGF antibody nor laser treatment prevents ROP, which should be the long-term goal. It should be possible to prevent ROP by more closely mimicking the intrauterine environment after preterm birth. Such preventive measures include preventing the toxic postbirth influences (eg, oxygen excess) as well as providing the missing intrauterine factors (eg, insulin growth factor 1) and are likely to also reduce other complications of premature birth as well as ROP.

Normal tissue injury is a dose-limiting toxicity for radiation therapy (RT). Although advances in the delivery of high precision conformal RT has increased normal tissue sparing, mitigating and therapeutic strategies that could alleviate early and chronic radiation effects are urgently needed in order to deliver curative doses of RT, especially in abdominal, pelvic and thoracic malignancies. Radiation-induced gastrointestinal injury is also a major cause of lethality from accidental or intentional exposure to whole body irradiation in the case of nuclear accidents or terrorism. This review examines the therapeutic options for mitigation of non-hematopoietic radiation injuries.\nWe have developed stem cell based therapies for the mitigation of acute radiation syndrome (ARS) and radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome (RIGS). This is a promising option because of the robustness of standardized isolation and transplantation of stromal cells protocols, and their ability to support and replace radiation-damaged stem cells and stem cell niche. Stromal progenitor cells (SPC) represent a unique multipotent and heterogeneous cell population with regenerative, immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing properties. SPC are also known to secrete various key cytokines and growth factors such as platelet derived growth factors (PDGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), R-spondins (Rspo), and may consequently exert their regenerative effects via paracrine function. Additionally, secretory vesicles such as exosomes or microparticles can potentially be a cell-free alternative replacing the cell transplant in some cases.\nThis review highlights the beneficial effects of SPC on tissue regeneration with their ability to (a) target the irradiated tissues, (b) recruit host stromal cells, (c) regenerate endothelium and epithelium, (d) and secrete regenerative and immunomodulatory paracrine signals to control inflammation, ulceration, wound healing and fibrosis.", "journal": "Current pathobiology reports", "date": "2017-05-04", "authors": ["ShilpaKulkarni", "Timothy CWang", "ChandanGuha"], "doi": "10.1007/s40139-016-0114-6"}

Therefore, in vitro electromechanical stimuli could benefit further integration of therapeutic cells into the myocardium. Our goals were (a) to study the viability of a tissue-engineered construct with cardiac adipose tissue-derived progenitor cells (cardiac ATDPCs) and (b) to examine the effect of electromechanically stimulated cardiac ATDPCs within a myocardial infarction (MI) model in mice for the first time. Cardiac ATDPCs were electromechanically stimulated at 2-millisecond pulses of 50 mV/cm at 1 Hz and 10% stretching during 7 days. The cells were harvested, labeled, embedded in a fibrin hydrogel, and implanted over the infarcted area of the murine heart. A total of 39 animals were randomly distributed and sacrificed at 21 days: groups of grafts without cells and with stimulated or nonstimulated cells. Echocardiography and gene and protein analyses were also carried out. Physiologically stimulated ATDPCs showed increased expression of cardiac transcription factors, structural genes, and calcium handling genes. At 21 days after implantation, cardiac function (measured as left ventricle ejection fraction between presacrifice and post-MI) increased up to 12% in stimulated grafts relative to nontreated animals. Vascularization and integration with the host blood supply of grafts with stimulated cells resulted in increased vessel density in the infarct border region. Trained cells within the implanted fibrin patch expressed main cardiac markers and migrated into the underlying ischemic myocardium.

However, engineered skin lacks a vascular plexus at the time of grafting, leading to slower vascularization and reduced rates of engraftment compared with autograft. Hypothetically, vascularization of engineered skin grafts can be improved by treatment with proangiogenic agents at the time of grafting. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid that are inactivated by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). EETs have multiple biological activities and have been shown to promote angiogenesis. Inhibitors of sEH (sEHIs) represent attractive therapeutic agents because they increase endogenous EET levels. We investigated sEHI administration, alone or combined with EET treatment, for improved vascularization of engineered skin after grafting to mice.\nEngineered skin substitutes, prepared using primary human fibroblasts and keratinocytes, were grafted to full-thickness surgical wounds in immunodeficient mice. Mice were treated with the sEHI 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU), which was administered in drinking water throughout the study period, with or without topical EET treatment, and were compared with vehicle-treated controls. Vascularization was quantified by image analysis of CD31-positive areas in tissue sections.\nAt 2 weeks after grafting, significantly increased vascularization was observed in the TPPU and TPPU + EET groups compared with controls, with no evidence of toxicity.\nThe results suggest that sEH inhibition can increase vascularization of engineered skin grafts after transplantation, which may contribute to enhanced engraftment and improved treatment of full-thickness wounds.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

{"title": "Bioprinting the Cancer Microenvironment.", "abstract": "Cancer is intrinsically complex, comprising both heterogeneous cellular compositions and microenvironmental cues. During the various stages of cancer initiation, development, and metastasis, cell-cell interactions (involving vascular and immune cells besides cancerous cells) as well as cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions (e.g., alteration in stiffness and composition of the surrounding matrix) play major roles. Conventional cancer models both two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) present numerous limitations as they lack good vascularization and cannot mimic the complexity of tumors, thereby restricting their use as biomimetic models for applications such as drug screening and fundamental cancer biology studies. Bioprinting as an emerging biofabrication platform enables the creation of high-resolution 3D structures and has been extensively used in the past decade to model multiple organs and diseases. More recently, this versatile technique has further found its application in studying cancer genesis, growth, metastasis, and drug responses through creation of accurate models that recreate the complexity of the cancer microenvironment. In this review we will focus first on cancer biology and limitations with current cancer models. We then detail the current bioprinting strategies including the selection of bioinks for capturing the properties of the tumor matrices, after which we discuss bioprinting of vascular structures that are critical toward construction of complex 3D cancer organoids.

A promising alternative may be bio-engineered collagen-based matrices containing stem cells or their secretions.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of this bladder substitution modality, an experiment was conducted on 14 male rabbits. The animals underwent resection of urinary bladder, and the formed defect was substituted with a membrane of type I collagen (series 1, 5 rabbits) or a membrane of the same composition containing a conditioned medium with secretion of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells derived from human adipose tissue (series 2, 5 rabbits). In the comparison group (4 rabbits) resection of the bladder and the closure of the defect was carried out without bladder substitution (series 3).\nAt 1 month after surgery, there was a complete epithelization of the inner surface of the implant, and body tissues replaced the collagen matrix. In series 1, the collagen implant was replaced mainly by connective tissue ingrown with occasional solitary smooth muscle cells. In series 2, the newly formed bladder wall contained numerous smooth muscle cells, growing into the collagen matrix and forming the muscular coat. In series 3, the muscular layer regeneration at the scar site was also noted, but it was less intense, which was confirmed by morphometry. In series 2, more active vascularization of the collagen implant occurred due to neo-angiogenesis, which was more intense than that in series 3, and especially in series 1. Functional studies revealed a reduced bladder functional capacity in series 1 and 3, while in series 2 it was close to normal. During filling cystometry, changes in intra-vesical pressure profile in series 2 were close to normal, while in series 1 and 3 infusion of a small volume of saline resulted in a marked increase in intra-vesical pressure, showing a reduced compliance of the reconstructed bladder.

Injection of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into the defect is highly desirable because such a procedure is microinvasive and grafts are more flexible to fill the lesions. However, preventing hypertrophic transition and morphological contraction remain significant challenges. We have developed an \"all host derived\" cell transplantation system composed of chondrocyte brick (CB)-enriched platelet-rich plasma (P) gel and BMSCs (B). Without exogenous biomaterials or growth factors, such grafts regenerate cartilage efficiently and present great clinical promise. In immunodeficient mice, we compared performance of BMSCs and BMSCs lacking angiogenic potential in CB-B-P constructs and followed the cartilage maturation process by histology, immunostaining, micro-computed tomography, and protein analysis. We determined that angiogenesis occurred quickly inside rudimentary cartilage derived from CB-B-P constructs after implantation, which improved tissue survival, tissue growth, and production of chondrogenic signals from chondrocytes. In contrast, silencing angiogenic potential of BMSCs led to poor chondrogenesis accompanied by necrosis. Chondrocyte bricks merged rapidly with angiogenesis, which constituted an enclosed chondrogenic niche and effectively inhibited runt-related transcription factor-2-dependent hypertrophic transition of BMSCs as well as endochondral ossification; progressive chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs resulted in vascularization regression, thus favoring persistent chondrogenesis and effectively augmenting nasal cartilage. In conclusion, these findings provided a novel, efficient approach to regenerating cartilage tissues in vivo. Chondrocyte bricks mixed with P provide transient vascularization and a persistently chondrogenic microenvironment for BMSCs; this provides a mini-invasive approach for craniofacial cartilage reconstruction.

These changes appeared before cartilage lesions were visible and were correlated with osteoarthritis severity. Thus the opportunity to obtain an objective assessment of bone vascularization in non-invasive conditions in humans might help better understanding osteoarthritis pathophysiology and finding new biomarkers. We hypothesized that, as in animals, DCE-MRI has the ability to identify subchondral bone marrow vascularization changes in human osteoarthritis. We performed knee MRI in 19 patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis. We assessed subchondral bone marrow vascularization in medial and lateral femorotibial compartments with DCE-MRI and graded osteoarthritis lesions on MR images. Statistical analysis assessed intra- and inter-observer agreement, compared DCE-MRI values between the different subchondral zones, and sought for an influence of age, sex, body mass index, and osteoarthritis garde on these values. The intra- and inter-observer agreement for DCE-MRI values were excellent.

We aimed at developing a classifier predicting neuroblastoma patients' outcome based on the assessment of the adverse effects of tumor hypoxia on the progression of the disease.\nMulti-layer perceptron (MLP) was trained on the expression values of the 62 probe sets constituting NB-hypo signature to develop a predictive model for neuroblastoma patients' outcome. We utilized the expression data of 100 tumors in a leave-one-out analysis to select and construct the classifier and the expression data of the remaining 82 tumors to test the classifier performance in an external dataset. We utilized the Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to evaluate the enrichment of hypoxia related gene sets in patients predicted with \"Poor\" or \"Good\" outcome.\nWe utilized the expression of the 62 probe sets of the NB-Hypo signature in 182 neuroblastoma tumors to develop a MLP classifier predicting patients' outcome (NB-hypo classifier). We trained and validated the classifier in a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis on 100 tumor gene expression profiles. We externally tested the resulting NB-hypo classifier on an independent 82 tumors' set. The NB-hypo classifier predicted the patients' outcome with the remarkable accuracy of 87\u00a0%. NB-hypo classifier prediction resulted in 2\u00a0% classification error when applied to clinically defined low-intermediate risk neuroblastoma patients. The prediction was 100\u00a0% accurate in assessing the death of five low/intermediated risk patients. GSEA of tumor gene expression profile demonstrated the hypoxic status of the tumor in patients with poor prognosis.\nWe developed a robust classifier predicting neuroblastoma patients' outcome with a very low error rate and we provided independent evidence that the poor outcome patients had hypoxic tumors, supporting the potential of using hypoxia as target for neuroblastoma treatment.", "journal": "BMC bioinformatics", "date": "2017-02-12", "authors": ["DavideCangelosi", "SimonePelassa", "MartinaMorini", "MassimoConte", "Maria CarlaBosco", "AlessandraEva", "Angela RitaSementa", "LuigiVaresio"], "doi": "10.1186/s12859-016-1194-3\n10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60983-0\n10.1634/theoncologist.8-3-278\n10.1016/j.gene.2003.09.042\n10.1200/JCO.2003.03.025\n10.1096/fj.07-103457\n10.1200/JCO.2009.24.8351\n10.1016/j.molonc.2014.01.010\n10.1186/1471-2105-15-S5-S4\n10.1186/1476-4598-9-185\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2607\n10.1200/JCO.2009.27.3367\n10.1186/1475-2867-11-9\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2483\n10.1073/pnas.1208215109\n10.1002/ijc.29461\n10.1200/JCO.2011.40.9169\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0817\n10.1371/journal.pone.0079843\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0695\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208936\n10.1016/j.ccr.2005.03.019\n10.1200/JCO.2006.06.1879\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0985\n10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70154-8\n10.1186/1471-2164-10-474\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2008.11.009\n10.1038/28867\n10.4161/cbt.9.12.12347\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1360\n10.1038/oncsis.2014.52\n10.1007/s10555-007-9063-1\n10.1016/j.clon.2015.07.004\n10.1038/nrc704\n10.1038/cdd.2008.21\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2006.04.005\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0223\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.01.013\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.02.023\n10.1186/1471-2105-11-183\n10.1038/nbt1296-1675\n10.1093/bib/bbp012\n10.1016/S1352-2310(97)00447-0\n10.1145/1961189.1961199\n10.2307/2347628\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bth261\n10.1093/bioinformatics/16.5.412\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1200/JCO.2003.05.191\n10.1371/journal.pmed.0030047\n10.1038/nrc1367\n10.1038/nrc3064\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6605450\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2534\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-3274\n10.1007/s10462-007-9052-3\n10.1186/1471-2105-14-S7-S12\n10.1109/TKDE.2009.206\n10.1186/1471-2105-13-S4-S13\n10.1634/theoncologist.9-90005-10"}
{"title": "The relationship between periosteum and fracture healing.", "abstract": "Fracture healing is a complex process that involves presence of osteoprogenitor cells and growth factors. Therefore, the integrity of the fracture site surrounding tissues including periosteum is necessary in order to provide the resources for bone regeneration. The purpose of this review is to organize and synthesize the relevant information regarding periosteum and fracture repair. Periosteum cells are involved in endochondral or intramembranous ossification according to the presence of a new formed cartilage. The periosteal osteoprogenitor mesenchymal cells differentiation is guided by a multitude of signaling molecules, especially bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), but also as a response to mechanical stimuli. If the periosteum is traumatized or removed, there are other osteoprogenitor cell sources as the ones located in the medullar cavity of the bones, the pericytes from the blood vessel walls as well as the undifferentiated cells from the adjacent soft tissue, muscles and fascia. However, total absence of the periosteum and lesions of the intramedullary vascular network is associated with fracture non-union. In these cases, muscular tissue surrounding the site could take over some of the cambium functions. In conclusion, there are other factors that can influence significantly fracture healing, besides periosteum.", "journal": "Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie", "date": "2017-02-09", "authors": ["Tiberiu PaulNeagu", "Mirela\u0162igli\u015f", "IonCocolo\u015f", "Cristian RaduJecan"], "doi": null}

The correlation between WSS and atherosclerosis can be investigated over time using a WSS-manipulated atherosclerotic mouse model. To determine WSS in vivo, detailed 3D geometry of the vessel network is required. However, a protocol to reconstruct 3D murine vasculature using this animal model is lacking. In this project, we evaluated the adequacy of eXIA 160, a small animal contrast agent, for assessing murine vascular network on micro-CT. Also, a protocol was established for vessel geometry segmentation and WSS analysis.\nA tapering cast was placed around the right common carotid artery (RCCA) of ApoE\neXIA 160-enhanced micro-CT allowed clear visualization and assessment of the RCCA in all eight animals. No adverse biological effects were observed from the use of eXIA 160. Segmentation using local threshold values generated more accurate RCCA geometry than the global threshold-based approach. Mouse-specific velocity data and the RCCA geometry generated 3D WSS maps with high resolution, enabling quantitative analysis of WSS. In all animals, we observed low WSS upstream of the cast. Downstream of the cast, asymmetric WSS patterns were revealed with variation in size and location between animals.\neXIA 160 provided good contrast to reconstruct 3D vessel geometry and determine WSS patterns in the RCCA of the atherosclerotic mouse model.

Inclusion criteria were a scaphoid nonunion without radiocarpal arthritis, without any time limit and without any selection as to nonunion location. Before the operation, patients underwent an X-Ray and CT scan or MRI. Schernberg's classification was used to evaluate the location of the nonunion. Internal fixation was performed with a screw or K-wires. Bone grafts were taken from the dorsal side of the distal radius using a T-Lok\u2122 bone marrow biopsy needle (Argon Medical Devices, Plano, TX, USA). A CT scan was performed 3 months after the operation to determine whether union was achieved. Pain, strength and range of motion were evaluated before and after the operation. The patients' smoking habits were also documented. The average follow-up was 17.3 months (4-41). There were 20 men and 3 women with an average age of 26 years (17-63). The average duration of nonunion before the operation was 17 months (6-60). Based on Schernberg's classification, there was one type I, 12 type II and 10 type III nonunions. Wrist strength increased from 32 to 41kg. Union was obtained in all patients after an average of 4 months (3-12). Numerous treatments have been described for treating scaphoid nonunion: Matti-Russe, Fisk-Fernadez bone graft, vascularized bone graft, bone substitutes, etc. The success rate varies depending on the technique and study design. We have described an arthroscopic technique for treating scaphoid nonunion with very promising preliminary results. Arthroscopic debridement is needed to ensure good quality bone at the graft site, while preserving extrinsic vascularization. Traction is used during the operation to restore the scaphoid height, once debridement has been completed. Use of the compacted cancellous bone plugs adds stability to the nonunion site and helps to fill the defect.

Commonly used procedures like arthrodesis, amputation or ray resection of the finger compromise the functionality of the injured finger. Especially for young patients, the restoration of all functions of the fingers is a priority. Local tissue transfers for finger joint reconstructions is not an option due to inacceptable donor site morbidity; microsurgical tissue transfers in terms of free toe joint transfers have proven to be a valuable method.\nWe present the case of a patient who suffered an excessive injury from a circular saw to his dominant hand. The MCP Joints of D2-D4 were fully destroyed, along with the PIP joint of a subtotally amputated D4. Arteries, nerves and tendons could be coapted directly, while primarily reconstructing of the finger joints was impossible. To ensure a possible regain of full functionality, two coherent joints, the MTP and the PIP of one toe, were transferred to the ring finger as a single transplant, reconstructing the MCP and the PIP joints of the injured finger in a one step procedure. Additionally the MCP joint of the D2 was reconstructed by the use of a free PIP-joint transfer, further the MCP joint of the D3 was replaced by an MCP endoprosthesis.\nAfter a follow up of 3 years the patient displayed full function of his dominant hand including sensitivity, and has gone back to manual work without limitations. The result was cosmetically acceptable and the donor site defect was easily being tolerated by the patient who is playing soccer in the regional soccer league.\nFree double toe joint transfer has been proven feasible in this patient. While transferring a single toe joint to reconstruct a finger joint is a well-established method, our review of the latest literature showed no case of a free transfer of two coherent joints and three transplanted joints in one hand.

Unfortunately, preclinic and clinic anti-angiogenic approaches have not been very successful, and multiple factors have been found to contribute to toxicity and tumor resistance. Moreover, tumors can highlight intrinsic or acquired resistances, or show adaptation to the VEGF-targeted therapies. Furthermore, different mechanisms of vascularization, activation of alternative signaling pathways, and increased tumor aggressiveness make this context even more complex. On the other hand, it has to be considered that the transitional restoration of normal, not fenestrated, microvessels allows the drug to reach the tumor and act with the maximum efficiency. However, these effects are time-limited and different, depending on the various types of cancer, and clearly define a specific \"normalization window.\" So, new horizons in the therapeutic approaches consist on the treatment of the tumor with pro- (instead of anti-) angiogenic therapies, which could strengthen a network of well-structured blood vessels that facilitate the transport of the drug.", "journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "date": "2017-01-24", "authors": ["GabriellaLupo", "NunziaCaporarello", "MelaniaOlivieri", "MartinaCristaldi", "CarlaMotta", "VincenzoBramanti", "RobertoAvola", "MarioSalmeri", "FerdinandoNicoletti", "Carmelina DAnfuso"], "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2016.00519\n10.1093/cvr/cvm111\n10.1200/JCO.2012.44.4711\n10.1016/j.biochi.2013.11.013\n10.1080/14737140.2016.1192467\n10.1016/S1470-2045(12)70477-1\n10.1038/nrc2442\n10.1016/S0360-3016(01)01630-3\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60421-9\n10.1016/S1470-2045(15)00198-9\n10.1056/NEJMoa1104390\n10.1200/JCO.2013.54.3298\n10.1038/nrclinonc\n10.1002/path.4052\n10.1038/nm.3291\n10.1016/j.ccr.2011.11.024\n10.1016/jccr.2008.12.004\n10.1016/S1470-2045(12)70509-0\n10.1002/mrm.1910400602\n10.1016/S1470-2045(15)70137-3\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.01.021\n10.1038/nm.3289\n10.15252/embj.201592775\n10.1093/jjco/hyt201\n10.1111/j.1600-0463.2004.apm11207-0810.x\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61719-5\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-1489\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60845\n10.1056/NEJMoa1308573\n10.1152/physrev.00038.2010\n10.1038/nature07424\n10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61900-X\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.03.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010747\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604939\n10.1073/pnas.1424024112\n10.1016/j.mvr.2008.11.002\n10.1016/j.molonc.2015.12.011\n10.1007/s10147-016-0957-1\n10.1158/0008-5472\n10.1158/0008-5472\n10.1200/JCO.2013.50.3961\n10.1200/JCO.2012.46.3653\n10.1093/jnci/djv155\n10.1073/pnas.1014480108\n10.1038/nm.1985\n10.1200/JCO.2010.28.1386\n10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2014.10.004\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0463\n10.1371/journal.pone.0109757\n10.1007/s00259-015-3040-7\n10.1016/j.ccr.2012.05.037\n10.1016/j.canlet.2014.08.004\n10.1111/febs.13545\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.03.089\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1877\n10.1038/nrd3870\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0858\n10.1200/JCO.2012.48.5268\n10.1007/3-7643-7311-3_7\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6603201\n10.1007/s10585-012-9500-6\n10.1097/00001622-200401000-00009\n10.1007/s10238-009-0076-7\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.11.035\n10.2353/ajpath.2009.081030\n10.1093/annonc/mdt130\n10.1200/JCO.2013.51.4489\n10.1200/JCO.2013.50.5305\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00157\n10.1111/cmi.12121\n10.1200/JCO.2007.12.0949\n10.1056/NEJMoa061884\n10.1016/j.radonc.2009.11.007\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.01.003\n10.1016/j.ccr.2007.04.017\n10.1038/onc.2009.441\n10.1126/science.1127592\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1631\n10.1074/jbc.M402727200\n10.1038/nature06348\n10.1200/JCO.2014.57.0572\n10.1016/j.ygyno.2007.06.004\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3406\n10.1101/gad.261867.115\n10.2147/IJNRD.S48496\n10.1038/srep09898\n10.1182/blood-2010-01-266197\n10.1016/S1726-4901(10)70062-9\n10.1056/NEJMoa1309748\n10.1073/pnas\n10.1097/JTO.0b013e31822e7256\n10.1038/nature11055\n10.1038/nature09624\n10.1016/S1470-2045(14)70420-6\n10.1016/j.ccr.2004.10.011\n10.1172/JCI25705\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-1016-T\n10.1159/000087840\n10.1126/science.1068327"}

{"title": "Pulp Vascularization during Tooth Development, Regeneration, and Therapy.", "abstract": "The pulp is a highly vascularized tissue situated in an inextensible environment surrounded by rigid dentin walls, with the apical foramina being the only access. The pulp vascular system is not only responsible for nutrient supply and waste removal but also contributes actively to the pulp inflammatory response and subsequent regeneration. This review discusses the underlying mechanisms of pulp vascularization during tooth development, regeneration, and therapeutic procedures, such as tissue engineering and tooth transplantation. Whereas the pulp vascular system is established by vasculogenesis during embryonic development, sprouting angiogenesis is the predominant process during regeneration and therapeutic processes. Hypoxia can be considered a common driving force. Dental pulp cells under hypoxic stress release proangiogenic factors, with vascular endothelial growth factor being one of the most potent. The benefit of exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor application in tissue engineering has been well demonstrated. Interestingly, dental pulp stem cells have an important role in pulp revascularization. Indeed, recent studies show that dental pulp stem cell secretome possesses angiogenic potential that actively contributes to the angiogenic process by guiding endothelial cells and even by differentiating themselves into the endothelial lineage. Although considerable insight has been obtained in the processes underlying pulp vascularization, many questions remain relating to the signaling pathways, timing, and influence of various stress conditions.", "journal": "Journal of dental research", "date": "2017-01-21", "authors": ["CRombouts", "TGiraud", "CJeanneau", "IAbout"], "doi": "10.1177/0022034516671688"}

Complete histologic evaluation of the endometrium was obtained through dilatation & curettage (D&C) and/or hysteroscopy. Accordingly, patients were divided into 3 groups: controls (no endometrial pathology, n = 49), GI (benign endometrial pathology, n = 37), GII (endometrial carcinoma, n = 32).\nGII had greater thickness and volume of the endometrium, compared to GI and controls. The presence of arterial vascular flow was identified only in GI and GII (51.35% and 93.75%, respectively). Endometrial volume merged together with uterine volume measurements (TVU-3D) showed a strong, statistical significance between GI and GII, allowing differentiation of begin and malignant endometrial pathologies in postmenopausal women.\nIn TVU diagnostics of postmenopausal women with AUB the following play the most significant role: 1) endometrial thickness (TVU-2D); 2) endometrial volume (TVU-3D); 3) uterine plus endometrial volume (TVU-3D); 4) vascularization within the endometrium, allowing to differentiate between pathological and normal endometrium (TVU-2/3D).

{"title": "Controlling the 3D architecture of Self-Lifting Auto-generated Tissue Equivalents (SLATEs) for optimized corneal graft composition and stability.", "abstract": "Ideally, biomaterials designed to play specific physical and physiological roles in\u00a0vivo should comprise components and microarchitectures analogous to those of the native tissues they intend to replace. For that, implantable biomaterials need to be carefully designed to have the correct structural and compositional properties, which consequently impart their bio-function. In this study, we showed that the control of such properties can be defined from the bottom-up, using smart surface templates to modulate the structure, composition, and bio-mechanics of human transplantable tissues. Using multi-functional peptide amphiphile-coated surfaces with different anisotropies, we were able to control the phenotype of corneal stromal cells and instruct them to fabricate self-lifting tissues that closely emulated the native stromal lamellae of the human cornea. The type and arrangement of the extracellular matrix comprising these corneal stromal Self-Lifting Analogous Tissue Equivalents (SLATEs) were then evaluated in detail, and was shown to correlate with tissue function. Specifically, SLATEs comprising aligned collagen fibrils were shown to be significantly thicker, denser, and more resistant to proteolytic degradation compared to SLATEs formed with randomly-oriented constituents. In addition, SLATEs were highly transparent while providing increased absorption to near-UV radiation. Importantly, corneal stromal SLATEs were capable of constituting tissues with a higher-order complexity, either by creating thicker tissues through stacking or by serving as substrate to support a fully-differentiated, stratified corneal epithelium. SLATEs were also deemed safe as implants in a rabbit corneal model, being capable of integrating with the surrounding host tissue without provoking inflammation, neo-vascularization, or any other signs of rejection after a 9-months follow-up. This work thus paves the way for the de novo bio-fabrication of easy-retrievable, scaffold-free human tissues with controlled structural, compositional, and functional properties to replace corneal, as well as other, tissues.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2017-01-17", "authors": ["Ricardo MGouveia", "ElenaGonz\u00e1lez-Andrades", "Juan CCardona", "CarmenGonz\u00e1lez-Gallardo", "Ana MIonescu", "IngridGarzon", "MiguelAlaminos", "MiguelGonz\u00e1lez-Andrades", "Che JConnon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.12.023"}

It contains a vascular component that provides vital blood supply to the cortical bone and an osteogenic niche that acts as a source of bone-forming cells. Periosteal grafts have shown promise in the regeneration of critical size defects, however their limited availability restricts their widespread clinical application. Only a small number of tissue-engineered periosteum constructs (TEPCs) have been reported in the literature. A current challenge in the development of appropriate TEPCs is a lack of pre-clinical models in which they can reliably be evaluated. In this study, we present a novel periosteum tissue engineering concept utilizing a multiphasic scaffold design in combination with different human cell types for periosteal regeneration in an orthotopic in\u00a0vivo platform. Human endothelial and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were used to mirror both the vascular and osteogenic niche respectively. Immunohistochemistry showed that the BM-MSCs maintained their undifferentiated phenotype. The human endothelial cells developed into mature vessels and connected to host vasculature. The addition of an in\u00a0vitro engineered endothelial network increased vascularization in comparison to cell-free constructs.

{"title": "An update and review of cell-based wound dressings and their integration into clinical practice.", "abstract": "Chronic wounds affect over 4 million individuals and pose a significant burden to the US healthcare system. Diabetes, venous stasis, radiation or paralysis are common risk factors for chronic wounds. Unfortunately, the current standard of care (SOC) has a high relapse rate and these wounds continue to adversely affect patients' quality of life. Fortunately, advances in tissue engineering have allowed for the development of cell-based wound dressings that promote wound healing by improving cell migration and differentiation. As the available options continue to increase in quantity and quality, physicians should have a user-friendly guide to reference when deciding which dressing to use. The objective of this review is to identify the currently available biologic dressings, describe their indications, and provide a framework for integration into clinical practice. This review included 53 studies consisting of prospective and retrospective cohorts as well as several randomized control trials. Three general categories of cell-based biologic dressings were identified and nine brands were included. Cell-based biologic dressings have shown efficacy in a broad range of scenarios, and studies examining their efficacy have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic wounds. Amniotic and placental membranes have the widest scope and can be used to treat all subtypes of chronic wounds. Human skin allografts and bioengineered skin substitutes can be used for chronic ulcers but generally require a vascularized wound bed. Autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) has shown promise in venous stasis ulcers and decubitus ulcers that have failed conventional treatment. Overall, more research is necessary to determine if these novel therapeutic options will change the current SOC, but current studies demonstrate encouraging results in the treatment of chronic wounds.", "journal": "Annals of translational medicine", "date": "2017-01-17", "authors": ["AustinPourmoussa", "Daniel JGardner", "Maxwell BJohnson", "Alex KWong"], "doi": "10.21037/atm.2016.12.44\n10.1089/wound.2015.0647\n10.1089/wound.2015.0635\n10.1111/j.1524-475X.2009.00543.x\n10.1097/01.prs.0000225431.63010.1b\n10.22203/eCM.v015a07\n10.1111/wrr.12227\n10.1136/bjo.83.6.748\n10.1111/iwj.12329\n10.5966/sctm.2011-0018\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2007.07914.x\n10.5966/sctm.2012-0041\n10.1089/wound.2013.0449\n10.1111/iwj.12566\n10.2174/157488807782793790\n10.12968/jowc.2016.25.Sup7.S10\n10.1111/wrr.12456\n10.1177/1938640010387417\n10.2147/ciia.2007.2.1.93\n10.2165/00063030-200216060-00005\n10.1111/j.1365-4632.2003.02039.x\n10.1186/1472-6963-9-115\n10.1177/1534734609331597\n10.2337/diacare.24.2.290\n10.1111/iwj.12053\n10.1089/wound.2011.0282\n10.1016/j.ejvs.2004.03.001\n10.1111/j.1525-1594.1997.tb00476.x\n10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.01386.x\n10.2337/diacare.26.6.1701\n10.1016/S1067-2516(02)80047-3\n10.1097/00129334-200211000-00006\n10.1016/S0305-4179(03)00164-5\n10.1097/00000658-198609000-00011\n10.1016/j.jtv.2016.03.003\n10.4142/jvs.2016.17.1.79\n10.1097/00008505-200110000-00002\n10.1177/0363546509349921\n10.1111/jocd.12167\n10.1016/S1079-2104(98)90029-4\n10.1177/1534734611426755\n10.12968/jowc.2015.24.4.172"}
{"title": "Clinical analysis of 54 cases of large area soft tissue avulsion in the lower limb.", "abstract": "To assess the clinical curative effect of different treatment methods for large area avulsion injury in the lower limb.\nBetween January 2010 and December 2013, 54 patients with large area avulsion injury in the lower limb were treated in the trauma center of our hospital, including 34 males and 20 females with a mean age of 35.7 years (range, 16-65 years). The injury mechanism was traffic accident in 44 cases, hitting by heavy objects in 8 cases, and fall from height in 2 cases, involving 31 thighs, 19 legs and 4 feet involved. The sizes of the avulsed wounds ranged from 10 cm \u00d715 cm to 50 cm \u00d730 cm. There were 16 cases combined with hemorrhagic shock, 5 with femoral fractures, and 7 with tibiofibula fractures. Averagely the patients were sent to our hospital within 3.5 h (range, 1.5-10 h) after injury. For the 54 patients, three different surgical strategies were performed based on the wound area and condition of the avulsed skin: in Group A, 24 patients were treated by debridement and preservation of subcutaneous vascular network \u207a vertical mattress suture of full thickness skin flap \u207a tube drainage; in Group B, 25 patients were treated by split-thickness skin flap meshing and grafting \u207a vacuum sealing drainage (VSD); and in Group C, the other 5 patients were treated by debridement and VSD at stage I \u207a reattachment of autologous reserved frozen split-thickness skin graft at stage II.\nAll the 54 patients recovered and were discharged eventually, without any deaths or amputees. In each group, there were no statistical differences (all p > 0.05) among different injury sites in terms of survival rate and length of hospital stay, except for the infection rate, which was much higher (p =0.000) at the leg area than that at the thigh (32.54% \u00b1 2.97% vs. 2.32% \u00b1 2.34% in Group A and 50.00% \u00b1 0.00% vs. 0 in Group C) or the foot (50.00% \u00b1 0.00% vs. 0 in Group C). Moreover comparison of the three surgical methods showed a significant different (all p < 0.05) between each other for all the three assessed parameters, i.e. flap survival rate, length of hospital stay, and infection rate.\nTreatment choices for skin avulsion on the lower limb should be based on the viability of the avulsed skin flap and the location of the wound. Proper choice can not only reduce the economic burden caused by using VSD, but also shorten the long hospital stay due to repeated wound dressing change or second stage surgery.", "journal": "Chinese journal of traumatology = Zhonghua chuang shang za zhi", "date": "2017-01-17", "authors": ["YuChen", "LeiLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cjtee.2016.09.003"}

In March 2016, ultrasonography showed that the diameter of the right major nodule had grown to 12 mm, characterized by increased vascularization and increased texture.

We propose the use of autologous Platelet Rich Plasma gel (aPRPg) in order to enhance to vascularization of BM graft and reduce the fibrous spongy. We report the outcome of our ten cases of bulbar and penile UP and the safety of this technique. Materials and metods: Ten patients underwent to BM UP with use of aPRP gel. Median age was 46. Stricture etiology was idiopathic, failed hypospadias and flogistic. Average stricture length was 3.7 cm. All patient were preoperatively evaluated with uroflowmetry , retrograde urethrography, cystoscopy and questionnaire. The harvesting of the aPRP was performed in blood bank from peripheral venous sample. Catheter was usually removed after 3 weeks and urethrography was performed after 6 weeks.\nAll patients reported no problem on the donor site. At time of follow-up (median 20 month, 12-34) all patients refer no problem and a good uroflowmetry. No re-strictures at the anastomotic sites were demonstrated in any of the patients.\nHowever in our experience the follow-up is limited and no definitive conclusion or comparison can be made with the original BM UP. The use of aPRP gel seems feasible and safe. In our opinion it is important to continue investigating this procedure for its advantages in case of complex urethral strictures complicated by fibrous spongy, above all in penile urethral strictures post hypospadia repair.", "journal": "Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica", "date": "2017-01-12", "authors": ["MarcelloScarcia", "Francesco PaoloMaselli", "GiuseppeCardo", "Giuseppe MarioLudovico"], "doi": "10.4081/aiua.2016.4.274"}
{"title": "The Essential Role of Type I Interferons in Differentiation and Activation of Tumor-Associated Neutrophils.", "abstract": "Type I interferons (IFNs) were first characterized in the process of viral interference. However, since then, IFNs are found to be involved in a wide range of biological processes. In the mouse, type I IFNs comprise a large family of cytokines. At least 12 IFN-\u03b1 and one IFN-\u03b2 can be found and they all signal through the same receptor (IFNAR). A hierarchy of expression has been established for type I IFNs, where IFN-\u03b2 is induced first and it activates in a paracrine and autocrine fashion a cascade of other type I IFNs. Besides its importance in the induction of the IFN cascade, IFN-\u03b2 is also constitutively expressed in low amounts under normal non-inflammatory conditions, thus facilitating \"primed\" state of the immune system. In the context of cancer, type I IFNs show strong antitumor function as they play a key role in mounting antitumor immune responses through the modulation of neutrophil differentiation, activation, and migration. Owing to their plasticity, neutrophils play diverse roles during cancer development and metastasis since they possess both tumor-promoting (N2) and tumor-limiting (N1) properties. Notably, the differentiation into antitumor phenotype is strongly supported by type I IFNs. It could also be shown that these cytokines are critical for the suppression of neutrophil migration into tumor and metastasis site by regulating chemokine receptors, e.g., CXCR2 on these cells and by influencing their longevity. Type I IFNs limit the life span of neutrophils by influencing both, the extrinsic as well as the intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Such antitumor neutrophils efficiently suppress the pro-angiogenic factors expression, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metallopeptidase 9.

The patients were divided into two groups of maxillary reconstruction, according to different planning and treatment strategies. In Group 1, presurgical planning was achieved using three-dimensional stereomodeling (n\u00a0=\u00a012). In Group 2, virtual surgical planning was performed and guided templates were produced (n\u00a0=\u00a022). The differences in the preoperative planning, intraoperative technique, postoperative complications, and long-term results between the two groups were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the differences between the two groups and the risk factors for prognosis.\nSimilar and accurate secondary maxillary reconstructions were successfully performed in Group 1 and 2. Postoperative complications were reported in 8 patients in Group 1 and 11 patients in Group 2. Complications were reported in patients who underwent radiotherapy. The incidence of postoperative complications in Group 2 were lower than that in Group 1 with the exception of midfacial collapse (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The long-term results of some patients with class 3 defects were not satisfactory because of midfacial collapse and lower eyelid ectropion. Stepwise regression analysis showed radiotherapy to be a risk factor for prognosis.\nThe long-term results of secondary maxillary reconstruction were reported to be acceptable in our study. Radiotherapy was the risk factor for prognosis in secondary maxillary reconstruction. On the basis of these results, we highly recommend our strategy for secondary maxillary reconstruction. Good functional results could be achieved after the accurate restoration of maxillary alveolar ridge with several fibular segments using virtual surgical planning and dental restoration.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2017-01-09", "authors": ["YiShen", "JunLi", "AndrewOw", "LiangWang", "Ming-MingLv", "JianSun"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2016.11.020"}

Then, autologous tracheal epithelial cells and chondrocytes were separately seeded onto the two layers of the BLTS. After culturing for 7 days, the cell-seeded BLTS (CS-BLTS) was implanted and wrapped in rat tracheal fascia for pre-vascularization. The pre-vascularized BLTS (PV-BLTS) was subjected to an in situ trachea regeneration study using a rat trachea injury model, along with CS-BLTS and bare BLTS for comparison. The results presented the bilayer structure of the BLTS, and the two layers were arranged conterminously. The porosity of the outer layer (collagen/P(LLA-CL) yarns) was found to be significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the inner layer (collagen/P(LLA-CL) fibers). In vitro biological analysis demonstrated that the collagen/P(LLA-CL) showed good biocompatibility, which promoted tracheal epithelial cell initial adhesion and proliferation with a highly significant difference (P < 0.001) or significant difference (P < 0.05) compared to those of pure P(LLA-CL) materials respectively. Chondrocyte activity and proliferation were also enhanced on collagen/P(LLA-CL) yarns with a significant difference (P < 0.05) compared to those of pure P(LLA-CL). Chondrocyte penetration was promoted as well, due to the loose and porous structure of the electrospun collagen/P(LLA-CL) yarns. The in vivo evaluation results of immune response analysis and histological investigation demonstrated that the PV-BLTS performed better in new capillary regeneration, reducing immunogenicity and improving tracheal tissue regeneration compared to the CS-BLTS and bare BLTS, indicating its promising potential as a new tissue engineered alternative for trachea repair and regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

{"title": "Development of demineralized bone matrix-based implantable and biomimetic microcarrier for stem cell expansion and single-step tissue-engineered bone graft construction.", "abstract": "Tissue engineered bone grafts (TEBG) using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) demonstrate great potential for bone defect treatment. However, current MSC expansion techniques and multiple-step TEBG construction strategy have problems such as repeated trypsinization, limiting further clinical application. Microcarriers present promising solutions, but conventional microcarriers are either non-implantable or have insufficient biomimetic potential to maintain effective cellular function. Here, we developed a biomimetic and implantable microcarrier using demineralized bone matrix (DBM-MC), which preserves the essential biochemical composition, architecture and surface topography of natural bone tissue. Furthermore, based on this DBM-MC, we established a single-step micro-sized TEBG (\u03bcTEBG) construction strategy integrating multiple procedures of cell seeding, expansion, and differentiation. Benchmarked with Cytodex 3, a widely used microcarrier, DBM-MC shared similar physical properties, and supported efficient cell adhesion and proliferation with MSC characteristics being well maintained. However, when implanted ectopically, the MSC/DBM-MC constructs achieved more neo-bone formation with better vascularization than MSC/Cytodex 3. Moreover, \u03bcTEBG generated via our single-step strategy can successfully heal a critical-sized cranial defect with two-fold more bone regeneration. This new DBM-MC and single-step \u03bcTEBG construction strategy can provide an enclosed, large-scale, reduced-trypsinization, and semi-automatic fabrication process to generate \u03bcTEBGs with outstanding osteogenic and angiogenic capacity, demonstrating great potential for clinical application.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

Occlusion of the artery of Percheron mostly results in a bilateral medial thalamic infarction, which usually manifests with altered consciousness (including coma), vertical gaze paresis, and cognitive disturbance.

{"title": "Clavicle fractures.", "abstract": "Management of clavicle fracture has progressed over the last decade, notably with wider use of surgery in midshaft fracture, and new techniques for lateral fracture. Midshaft clavicle fracture treatment needs to be personalized and adapted to the patient's activity level. Whichever the segment involved, treatment for non-displaced fracture is functional; elbow-to-body sling immobilization seems the best tolerated. Apart from regular surgical indications (shoulder impaction, floating shoulder, open fracture or fracture with neurovascular complications), surgery is recommended in case of bone shortening exceeding 1.5cm in young active patients. The technique needs to take account of clavicle anatomy: notably periosteal vascularization in midshaft fracture and acromioclavicular ligament integrity and location in case of lateral fracture. Plate osteosynthesis should take account of bone diameter and 3D curvature; intramedullary fixation should take account of intramedullary canal morphology. Although iatrogenic vascular complications are rare, vessel relations and variants need to be known, especially in the medial end of the clavicle and midshaft. Lateral segment fractures are a particular entity.

The expression levels of Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 in cystic and solid HBs were estimated and compared according to the integrated optical density (IOD) of staining in the sections. To further confirm the differential expression of Ang-1 and Ang-2 between cystic and solid HBs, an additional 9 frozen specimens from 5 cyst-associated and 4 solid solitary HBs were collected for Western blot analysis. Clinical histories and radiological records of the patients were reviewed retrospectively.\nCompared to normal cerebellum tissue, Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 were prominently overexpressed in both the stromal cells and endothelial cells of CNS HBs. The expression of Ang-2 and the ratio of Ang-2/Ang-1 in the cystic group were significantly higher than those in the solid group. The intensity of Ang-2 expression in the cystic group was negatively correlated with age. There was no correlation between the expression level of the proteins and sex, tumor location, tumor volume or cyst volume.\nAng/Tie signaling is upregulated in HBs and is likely associated with the process of intense vascularization and cyst formation. Higher Ang-2 levels and a higher Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio may contribute to cyst formation by increasing the vascular permeability. The decrease in Ang-2 expression with advanced age in cystic-associated HBs may be associated with the reduced growth rate of peritumoral cysts among elderly patients.

Inclusion criteria were patients with bone defects secondary to septic non-union, chronic osteomyelitis and acute fracture with bone loss. Pathological fractures with bone loss were excluded. Data collection included patient demographics, pathology, previous surgical intervention, size of bone defect, type of graft implanted, time-to-union and complications/reinterventions. The minimum time of follow up was 12 months. Forty-three patients (32 males) met the inclusion criteria with a mean age of 47.9 years (range 18-80 years). 22 patients had an acute traumatic bone loss associated with open fracture and 21 presented with an infected non-union or underlying osteomyelitis requiring bone excision. The most common microorganisms grown were staphylcoccous aureus and coagulase negative staphylococcous. The mean length of the bone defect area was 4.2 cm (range 2-12 cm). All patients were managed with the two stage technique receiving composited grafting (Autologous bone graft (Iliac crest/RIA), graft expander as required, osteoprogenitor cells, growth factor) during the second stage. There was one failure (humeral infected non-union) in a previous background of bone radiation that necessitated reconstruction with a free fibula vascularized graft. One patient had a fall and sustained implant failure (humeral defect) 3 months after reconstruction and following re-plating progressed to union 4 months later. Two patients required re-grafting due to failure of healing in one of the defect sides. One patient presented with a discharging sinus 2 years after successful healing of a tibial defect that was treated successfully with soft tissue and bone debridement without necessitating further interventions. One patient despite union (distal 1/3 tibia) underwent a below knee amputation due to a dysfunctional ankle/foot (previous foot compartment syndrome-regional pain syndrome). Of those patients, with lower limb injuries, 4 patients had leg length discrepancies of 1 cm, 1.5 cm, 2 cm (two patients) respectively. The mean time to radiological union was 5.4 months (range 2-12 months). The average time of healing of 1 cm bone defect was 1.24 months. Patients with upper limb reconstruction recovered earlier than those with lower limb injuries. At the latest follow up all patients were able to mobilize full weight bearing without residual pain. The induced membrane technique appears to be an alternative good option for the management of large bone defects secondary to acute bone loss or infected non-unions.

The present study aimed to investigate changes in apelin levels, in postmenopausal breast cancer (BC) patients receiving aromatase inhibitors (AIs).\nForty early-stage postmenopausal BC patients treated with AIs with no history of chemotherapy administration were included in the study. At the beginning, we measured serum apelin levels in postmenopausal BC patients who were receiving AIs and healthy women of similar age and normal body mass index (BMI) (control group). We evaluated changes in the body composition, serum lipid profile and serum apelin levels at the beginning and the 12th month through anthropometric measurements and bioelectric impedance analysis.\nForty subjects with postmenopausal BC had a median age of 57 years (range 44-82)). BC patients exhibited significantly higher apelin levels and body mass index (BMI) scores compared to the control group (p=0.0001, p=0.0001, respectively). The 12th month's measurements indicated reduced apelin levels in 24 patients (60%) and increased apelin levels in 16 patients (40%) compared to the initial figures. With respect to the parameters, the patients with reduced apelin levels had significantly different waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and fat mass scores compared to those with higher apelin levels (p=0.008, p=0.047, respectively).\nThis study showed that postmenopausal BC patients had high levels of apelin and high BMI scores. This finding suggests that apelin promoted carcinogenesis particularly in obese individuals. The massive and metabolic changes observed in the fat tissues of the postmenopausal BC patients receiving AIs will especially affect the BC-associated outcome.", "journal": "Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology", "date": "2017-01-01", "authors": ["TarikSalman", "LeylaDemir", "UmutVarol", "MuratAkyol", "UtkuOflazoglu", "YasarYildiz", "HalilTaskaynatan", "HakanCengiz", "GuvenGuvendi", "YukselKucukzeybek", "AhmetAlacacioglu", "OktayTarhan"], "doi": null}

Multiple forms are described, resulting in various positional configurations of the small bowel and colon. Replaced common hepatic artery is a rare but not anecdotic variant of the standard hepatic vascularization, associated with surgical implications. Our aim is to explain the impact of their simultaneous presence during this procedure and the difficulty in identifying them preoperatively, despite imaging.\nThese two abnormalities were simultaneously observed in our patient who underwent a duodenopancreatectomy for an adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas.\nIn our case, intestinal malrotation and replaced common hepatic artery were discovered preoperatively. Malrotation made the dissection and kocherization more easier. Replaced common hepatic artery required a carefully skeletonized dissection, first posteriorly And then into the pancreatic parenchyma, before being partially resected and then primarily anastomosed.\nPreoperative imaging is crucial to define the lesion resectability, the proximity with the tumor, and also to identify these vascular anomalies and their relation with the pancreas parenchyma, in order to adjust the surgical strategy and preserve them, avoiding many complications (massive hepatic necrosis, chronic biliary ischemia, bleedings, etc.). In this context, angioscanner with 3D reconstruction is considered as a gold standard and should always be performed before a duodenopancreatectomy.", "journal": "Acta chirurgica Belgica", "date": "2016-12-31", "authors": ["AlexanderSchank", "PhilippeColonval", "Mikha\u00eblSalame"], "doi": "10.1080/00015458.2016.1272251"}
{"title": "An Alternative Posterosuperior Auricular Fascia Flap for Ear Elevation During Microtia Reconstruction.", "abstract": "Advances in staged total auricular reconstruction have resulted in improved anterior auricular appearance; however, satisfactory postreconstruction esthetics of the retroauricular fold remain challenging. The postauricular appearance of the reconstructed ear depends largely upon optimizing the covering material. When used as the covering soft tissue for ear elevation, a flap containing primarily the upper portion of the retroauricular fascia has potential advantages over the conventional book cover-type retroauricular fascia flap.\nWe developed a geometrically designed, posterosuperior auricular fascia flap to replace the conventional retroauricular fascia flap for ear elevation. During the second-stage operation, the posterosuperior auricular fascia flap is rotated downward and turned over to wrap around the inner strut and entire posterior auricular surface.\nCompared to the conventional book cover-type retroauricular fascia flap, the novel posterosuperior auricular fascia flap was easier to harvest and the operative time significantly decreased (110.3 vs. 121.5\u00a0min, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The modified flap produced a thin and natural contour of the postauricular surface, as well as reduced the incidence of postauricular hypertrophic scarring (from 24.7 to 13.2%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and partial skin graft necrosis (from 43.4 to 31.2%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).\nThe geometrically designed posterosuperior auricular fascia flap improves ear elevation. Compared to the conventional book cover-type retroauricular fascia flap, this covering tissue is easier to perform so the surgical time is decreased. It was highly vascularized, well defined, thinner, and yields reliable results. Thus, favorable postauricular surface results can be achieved during auricular reconstruction by using the modified fascia flap.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each submission to which Evidence-Based Medicine rankings are applicable.

{"title": "The Involvement of Pial Microvessels in Leukocyte Invasion after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.", "abstract": "The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are not well understood, but likely involve neuroinflammation. Here the controlled cortical impact model of mTBI in rats was used to test this hypothesis. Mild TBI caused a rapid (within 6 h post-mTBI) upregulation of synthesis of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, followed by an increase in production of neutrophil (CXCL1-3) and monocyte (CCL2) chemoattractants. While astrocytes were not a significant source of CXC chemokines, they highly expressed CCL2. An increase in production of CXC chemokines coincided with the influx of neutrophils into the injured brain. At 6 h post-mTBI, we observed a robust influx of CCL2-expressing neutrophils across pial microvessels into the subarachnoid space (SAS) near the injury site. Mild TBI was not accompanied by any significant influx of neutrophils into the brain parenchyma until 24 h after injury. This was associated with an early induction of expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on the endothelium of the ipsilateral pial, but not intraparenchymal, microvessels. At 6 h post-mTBI, we also observed a robust influx of neutrophils into the ipsilateral cistern of velum interpositum (CVI), a slit-shaped cerebrospinal fluid space located above the 3rd ventricle with highly vascularized pia mater. From SAS and CVI, neutrophils appeared to move along the perivascular spaces to enter the brain parenchyma. The monocyte influx was not observed until 24 h post-mTBI, and these inflammatory cells predominantly entered the ipsilateral SAS and CVI, with a limited invasion of brain parenchyma. These observations indicate that the endothelium of pial microvessels responds to injury differently than that of intraparenchymal microvessels, which may be associated with the lack of astrocytic ensheathment of cerebrovascular endothelium in pial microvessels. These findings also suggest that neuroinflammation represents the potential therapeutic target in mTBI.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-12-29", "authors": ["JoannaSzmydynger-Chodobska", "RongziShan", "NicoleThomasian", "AdamChodobski"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0167677\n10.1542/peds.2008-1056\n10.1136/jnnp-2011-300767\n10.1017/S1355617712000872\n10.1089/neu.2014.3555\n10.1089/neu.2014.3811\n10.1089/neu.2012.2650\n10.1089/neu.2012.2437\n10.1016/j.brainres.2008.02.057\n10.1016/j.nbd.2010.06.015\n10.1038/jcbfm.2009.262\n10.1186/1742-2094-9-17\n10.1089/neu.2012.2408\n10.1089/hyb.1997.16.249\n10.1089/neu.2010.1331\n10.1038/jcbfm.2009.71\n10.1089/neu.2012.2349\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-012110-142250\n10.1089/neu.2010.1310\n10.1371/journal.pone.0076904\n10.1016/S0076-6879(09)05409-3\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2015.06.016\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0002099\n10.1016/j.jneuroim.2005.11.020\n10.1016/j.jneuroim.2014.12.009\n10.1038/nri3908\n10.1172/JCI114175\n10.1038/nature08478\n10.1242/jcs.037127\n10.1038/onc.2011.498"}

Allogeneic skin grafts are performed on patients with extensive burn injuries after escharotomy, tangential excisions and deep debridement for the purpose of stabilizing the general condition and reducing the scope of local complications.\nThe aim of this paper is to determine how the use of allografts improves the conditions for the intake of autografts in burns treatment, and how it accelerates wound healing in comparison to the autografts-only option.\nIn 2012-2013, allogeneic skin was grafted on 46 patients, and in 8 cases grafting was repeated several times. An autologous split-thickness skin graft was applied to 32 patients. The analysis included the relationship between the duration of hospitalization and the number of skin transplantations, the relationship between the time of admission to debridement of the necrotic tissues and the total duration of hospitalization. Statistical analysis encompassed also pain assessment.\nThe results suggest that multiple applications of autografts not only do not lead to quicker recovery, but even lengthen the hospitalization time. The dependency is visible also in the patients who underwent the skin grafting procedure in allogeneic and autologous systems twice or more. There was a statistical significant difference between the duration of hospitalization in groups of patients who underwent STSG preceded by allogeneic skin graft transplantation when compared to the group of patients who underwent allogeneic skin application (p < 0.05) and the group of patients who were grafted with autologous skin (p < 0.05).\nAllogeneic skin grafts are a perfect dressing when wound vascularization is insufficient to take free split-thickness skin graft. In patients with comparable burn surface areas, multiple applications of free autologous split-thickness skin grafts (STSG) extend the hospitalization time in comparison to application of allogeneic skin dressing as the first-line therapy.", "journal": "Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University", "date": "2016-12-29", "authors": ["DianaKitala", "MarekKawecki", "AgnieszkaKlama-Bary\u0142a", "Wojciech\u0141abu\u015b", "Ma\u0142gorzataKraut", "JustynaGlik", "IreneuszRyszkiel", "Marek PKawecki", "MariuszNowak"], "doi": "10.17219/acem/61961"}

To promote wound healing, a bioactive wound dressing is required. In this study, a functionalized silk fibroin dressing with topical bioactive insulin release was prepared for the treatment of chronic wounds. For this purpose, insulin-encapsulated silk fibroin (SF) microparticles were prepared by coaxial electrospraying of aqueous SF solution under mild processing conditions. Insulin was successfully encapsulated in the inner layer of SF microparticles, providing a sustained insulin release for up to 28days. It was found that the insulin released from the microparticles could maintain original molecular conformation. Moreover, the cell migration assay based on human keratinocyte and endothelial cells confirmed that the insulin released from SF microparticles retained its native bioactivity. Furthermore, the insulin-encapsulated microparticles were loaded into a SF sponge, functioned as a bioactive wound dressing, and the in vivo therapeutic effect of the sponge dressing was evaluated on dorsal full thickness wounds of diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats. The results showed that an insulin-functionalized SF dressing accelerated wound closure, collagen deposition and vascularization, thus, significantly promoting wound healing.

{"title": "Differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells from human amniotic fluid to vascular endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction is a principle feature of vascular-related disease. Endothelial cells have been acquired for the purposes of the restoration of damaged tissue in therapeutic angiogenesis. However, their use is limited by expansion capacity and the small amount of cells that are obtained. Human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (hAF-MSCs) are considered an important source for vascular tissue engineering. In this study, hAF-MSCs were characterized and then induced in order to differentiate into the endothelial-like cells. Human amniotic fluid cells (hAFCs) were obtained from amniocentesis at the second trimester of gestation. The cells were characterized as mesenchymal stem cells by flow cytometry. The results showed that the cells were positive for mesenchymal stem cell markers CD44, CD73, CD90 and HLA-ABC, and negative for CD31, Amniotic fluid stem cells marker: CD117, anti-human fibroblasts, HLA-DR and hematopoietic differentiation markers CD34 and CD45. The hAF-MSCs were differentiated into endothelial cells under the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and analyzed for the expression of the endothelial-specific markers and function. The expression of the endothelial-specific markers was determined by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), while immunofluorescent analysis demonstrated that the induced hAF-MSCs expressed von Willebrand factor (vWF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), CD31 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The network formation assay showed that the induced hAF-MSCs formed partial networks. All results indicated that hAF-MSCs have the potential to be differentiated into endothelial-like cells, while human amniotic fluid might be a suitable source of MSCs for vascularized tissue engineering.", "journal": "Acta histochemica", "date": "2016-12-27", "authors": ["WaleephanTancharoen", "SirindaAungsuchawan", "PeraphanPothacharoen", "RunchanaMarkmee", "SuteeraNarakornsak", "JunjiraKieodee", "NonglakBoonma", "WitoonTasuya"], "doi": "10.1016/j.acthis.2016.11.009"}
{"title": "Pathognomonic remodeling of blood and lymphatic capillaries in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.", "abstract": "Numerous studies have been published investigating the pathologic alterations in various interstitial pneumonias, particularly in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the few existing studies on capillary remodeling, which does not seem to have priority for pathologic diagnosis, are contradictory, with some reporting increased and others reduced vascularization. We hypothesized that these discrepancies were due to the temporal heterogeneity of the lesions in IPF. We subsequently developed original techniques for evaluating vascular density within the alveolar septa and discovered, for the first time, a heterogeneous increase in alveolar capillaries in the lungs of IPF patients. Notably, we consistently found that the fibrotic lesions in IPF lungs, which are composed mainly of dense collagen with myofibroblasts, featured a reduction in capillaries. This finding provides a plausible explanation for the intractability of IPF, as this reduced vascularization would result in poor delivery of anti-fibrotic agents to these lesions. We also reported the disappearance of subpleural and interlobular lymphatics in IPF lungs, which likely results in poor alveolar clearance in the diseased lungs. Finally, we assessed the autopsied lungs of patients with IPF who died because of acute exacerbation and observed increased and dilated alveolar capillaries. These capillaries are likely to be \"leaky\" owing to exposure to VEGF produced by regenerated alveolar type II epithelial cells. Furthermore, poor alveolar clearance may prolong the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)-induced lung injury in acute exacerbation of IPF. Our data obtained from the assessment of blood and lymphatic capillary alterations in IPF provide novel pathogenetic insights and may provide the basis for new therapeutic strategies targeting IPF.", "journal": "Respiratory investigation", "date": "2016-12-26", "authors": ["MasahitoEbina"], "doi": "10.1016/j.resinv.2016.08.005"}

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a localized treatment based on the light activation of a photosensitizer (PS) in the presence of oxygen, which results in the formation of cytotoxic species. The delivery of fractionated light may enhance treatment efficacy by reoxygenating tissues.\nTo evaluate the efficiency of two light-fractionation schemes using immunohistological data.\nHuman U87 cells were grafted into the right putamen of 39 nude rats. After PS precursor intake (5-ALA), an optic fiber was introduced into the tumor. The rats were randomly divided into three groups: without light, with light split into 2 fractions and with light split into 5 fractions. Treatment effects were assessed using brain immunohistology.\nFractionated treatments induced intratumoral necrosis (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and peritumoral edema (P\u2009=\u20090.009) associated with a macrophagic infiltration (P\u2009=\u20090.006).

Peripheral vascularization increased after treatment (P\u2009=\u20090.017), and these likely new vessels were more frequently observed in the 5-fraction group (P\u2009=\u20090.028).\nInterstitial PDT with fractionated light resulted in specific tumoral lesions.

EPM was estimated from the pathologic specimen by subtracting the tumor mass from the specimen mass, with both calculated using the elliptical formula. Vascularized parenchymal mass preserved was measured from computed tomography scans obtained <2 months prior and 3-12 months after surgery. All functional analyses were required to be within the same time frames, and patients with a contralateral kidney were also required to have nuclear renal scans.\nThe median tumor size was 3.5\u2009cm and the median R.E.N.A.L. was 7.

In this context, in vivo characterization of the blood-brain-barrier and tumor vascularization may be important for individual prognosis and therapy optimization.\nWe analyzed perfusion and capillary permeability of C6-gliomas in rats at different stages of tumor-growth by contrast enhanced MRI and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI at 7 Tesla. The analyses included maps of relative cerebral blood volume (CBV) and signal recovery derived from DSC data over a time period of up to 35 days after tumor cell injections.\nIn all rats tumor progression was accompanied by temporal and spatial changes in CBV and capillary permeability. A leakage of the blood-brain barrier (slow contrast enhancement) was observed as soon as the tumor became detectable on T2-weighted images. Interestingly, areas of strong capillary permeability (fast signal enhancement) were predominantly localized in the center of the tumor. In contrast, the tumor rim was dominated by an increased CBV and showed the highest vessel density compared to the tumor center and the contralateral hemisphere as confirmed by histology.\nSubstantial regional differences in the tumor highlight the importance of parameter maps in contrast or in addition to region-of-interest analyses. The data vividly illustrate how MRI including contrast-enhanced and DSC-MRI may contribute to a better understanding of tumor development.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-12-23", "authors": ["MonikaHuhndorf", "AmirMoussavi", "NadineKramann", "OlgaWill", "KirstenHattermann", "ChristineStadelmann", "OlavJansen", "SusannBoretius"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0168174\n10.1056/NEJMoa043330\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07177.x\n10.2214/ajr.179.3.1790783\n10.1007/s00234-010-0770-x\n10.1002/nbm.2940\n10.1177/1971400915611916\n10.1007/s11060-013-1161-z\n10.1080/02841850802616752\n10.3174/ajnr.A2441\n10.3174/ajnr.A0484\n10.1007/s11547-015-0511-7\n10.1007/s11060-009-9875-7\n10.1007/s00441-002-0651-7\n10.1016/j.acra.2005.01.024\n10.1002/nbm.2918\n10.1148/radiology.176.1.2353094\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.08.051\n10.1002/mrm.10446\n10.1007/s11060-014-1639-3\n10.1038/359843a0\n10.1007/s11864-014-0308-2\n10.1146/annurev.pathol.1.110304.100043\n10.1179/1743132812Y.0000000105\n10.1148/radiol.2223010558\n10.1016/j.clinimag.2012.02.016\n10.1200/JCO.2009.26.3541"}

The contributions of ARNT in pancreas, liver and adipose tissue to energy balance through gene regulation have been described. Surprisingly, the impact of ARNT signaling in the skeletal muscles, one of the major organs involved in glucose disposal, has not been investigated, especially in type II diabetes. Here we report that ARNT is expressed in the skeletal muscles, particularly in the energy-efficient oxidative slow-twitch myofibers, which are characterized by increased oxidative capacity, mitochondrial content, vascular supply and insulin sensitivity. However, muscle-specific deletion of ARNT did not change myofiber type distribution, oxidative capacity, mitochondrial content, capillarity, or the expression of genes associated with these features. Consequently, the lack of ARNT in the skeletal muscle did not affect weight gain, lean/fat mass, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in lean mice, nor did it impact insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in high fat diet-induced obesity. Therefore, skeletal muscle ARNT is dispensable for controlling muscle fiber type and metabolic regulation, as well as diet-induced weight control, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-12-23", "authors": ["Pierre-MarieBadin", "Danesh HSopariwala", "SabinaLorca", "Vihang ANarkar"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0168457\n10.2119/molmed.2014.00032\n10.1038/386403a0\n10.1182/blood-2014-10-607267\n10.1007/s10456-012-9269-x\n10.1172/JCI76737\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.05.027\n10.1172/JCI35846\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098435\n10.1371/journal.pone.0077419\n10.2337/db11-0174\n10.1016/j.cmet.2011.08.006\n10.1016/j.cmet.2009.04.001\n10.2337/db14-0277\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0020288\n10.1073/pnas.1016089107\n10.1210/mend.14.10.0533\n10.1210/en.2012-2029\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.266478\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.06.040\n10.1139/h2012-051\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.062\n10.1038/srep26442\n10.2337/db14-0590\n10.1093/gerona/gls194\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.006\n10.2337/db07-0093\n10.1038/sj.ijo.0801844\n10.1007/s10456-012-9315-8\n10.1113/EP085318\n10.1096/fj.05-3720fje\n10.1073/pnas.0910561106\n10.1016/j.mvr.2010.09.008\n10.1113/jphysiol.2004.069757\n10.1111/eci.12333\n10.1016/j.jvs.2013.04.043\n10.1242/dev.123026"}

{"title": "Management of Zygomatic Fractures in Young Patients: Technical Modifications for Aesthetic and Functional Results.", "abstract": "The zygomaticomaxillary complex is very vulnerable to injury because of its intrinsically prominent convexity. There are 2 different surgical approaches for the therapy of these fractures: closed reduction and open reduction. In the open reduction 2 or 3 fixation points with related incisions are usually necessary in dislocated fractures: osteosynthesis must be performed starting from zygomaticofrontal suture when dislocated at this site, followed by zygomatic body fixation on the anterior sinus wall, anterior orbital floor margin fixation, and finally orbital floor reconstruction in case of eye globe dislocation with diplopia.\nThis study evaluated the combination of the transconjunctival (TC) approach without canthotomy in association with the transoral maxillary approach and lateral rim skin incision (SI) without canthotomy for frontozygomatic dislocated fractures to achieve proper reduction and stabilization without any aesthetic decay in young patients. A less invasive and more aesthetic technique is shown for treating dislocated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures with 2 or 3 fixation points and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) use to promote tissue healing.\nTen patients (mean age: 32) were referred for dislocated zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture. Five patients were treated by TC approach without canthotomy in association with the transoral maxillary approach and, when needed, eyebrow SI without canthotomy for frontozygomatic dislocated fractures (group 1). Five more patients were treated by traditional subciliar incision at lower eyelid and vertical lateral incision at lateral margin of the orbit (group 2). Autologous PRF for orbital floor reconstruction was used. The follow-up period was 6 months long. Follow-up radiographs (TC) and photos were routinely used to evaluate the adequacy of reduction and lower eyelid right position or retraction.\nAll cases were successful; there were no problems at surgery and postoperative time. During the 6-month follow-up, all 5 patients of group 1 showed satisfactory facial symmetry, no noticeable scarring, no ectropion or lower eyelid significant droop, and no functional impairment. Mean difference for lower eyelid droop between the 2 groups of patients was 1.4\u200amm at T1 and 1.2\u200amm at T2.\nAesthetic result is a priority in the treatment planning of orbitozygomatic fractures because of the fundamental role of the eye and lid area in the aesthetic of the face. In our experience best aesthetic results were achieved through a latero cantal horizontal SI combined to a vertical periosteal incision at the frontozygomatic rim without canthotomy, thus performing a different double-layer incision. In the patients with large orbital floor dislocation, reconstructive titanium mesh was covered by autologous PRF membranes, which can improve the vascularization of the surgical site, by promoting neoangiogenesis.\nIn young patients these techniques are indicated because of the need of better aesthetic results that can be achieved by preventing postoperative functional impairment with lower eyelid droop and unnatural aesthetic asymmetry of the 2 lower lids.

The authors describe a staged technique utilizing free muscle transfer, tissue expansion, and custom polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants for the management of previously failed cranioplasty sites in patients with complicating local factors.\nConsecutive patients with previously failed cranioplasties following large decompressive craniectomies underwent reconstruction of skull and soft tissue defects with staged free latissimus muscle transfer, tissue expansion, and placement of custom computer-aided design and modeling PEEK implants with a 'temporalis-plus' modification to minimize temporal hollowing. Implants were placed in a vascularized pocket at the third stage by elevating a plane between the previously transferred latissimus superficial fascia (left on the skin) and muscle (left on the dura/bone). Patients were evaluated postoperatively for cranioplasty durability, aesthetic outcome, and complications.\nSix patients with an average of 1.6 previously failed cranioplasties underwent this staged technique. Average age was 33 years. Average defect size was 139 cm. Average time to procedure series completion was 14.9 months. There were no flap failures. One patient had early postoperative incisional dehiscence following PEEK implant placement that was managed by immediate scalp flap readvancement. At 21.9 month average follow-up, there were no cranioplasty failures. Three patients (50%) underwent 4 subsequent refining outpatient procedures.

{"title": "Vein graft disease in a knockout mouse model of hyperhomocysteinaemia.", "abstract": "A major reason for vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting is neointimal hyperplasia and thrombosis. Elevated serum levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, but homocysteine levels also tend to increase during the first weeks or months after cardiac surgery. To investigate this further, C57BL/6J mice (WT) and cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygous knockout mice (CBS+/-), a mouse model for hyperhomocysteinaemia, underwent interposition of the vena cava of donor mice into the carotid artery of recipient mice. Two experimental groups were examined: 20 mice of each group underwent bypass surgery (group 1: WT donor and WT recipient; group 2: CBS+/- donor and CBS+/- recipient). After 4\u00a0weeks, the veins were harvested, dehydrated, paraffin-embedded, stained and analysed by histomorphology and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, serum Hcy levels in CBS knockout animals and in WT animals before and after bypass surgery were measured. At 4\u00a0weeks postoperatively, group 2 mice showed a higher percentage of thrombosis compared to controls, a threefold increase in neointima formation, higher general vascularization, a lower percentage of elastic fibres with shortage and fragmentation in the neointima, a lower percentage of acid mucopolysaccharides in the neointima and a more intense fibrosis in the neointima and media. In conclusion, hyperhomocysteinaemic cystathionine-beta-synthase knockout mice can play an important role in the study of mechanisms of vein graft failure.

We sought to learn how an abnormal concentration of iodide within thyrocyte can have significant effects on the thyroid, specifically the surrounding vascular network. Insufficient levels of iodide can lead to increased expression or activity of several pathways, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The VEGF protein fuel vessel growth (angiogenesis) and therefore enhances the nutrients available to surrounding cells. Alternatively, normal/surplus iodide levels can have inhibitory effects on angiogenesis. Varying levels of iodide in the thyroid can influence thyroid carcinoma cell proliferation and angiogenesis via regulation of the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and VEGF-dependent pathway.

{"title": "Targeting bacterial adherence inhibits multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection following burn injury.", "abstract": "Classical antimicrobial drugs target proliferation and therefore place microbes under extreme selective pressure to evolve resistance. Alternative drugs that target bacterial virulence without impacting survival directly offer an attractive solution to this problem, but to date few such molecules have been discovered. We previously discovered a widespread group of bacterial adhesins, termed Multivalent Adhesion Molecules (MAMs) that are essential for initial binding of bacteria to host tissues and virulence. Thus, targeting MAM-based adherence is a promising strategy for displacing pathogens from host tissues and inhibiting infection. Here, we show that topical application of polymeric microbeads functionalized with the adhesin MAM7 to a burn infected with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa substantially decreased bacterial loads in the wound and prevented the spread of the infection into adjacent tissues. As a consequence, the application of this adhesion inhibitor allowed for vascularization and wound healing, and maintained local and systemic inflammatory responses to the burn. We propose that MAM7-functionalized microbeads can be used as a topical treatment, to reduce bacterial attachment and hence prevent bacterial colonization and infection of wounds.

{"title": "A multilevel framework to reconstruct anatomical 3D models of the hepatic vasculature in rat livers.", "abstract": "The intricate (micro)vascular architecture of the liver has not yet been fully unravelled. Although current models are often idealized simplifications of the complex anatomical reality, correct morphological information is instrumental for scientific and clinical purposes. Previously, both vascular corrosion casting (VCC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) have been separately used to study the hepatic vasculature. Nevertheless, these techniques still face a number of challenges such as dual casting in VCC and limited imaging depths for IHC. We have optimized both techniques and combined their complementary strengths to develop a framework for multilevel reconstruction of the hepatic circulation in the rat. The VCC and micro-CT scanning protocol was improved by enabling dual casting, optimizing the contrast agent concentration, and adjusting the viscosity of the resin (PU4ii). IHC was improved with an optimized clearing technique (CUBIC) that extended the imaging depth for confocal microscopy more than five-fold. Using in-house developed software (DeLiver), the vascular network - in both VCC and IHC datasets - was automatically segmented and/or morphologically analysed. Our methodological framework allows 3D reconstruction and quantification of the hepatic circulation, ranging from the major blood vessels down to the intertwined and interconnected sinusoids.

{"title": "Is There Benefit to Free Over Pedicled Vascularized Grafts in Augmenting Tibial Intercalary Allograft Constructs?", "abstract": "Intercalary reconstruction of tibial sarcomas with vascularized fibula autografts and massive bone allografts is reliable with predictable long-term results. However, inadequate data exist comparing free and pedicled vascularized fibula autografts in combination with a massive bone allograft in patients undergoing intercalary tibia reconstructions.\nAmong patients undergoing large-segment intercalary allografting, we sought to compare supplemental free vascularized fibular autografts with supplemental pedicled vascularized fibular autografts, in terms of (1) oncologic results, (2) complications associated with surgery, (3) Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scores, and (4) surgical time.\nBetween 1994 and 2013, we treated 320 patients, younger than 40 years, with tibial sarcomas. Thirty-five patients (11%) underwent amputations. One hundred ninety-five patients (61%) were treated with intraarticular resection of the tibia, which constituted 104 tumor endoprostheses, 63 proximal tibia allograft prosthetic composites, 21 osteoarticular allografts, and seven arthrodeses with allografts. Ninety patients (28%) underwent joint-sparing intercalary reconstruction. Forty-one (13%) of these 90 patients were treated with allografts alone, two (1%) with vascularized fibula grafts, and 47 (15%) with intercalary allografts supplemented by autografts (free fibular autografts, 22 patients, 7%; pedicled fibular autografts, 25 patients, 8%). During the study period, we used free vascularized fibular autografts in association with massive bone allograft for a resection longer than 12 cm with a very small periarticular residual segment. The choice for using a pedicled fibula harvested in the ipsilateral leg initially was for patients having only diaphyseal resections and the indication was later extended to intraepiphyseal osteotomies with a small periarticular residual segment. The goals of this study are to present the long-term results in this group of patients and compare their results based on the type of vascularized fibula harvest. There were 33 male and 14 female patients with mean age of 14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 years. The median followup was 84 months (range, 7-231 months). No patients were lost to followup before 1 year. Four patients died and were not available for followup after 18 months. The mean tibia resection length was 15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 cm and mean length of the harvested vascularized fibula was 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 cm.\nOverall 5- and 10-year oncologic survival rates in this study were 87% \u00b1 5% and 83% \u00b1 6% respectively. With the numbers available, we observed no difference in survivorship free from death from disease between the study groups (85% \u00b1 8% [95% CI, 174-232 months] of the free vascularized group versus 82% \u00b1 8% [95% CI, 148-206 months] of the pedicled fibula graft group; p = 0.741). At last followup, 40 patients had no evidence of disease and seven had died of disease. Local recurrence was observed in two patients in the supplemental free vascularized fibula group and three patients in the supplemental pedicled vascularized fibula group, whereas metastases was observed in eight patients. With the numbers available, we observed no difference in the proportion of patients experiencing surgical complications between those treated with free vascularized fibula grafts and those treated with pedicled grafts (eight of 22 [36%] versus nine of 25 [36%] respectively; p = 0.605). With the numbers available, we observed no difference in mean MSTS scores between patients treated with free vascularized fibula grafts and those treated with pedicled grafts (24 \u00b1 9 versus 25 \u00b1 8; mean difference, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.54-4.6; p = 0.858). Mean surgical time was longer in the free vascularized fibula and massive bone allograft group at 9.4 \u00b1 1.7 hours compared with that of the pedicled vascularized fibula and massive bone allograft group at 5.7 \u00b1 1.3 hours (mean difference, 3.73 hours; 95% CI, 2.8-4.6 hours; p \u2264 0.001).\nIntercalary reconstruction of tibia sarcomas with massive bone allografts supplemented with vascularized fibula grafts provide predictable results. Complications occur as expected in a biologic reconstruction, but are salvageable, preserving the original construct. The pedicled fibula can be an alternative to a free contralateral fibula for intraepiphyseal resections. Comparative technical ease, shorter surgical time, avoidance of additional microvascular anastomosis, and avoidance of surgery on the contralateral leg are notable advantages of pedicled vascularized fibula over free fibula grafts to supplement allografts when indicated in intercalary tibia resections.\nLevel III, therapeutic study.", "journal": "Clinical orthopaedics and related research", "date": "2016-12-21", "authors": ["MarcoManfrini", "SrimanthBindiganavile", "FerhatSay", "MarcoColangeli", "LauraCampanacci", "MassimilianoDepaolis", "MassimoCeruso", "DavideDonati"], "doi": "10.1007/s11999-016-5196-2\n10.1302/0301-620X.91B10.22212\n10.1302/0301-620X.81B6.10001\n10.1007/s00264-008-0700-2\n10.1016/j.injury.2013.10.012\n10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181fa7981\n10.1055/s-2001-16597\n10.1016/j.injury.2008.05.014\n10.1097/01.prs.0000189203.38204.d5\n10.1200/JCO.2011.38.4420\n10.1093/annonc/mdq573\n10.1302/0301-620X.94B6.28680\n10.1016/j.ejso.2007.11.010\n10.1155/S1357714X00000050\n10.1002/micr.20668\n10.1016/j.otsr.2010.02.003\n10.1002/jso.21620\n10.1055/s-0030-1267381\n10.2214/ajr.182.4.1820963\n10.1097/01.prs.0000227682.71527.2b\n10.1155/2004/483247\n10.3109/17453679708996706\n10.1302/0301-620X.91B2.21272\n10.2106/00004623-199311000-00011"}

Accordingly, resistive index (RI) on spectral Doppler (sD) US provides a quantitative analysis of vascular inflammation, but its utility in the evaluation of RA activity has not been established. Our objective was to determine the association of RI with other US parameters of synovitis and with clinical disease activity in established RA. Patients with positive power Doppler (pD) were included in a prospective cross-sectional study. Disease activity and disability were evaluated using the Disease Activity Score in 28-joints (DAS28) and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), respectively. Gray scale (GS) synovitis, pD, and sD analyses were performed by one of two examiners in wrists and the second and third metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints.

A nasoseptal flap (NSF) is a vascularized graft that has greatly diminished the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak. Annealing of flaps against the ventral skull base can be tenuous within the first few days after surgery. We report the use of sphenoid sinus fat packing as a buttress to support the nasoseptal flap during skull base reconstruction.\nA 37-year-old man presented with pan-hypopituitarism, bitemporal hemianopsia, and imaging consistent with a craniopharyngioma. He underwent an endoscopic endonasal approach with resection of the planum and tuberculum sphenoidale for resection of this mass. An NSF was harvested, and a combination of suprasellar fat packing, tensor fasciae lata graft, and Porex plate along with the flap were used to reconstruct the skull base. Postoperatively, he precipitously experienced copious rhinorrhea necessitating surgical re-exploration. A redundant segment of the NSF had retracted into the sphenoid sinus, and was no longer supported against the ventral skull base. We repositioned the NSF and used sphenoid sinus fat packing to help support the graft against the ventral skull base. A postoperative computed tomographic scan demonstrated a clear delineation between the vascularized graft and the fat packing, confirming proper positioning of the flap.\nSphenoid sinus fat packing can be an important technical adjunct in bolstering the nasoseptal flap against the ventral skull base in the tenuous early perioperative period.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2016-12-21", "authors": ["HussamAbou-Al-Shaar", "Hasan AZaidi", "David JCote", "Edward RLaws"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2016.12.009"}

By reaching CRLM via their preferential arterial vascularization, hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy (HAIC) has demonstrated improvement in response rate and deepness of response. Improvement in deepness of response is potentially helpful to convert no surgical patient to surgery. Recent HAIC regimens, including HAIC-FUDR plus systemic oxaliplatin/irinotecan, or HAIC-oxaliplatin plus systemic 5FU and cetuximab yielded a 92% and 90% response rate respectively, and conversion to R0 surgery in 47% and 42% of patients, respectively. When HAIC delivered a drug ineffective through intravenous delivery, this rechallenge provided 62% response rate for HAIC. Nowadays, port-catheter implanted percutaneously by radiologists has 95% feasibility with primary patency equivalent to that of surgically implanted catheters, and secondary patency superior after radiologic revision. Retrospective studies demonstrated prolonged DFS of HAIC over IV chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting after surgery of CRLM.

We evaluate the pathogenicity of TLRs in RA myeloid cells, synovial tissue fibroblasts, T cells, osteoclast progenitor cells and endothelial cells. These observations establish that ligation of TLRs can transform RA myeloid cells into M1 macrophages and that the inflammatory factors secreted from M1 and RA synovial tissue fibroblasts participate in TH-17 cell development. From the investigations conducted in RA preclinical models, we conclude that TLR-mediated inflammation can result in osteoclastic bone erosion by interconnecting the myeloid and TH-17 cell response to joint vascularization.

Current approaches for the treatment of ACL injuries include surgical interventions and grafting, however recent reports show that surgeries have 94% recurrency, and that repaired tissues are biomechanically inferior to the native tissue. These necessitate the need for new strategies for scar-free repair/regeneration of ACL injuries. Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a biodegradable and biocompatible synthetic polymer, which has been widely used in the connective tissue repair/regeneration attempts. Here, we report on the synthesis of PCL via ring opening polymerization using \u03b5-caprolactone as the monomer, and ammonium heptamolybdate as a catalyst. The synthesized PCL was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. It was then processed using electrospinning to form nanofiber-based scaffolds. These scaffolds were characterized in terms of surface as well as mechanical properties, and compared to the properties of commercially available PCL, and of native ACL tissue harvested from sheep. In addition, scaffolds fabricated with synthesized PCL were evaluated regarding their cell attachment capacity using human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). Our findings demonstrated that the synthesized PCL is similar to its commercially available counterpart in terms of surface morphology and mechanical properties. In addition, fibrous scaffolds generated with electrospinning showed weaker mechanical properties visa vis native ACL tissue in terms of ultimate stress, and elastic modulus. Also, the synthesized PCL can accommodate cell attachment when tested with hBMSCs.

In this paper, space holder method was applied to synthesize diopside/forsterite composite scaffolds with different diopside content. During the sintering process, NaCl, as spacer agent, gradually evaporated from the system and produced desirable pore size in the scaffolds. The results showed that adding 10wt.% diopside to forsterite can enormously improve the bioactivity, biodegradability, and mechanical properties of the composite scaffolds.

{"title": "Polycaprolactone nanofibrous mesh reduces foreign body reaction and induces adipose flap expansion in tissue engineering chamber.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering chamber technique can be used to generate engineered adipose tissue, showing the potential for the reconstruction of soft tissue defects. However, the consequent foreign body reaction induced by the exogenous chamber implantation causes thick capsule formation on the surface of the adipose flap following capsule contracture, which may limit the internal tissue expansion. The nanotopographical property and architecture of nanofibrous scaffold may serve as a promising method for minimizing the foreign body reaction. Accordingly, electrospinning porous polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibrous mesh, a biocompatible synthetic polymer, was attached to the internal surface of the chamber for the reducing local foreign body reaction. Adipose flap volume, level of inflammation, collagen quantification, capsule thickness, and adipose tissue-specific gene expression in chamber after implantation were evaluated at different time points. The in vivo study revealed that the engineered adipose flaps in the PCL group had a structure similar to that in the controls and normal adipose tissue structure but with a larger flap volume. Interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 expression decreased significantly in the PCL group compared with the control. Moreover, the control group had much more collagen deposition and thicker capsule than that observed in the PCL group.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) of 3-25 disaccharides is known to be angiogenic due to its interaction with endothelial cell receptors. This effect has been explored with HA-based structures but a transitory response is observed due to HA burst biodegradation. Herein we developed gellan gum (GG)-HA spongy-like hydrogels from semi-interpenetrating network hydrogels with different HA amounts. Enzymatic degradation was more evident in the GG-HA with high HA amount due to their lower mechanical stability, also resulting from the degradation itself, which facilitated the access of the enzyme to the HA in the bulk. GG-HA spongy-like hydrogels hyaluronidase-mediated degradation lead to the release of HA oligosaccharides of different amounts and sizes in a HA content-dependent manner which promoted in vitro proliferation of human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) but not their migration. Although no effect was observed in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (hDMECs) in vitro, the implantation of GG-HA spongy-like hydrogels in an ischemic hind limb mice model promoted neovascularization in a material-dependent manner, consistent with the in vitro degradation profile. Overall, GG-HA spongy-like hydrogels with a sustained release of HA oligomers are valuable options to improve tissue vascularization, a critical issue in several applications in the tissue engineering and regenerative medicine field.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-12-15", "authors": ["Luc\u00edlia P daSilva", "Rog\u00e9rio PPirraco", "T\u00edrcia CSantos", "RamonNovoa-Carballal", "Mariana TCerqueira", "Rui LReis", "Vitor MCorrelo", "Alexandra PMarques"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b11684"}

A c.14576G>A polymorphism in RNF213 was identified in 95% of MMD patients with a family history and in 79% of sporadic cases, and patients carrying this polymorphism exhibited significantly earlier disease onset and a more-severe form of MMD. Due possibly to genetic differences, the prevalence of MMD is higher in East Asia (e.g., Korea and Japan) than in Western countries. The MMD prevalence peaks at two ages with different clinical presentations: around 10 years and at 30-45 years. Ischemic symptoms, including transient ischemic attacks, are the most important clinical manifestation in both children and adults. Intracranial hemorrhages are more frequent in adults than in children. Catheter angiography is a diagnostic method of choice. Magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography are noninvasive diagnostic methods. High-resolution vessel-wall magnetic resonance imaging also helps in diagnosing MMD by revealing concentric vessel-wall narrowing with basal collaterals. Surgical revascularization such as extracranial-intracranial bypass is the preferred procedure for MMD patients presenting with ischemic stroke.

In this study, we evaluated the potential protective effect of precedent GnRHa treatment before cryopreservation on freezing-thawing related follicular damages using a rat autoxenograft model. We have observed that GnRHa significantly increases the fraction of follicles with normal morphology, while presenting negnigible effect on the physiological recovery of the grafted follicular tissue, as demonstrated by the estrous cycle, folliculogenesis and post-autograft vascularization.

Histology of the wounds dressed with CMLA or Intrasite gel displayed a smaller scar width, required less time to heal and showed more collagen staining and fewer inflammatory cells in comparison to wounds dressed with the vehicle. Immunohistochemistry for Hsp70 and TGF-\u03b2 showed greater staining intensity in the treated groups compared to the vehicle group. Bax staining was less intense in treated groups compared to the vehicle group, suggesting that CMLA and Intrasite gel provoked apoptosis, responsible for the development of granulation tissue into a scar. CD31 protein analysis showed that the treated groups enhanced angiogenesis and increased vascularization compared to the control group. Furthermore, a significant increase in the levels of GPx and SOD and a decrease in MDA were also observed in the treated groups.

Seven patients underwent lymphovenous bypass in addition to LD VLNT. Limb volume and quality of life scores using the Lymphedema Life Impact Scale (LLIS) were analyzed for quantitative and qualitative assessment.\nMean duration of lymphedema was 69 months (range 24-124 months). Follow-up ranged from 3 to 12 months (mean 6.7 month). Major complications included one free flap loss and one reoperation for thrombosis. Mean preoperative volume differential between normal and affected limb was 35% (range 3-87%). Volume differential reduction was 48%, 28%, and 46% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively.

{"title": "A new algorithm for a better characterization and timing of the anti-VEGF vascular effect named \"normalization\".", "abstract": "Antiangiogenics are widely used in cancer treatment in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy for their vascular effects. Antiangiogenics are supposed to induce morphological and functional changes in the chaotic tumor vasculature that would help enhance the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy through the amelioration of the drug delivery or the oxygenation in the tumor, respectively. However, finding the best treatment sequence is not an easy task to achieve and no consensus has yet been established because of the lack of knowledge regarding when and for how long the vascular network is ameliorated. The aim of this work was to develop a dedicated image processing algorithm able to analyze the vascular structures on optical microscopy images of the vascular network and to follow its fine modifications in vivo, over time. We applied this algorithm to follow the evolution of the vascular parameters (vascularized tissue surface, branches, sprouts and length), in response or not to anti-VEGF therapy (10\u00a0mg/kg/day) and determine precisely whether there is really a vascular \"normalization\" with anti-VEGF therapy in comparison with the parameters extracted from healthy vascular networks. We found that for this determination, the choice of region of interest to analyze is critical as it is important to compare only microcirculation areas and avoid areas with arteriole-venule-capillary hierarchy. The algorithm analysis allowed us to define a vascular \"normalization\" in treated tumors, between 8 and 12\u00a0days of bevacizumab treatment that was confirmed by standard immunohistochemical analysis, microvascular permeability assessment and immunohistological blood perfusion assessment.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2016-12-13", "authors": ["KarimaEl Alaoui-Lasmaili", "El-HadiDjermoune", "Jean-BaptisteTylcz", "DominiqueMeng", "Fran\u00e7oisPl\u00e9nat", "No\u00e9mieThomas", "B\u00e9atriceFaivre"], "doi": "10.1007/s10456-016-9536-3"}

Here we describe an easy-to-implement strategy to chemically modify vascular ECM by covalently linking a collagen binding peptide (CBP) to heparin to form a heparin derivative (CBP-heparin) that selectively binds a subset of collagens. Modification of ECM with CBP-heparin leads to increased deposition of functional heparin (by \u223c7.2-fold measured by glycosaminoglycan composition) and a corresponding reduction in platelet binding (>70%) and whole blood clotting (>80%) onto the ECM. Furthermore, addition of CBP-heparin to the ECM stabilizes long-term endothelial cell attachment to the lumen of ECM-derived vascular conduits, potentially through recruitment of heparin-binding growth factors that ultimately improve the durability of endothelialization in vitro. Overall, our findings provide a simple yet effective method to increase deposition of functional heparin on the surface of ECM-based vascular grafts and thereby minimize thrombogenicity of decellularized tissue, overcoming a significant challenge in tissue engineering of bioartificial vessels and vascularized organs.", "journal": "Biomacromolecules", "date": "2016-12-13", "authors": ["BinJiang", "RachelSuen", "Jason AWertheim", "Guillermo AAmeer"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.biomac.6b01330"}

A recent clinical trial of sunitinib for treatment of recurrent Grade II and III meningiomas suggested potential efficacy in this population, but only 2 patients exhibited significant radiographic response with tumor volume reduction. The authors illustrate another such case and discuss a complication related to this dramatic tumor volume reduction in aggressive skull base meningiomas. The authors describe the case of a 39-year-old woman who had undergone repeat surgical interventions and courses of radiotherapy over the previous 11 years for recurrent cranial and spinal meningiomas. Despite 4 operations over the course of 4 years on her right petroclival meningioma with cavernous sinus and jugular fossa extensions, she had progressive neurological deficits and tumor recurrences. The specimen histology progressed from WHO Grade I initially to Grade II at the time of the third recurrence. The lesion was then irradiated 3 times using stereotactic radiosurgery for further recurrences. More recently, the tumor size increased rapidly on imaging, in association with progressive neurological symptoms arising from brainstem compression and vasogenic edema. Institution of sunitinib therapy yielded a dramatic radiographic response, with marked reduction in the tumor volume and reduction of brainstem vasogenic edema within a few weeks of initiation of treatment. The significant radiographic response of tumor in the clival region was also associated with CSF rhinorrhea from a dural breach created by resolution of the invasive skull base meningioma, which necessitated withholding the sunitinib medication. To address the leak, the authors undertook surgical exploration and transsphenoidal packing using an autologous fat graft and a vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap. The patient has done well during follow-up of 3 months after packing, with no evidence of recurrent CSF leak, and the medication was subsequently restarted. Prior clinical data and the dramatic radiographic response in this patient suggest that sunitinib holds promising therapeutic potential in carefully selected patients with recurrent atypical meningiomas where conventional strategies have been exhausted.

However, how Nogo-A affected the three-dimensional (3D) central nervous system (CNS) vascular network architecture remained unknown. Here, using vascular corrosion casting, hierarchical, synchrotron radiation \u03bcCT-based network imaging and computer-aided network analysis, we found that genetic ablation of Nogo-A significantly increased the three-dimensional vascular volume fraction in the postnatal day 10 (P10) mouse brain. More detailed analysis of the cerebral cortex revealed that this effect was mainly due to an increased number of capillaries and capillary branchpoints. Interestingly, other vascular parameters such as vessel diameter, -length, -tortuosity, and -volume were comparable between both genotypes for non-capillary vessels and capillaries. Taken together, our three-dimensional data showing more vessel segments and branchpoints at unchanged vessel morphology suggest that stimulated angiogenesis upon Nogo-A gene deletion results in the insertion of complete capillary micro-networks and not just single vessels into existing vascular networks.

The major cause of the failure of segmental tracheal defect reconstruction by TET is airway collapse caused by the chondromalacia of TET cartilage. The key to maintain the TET structure is the regeneration of chondrocytes in cartilage, which can secrete plenty of cartilage matrices. To address the problem of the chondromalacia of TET cartilage, this study proposed an improved strategy. We designed a new cell sheet scaffold using the poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) to make a porous membrane for seeding cells, and used the PLGA-PTMC cell-scaffold to pack the decellularized allogeneic trachea to construct a new type of TET. The TET was then implanted in the subcutaneous tissue for vascularization for 2 weeks. Orthotopic transplantation was then performed after implantation. The efficiency of the TET we designed was analyzed by histological examination and biomechanical analyses 4 weeks after surgery. Four weeks after surgery, both the number of chondrocytes and the amount of cartilage matrix were significantly higher than those contained in the traditional stem-cell-based TET.

Changes in ECM can alter tissue homeostasis, potentially leading to promotion of cellular transformation and the generation of tumors. Therefore, understanding ECM compositional changes during cancer progression is vital to the development of targeted treatments. Previous efforts to reproduce the native 3D cellular microenvironment have utilized protein gels and scaffolds that incompletely recapitulate the complexity of native tissues. Here, we address this problem by extracting and comparing ECM from normal human colon and colon tumor that had metastasized to liver. We found differences in protein composition and stiffness, and observed significant differences in vascular network formation and tumor growth in each of the reconstituted matrices, both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. We studied free/bound ratios of NADH in the tumor and endothelial cells using Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy as a surrogate for the metabolic state of the cells.

{"title": "The learning curve in endoscopic endonasal resection of craniopharyngiomas.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE There is a paucity of literature regarding the learning curve associated with performing endoscopic endonasal cranial base surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent a learning curve might exist for endoscopic endonasal resection in cases of craniopharyngiomas. METHODS A retrospective review was performed for all endoscopic endonasal craniopharyngioma resections performed at Thomas Jefferson University from 2005 to 2015. To assess for a learning curve effect, patients were divided into an early cohort (2005-2009, n = 20) and a late cohort (2010-2015, n = 23). Preoperative demographics, clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, extent of resection, complications, tumor control, and visual and endocrine outcomes were obtained. Categorical variables and continuous variables were compared using a 2-sided Fisher's exact test and t-test, respectively. RESULTS Only the index operation performed at the authors' institution was included. There were no statistically significant differences between early and late cohorts in terms of patient age, sex, presenting symptoms, history of surgical or radiation treatment, tumor size or consistency, hypothalamic involvement, or histological subtype. The rate of gross-total resection (GTR) increased over time from 20% to 65% (p = 0.005), and the rate of subtotal resection decreased over time from 40% to 13% (p = 0.078). Major neurological complications, including new hydrocephalus, meningitis, carotid artery injury, or stroke, occurred in 6 patients (15%) (8 complications) in the early cohort compared with only 1 (4%) in the late cohort (p = 0.037). CSF leak decreased from 40% to 4% (p = 0.007). Discharge to home increased from 64% to 95% (p = 0.024). Visual improvement was high in both cohorts (88% [early cohort] and 81% [late cohort]). Rate of postoperative panhypopituitarism and permanent diabetes insipidus both increased from 50% to 91% (p = 0.005) and 32% to 78% (p = 0.004), which correlated with a significant increase in intentional stalk sacrifice in the late cohort (from 0% to 70%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS High rates of near- or total resection and visual improvement can be achieved using an endoscopic endonasal approach for craniopharyngiomas. However, the authors did find evidence for a learning curve. After 20 cases, they found a significant decrease in major neurological complications and significant increases in the rates of GTR rate and discharge to home. Although there was a large decrease in the rate of postoperative CSF leak over time, this was largely attributable to the inclusion of very early cases prior to the routine use of vascularized nasoseptal flaps. There was a significant increase in new panhypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus, which is attributable to increase rates of intentional stalk sacrifice.", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "date": "2016-12-03", "authors": ["Varun RKshettry", "HyunwooDo", "KhaledElshazly", "Christopher JFarrell", "GurstonNyquist", "MarcRosen", "James JEvans"], "doi": "10.3171/2016.9.FOCUS16292"}
{"title": "Recovery of Chicken Growth Plate by Heat-Shock Protein 90 Inhibitors Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate and Apigenin in Thiram-Induced Tibial Dyschondroplasia.", "abstract": "Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) is an important tibiotarsal bone disorder characterized by an avascular and nonmineralized growth plate; it is attributed to abnormal differentiation of chondrocytes and causes lameness. Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a proangiogenic factor in animal tissues; however, its gene expression increases in cases of chicken TD. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and apigenin in thiram-induced TD birds; these substances were used because of their Hsp90 inhibitory activities. The histologic study of growth plates was carried out with hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the Hsp90 gene expression was examined by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR. Results showed that as compared to a control group, TD-affected birds displayed changes in chondrocyte differentiation, with lack of blood vessels, and an increased expression of Hsp90 was observed significantly (P < 0.05). However, on administering the EGCG and apigenin to TD-affected birds, the normal chondrocyte columnar organization was restored with vascularization and decreased Hsp90 expression activity (P < 0.05), which ultimately abrogated the lameness. Our results suggested that Hsp90 is the key factor in the development of TD, and EGCG and apigenin have a novel effect on Hsp90 inhibition properties, thus reducing the lameness and leg deformity in chicken broilers.", "journal": "Avian diseases", "date": "2016-12-03", "authors": ["Muhammad KashifIqbal", "JingyingLiu", "FazulNabi", "Mujeeb UrRehman", "HuiZhang", "Adnan HassanTahir", "JiakuiLi"], "doi": "10.1637/11425-041816-Reg"}
{"title": "Extensive Characterization and Comparison of Endothelial Cells Derived from Dermis and Adipose Tissue: Potential Use in Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Tissue-engineered constructs need to become quickly vascularized in order to ensure graft take. One way of achieving this is to incorporate endothelial cells (EC) into the construct. The adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction (adipose-SVF) might provide an alternative source for endothelial cells as adipose tissue can easily be obtained by liposuction. Since adipose-EC are now gaining more interest in tissue engineering, we aimed to extensively characterize endothelial cells from adipose tissue (adipose-EC) and compare them with endothelial cells from dermis (dermal-EC). The amount of endothelial cells before purification varied between 4-16% of the total stromal population. After MACS selection for CD31 positive cells, a >99% pure population of endothelial cells was obtained within two weeks of culture. Adipose- and dermal-EC expressed the typical endothelial markers PECAM-1, ICAM-1, Endoglin, VE-cadherin and VEGFR2 to a similar extent, with 80-99% of the cell population staining positive. With the exception of CXCR4, which was expressed on 29% of endothelial cells, all other chemokine receptors (CXCR1, 2, 3, and CCR2) were expressed on less than 5% of the endothelial cell populations. Adipose-EC proliferated similar to dermal-EC, but responded less to the mitogens bFGF and VEGF. A similar migration rate was found for both adipose-EC and dermal-EC in response to bFGF. Sprouting of adipose-EC and dermal-EC was induced by bFGF and VEGF in a 3D fibrin matrix. After stimulation of adipose-EC and dermal-EC with TNF-\u03b1 an increased secretion was seen for PDGF-BB, but not uPA, PAI-1 or Angiopoietin-2. Furthermore, secretion of cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, CCL2, CCL5, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL8 and CXCL10) was also upregulated by both adipose- and dermal-EC. The similar characteristics of adipose-EC compared to their dermal-derived counterpart make them particularly interesting for skin tissue engineering. In conclusion, we show here that adipose tissue provides for an excellent source of endothelial cells for tissue engineering purposes, since they are readily available, and easily isolated and amplified.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-12-03", "authors": ["Hanneke NMonsuur", "Ester MWeijers", "Frank BNiessen", "AmitGefen", "PieterKoolwijk", "SusanGibbs", "Lenie Jvan den Broek"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0167056\n10.2217/rme.09.77\n10.1155/2014/320123\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.08.014\n10.1111/wrr.12119\n10.2217/rme.13.74\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.02.049\n10.1111/j.1432-2277.2010.01182.x\n10.1016/j.burns.2014.05.013\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2006.07266.x\n10.1111/wrr.12171\n10.1016/j.addr.2011.01.005\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2008.0550\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2005.00790.x\n10.1096/fj.01-0868com\n10.1002/stem.445\n10.1007/s00383-015-3808-7\n10.1097/SCS.0000000000001470\n10.1002/term.454\n10.1038/jid.2008.405\n10.1111/j.1538-7836.2010.04096.x\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2011.07.014\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181b5a3f1\n10.1038/nrm1357\n10.1111/j.1365-2249.2003.02323.x\n10.1096/fj.99-0963com\n10.1006/cyto.1998.0465\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.07.030\n10.1371/journal.pone.0083901\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01545.x\n10.1101/gad.1725808\n10.1186/1756-8722-6-61\n10.1177/0192623310378866\n10.1038/nm0603-653"}

Control of hemorrhage, neurological, and survival outcomes were studied.\nBetween 2004 and 2014, 33 patients had 38 hemorrhagic events related to head and neck cancer that were managed with endovascular means. Of these, 23 were localized to the external carotid artery (ECA) branches and five localized to the ECA main trunk; nine were related to the common carotid artery (CCA) or internal carotid artery (ICA), and one event was related to the innominate artery. Seven events related to the CCA/ICA or innominate artery were managed with endovascular sacrifice, whereas three cases were managed with a flow-preserving approach (covered stent). Only one patient developed permanent hemiparesis. In two of the three cases where the flow-preserving approach was used, the covered stent eventually became exposed via the overlying soft tissue defect, and definitive management using carotid revascularization or resection was employed to prevent further hemorrhage. In cases of soft tissue necrosis, vascularized tissues were used to cover the great vessels as applicable.\nThe use of modern endovascular approaches for management of acute CBS yields optimal results and should be employed in a coordinated manner by the head and neck surgeon and the neurointerventionalist.\n4.

Unfortunately, care of retracted-degenerated injuries remains a challenge for orthopedic surgeons. Complication rates appear to increase when surgery is performed in chronic cases compared to those operated acutely. Multiple techniques for chronic reconstruction with the use of grafts have been described. Recently Morrey, from the Mayo Clinic, proposed a direct anatomic repair of retracted distal biceps tendon ruptures in extreme flexion (60\u00b0-90\u00b0) to avoid grafting.\nThe authors propose and describe a new surgical technique using the lacertus fibrosus (LF) as augmentation-elongation for retracted-degenerated distal biceps tendon tears. We present four cases with chronic ruptures with 2-year follow-up. The mean age was 45\u00a0years old (33-51), the time of surgery was 13\u00a0weeks (4-24) after the trauma, dominant arm was involved in two cases.\nThe mean MEPS was 95/100 at 2-year follow-up. With this technique we increase the length of the tendon up to 2.5\u00a0cm. The major complication in our study was transient sensitive radial nerve paresthesia. We did not have any hardware mobilization or muscular herniation.\nWith this study we want to present our experience in the treatment of retracted distal biceps tendon tear with lacertus fibrosus augmentation. Our surgical technique is an effective and cheap option for chronic-retracted distal biceps tendon lesions.

{"title": "MEF2 transcription factors are key regulators of sprouting angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the fundamental process by which new blood vessels form from existing ones, depends on precise spatial and temporal gene expression within specific compartments of the endothelium. However, the molecular links between proangiogenic signals and downstream gene expression remain unclear. During sprouting angiogenesis, the specification of endothelial cells into the tip cells that lead new blood vessel sprouts is coordinated by vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4)/Notch signaling and requires high levels of Notch ligand DLL4. Here, we identify MEF2 transcription factors as crucial regulators of sprouting angiogenesis directly downstream from VEGFA. Through the characterization of a Dll4 enhancer directing expression to endothelial cells at the angiogenic front, we found that MEF2 factors directly transcriptionally activate the expression of Dll4 and many other key genes up-regulated during sprouting angiogenesis in both physiological and tumor vascularization. Unlike ETS-mediated regulation, MEF2-binding motifs are not ubiquitous to all endothelial gene enhancers and promoters but are instead overrepresented around genes associated with sprouting angiogenesis. MEF2 target gene activation is directly linked to VEGFA-induced release of repressive histone deacetylases and concurrent recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase EP300 to MEF2 target gene regulatory elements, thus establishing MEF2 factors as the transcriptional effectors of VEGFA signaling during angiogenesis.", "journal": "Genes & development", "date": "2016-11-30", "authors": ["NataliaSacilotto", "Kira MChouliaras", "Leonid LNikitenko", "Yao WeiLu", "MartinFritzsche", "Marsha DWallace", "SvanhildNornes", "FernandoGarc\u00eda-Moreno", "SophiePayne", "EstherBridges", "KeLiu", "DanielBiggs", "IndrikaRatnayaka", "Shane PHerbert", "Zolt\u00e1nMoln\u00e1r", "Adrian LHarris", "BenjaminDavies", "Gareth LBond", "GeorgeBou-Gharios", "John JSchwarz", "SarahDe Val"], "doi": "10.1101/gad.290619.116\n10.1242/dev.137919"}
{"title": "Future Prospects for Scaffolding Methods and Biomaterials in Skin Tissue Engineering: A Review.", "abstract": "Over centuries, the field of regenerative skin tissue engineering has had several advancements to facilitate faster wound healing and thereby restoration of skin. Skin tissue regeneration is mainly based on the use of suitable scaffold matrices. There are several scaffold types, such as porous, fibrous, microsphere, hydrogel, composite and acellular, etc., with discrete advantages and disadvantages. These scaffolds are either made up of highly biocompatible natural biomaterials, such as collagen, chitosan, etc., or synthetic materials, such as polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly-ethylene-glycol (PEG), etc. Composite scaffolds, which are a combination of natural or synthetic biomaterials, are highly biocompatible with improved tensile strength for effective skin tissue regeneration. Appropriate knowledge of the properties, advantages and disadvantages of various biomaterials and scaffolds will accelerate the production of suitable scaffolds for skin tissue regeneration applications. At the same time, emphasis on some of the leading challenges in the field of skin tissue engineering, such as cell interaction with scaffolds, faster cellular proliferation/differentiation, and vascularization of engineered tissues, is inevitable. In this review, we discuss various types of scaffolding approaches and biomaterials used in the field of skin tissue engineering and more importantly their future prospects in skin tissue regeneration

{"title": "Prognostic factors in the treatment of carpal scaphoid non-unions.", "abstract": "In this literature review, the authors analyse the prognostic factors in the curative treatment of scaphoid non-unions.

{"title": "A Study on Variations of Nutrient Foramen of Humerus with its Clinical Implications.", "abstract": "Background Nutrient foramen is an opening into shaft of humerus which gives passage to the blood vessels of medullary cavity. The knowledge of nutrient foramen is important in surgical procedures like bone grafting and more recently in microsurgical vascularized bone transplantation. Objective To determine the number, location and direction of nutrient foramen and whether the nutrient foramens obey the rule of ossification, that is directed away from the growing end of the bone or not. Method The present study consisted of 253 (108 right and 145 left) dried humeri excluding any fracture or pathological abnormalities during the period of 15th December 2014 - 14th February 2015. Number and direction of nutrient foramen was observed in each humerus. Location of nutrient foramen in relation with surfaces and zones of humeri was determined. Result It has been observed that 60.87% of the humeri had a single nutrient foramen, 28.85% double foramen, 6.32% triple foramen and 1.98% of humeri had four nutrient foramina where as 1.98% humeri did not have any nutrient foramina. It was concluded that the majority (88.86%) of the nutrient foramina were present on the antero-medial surface, 6.52% on the anterolateral surface and 4.62% on the posterior surface of the shaft of humeri. It was also concluded that most (94.84%) of the foramina present in the zone II followed by zone III (4.62%) then by zone I (0.54%). All foramina were directed toward the lower end of humeri.

{"title": "3D hybrid modelling of vascular network formation.", "abstract": "We develop an off-lattice, agent-based model to describe vasculogenesis, the de novo formation of blood vessels from endothelial progenitor cells during development. The endothelial cells that comprise our vessel network are viewed as linearly elastic spheres that move in response to the forces they experience. We distinguish two types of endothelial cells: vessel elements are contained within the network and tip cells are located at the ends of vessels. Tip cells move in response to mechanical forces caused by interactions with neighbouring vessel elements and the local tissue environment, chemotactic forces and a persistence force which accounts for their tendency to continue moving in the same direction. Vessel elements are subject to similar mechanical forces but are insensitive to chemotaxis. An angular persistence force representing interactions with the local tissue is introduced to stabilise buckling instabilities caused by cell proliferation. Only vessel elements proliferate, at rates which depend on their degree of stretch: elongated elements have increased rates of proliferation, and compressed elements have reduced rates. Following division, the fate of the new cell depends on the local mechanical environment: the probability of forming a new sprout is increased if the parent vessel is highly compressed and the probability of being incorporated into the parent vessel increased if the parent is stretched. Simulation results reveal that our hybrid model can reproduce the key qualitative features of vasculogenesis. Extensive parameter sensitivity analyses show that significant changes in network size and morphology are induced by varying the chemotactic sensitivity of tip cells, and the sensitivities of the proliferation rate and the sprouting probability to mechanical stretch. Varying the chemotactic sensitivity directly influences the directionality of the networks. The degree of branching, and thereby the density of the networks, is influenced by the sprouting probability. Glyphs that simultaneously depict several network properties are introduced to show how these and other network quantities change over time and also as model parameters vary. We also show how equivalent glyphs constructed from in vivo data could be used to discriminate between normal and tumour vasculature and, in the longer term, for model validation. We conclude that our biomechanical hybrid model can generate vascular networks that are qualitatively similar to those generated from in vitro and in vivo experiments.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2016-11-29", "authors": ["HolgerPerfahl", "Barry DHughes", "Tom\u00e1sAlarc\u00f3n", "Philip KMaini", "Mark CLloyd", "MatthiasReuss", "Helen MByrne"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.11.013"}

A contemporary management of the treatment of the initial fracture is ideal and so benefits from a routine arthroscopic management. Nevertheless, in the absence of diagnosis and therefore early treatment, the symptoms may be located at the ulnar crossroads and justify specific treatment of TFCC. It is generally conducted after an accurate arthroscopic lesion classification guiding a procedure, depending on the lesion vascularization as well as its possible destabilization potential (debridement, capsular suture or foveal reattachment). Unfortunately, too often the radius fracture is insufficiently stabilized by an inadequate fixation process or inappropriate orthopedic management with a positive ulnar variance consequence and an ulnar plus syndrome.

To this purpose, a cylindrical tissue with two co- and counter-current vascular networks and a central heat source is introduced. Next, the energy equations of tissue, supply fluid (arterial blood), and return fluid (venous blood) are derived using porous media approach. Then, a 2D computer code is developed to predict the temperature of blood (fluid phase) and tissue (solid phase) by conventional volume averaging method and a more realistic solution method. In latter method, despite the volume averaging the blood of interconnect capillaries is separated from the arterial and venous blood phases. It is found that in addition to blood perfusion rate, the arrangement of vascular network has considerable effects on the pattern and amount of the achieved temperature. In contrast to counter-current network, the co-current network of vessels leads to considerable asymmetric pattern of temperature contours and relocation of heat affected zone along the blood flow direction. However this relocation can be prevented by changing the site of hyperthermia heat source. The results show that the cooling effect of co-current blood vessels during of interstitial heating is more efficient. Despite much anatomical dissimilarities, these findings can be useful in designing of protocols for hyperthermia cancer treatment of living tissue.", "journal": "Journal of thermal biology", "date": "2016-11-28", "authors": ["SaeidHassanpour", "AhmadSaboonchi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.06.022"}

There were 59 males with 70 fingers and 43 females with 45 fingers, aged from 19 to 62 years old with an average of 45.6 years. Twenty-nine patients with 29 fingers were repaired by free peroneal artery perforator flaps, 35 patients with 37 fingers were repaired by the free vascularized flaps based on the wrist cutaneous branch of ulnar artery, 38 patients with 49 fingers were repaired by metacarpal dorsal artery perforator flaps. The soft tissue defect area varied from 1.8 cm\u00d74.0 cm to 2.8 cm\u00d75.4 cm. The flap area varied from 2.0 cm\u00d74.4 cm to 3.1 cm\u00d76.0 cm. The clinical results were evaluated based on flap survival rate, finger function and complications.\nAll flaps survived. Distal skin flap necrosis occurred in 5 flaps, but healed after wound dressing therapy. No deep infection were found in donor site and recipient site. There were 3 cases with partial necrosis of the skin graft, and delayed healing after wound dressing therapy. All patients were followed up from 6 to 28 months with an average of 10.6 months.

Donor administration of the nitric oxide synthases (NOS) co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin has been shown to prevent IRI. Herein, we analysed whether tetrahydrobiopterin is also involved in TV development. Using a fully allogeneic mismatched (BALB/c to C57BL/6) murine aortic transplantation model grafts subjected to long cold ischemia time developed severe TV with intimal hyperplasia (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin positive cells in the neointima) and endothelial activation (increased P-selectin expression). Donor pretreatment with tetrahydrobiopterin significantly minimised these changes resulting in only marginal TV development. Severe TV observed in the non-treated group was associated with increased protein oxidation and increased occurrence of endothelial NOS monomers in the aortic grafts already during graft procurement. Tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation of the donor prevented all these early oxidative changes in the graft. Non-treated allogeneic grafts without cold ischemia time and syngeneic grafts did not develop any TV. We identified early protein oxidation and impaired endothelial NOS homodimer formation as plausible mechanistic explanation for the crucial role of IRI in triggering TV in transplanted aortic grafts. Therefore, targeting endothelial NOS in the donor represents a promising strategy to minimise TV.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-11-25", "authors": ["RupertOberhuber", "GregorRiede", "BennoCardini", "DavidBernhard", "BarbaraMessner", "KatrinWatschinger", "ChristinaSteger", "GeraldBrandacher", "JohannPratschke", "GeorgGolderer", "Ernst RWerner", "ManuelMaglione"], "doi": "10.1038/srep37917\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03539.x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.711911\n10.1111/j.1399-0012.2010.01307.x\n10.1016/j.trre.2012.07.002\n10.1186/1749-8090-6-2\n10.1038/nm.2507\n10.1161/01.RES.0000261982.76892.09\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.02.025\n10.1056/NEJM198501173120305\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2008.08.034\n10.1038/ki.2010.7\n10.1042/BJ20110293\n10.1016/j.tips.2008.10.003\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2010.03262.x\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.06.015\n10.1016/j.bcp.2005.05.009\n10.1074/jbc.M004392200\n10.1371/journal.pone.0112570\n10.1097/TP.0b013e318160130f\n10.1172/JCI4584\n10.1161/01.RES.0000255032.33661.88\n10.1172/JCI10233\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.597526\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.10.001\n10.1126/science.1071059\n10.1097/01.tp.0000269725.74189.b9\n10.1681/ASN.2010050531\n10.1111/j.1432-2277.2009.00947.x\n10.1016/j.healun.2004.06.007\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64928-0\n10.1146/annurev.pathol.3.121806.151449\n10.1385/1-59745-049-9:401\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2005.05.030\n10.106/S1053-2498(00)00192-3\n10.1152/ajprenal.00449.2012\n10.1152/ajpheart.00393.2010\n10.1016/S0022-5223(99)70019-X\n10.1111/j.1432-2277.2012.01530.x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.038919\n10.1038/ncpcardio0878\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000249\n10.1016/j.healun.2010.08.001\n10.1056/NEJMc1511744\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2008.04.007\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2010.09.005\n10.1111/ajt.13708"}

The method was tested in rats (n\u2009=\u2009115), divided in 3 models: brain tumors (9\u2009L, C6, F98), permanent stroke, and a control group of healthy animals. We showed that fingerprinting can robustly distinguish between healthy and pathological brain tissues with different behaviors in tumor and stroke models. In particular, fingerprinting revealed that C6 and F98 glioma models have similar signatures while 9\u2009L present a distinct evolution. We also showed that it is possible to improve the results of MRvF and obtain supplemental information by changing the numerical representation of the vascular network. Finally, good agreement was found between MRvF and conventional MR approaches in healthy tissues and in the C6, F98, and permanent stroke models. For the 9\u2009L glioma model, fingerprinting showed blood oxygenation measurements that contradict results obtained with a quantitative BOLD approach.

Although surgical intervention remains the standard treatment, preservation of the sphincter attached to the rest of the gut is challenging. The present study aimed to evaluate a bioengineered gut-sphincter complex following its subcutaneous implantation for 4\u00a0weeks in rats. Engineered innervated human smooth muscle sheets and innervated human sphincters with a predefined alignment were placed around tubular scaffolds to create a gut-sphincter complex. The engineered complex was subcutaneously implanted in the abdomen of the rats for 4\u00a0weeks. The implanted tissues were vascularized. In vivo manometry revealed luminal pressure at the gut and the sphincter zone. Tensile strength, elongation at break and Young's modulus of the engineered complexes were similar to those of native rat intestine. Histological and immunofluorescence assays showed maintenance of smooth muscle circular alignment in the engineered tissue, maintenance of smooth muscle contractile phenotype and innervation of the smooth muscle. Electrical field stimulation induced relaxation of the smooth muscle of both the sphincter and the gut parts. Relaxation was partly inhibited by nitric oxide inhibitor indicating nitrergic contribution to relaxation. The present study has demonstrated for the first time a successfully developed and subcutaneously implanted a tubular human-derived gut-sphincter complex. The sphincteric part of Tubular Gut-Sphincter Complex (TGSC) maintained the basal tone characteristic of a native sphincter. The gut part also maintained its specific neuromuscular characteristics.

With advancements in immunomodulation strategies together with new therapies in neuroregeneration, parallel development of human surgical protocols is vital for ensuring momentum toward eye transplantation in actual patients.\nCadaveric donor tissue harvest (n = 8) was performed with orbital exenteration, combined open craniotomy, and endonasal approach to ligate the ophthalmic artery with a cuff of paraclival internal carotid artery, for transection of the optic nerve at the optic chiasm and transection of cranial nerves III to VI and the superior ophthalmic vein at the cavernous sinus. Candidate recipient vessels (superficial temporal/internal maxillary/facial artery and superficial temporal/facial vein) were exposed. Vein grafts were required for all anastomoses. Donor tissue was secured in recipient orbits followed by sequential venous and arterial anastomoses and nerve coaptation. Pedicle lengths and calibers were measured. All steps were timed, photographed, video recorded, and critically analyzed after each operative session.\nThe technical feasibility of cadaveric donor procurement and transplantation to cadaveric recipient was established. Mean measurements included optic nerve length (39 mm) and caliber (5 mm), donor artery length (33 mm) and caliber (3 mm), and superior ophthalmic vein length (15 mm) and caliber (0.5 mm).

Triptolide had an obvious effect on proinflammatory cytokine expression and T-lymphocyte proliferation in the peripheral blood. Interestingly, triptolide could increase the mixed chimerism level of recipients, possibly by inhibiting the apoptosis of transplanted bone marrow cells by means of regulation of the apoptotic genes bcl-2 and Bax.\nTriptolide reduces the dose of tacrolimus required for immunosuppression by attenuating inflammation and by T-cell suppression.

Overexpression of HIF-1, the transcriptional regulator for a group of malignant-pathway related genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is associated with increased tumor growth, vascularization, and metastasis. HIF-1 is composed of an inducible subunit, HIF-1\u03b1 and a constitutively expressed subunit, HIF-1\u00df. HIF-1 activity is mainly dependent on the level of HIF-1\u03b1 protein, the inducible and regulatory subunit of the HIF-1 heterodimer complex; thus, identification of novel anti-HIF-1\u03b1 agents will lead to effective blockage of the HIF-1 (HIF-1\u03b1)-mediated \"switch-on\" function for those malignant-pathway related genes and suppression of the HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF-mediated signaling pathway that promotes cancer progression and metastasis. While there is an extremely large number of small molecule compounds in the database (compound libraries), the currently existing screening system is inefficient and time-consuming; or, at best, the application of the existing screening system is very limited as it is usually not coupled with biological validation processes. The further development of potential drugs is partly hindered due to the cumbersome steps in between the primary screen and consequent validation: the slow, exhausted and sometimes lack of a linked biological validation process contributes to the dismal fate of scant compounds uncovered in the primary screen. To improve upon the status quo, we developed a prototype screening system that is coupled anti-HIF-1\u03b1 primary screen with secondary anti-VEGF/anti-angiogenesis validation screens. We used breast cancer cells as the model to select potent anti-HIF-1\u03b1 small-molecule compounds by their abilities to inhibit transactivation of a VEGF promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene under hypoxia. Positive compounds were then validated by a series of assays that confirm compounds' anti-HIF-1\u03b1 activities including measurement of their effects on HIF-1\u03b1 downstream VEGF gene expression and angiogenic ability of breast cancer cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that we could further improve the compound's potency of anti-HIF-1\u03b1 and anti-angiogenesis by modifying the identified lead to synthesize a superior (novel) drug.", "journal": "Journal of Cancer", "date": "2016-11-24", "authors": ["ChikezieMadu", "LiyuanLi", "YiLu"], "doi": "10.7150/jca.15603"}

{"title": "Combining Theoretical and Experimental Techniques to Study Murine Heart Transplant Rejection.", "abstract": "The quality of life of organ transplant recipients is compromised by complications associated with life-long immunosuppression, such as hypertension, diabetes, opportunistic infections, and cancer. Moreover, the absence of established tolerance to the transplanted tissues causes limited long-term graft survival rates. Thus, there is a great medical need to understand the complex immune system interactions that lead to transplant rejection so that novel and effective strategies of intervention that redirect the system toward transplant acceptance (while preserving overall immune competence) can be identified. This study implements a systems biology approach in which an experimentally based mathematical model is used to predict how alterations in the immune response influence the rejection of mouse heart transplants. Five stages of conventional mouse heart transplantation are modeled using a system of 13 ordinary differential equations that tracks populations of both innate and adaptive immunity as well as proxies for pro- and anti-inflammatory factors within the graft and a representative draining lymph node.

{"title": "Self-hardening and thermoresponsive alpha tricalcium phosphate/pluronic pastes.", "abstract": "Although calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) are used for bone regeneration in a wide range of clinical applications, various physicochemical phenomena are known to hinder their potential use in minimally invasive surgery or in highly vascularized surgical sites, mainly because of their lack of injectability or their low washout resistance. The present work shows that the combination of CPCs with an inverse-thermoresponsive hydrogel is a good strategy for finely tuning the cohesive and rheological properties of CPCs to achieve clinical acceptable injectability to prevent phase separation during implantation and cohesion to avoid washout of the paste. The thermoresponsive CPC developed combines alpha-tricalcium phosphate with an aqueous solution of pluronic F127, which exhibits an inverse thermoresponsive behaviour, with a gelling transformation at around body temperature. These novel CPCs exhibited temperature-dependent properties. Addition of the polymer enhanced the injectability of the paste, even at a low liquid-to-powder ratio, and allowed the rheological properties of the cement to be tuned, with the injection force decreasing with the temperature of the paste. Moreover, the cohesion of the paste was also temperature-dependent and increased as the temperature of the host medium increased due to gelling induced in the paste. The thermoresponsive cement exhibited excellent cohesion and clinically acceptable setting times at 37\u00b0C, irrespective of the initial temperature of the paste. The addition of pluronic F127 slightly delayed the setting reaction in the early stages but did not hinder the full transformation to calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite. Moreover, the frozen storage of premixed thermoresponsive cement pastes was explored, the main physicochemical properties of the cements being maintained upon thawing, even after 18months of frozen storage. This avoids the need to mix the cement in the operating theatre and allows its use off-the-shelf. The reverse thermoresponsive cements studied herein open up new perspectives in the surgical field, where the sequential gelling/hardening of these novel cements could allow for a better and safer clinical application.\nCalcium phosphate cements are attractive bone substitutes due to their similarity to the bone mineral phase. Although they can be injectable, cohesion and stability of the paste are crucial in terms of performance and safety. A common strategy is the combination with hydrogels. However, this often results in a decrease of viscosity with increasing temperature, which can lead to extravasation and particle leakage from the bone defect. The preferred evolution would be the opposite: a low viscosity would enhance mixing and injection, and an instantaneous increase of viscosity after injection would ensure washout resistance to the blood flow. Here we develop for the first time a calcium phosphate cement exhibiting reverse thermoresponsive properties using a poloxamer featuring inverse thermal gelling.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-11-23", "authors": ["YassineMaazouz", "Edgar BMontufar", "JulienMalbert", "MontserratEspanol", "Maria-PauGinebra"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.043"}

In this contribution, we describe the vasculature of the zygomatic arch in young pigs (Sus scrofa dom.) in order to understand the relationship of osseous and periosteal vessels to each other, to surrounding tissues, and to patterns of modeling. Subjects 2-6 weeks of age were perfused with vascular fill; some also received the vital bone label calcein. Whole mounts were prepared of the decalcified bony arch and of its lateral periosteum. Undecalcified arches were plastic-embedded and thick-sectioned. Additional observations on cell replication were made using material from a previous study. The osseous and periosteal vascular supplies were largely independent, joined only by a fine network at the tissue interface. Osseous vessels entered the medial side of the arch through clusters of nutrient foramina. The intraosseous branching pattern resembled the direction of appositional growth, which in turn describes the disposition of bony trabeculae in older pigs. In contrast, vessels arrived at the periosteum via muscles and ligaments and thus its perfusion may partially depend on functional activity. The open weave of periosteal vessels bore little similarity to bone architecture, especially for the temporal bone, but the appositional lateral periosteum showed indications of angiogenesis, whereas the thinner, resorptive periosteum on the medial side featured composite, possibly fusing vessels at the bone surface.

In order to determine its efficacy with sustained release, heparin (Hep) was covalently incorporated into degradable (Type D) and non-degradable (Type N) polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels. After in vitro characterization of their physicochemical properties, growth factor (GF) loaded, heparinised Type D gels were formed within the pores of porous polyurethane disks, which were then implanted and evaluated in a subcutaneous model. Type N gels formed faster (3.1\u00b10.1 vs. 7.2\u00b10.2min), were stiffer (10.0\u00b10.5kPa vs. 7.1\u00b11.2kPa) and more stable than degradable gels (>6month stability vs. disintegration \u2a7d22d in vitro; all p<0.001). Sustained release of covalently incorporated (CI) heparin from Type N (56days; first order kinetics) and Type D (21days; zero order kinetics) was achieved, as opposed to non-covalently incorporated (NI) heparin that eluted in a burst release within the first 2days. While Type D gels initially impeded tissue ingrowth into the porous scaffolds, they were completely degraded and replaced by ingrown tissue after 28days in vivo. At the latter timepoint disks containing gels without Hep or with non-covalently incorporated Hep were less vascularized than empty (no gel) controls. In contrast, the incorporation of covalently heparinized (no GF) and GF containing gels (no Hep) resulted in a 50% and 42% (p<0.05) improvement in vascularization, while an increase of 119% (p<0.001) was achieved with a combination of covalently attached Hep and GF. These gels thus provide a sustained release system for heparin and GF that extends the duration of their action to local tissue ingrowth.\nThe paper describes the modification and covalent incorporation of heparin into degradable and non-degradable polyethylene glycol hydrogels in a way that provides for the hydrolytic cleavage of the linker for the release of the heparin in original and active form, and in an extended (21-56d) controlled (zero and first order respectively) manner. The successful use of these gels as growth-factor containing and releasing matrices for the improvement of in vivo vascularization holds promise for many potential uses in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications, such as vascular grafts and myocardial infarction therapy, where the antithrombotic and/or growth factor binding/potentiating properties are required.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-11-21", "authors": ["AlizaJanse van Rensburg", "Neil HDavies", "AnelOosthuysen", "CindyChokoza", "PeterZilla", "DeonBezuidenhout"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.036"}

{"title": "Morphological And Molecular Analyses of an Anatomical Novelty: The Pelvic Fin Filaments of the South American Lungfish.", "abstract": "The pelvic fins of male South American lungfish, Lepidosiren paradoxa, are adorned with a distinctive array of filaments, which grow and become highly vascularized during the breeding season. The resemblance between these pelvic fin filaments (PFFs) and external gills of other vertebrates suggested that this gill-like structure was used for physiological gas exchange. It has been proposed that the unique pelvic fin of male L. paradoxa is used for release of oxygen from its blood into the environment in order to aerate its nesting brood, or, conversely, as an auxiliary respiratory organ by absorbing oxygen from the environment into its bloodstream. Here, we employed histology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to assess whether the morphology and molecular profile of PFFs are compatible with a role in gas exchange. First, we closely examined its external morphology and showed that PFFs develop from short papillae during the rainy season, but remain covered by a thick nonvascularized epithelium. Histological examination confirmed that capillaries within the filaments are separated from the exterior by a basement membrane and a stratified epithelium composed of four to five cell layers. In addition, SEM analysis revealed significant differences between the fin filament epithelium and typical gill epithelium. Finally, our qPCR results showed that five genes commonly expressed in gills were downregulated in PFFs relative to their expression in regular pectoral fin epidermis. Collectively, our results do not directly support a role for PFFs, commonly referred to as \"limb gills\", in oxygen release or uptake.", "journal": "Journal of experimental zoology.

These will be used to evaluate two different methods for computing oxygen distribution.\nA vessel tree structure, and an associated tumour of 127 cm3, were generated, using a stochastic method and Bresenham's line algorithm to develop trees on two different scales and fusing them together. The vessel dimensions were adjusted through convolution and thresholding and each vessel voxel was assigned an oxygen value. Diffusion and consumption were modelled using a Green's function approach together with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The computations were performed using a combined tree method (CTM) and an individual tree method (ITM). Five tumour sub-sections were compared, to evaluate the methods.\nThe oxygen distributions of the same tissue samples, using different methods of computation, were considerably less similar (root mean square deviation, RMSD\u22480.02) than the distributions of different samples using CTM (0.001< RMSD<0.01). The deviations of ITM from CTM increase with lower oxygen values, resulting in ITM severely underestimating the level of hypoxia in the tumour. Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests showed that millimetre-scale samples may not represent the whole.\nThe stochastic model managed to capture the heterogeneous nature of hypoxic fractions and, even though the simplified computation did not considerably alter the oxygen distribution, it leads to an evident underestimation of tumour hypoxia, and thereby radioresistance. For a trustworthy computation of tumour oxygenation, the interaction between adjacent microvessel trees must not be neglected, why evaluation should be made using high resolution and the CTM, applied to the entire tumour.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-11-20", "authors": ["Jakob HLagerl\u00f6f", "PeterBernhardt"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0166251\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.04.049\n10.1089/ars.2013.5759\n10.1088/0031-9155/52/16/005\n10.1088/0031-9155/57/19/6103\n10.1118/1.4773886\n10.1118/1.4866887\n10.1007/s10439-006-9150-4\n10.1111/joa.12156\n10.1111/micc.12017\n10.1118/1.4812431\n10.1089/ars.2007.1628\n10.1118/1.3615164"}

Previously, we demonstrated that tolerance to a VCA could be achieved after canine recipients were simultaneously given marrow from a dog leukocyte antigen-identical donor. In the present study, we extend those findings across a dog leukocyte antigen mismatched barrier.\nEight recipient dogs received total body irradiation (4.5 cGy), hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), either marrow (n = 4) or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (n = 4), and a VCA transplant from the HCT donor. Post grafting immunosuppression consisted of mycophenolate mofetil (28 days) and cyclosporine (35 days).\nIn 4 dogs receiving bone marrow, 1 accepted both its marrow transplant and demonstrated long-term tolerance to the donor VCA (>52 weeks). Three dogs rejected both their marrow transplants and VCA at 5 to 7 weeks posttransplant. Dogs receiving mobilized stem cells all accepted their stem cell transplant and became tolerant to the VCA. However, 3 dogs developed graft-versus-host disease, whereas 1 dog rejected its stem cell graft by week 15 but exhibited long-term tolerance toward its VCA (>90 weeks).\nThe data suggest that simultaneous transplantation of mobilized stem cells and a VCA is feasible and leads to tolerance toward the VCA in a haploidentical setting.

{"title": "Vessel co-option is common in human lung metastases and mediates resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in preclinical lung metastasis models.", "abstract": "Anti-angiogenic therapies have shown limited efficacy in the clinical management of metastatic disease, including lung metastases. Moreover, the mechanisms via which tumours resist anti-angiogenic therapies are poorly understood. Importantly, rather than utilizing angiogenesis, some metastases may instead incorporate pre-existing vessels from surrounding tissue (vessel co-option). As anti-angiogenic therapies were designed to target only new blood vessel growth, vessel co-option has been proposed as a mechanism that could drive resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. However, vessel co-option has not been extensively studied in lung metastases, and its potential to mediate resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in lung metastases is not established. Here, we examined the mechanism of tumour vascularization in 164 human lung metastasis specimens (composed of breast, colorectal and renal cancer lung metastasis cases). We identified four distinct histopathological growth patterns (HGPs) of lung metastasis (alveolar, interstitial, perivascular cuffing, and pushing), each of which vascularized via a different mechanism. In the alveolar HGP, cancer cells invaded the alveolar air spaces, facilitating the co-option of alveolar capillaries. In the interstitial HGP, cancer cells invaded the alveolar walls to co-opt alveolar capillaries. In the perivascular cuffing HGP, cancer cells grew by co-opting larger vessels of the lung. Only in the pushing HGP did the tumours vascularize by angiogenesis. Importantly, vessel co-option occurred with high frequency, being present in >80% of the cases examined. Moreover, we provide evidence that vessel co-option mediates resistance to the anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib in preclinical lung metastasis models. Assuming that our interpretation of the data is correct, we conclude that vessel co-option in lung metastases occurs through at least three distinct mechanisms, that vessel co-option occurs frequently in lung metastases, and that vessel co-option could mediate resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in lung metastases. Novel therapies designed to target both angiogenesis and vessel co-option are therefore warranted. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

{"title": "Proliferation status defines functional properties of endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Homeostasis of solid tissue is characterized by a low proliferative activity of differentiated cells while special conditions like tissue damage induce regeneration and proliferation. For some cell types it has been shown that various tissue-specific functions are missing in the proliferating state, raising the possibility that their proliferation is not compatible with a fully differentiated state. While endothelial cells are important players in regenerating tissue as well as in the vascularization of tumors, the impact of proliferation on their features remains elusive. To examine cell features in dependence of proliferation, we established human endothelial cell lines in which proliferation is tightly controlled by a doxycycline-dependent, synthetic regulatory unit. We observed that uptake of macromolecules and establishment of cell-cell contacts was more pronounced in the growth-arrested state. Tube-like structures were formed in vitro in both proliferating and non-proliferating conditions. However, functional vessel formation upon transplantation into immune-compromised mice was restricted to the proliferative state. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) infection resulted in reduced expression of endothelial markers. Upon transplantation of infected cells, drastic differences were observed: proliferation arrested cells acquired a high migratory activity while the proliferating counterparts established a tumor-like phenotype, similar to Kaposi Sarcoma lesions. The study gives evidence that proliferation governs endothelial functions. This suggests that several endothelial functions are differentially expressed during angiogenesis. Moreover, since proliferation defines the functional properties of cells upon infection with KSHV, this process crucially affects the fate of virus-infected cells.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS", "date": "2016-11-18", "authors": ["ChristophLipps", "MuhammadBadar", "MiladaButueva", "TatyanaDubich", "Vivek VikramSingh", "SophieRau", "AxelWeber", "MichaelKracht", "MarioK\u00f6ster", "TobiasMay", "Thomas FSchulz", "Hansj\u00f6rgHauser", "DagmarWirth"], "doi": "10.1007/s00018-016-2417-5"}

All animals underwent a laminectomy at the lumbar 1-2 (L 1-2) level. After intragastric treatment, all rats were sacrificed at post-operative week 8. The extent of the epidural scar, the regeneration of the vasculature and the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were analysed.\nThe animals' recovery was uneventful during the experimental period. The extent of the epidural scar, the regeneration of the vasculature and the expression levels of VEGF suggested better outcomes in the Sal B-treated groups. Sal B exerted the ability to prevent the formation of an epidural scar and vascularization at the laminectomy sites. The effects of Sal B were dose-dependent, with the 50\u00a0mg/kg Sal B group showing the best outcomes compared with the other groups.\nPost-operative intragastric application of Sal B can prevent the formation of epidural scarring.

{"title": "Physiological basis of vascular autocalibration (VasA): Comparison to hypercapnia calibration methods.", "abstract": "The statistical power of functional MRI (fMRI) group studies is significantly hampered by high intersubject spatial and magnitude variance. We recently presented a vascular autocalibration method (VasA) to account for vascularization differences between subjects and hence improve the sensitivity in group studies. Here, we validate the novel calibration method by means of direct comparisons of VasA with more established measures of baseline venous blood volume (and indirectly vascular reactivity), the M-value.\nSeven healthy volunteers participated in two 7\u2009T (T) fMRI experiments to compare M-values with VasA estimates: (i) a hypercapnia experiment to estimate voxelwise M-value maps, and (ii) an fMRI experiment using visual stimulation to estimate voxelwise VasA maps.\nWe show that VasA and M-value calibration maps show the same spatial profile, providing strong evidence that VasA is driven by local variations in vascular reactivity as reflected in the M-value.\nThe agreement of vascular reactivity maps obtained with VasA when compared with M-value maps confirms empirically the hypothesis that the VasA method is an adequate tool to account for variations in fMRI response amplitudes caused by vascular reactivity differences in healthy volunteers. VasA can therefore directly account for them and increase the statistical power of group studies. The VasA toolbox is available as a statistical parametric mapping (SPM) toolbox, facilitating its general application.

{"title": "A Computational Model of Peripheral Photocoagulation for the Prevention of Progressive Diabetic Capillary Occlusion.", "abstract": "We developed a computational model of the propagation of retinal ischemia in diabetic retinopathy and analyzed the consequences of various patterns and sizes of burns in peripheral retinal photocoagulation. The model addresses retinal ischemia as a phenomenon of adverse local feedback in which once a capillary is occluded there is an elevated probability of occlusion of adjacent capillaries resulting in enlarging areas of retinal ischemia as is commonly seen clinically. Retinal burns of different sizes and patterns, treated as local oxygen sources, are predicted to have different effects on the propagation of retinal ischemia. The patterns of retinal burns are optimized with regard to minimization of the sum of the photocoagulated retina and computer predicted ischemic retina. Our simulations show that certain patterns of retinal burns are effective at preventing the spatial spread of ischemia by creating oxygenated boundaries across which the ischemia does not propagate. This model makes no statement about current PRP treatment of avascular peripheral retina and notes that the usual spot sizes used in PRP will not prevent ischemic propagation in still vascularized retinal areas. The model seems to show that a properly patterned laser treatment of still vascularized peripheral retina may be able to prevent or at least constrain the propagation of diabetic retinal ischemia in those retinal areas with intact capillaries.", "journal": "Journal of diabetes research", "date": "2016-11-17", "authors": ["Thomas JGast", "XiaoFu", "John ScottGens", "James AGlazier"], "doi": "10.1155/2016/2508381\n10.1097/00004397-198702740-00004\n10.1016/s0161-6420(13)38011-7\n10.1016/s0161-6420(81)34978-1\n10.1136/bjo.2008.139568\n10.1097/IAE.0b013e3181c70127\n10.1080/08820530802519899\n10.1111/j.1755-3768.2011.02307.x\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004932\n10.1056/nejm199412013312203\n10.1167/iovs.08-2201\n10.1007/s11033-008-9428-8\n10.2337/db09-1420\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2011.05.002\n10.1172/jci200213776\n10.1152/ajpregu.00080.2003\n10.1038/aps.2012.61\n10.1080/15216540252774757\n10.1007/BF00409828\n10.1016/b978-0-12-388403-9.00013-8\n10.1016/S0002-9394(14)75794-0\n10.1159/000310130\n10.1007/BF00161019\n10.1023/a:1006367029134\n10.1038/eye.2009.308\n10.1016/S0161-6420(90)32557-5\n10.1007/s10633-015-9495-9\n10.1007/s10633-014-9476-4\n10.1136/bjo.77.11.726\n10.1007/978-1-4419-1672-3"}

{"title": "Time to Decide? Dynamical Analysis Predicts Partial Tip/Stalk Patterning States Arise during Angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a highly dynamic morphogenesis process; however, surprisingly little is known about the timing of the different molecular processes involved. Although the role of the VEGF-notch-DLL4 signaling pathway has been established as essential for tip/stalk cell competition during sprouting, the speed and dynamic properties of the underlying process at the individual cell level has not been fully elucidated. In this study, using mathematical modeling we investigate how specific, biologically meaningful, local conditions around and within an individual cell can influence their unique tip/stalk phenotype switching kinetics. To this end we constructed an ordinary differential equation model of VEGF-notch-DLL4 signaling in a system of two, coupled endothelial cells (EC). Our studies reveal that at any given point in an angiogenic vessel the time it takes a cell to decide to take on a tip or stalk phenotype may be drastically different, and this asynchrony of tip/stalk cell decisions along vessels itself acts to speed up later competitions. We unexpectedly uncover intermediate \"partial\" yet stable states lying between the tip and stalk cell fates, and identify that internal cellular factors, such as NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) and Lunatic fringe 1 (Lfng1), can specifically determine the length of time a cell spends in these newly identified partial tip/stalk states. Importantly, the model predicts that these partial EC states can arise during normal angiogenesis, in particular during cell rearrangement in sprouts, providing a novel two-stage mechanism for rapid adaptive behavior to the cells highly dynamic environment. Overall, this study demonstrates that different factors (both internal and external to EC) can be used to modulate the speed of tip/stalk decisions, opening up new opportunities and challenges for future biological experiments and therapeutic targeting to manipulate vascular network topology, and our basic understanding of developmental/pathological angiogenesis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-11-16", "authors": ["LakshmiVenkatraman", "Erzs\u00e9bet RavaszRegan", "KatieBentley"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0166489\n10.1046/j.1087-0024.2000.00014.x\n10.1016/0026-2862(77)90141-8\n10.1002/aja.1001920305\n10.1242/dev.062323\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000549\n10.7554/eLife.12167\n10.1038/ncb2103\n10.7554/eLife.13212\n10.1038/nature05571\n10.1006/jtbi.1996.0233\n10.1242/dev.003244\n10.1128/MCB.23.1.14-25.2003\n10.1073/pnas.0611206104\n10.1038/nature08959\n10.1101/cshperspect.a006502\n10.1073/pnas.1511814112\n10.1016/j.devcel.2014.03.019\n10.1002/bies.20135\n10.1038/nature09917\n10.1038/35019075\n10.1101/gad.250603\n10.1101/gad.435107\n10.1371/journal.pone.0045331\n10.1016/j.joen.2012.04.006\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.039\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.09.015\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002088\n10.1074/jbc.275.14.10661\n10.1101/gad.211912.112\n10.1038/nrc2223\n10.1126/science.1074560\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1761\n10.1016/j.bpj.2011.11.3964\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bth078\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bth349\n10.1016/j.febslet.2007.09.063\n10.1016/j.febslet.2005.01.009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0001469\n10.1002/jcp.10208\n10.1093/nar/gkm477\n10.1016/j.mcn.2010.05.004"}
{"title": "The Tofts model in frequency domain: fast and robust determination of pharmacokinetic maps for dynamic contrast enhancement MRI.", "abstract": "Dynamic contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a well-established method for non-invasive detection and therapeutic monitoring of pathologies through administration of intravenous contrast agent. Quantification of pharmacokinetic (PK) maps can be achieved through application of compartmental models relevant to the pathophysiology of the tissue under interrogation. The determination of PK parameters involves fitting of time-concentration data to these models. In this work, the Tofts model in frequency domain (TM-FD) is applied to a weakly vascularized tissue such as the breast. It is derived as a convolution-free model from the conventional Tofts model in the time domain (TM-TD). This reduces the dimensionality of the curve-fitting problem from two to one. The approaches of TM-FD and TM-TD were applied to two kinds of in silico phantoms and six in vivo breast DCE data sets with and without the addition of noise. The results showed that computational time taken to estimate PK maps using TM-FD was 16-25% less than with TM-TD. Normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) calculation and Pearson correlation analyses were performed to validate robustness and accuracy of the TM-FD and TM-TD approaches. These compared with ground truth values in the case of phantom studies for four different temporal resolutions. Results showed that NRMSE values for TM-FD were significantly lower than those of TM-TD as validated by a paired t-test along with reduced computational time. This approach therefore enables online evaluation of PK maps by radiologists in a clinical setting, aiding in the evaluation of 3D and/or increased coverage of the tissue of interest.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2016-11-16", "authors": ["Nithin NVajuvalli", "Dharmendra Kumar KChikkemenahally", "Krupa NNayak", "Manoj GBhosale", "SairamGeethanath"], "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/61/24/8462"}
{"title": "Defective Bone Repair in C57Bl6 Mice With Acute Systemic Inflammation.", "abstract": "Bone repair is initiated with a local inflammatory response to injury. The presence of systemic inflammation impairs bone healing and often leads to malunion, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Our research objective was to use a mouse model of cortical bone repair to determine the effect of systemic inflammation on cells in the bone healing microenvironment. QUESTION/PURPOSES: (1) Does systemic inflammation, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration affect the quantity and quality of regenerating bone in primary bone healing? (2) Does systemic inflammation alter vascularization and the number or activity of inflammatory cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts in the bone healing microenvironment?\nCortical defects were drilled in the femoral diaphysis of female and male C57BL/6 mice aged 5 to 9 months that were treated with daily systemic injections of LPS or physiologic saline as control for 7 days. Mice were euthanized at 1 week (Control, n = 7; LPS, n = 8), 2 weeks (Control, n = 7; LPS, n = 8), and 6 weeks (Control, n = 9; LPS, n = 8) after surgery. The quantity (bone volume per tissue volume [BV/TV]) and microarchitecture (trabecular separation and thickness, porosity) of bone in the defect were quantified with time using microCT. The presence or activity of vascular endothelial cells (CD34), macrophages (F4/80), osteoblasts (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]), and osteoclasts (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase [TRAP]) were evaluated using histochemical analyses.\nOnly one of eight defects was bridged completely 6 weeks after surgery in LPS-injected mouse bones compared with seven of nine defects in the control mouse bones (odds ratio [OR], 0.04; 95% CI, 0.003-0.560; p = 0.007). The decrease in cortical bone in LPS-treated mice was reflected in reduced BV/TV (21% \u00b1 4% vs 39% \u00b1 10%; p < 0.01), increased trabecular separation (240 \u00b1 36 \u03bcm vs 171 \u00b1 29 \u03bcm; p < 0.01), decreased trabecular thickness (81 \u00b1 18 \u03bcm vs 110 \u00b1 22 \u03bcm; p = 0.02), and porosity (79% \u00b1 4% vs 60% \u00b1 10%; p < 0.01) at 6 weeks postoperative. Defective healing was accompanied by decreased CD34 (1.1 \u00b1 0.6 vs 3.4 \u00b1 0.9; p < 0.01), ALP (1.9 \u00b1 0.9 vs 6.1 \u00b1 3.2; p = 0.03), and TRAP (3.3 \u00b1 4.7 vs 7.2 \u00b1 4.0; p = 0.01) activity, and increased F4/80 (13 \u00b1 2.6 vs 6.8 \u00b1 1.7; p < 0.01) activity at 2 weeks postoperative.\nThe results indicate that LPS-induced systemic inflammation reduced the amount and impaired the quality of bone regenerated in mouse femurs. The effects were associated with impaired revascularization, decreased bone turnover by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and by increased catabolic activity by macrophages.\nResults from this preclinical study support clinical observations of impaired primary bone healing in patients with systemic inflammation. Based on our data, local administration of VEGF in the callus to stimulate revascularization, or transplantation of stem cells to enhance bone turnover represent potentially feasible approaches to improve outcomes in clinical practice.", "journal": "Clinical orthopaedics and related research", "date": "2016-11-16", "authors": ["D ABehrends", "DHui", "CGao", "AAwlia", "YAl-Saran", "ALi", "J EHenderson", "P AMartineau"], "doi": "10.1007/s11999-016-5159-7\n10.1002/jbmr.2038\n10.1002/jbmr.354\n10.1038/ki.2011.217\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.07.001\n10.1097/00024382-199603000-00007\n10.1073/pnas.1107019108\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2011.08.009\n10.1016/S8756-3282(01)00638-X\n10.3748/wjg.v11.i35.5485\n10.1038/nm849\n10.1038/nrrheum.2012.1\n10.1186/1741-7015-9-66\n10.1038/nrrheum.2014.164\n10.1016/j.trsl.2014.01.011\n10.1002/jcb.10435\n10.1074/jbc.M106339200\n10.1016/j.mvr.2014.12.001\n10.1084/jem.177.4.1205\n10.4161/cbt.28552\n10.22203/eCM.v015a08\n10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0687\n10.4049/jimmunol.1201345\n10.22203/eCM.v032a10\n10.1016/j.bone.2004.10.010\n10.1002/jor.20870\n10.1016/j.intimp.2015.05.012\n10.1007/s00402-012-1525-4\n10.1002/art.33504\n10.1016/j.biocel.2010.10.013\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.008\n10.1038/jid.2013.328\n10.1097/TA.0b013e318278956d\n10.1038/nrd3669\n10.1080/17453670510045327\n10.1097/SHK.0b013e318257123a\n10.1186/s40634-014-0017-6\n10.1007/s00441-011-1205-7\n10.22203/eCM.v027sa01\n10.1038/nri2062\n10.1093/hmg/ddh034\n10.1038/bonekey.2013.107\n10.1007/s00223-013-9764-0\n10.1002/path.4680"}

{"title": "The Arteriovenous (AV) Loop in a Small Animal Model to Study Angiogenesis and Vascularized Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "A functional blood vessel network is a prerequisite for the survival and growth of almost all tissues and organs in the human body. Moreover, in pathological situations such as cancer, vascularization plays a leading role in disease progression. Consequently, there is a strong need for a standardized and well-characterized in vivo model in order to elucidate the mechanisms of neovascularization and develop different vascularization approaches for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. We describe a microsurgical approach for a small animal model for induction of a vascular axis consisting of a vein and artery that are anastomosed to an arteriovenous (AV) loop. The AV loop is transferred to an enclosed implantation chamber to create an isolated microenvironment in vivo, which is connected to the living organism only by means of the vascular axis. Using 3D imaging (MRI, micro-CT) and immunohistology, the growing vasculature can be visualized over time. By implanting different cells, growth factors and matrices, their function in blood vessel network formation can be analyzed without any disturbing influences from the surroundings in a well controllable environment. In addition to angiogenesis and antiangiogenesis studies, the AV loop model is also perfectly suited for engineering vascularized tissues. After a certain prevascularization time, the generated tissues can be transplanted into the defect site and microsurgically connected to the local vessels, thereby ensuring immediate blood supply and integration of the engineered tissue. By varying the matrices, cells, growth factors and chamber architecture, it is possible to generate various tissues, which can then be tailored to the individual patient's needs.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2016-11-15", "authors": ["AnnikaWeigand", "Justus PBeier", "AndreasArkudas", "MajidaAl-Abboodi", "EliasPolykandriotis", "Raymund EHorch", "Anja MBoos"], "doi": "10.3791/54676"}

This transition occurs in response to reduced tissue oxygenation and is an important physiologic regulator of hypoxic vasodilation. In this issue of the JCI, Zhang and colleagues demonstrate that S-nitrosylation of hemoglobin at \u03b2Cys93 is important for tissue oxygenation after cardiac injury. Mice harboring mutations that prevent S-nitrosylation of \u03b2Cys93 had higher rates of morbidity and mortality following cardiac injury compared with WT; however, adaptive cardiac vascularization was increased in some mutant mice and reduced cardiac injury in these animals.

{"title": "Vascular Network Formation by Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells in Modular Fibrin Microtissues.", "abstract": "Microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) are a preferred cell source for autologous revascularization strategies, since they can be harvested and propagated from small tissue biopsies. Biomaterials-based strategies for therapeutic delivery of cells are aimed at tailoring the cellular microenvironment to enhance the delivery, engraftment, and tissue-specific function of transplanted cells. In the present study, we investigated a modular tissue engineering approach to therapeutic revascularization using fibrin-based microtissues containing embedded human MVEC and human fibroblasts (FB). Microtissues were formed using a water-in-oil emulsion process that produced populations of spheroidal tissue modules with a diameter of 100-200 \u00b5m. The formation of MVEC sprouts within a fibrin matrix over 7 days in culture was dependent on the presence of FB, with the most robust sprouting occurring at a 1:3 MVEC:FB ratio. Cell viability in microtissues was high (>90%) and significant FB cell proliferation was observed over time in culture. Robust sprouting from microtissues was evident, with larger vessels developing over time and FB acting as pericyte-like cells by enveloping endothelial tubes. These neovessels were shown to form an interconnected vascular plexus over 14 days of culture when microtissues were embedded in a surrounding fibrin hydrogel. Vessel networks exhibited branching and inosculation of sprouts from adjacent microtissues, resulting in MVEC-lined capillaries with hollow lumens. Microtissues maintained in suspension culture aggregated to form larger tissue masses (1-2 mm in diameter) over 7 days. Vessels formed within microtissue aggregates at a 1:1 MVEC:FB ratio were small and diffuse, whereas the 1:3 MVEC:FB ratio produced large and highly interconnected vessels by day 14. This study highlights the utility of human MVEC as a cell source for revascularization strategies, and suggests that the ratio of endothelial to support cells can be used to tailor vessel characteristics. The modular microtissue format may allow minimally invasive delivery of populations of prevascularized microtissues for therapeutic applications.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2016-11-14", "authors": ["RamkumarTiruvannamalai Annamalai", "Ana YRioja", "Andrew JPutnam", "Jan PStegemann"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00274\n10.1038/nbt0705-821\n10.1038/nprot.2013.110\n10.1007/s10456-012-9307-8\n10.1159/000336876\n10.1039/b814285h\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0740\n10.1002/adma.201403943\n10.1039/C5TB00934K\n10.1002/term.2008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0084287\n10.1073/pnas.0602740103\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.10.022\n10.1039/C4BM00141A\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.039\n10.1038/386671a0\n10.1038/74651\n10.1146/annurev.cb.11.110195.000445\n10.1023/A:1006493130855\n10.1134/S0006297908070031\n10.1016/j.mvr.2009.01.007\n10.1215/S1152851705000232\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0275\n10.1002/term.336\n10.1007/BF02634257\n10.1007/b137240\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.1999.00786.x\n10.1089/ten.teb.2007.0435\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.07.043\n10.1016/j.ejvs.2006.08.008\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2006.tb00429.x\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00418.x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.03.029\n10.1007/s00441-014-1830-z\n10.1016/j.ijporl.2015.06.034\n10.1016/j.tice.2015.06.001\n10.1002/term.410\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2014.0299\n10.1002/term.1830\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00369.x\n10.1089/ten.teb.2014.0188\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0125\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0550\n10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0092\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2009.0018\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.01.012\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.04.031\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.2875\n10.1016/j.actbio.2006.08.006\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.08.109\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.06.016\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.257\n10.1529/biophysj.107.120774\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0314\n10.1091/mbc.E11-05-0393\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.09.007\n10.1161/01.RES.0000182903.16652.d7\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.10.023\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01044.x\n10.1073/pnas.162488599\n10.1002/jcp.20584\n10.1242/dev.00721"}
{"title": "Combined maceration procedure permits advanced microsurgical dissection of Thiel-embalmed specimens.", "abstract": "Due to the realistic colour, texture conservation and preservation of biomechanical properties, Thiel-embalming is becoming the main embalming procedure for clinical courses and research based on human cadaver material. The aim of this study is to establish a new procedure that allows advanced microdissection of small vessels and intraorganic nerves in Thiel-embalmed material.\nAfter a classical gross anatomical dissection, human hemipelves underwent repetitive application of 3 consecutive steps: (i) maceration with alloy of nitric acid and MiliQ water 1:10 for 24-48h. (ii) Immersion: the hemipelves were rinsed under tap water for 20-30min. and placed in a water bath for 1h. The nerves become more prominent due to the swelling and increased water content. (iii) microdissection under surgical microscope. To facilitate the organ visualization perfusion with polyurethane (Pu4ii, VasQtec\nBy using the proposed procedure, we performed satisfactory microdissection on Thiel-embalmed samples. The combination with polyurethane vascular casting permits visualization of small arterioles and venules in a range of 20-25\u03bcm. The method is very suitable for demonstration of somatic and vegetative nerves. Branches of the sacral plexuses and autonomic nerves from the superior and inferior hypogastric plexus have been tracked up to the smallest intraorganic branches in a range of 12.5-15\u03bcm. In conclusion, the established combined procedure offers a new possibility for advanced microdissection, which will allow acquisition of clinically relevant information about organ specific micro- vascularization and innervation.", "journal": "Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft", "date": "2016-11-14", "authors": ["HannesBangerter", "SusanneBoemke", "RaphaelR\u00f6thlisberger", "ValerieSchwartz", "MathiasBergmann", "Michael DM\u00fcller", "ValentinDjonov"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aanat.2016.10.008"}
{"title": "No evidence of ischemia in stroke-like lesions of mitochondrial POLG encephalopathy.", "abstract": "Stroke-like lesions are characteristically associated with mitochondrial encephalopathies such as those caused by mutations of polymerase gamma (POLG) and the m.3243A>G mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation. The combination of acute clinical onset, MRI and pathological abnormalities, have led to the suggestion that these lesions are ischemic. Here, we sought to determine the role of ischemia in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial stroke-like lesions. We performed a systematic study of cerebral blood vessel morphology, density and distribution in post mortem brain tissue from nine patients with POLG-encephalopathy and seven neurologically healthy controls. We found that patients had significantly higher cerebral vascular density than controls: this was more pronounced in areas of chronic neurodegeneration, where vascular density correlated with the severity of neuronal loss, but was also seen in acute lesions. Further, blood vessels were patent and, in acute lesions, dilated suggesting increased perfusion. In contrast to what would be expected in ischemia, stroke-like lesions were not pan-necrotic and were highly vascularized. Our results suggest that ischemia does not contribute to the pathogenesis of either the chronic neurodegeneration or acute lesions in POLG encephalopathy. Neovascularization and vascular dilatation does occur and suggests a compensatory response. We suggested the acute lesions are more likely to reflect energy insufficiency and our earlier studies suggest that this is driven in large part by seizure activity.", "journal": "Mitochondrion", "date": "2016-11-14", "authors": ["CharalamposTzoulis", "EilenHenriksen", "HrvojeMiletic", "Laurence ABindoff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mito.2016.11.004"}
{"title": "Aberrant bone marrow vascularization patterns in untreated patients with Gaucher disease type 1.", "abstract": "Bone marrow (BM) in subjects with Gaucher disease (GD) displays accumulation of Gaucher cells (GC), i.e. glucocerebroside-laden macrophages. Following the assumption that macrophage proliferation and perturbation in GD modulates local inflammation-associated phenomena including angiogenesis, BM biopsies from 11 untreated GD patients and 36 controls were investigated for morphology and angiogenesis-associated features. These included microvascular density, (MVD), vessel structure and pericyte coverage, expression of VEGF-A and angiopoietins (ANGPT1 and 2). In GD BM, cellularity was higher, and GC clustered in cohesive but poorly demarcated areas, leaving irregular islands with normal hematopoiesis. MVD was 2.6-fold higher in GD marrows than in controls (p<0.001). In GC-rich areas, MVD was 1.4-fold higher (p=0.026), and vessel architecture was abnormal compared with GC-poor areas. MVD correlated with BM cellularity, particularly in GC-rich areas. Moreover, 30\u00b117% of GD BM vessels were pericyte-coated, significantly fewer than in controls (48\u00b116%; p<0.001). Expression of ANGPT1 and 2 was significantly higher in GD BM vessel walls than in controls (7.2- and 13.2-fold higher), whereas VEGF expression was 20-fold lower (p<0.05 for all). Thus, human GD BM shows increased angiogenesis with defective pericyte coating and skewed VEGF/ANGPT1 and 2 balances, presumably related to local accumulation of GC.", "journal": "Blood cells, molecules & diseases", "date": "2016-11-12", "authors": ["MonikaKlimkowska", "MaciejMachaczka", "JanPalmblad"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bcmd.2016.10.009"}

{"title": "Mandibular Reconstruction: Overview.", "abstract": "Mandibular reconstruction has changed significantly over the years and continues to evolve with the introduction of newer technologies and techniques.\nThis article reviews the history of oromandibular reconstruction, biomechanics of mandible, summarizes the reconstruction options available for mandible with defect classification, goals in reconstruction, the various donor sites, current reconstructive options, dental rehabilitation and persistent associated problems.\nOromandibular reconstruction, although a challenge for the head and neck reconstructive surgeon, is now reliable and highly successful with excellent long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes with the use of autogenous bone grafts and current reconstructive options. The ideal reconstruction would provide a solid arch to articulate with the upper jaw, restoring swallowing speech, mastication, and esthetics. Autogenous vascularized bone grafts in combination with microsurgical techniques have revolutionized mandibular reconstruction in oral cancer surgery. Current trends in mandibular reconstruction aim to achieve reestablishment of a viable mandible of proper form and maxillary mandibular relationship while decreasing the need for invasive autogenous graft procurement. However the optimal reconstruction of mandibular defects is still controversial in regards to reconstructive options which include the donor site selection, timing of surgery and method of reconstruction.", "journal": "Journal of maxillofacial and oral surgery", "date": "2016-11-12", "authors": ["Batchu PavanKumar", "VVenkatesh", "K A JeevanKumar", "B YashwanthYadav", "S RamMohan"], "doi": "10.1007/s12663-015-0766-5\n10.1097/00006534-195107040-00009\n10.1097/01.prs.0000173906.35257.e0\n10.1136/bmj.2.2552.1525\n10.1288/00005537-199008000-00008\n10.1097/00006534-194903000-00004\n10.1097/00006534-197964050-00001\n10.1097/00006534-198604000-00003\n10.1097/00006534-198907000-00014\n10.1016/0278-2391(82)90218-X\n10.1016/S0266-4356(96)90137-0\n10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181a72f62\n10.1016/j.oraloncology.2009.11.006\n10.5402/2011/824251\n10.1016/S0278-2391(99)90437-8\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2006.11.005\n10.1002/hed.2880150305\n10.1288/00005537-198201000-00002\n10.1016/0278-2391(82)90076-3\n10.1016/S0278-2391(10)80501-4\n10.1016/j.joms.2004.05.114\n10.1053/joms.2001.27825\n10.1186/1477-7819-12-201\n10.1097/00006534-200004050-00005\n10.1001/archotol.126.3.329\n10.1097/00006534-199505000-00010\n10.1001/archotol.1986.03780070026006\n10.1001/archotol.1991.01870190036009\n10.1288/00005537-199004000-00007\n10.1016/j.joms.2004.06.052\n10.1002/micr.1920150405\n10.1288/00005537-199411000-00001\n10.1097/00006534-198811000-00013\n10.1097/00006534-199110000-00005\n10.1288/00005537-198607000-00013\n10.1016/S0300-9785(74)80005-0\n10.1097/00006534-199211000-00024\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2004.05.004\n10.1016/j.cxom.2006.05.007\n10.1016/j.cxom.2005.05.004\n10.1288/00005537-198107000-00001\n10.1002/hed.2890060603\n10.1016/S0301-0503(83)80025-3\n10.1016/0002-9610(71)90439-9\n10.1016/S0002-8177(69)84023-7\n10.1016/0278-2391(94)90440-5\n10.1016/S0266-4356(97)90045-0\n10.1016/S0278-2391(97)90585-1\n10.1016/j.joms.2003.12.012\n10.1002/1097-4636(2001)58:1<36::AID-JBM50>3.0.CO;2-#\n10.1016/S0901-5027(98)80061-1\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16935-3\n10.1073/pnas.87.24.9843\n10.1097/00001665-200103000-00005\n10.1016/j.joms.2007.11.021\n10.1016/j.joms.2008.01.058\n10.1097/SCS.0b013e3181f502fa\n10.1097/00006534-199110000-00003\n10.1097/00006534-199509000-00010\n10.1097/00006534-199309000-00010\n10.1055/s-0030-1255336\n10.1016/S1010-5182(96)80033-3\n10.1016/0007-1226(90)90004-J\n10.1001/archoto.2011.216\n10.1055/s-2004-824887\n10.1002/ssu.2980110304\n10.1001/archotol.1988.01860150049015\n10.1016/0196-0709(90)90062-Z\n10.1001/archotol.130.7.813\n10.1097/00006534-200206000-00007\n10.1002/hed.20050\n10.1097/00006534-199309000-00006\n10.1097/00006534-198803000-00009\n10.1097/00006534-200006000-00007\n10.1007/BF02994653\n10.1016/S0007-1226(82)90108-4\n10.1001/archotol.124.1.46\n10.1097/00006534-197209000-00009\n10.1001/archotol.1989.01860270081019\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000082817.26407.86\n10.1097/00006534-198405000-00001\n10.1016/S0194-5998(97)70029-9\n10.1097/00000637-198801000-00012\n10.1016/0007-1226(86)90005-6\n10.2310/7070.2003.41646\n10.1016/S0278-2391(97)90165-8\n10.1016/S0278-2391(83)80005-6\n10.1016/j.otohns.2009.03.013\n10.1097/00006534-198705000-00001\n10.1016/j.joms.2007.08.041\n10.1016/j.joms.2012.08.022\n10.1001/archotol.1990.01870050035003\n10.1016/0196-0709(95)90011-X\n10.1016/j.joms.2003.06.010\n10.1001/archoto.2010.2\n10.1007/s00402-007-0342-7\n10.1016/S0915-6992(06)80024-5\n10.1016/j.ijom.2008.11.020\n10.1016/j.joms.2008.11.018\n10.1016/j.jcms.2012.03.010\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16948-1\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.01.050\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.07.042\n10.1016/j.ijom.2005.07.013\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000069709.89719.79\n10.1016/S0022-3913(99)70136-8\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2010.03.042\n10.1016/j.prosdent.2006.05.010\n10.1097/SCS.0b013e3181bec611\n10.1016/j.joms.2009.09.104\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0347(199901)21:1<66::AID-HED9>3.0.CO;2-Z\n10.1016/S1010-5182(99)80008-0\n10.1002/hed.20176\n10.1016/0030-4220(94)90085-X"}

Data were extracted by one of the reviewers and then checked by the second. A quality of evidence score and a methodology score were used. Heterogeneity was assessed. A random effects model approach was used to combine estimates.\nOut of 376 selected studies only 34 met the inclusion criteria. The summary pooled union rate was 91\u00a0% (95 % CI: 87-95\u00a0%) while union rate after additional procedures raised to 98\u00a0% (95 % CI 96-99\u00a0%). No association between union rate and bone defect size was found. (Univariable regression model: vascularized: P\u2009=\u20090.677; non-vascularized: 0.202. Multivariable regression model: vascularized: P\u2009=\u20090.381; non-vascularized: P\u2009=\u20090.226).

{"title": "Computational Screening of Tip and Stalk Cell Behavior Proposes a Role for Apelin Signaling in Sprout Progression.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis involves the formation of new blood vessels by sprouting or splitting of existing blood vessels. During sprouting, a highly motile type of endothelial cell, called the tip cell, migrates from the blood vessels followed by stalk cells, an endothelial cell type that forms the body of the sprout. To get more insight into how tip cells contribute to angiogenesis, we extended an existing computational model of vascular network formation based on the cellular Potts model with tip and stalk differentiation, without making a priori assumptions about the differences between tip cells and stalk cells. To predict potential differences, we looked for parameter values that make tip cells (a) move to the sprout tip, and (b) change the morphology of the angiogenic networks. The screening predicted that if tip cells respond less effectively to an endothelial chemoattractant than stalk cells, they move to the tips of the sprouts, which impacts the morphology of the networks. A comparison of this model prediction with genes expressed differentially in tip and stalk cells revealed that the endothelial chemoattractant Apelin and its receptor APJ may match the model prediction. To test the model prediction we inhibited Apelin signaling in our model and in an in vitro model of angiogenic sprouting, and found that in both cases inhibition of Apelin or of its receptor APJ reduces sprouting. Based on the prediction of the computational model, we propose that the differential expression of Apelin and APJ yields a \"self-generated\" gradient mechanisms that accelerates the extension of the sprout.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-11-10", "authors": ["Margriet MPalm", "Marchien GDallinga", "Erikvan Dijk", "IngeborgKlaassen", "Reinier OSchlingemann", "Roeland M HMerks"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0159478\n10.1083/jcb.200302047\n10.1016/j.modgep.2004.05.004\n10.1007/s10456-011-9251-z\n10.1038/ncb2103\n10.1242/dev.068023\n10.1038/288551a0\n10.1007/s12195-008-0022-x\n10.1073/pnas.1007508108\n10.1007/BF00046533\n10.1093/emboj/cdg176\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.10.003\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000163\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000163\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003774.s013\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003774\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.038102\n10.1529/biophysj.108.129668\n10.1051/mmnp/20105105\n10.1038/nature05571\n10.1073/pnas.0611177104\n10.1073/pnas.0611206104\n10.1096/fj.04-3172fje\n10.1182/blood-2005-03-1000\n10.1182/blood-2006-12-063933\n10.1038/nature05313\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1208\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4226\n10.1042/BST0371233\n10.1074/jbc.M000528200\n10.1007/s10456-009-9146-4\n10.1038/nature05577\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.11.030\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.2013\n10.1103/PhysRevE.47.2128\n10.1103/PhysRevE.87.012725\n10.1016/S0764-4469(00)00110-4\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.118101\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2003.10.015\n10.1371/journal.pone.0007190\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002440\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002996\n10.1006/jtbi.1996.0237\n10.1073/pnas.1010059108\n10.1038/ncb2926\n10.1038/ncb1705\n10.1088/1478-3975/10/6/066007\n10.1186/s12918-015-0222-7\n10.1038/nature12635\n10.1038/nature10908\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.03.025\n10.1016/j.mvr.2007.06.006\n10.1182/blood-2010-02-270819\n10.1182/blood-2009-07-230284\n10.1210/er.2003-0027\n10.1083/jcb.141.7.1659\n10.1182/blood-2011-01-331694\n10.1242/dev.062323\n10.1074/jbc.273.7.4282\n10.1038/sj.mn.7800200\n10.1006/bbrc.1998.9489\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.10.042\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.03.004\n10.1182/blood.V99.8.2703\n10.1529/biophysj.107.127662\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.04.452\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.179333\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.163402\n10.1074/jbc.M110.176065\n10.1529/biophysj.107.124511\n10.1529/biophysj.106.101501\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000445\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0571\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.12.047\n10.1007/s11538-009-9471-1\n10.1186/1752-0509-3-13\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019989\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.09.015\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000549\n10.1101/cshperspect.a006452\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601982\n10.1167/iovs.13-11611\n10.1006/mvre.2002.2443\n10.1186/2040-2384-2-3\n10.1038/ncb1486\n10.1007/s10456-013-9349-6\n10.1101/gad.242002\n10.1387/ijdb.103167dr\n10.1038/nrm2009\n10.1145/364099.364331\n10.1016/0020-0190(72)90045-2\n10.1016/j.mvr.2003.11.002\n10.5334/jors.ac\n10.1007/BF01386390\n10.1016/B978-0-12-388403-9.00013-8\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1164-6_20\n10.1083/jcb.137.5.1103\n10.1083/jcb.143.5.1341\n10.1038/nmeth.2089\n10.1002/cyto.a.20022\n10.2307/3001913"}

{"title": "Tumor-associated macrophages induce vasculogenic mimicry of glioblastoma multiforme through cyclooxygenase-2 activation.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with characteristics of strong aggressiveness which depend on vigorous microvascular supply. Vasculogenic mimicry (VM), a new microvascular circulation not involving endothelial cells, is reported as one part of the vascularization of GBM. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), mostly present as immunosuppressive M2 phenotype in GBM, are well known as a promoter for tumor angiogenesis. However, whether TAMs can induce VM in GBM remains uncertain. In the present study, immunohistochemistry showed that higher numbers of macrophages infiltrating in the VM-positive area where tumor cells also highly express COX-2. By using the coculture model of U87 cell line and Interleukin-4-activated M2 macrophages, we found that the capability of VM formation was increased and COX-2 expression was up-regulated in U87 cells. Moreover, knockdown of COX-2 by siRNA Oligonucleotides or abrogating activity of COX-2 by specific inhibitors resulted in impairment of VM formation. Besides, in the process of VM formation, PGE2/EP1/PKC pathway was activated in U87 cells and inhibition of COX-2 led to down-regulation of PGE2 and PKC. In in vivo experiment, we found that COX-2 loss of function in the U87 xenograft model lead to less vascular mimicry. Collectively, our study demonstrates that M2 macrophages are capable of promoting generation of VM in GBM with COX-2 dependent, providing potential mechanisms of the interaction between inflammatory microenvironment and perivascular microenvironment.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-11-09", "authors": ["XiaomingRong", "BoHuang", "ShuweiQiu", "XiangpenLi", "LeiHe", "YingPeng"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.6930\n10.18632/oncotarget.3288"}

An optoacoustic (OA) temperature monitoring method is proposed for noninvasive real-time thermometry of vascularized tissue during cryotherapy. The universal temperature-dependent optoacoustic response (ThOR) of red blood cells (RBCs) is employed to convert reconstructed OA images to temperature maps. To obtain the temperature calibration curve for intensity-normalized OA images, we measured ThOR of 10 porcine blood samples in the range of temperatures from 40\u00b0C to ?16\u00b0C and analyzed the data for single measurement variations. The nonlinearity (?Tmax) and the temperature of zero OA response (T0) of the calibration curve were found equal to 11.4\u00b10.1\u00b0C and ?13.8\u00b10.1\u00b0C, respectively. The morphology of RBCs was examined before and after the data collection confirming cellular integrity and intracellular compartmentalization of hemoglobin. For temperatures below 0\u00b0C, which are of particular interest for cryotherapy, the accuracy of a single temperature measurement was \u00b11\u00b0C, which is consistent with the clinical requirements.

{"title": "Immunomodulatory Role of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy in Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation.", "abstract": "This review aims to summarize contemporary evidence of the in vitro and in vivo immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in promoting vascularized composite allotransplant (VCA) tolerance. An extensive literature review was performed to identify pertinent articles of merit. Prospective preclinical trials in mammal subjects receiving VCA (or skin allograft) with administration of MSCs were reviewed. Prospective clinical trials with intravascular delivery of MSCs in human populations undergoing solid organ transplant were also identified and reviewed. Sixteen preclinical studies are included. Eleven studies compared MSC monotherapy to no therapy; of these, ten reported improved graft survival, which was statistically significantly prolonged in eight. Eight studies analyzed allograft survival with MSC therapy as an adjunct to proven immunosuppressive regimens. In these studies, daily immunosuppression was transiently delivered and then stopped. In all studies, treatment-free graft survival was statistically significantly prolonged in animals that received MSC therapy.

{"title": "Regulation of embryonic neurogenesis by germinal zone vasculature.", "abstract": "In the adult rodent brain, new neurons are born in two germinal regions that are associated with blood vessels, and blood vessels and vessel-derived factors are thought to regulate the activity of adult neural stem cells. Recently, it has been proposed that a vascular niche also regulates prenatal neurogenesis. Here we identify the mouse embryo hindbrain as a powerful model to study embryonic neurogenesis and define the relationship between neural progenitor cell (NPC) behavior and vessel growth. Using this model, we show that a subventricular vascular plexus (SVP) extends through a hindbrain germinal zone populated by NPCs whose peak mitotic activity follows a surge in SVP growth. Hindbrains genetically defective in SVP formation owing to constitutive NRP1 loss showed a premature decline in both NPC activity and hindbrain growth downstream of precocious cell cycle exit, premature neuronal differentiation, and abnormal mitosis patterns. Defective regulation of NPC activity was not observed in mice lacking NRP1 expression by NPCs, but instead in mice lacking NRP1 selectively in endothelial cells, yet was independent of vascular roles in hindbrain oxygenation. Therefore, germinal zone vascularization sustains NPC proliferation in the prenatal brain.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2016-11-09", "authors": ["MathewTata", "IvanWall", "AndyJoyce", "Joaquim MVieira", "NicolettaKessaris", "ChristianaRuhrberg"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1613113113"}

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was used to image the superficial, deep, and whole retinal vascular plexuses at the macular region. Highly myopic eye images were analyzed after adjusting the ocular magnification using Bennett's formula. Fractal analysis (box counting method, Dbox) representing vessel density was performed in different annular and quadrantile zones of both large vessels and microvessels. Correlations between the vascular density, axial length, and spherical equivalent refractive error were analyzed.\nThe average density (Dbox) of the superficial retinal annular zone (0.6-2.5 mm) microvessels was 1.741 \u00b1 0.018 in highly myopic eyes and was shown to be significantly lower than that of the controls (1.773 \u00b1 0.010, P < 0.001). Individual annular zone (bandwidth of 0.16 mm) analysis of highly myopic eyes revealed a significant level of microvessel alteration in all zones compared with the same zones in control eyes (P < 0.001). Furthermore, in the highly myopic group, the microvessel density was significantly correlated with axial length elongation in all three layers (r = -0.38 to -0.48; P < 0.05).\nThis study reveals retinal microvascular network alterations in highly myopic eyes, which correlates with axial length elongation.

However, current bioprinting techniques still exhibit difficulty in achieving biomimetic nano resolution and cooperating with bioactive spatiotemporal signals. In this study, a comprehensive design of engineered vascularized bone construct is presented for the first time by integrating biomimetic 3D bioprinted fluid perfused microstructure with biologically inspired smart release nanocoating, which is regarded as an aspiring concept combining engineering, biological, and material science. In this biologically inspired design, angiogenesis and osteogenesis are successively induced through a matrix metalloprotease 2 regulative mechanism by delivering dual growth factors with sequential release in spatiotemporal coordination. Availability of this system is evaluated in dynamic culture condition, which is similar to fluid surrounding in vivo, as an alternative animal model study.

Since the inception of PHCCs in September 2014, to date 35 centers have been accredited in the United States. This model of care brings together physicians and specialists from other disciplines to provide care, facilitate basic and clinical research, and educate the next generation of providers. PHCCs also offer additional opportunities for improvements in PH care. The patient registry offered through the PHCCs is an organized system by which data are collected to evaluate the outcomes of patients with PH. This registry helps in detecting variations in outcomes across centers, thus identifying opportunities for improvement. Multiple tactics were undertaken to implement the strategic plan, training, and tools throughout the PHCC network. In addition, strategies to foster collaboration between care center staff and individuals with PH and their families are the cornerstone of the PHCCs.

To address these shortcomings, we applied microfluidics-based polymerization to engineer injectable poly(ethylene glycol) microgels of defined size and crosslinked with a protease degradable peptide to allow for triggered release of proteins. The release rate of proteins covalently tethered within the microgel network was tuned by modifying the ratio of degradable to non-degradable crosslinkers, and the released proteins retained full bioactivity. Microgels injected into the dorsum of mice were maintained in the subcutaneous space and degraded within 2 weeks in response to local proteases. Furthermore, controlled release of VEGF from degradable microgels promoted increased vascularization compared to empty microgels or bolus injection of VEGF.

The molecular mechanisms that drive formation of the pituitary vasculature, which is necessary for regulated synthesis and secretion of hormones that maintain homeostasis, metabolism, and endocrine function, remain poorly understood. Here, we report that expression of integrin \u03b21 in embryonic pituitary epithelial cells is required for angiogenesis in the developing mouse pituitary gland. Deletion of pituitary epithelial integrin \u03b21 before the onset of angiogenesis resulted in failure of invading endothelial cells to recruit pericytes efficiently, whereas deletion later in embryogenesis led to decreased vascular density and lumen formation. In both cases, lack of epithelial integrin \u03b21 was associated with a complete absence of vasculature in the pituitary gland at birth. Within pituitary epithelial cells, integrin \u03b21 directs a large transcriptional program that includes components of the extracellular matrix and associated signaling factors that are linked to the observed non-cell-autonomous effects on angiogenesis. We conclude that epithelial integrin \u03b21 functions as a critical and canonical regulator of developmental angiogenesis in the pituitary gland, thus providing insight into the long-standing systems biology conundrum of how vascular invasion is coordinated with tissue development.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2016-11-05", "authors": ["Kathleen MScully", "DorotaSkowronska-Krawczyk", "MichalKrawczyk", "DariaMerkurjev", "HavilahTaylor", "AntoniaLivolsi", "JessicaTollkuhn", "Radu VStan", "Michael GRosenfeld"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1614970113"}

Explorative Cox modeling using gene pairs identified gene sets that in multivariate models were prognostic in breast cancer. This was validated in two microarray sets. Two notable genes are TCF4 and P4HA3 which were included in the sets associated with positive and negative prognosis, respectively. Data from laser-microdissected tumors, a xenografted tumor data set and from correlation analyses demonstrate the stroma specificity of the genes.\nIt is possible to construct ECM and endothelial metagenes common for several cancer forms.

It was recently described that zebrafish embryos expressing a dominant negative (DN) form of thraa recapitulate the key features of RTH\u03b1, and that zebrafish and human receptors are functionally interchangeable.\nThis study expressed several human thyroid hormone receptor alpha (hTR\u03b1) variants in zebrafish embryos and analyzed the resulting phenotypes.\nAll hTR\u03b1-injected embryos showed variable defects, including cerebral and cardiac edema likely caused by an aberrant looping during heart development, anemia, and an incomplete formation of the vascular network. Moreover, the hTR\u03b1-injected embryos presented severe defects of motorneurons and craniofacial development, thus affecting their autonomous feeding and swimming behaviors. Surprisingly, expression of all hTR\u03b1 mutants had no detectable effect on thyrotropin beta and thyrotropin-releasing hormone transcripts, indicating that their DN action is limited on the thyroid hormone reception beta 2 targets at the hypothalamic/pituitary level in vivo.

{"title": "Development of a Vascularized Heterotopic Neonatal Rat Heart Transplantation Model.", "abstract": "Rodent adult-to-adult heterotopic heart transplantation is a well-established animal model, and the detailed surgical technique with several modifications has been previously described. In immature donor organ transplantation, however, the surgical technique needs to be revised given the smaller size and fragility of the donor graft. Here, we report our surgical technique for heterotopic abdominal (AHTx) and femoral (FHTx) neonatal rat heart transplantation based on an experience of over 300 cases.\nHeterotopic heart transplantation was conducted in syngeneic Lewis rats. Neonatal rats (postnatal day 2-4) served as donors. AHTx was performed by utilizing the conventional adult-to-adult transplant method with specific modifications for optimal aortotomy and venous anastomosis. In the FHTx, the donor heart was vascularized by connecting the donor's aorta and pulmonary artery to the recipient's right femoral artery and vein, respectively, in an end-to-end manner. A specifically fashioned butterfly-shaped rubber sheet was used to align the target vessels properly. The transplanted graft was visually assessed for its viability and was accepted as a technical success when the viability met specific criteria. Successfully transplanted grafts were subject to further postoperative evaluation. Forty cases (AHTx and FHTx; n = 20 each) were compared regarding perioperative parameters and outcomes.\nBoth models were technically feasible (success rate: AHTx 75% vs. FHTx 70%) by refining the conventional heterotopic transplant technique. Injury to the fragile donor aorta and congestion of the graft due to suboptimal venous connection were predominant causes of failure, leading to refractory bleeding and poor graft viability. Although the FHTx required significantly longer operation time and graft ischemic time, the in situ graft viabilities were comparable. The FHTx provided better postoperative monitoring as it enabled daily graft palpation and better echocardiographic visualization.\nWe describe detailed surgical techniques for AHTx and FHTx while addressing neonatal donor-specific issues. Following our recommendations potentially reduces the learning curve to achieve reliable and reproducible results with these challenging animal models.", "journal": "European surgical research.

{"title": "Uterine haemodynamic, vascularization and blood pressure changes along the oestrous cycle in bitches.", "abstract": "Characterization of the bitch's reproductive physiology is of utmost importance for the development of new reproductive techniques and the diagnosis of reproductive diseases. In this respect, uterine B-mode ultrasonography has been employed in several studies; however, the focus on haemodynamic changes along the oestrous cycle is yet to be described. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize haemodynamic changes (uterine vascularization, systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate) throughout the oestrous cycle in bitches. For this purpose, ten Golden Retriever bitches were evaluated during an entire oestrous cycle, twice during each stage of the cycle. Uterine artery blood flow, velocity wave forms, haemodynamic parameters and vascularization were analysed by Doppler ultrasonography. Furthermore, uterine diameter, arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured. Uterine artery pulsatility index at early prooestrus was significantly lower in comparison with early oestrus, mid- and late anoestrus. Uterine artery resistance index was higher at early oestrus when compared to late oestrus and uterine diameter was significantly higher during late prooestrus. Furthermore, mean arterial blood pressure was lower and heart rate was higher during late prooestrus in comparison with the other oestrous cycle stages. In conclusion, haemodynamic changes in the uterine artery, uterine diameter, systemic blood pressure and heart rate occur during the canine oestrous cycle. Specifically, there is an increase in uterine artery perfusion, uterine diameter and mean arterial blood pressure during prooestrus, while uterine blood flow diminishes during oestrus and anoestrus.", "journal": "Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene", "date": "2016-11-04", "authors": ["I BNogueira", "L LAlmeida", "DsrAngrimani", "M MBrito", "R AAbreu", "C IVannucchi"], "doi": "10.1111/rda.12859"}

Transplantation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes has beneficial but variable effects. We created human engineered heart tissue (hEHT) strips from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and hiPSC-derived endothelial cells. The hEHTs were transplanted onto large defects (22% of the left ventricular wall, 35% decline in left ventricular function) of guinea pig hearts 7 days after cryoinjury, and the results were compared with those obtained with human endothelial cell patches (hEETs) or cell-free patches. Twenty-eight days after transplantation, the hearts repaired with hEHT strips exhibited, within the scar, human heart muscle grafts, which had remuscularized 12% of the infarct area. These grafts showed cardiomyocyte proliferation, vascularization, and evidence for electrical coupling to the intact heart tissue in a subset of engrafted hearts. hEHT strips improved left ventricular function by 31% compared to that before implantation, whereas the hEET or cell-free patches had no effect.

Endothelial cell hypertrophy (ECH), also known as endothelial hyperplasia, is correlated with a shorter survival of patients with gliomas. However, the prognostic value of these 2 morphological features has not been studied in meningiomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of angiogenesis in meningiomas, most notably ECH, MVP, and microvascular density, which were evaluated using immunohistochemistry with antibodies against CD34 and CD105 (a marker of neovascularization) in a series of 139 meningiomas. ECH, MVP, and CD105 immunoreactivity were significantly correlated with higher histological grades (p\u2009<\u20090.0001, p\u2009=\u20090.0004, and p\u2009=\u20090.0003, respectively).

In Cox multivariate analysis, ECH was an independent predictor of shorter PFS (p\u2009=\u20090.028). Therefore, ECH and MVP are markers of shorter PFS in meningiomas and are significantly correlated with grade. These findings give insight into the use of anti-angiogenic therapies.

To improve the efficacy of tissue engineering, we here investigated the roles of cell seeding, bioscaffolds, growth factors, and in vivo microenvironment (IM) in tissue regeneration. Bone marrow-derived stem cells, allogeneic demineralized bone matrix as bioscaffold, and growth factor bone morphogenetic protein 2/transforming growth factor, and the IM of rib periosteum and perichondrium were used in different combinations for the generation of osteochondral composite tissue. Self-regenerated neocomposite tissue based on the IM alone exhibited excellent anatomical configuration, vascularization, biomechanical stability, and function similar to native controls.

PCs have been suggested to behave as stem cells (SCs) in situ in animal models, although evidence for this role in humans is lacking. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomes of highly purified, non-cultured adipose tissue (AT)-derived PCs (ATPCs) to detect gene expression changes that occur as they acquire MSC characteristics in vitro, and evaluated the hypothesis that human ATPCs exhibit a gene expression profile compatible with an AT SC phenotype. The results showed ATPCs are non-proliferative and express genes characteristic not only of PCs, but also of AT stem/progenitor cells. Additional analyses defined a gene expression signature for ATPCs, and revealed putative novel ATPC markers. Almost all AT stem/progenitor cell genes differentially expressed by ATPCs were not expressed by ATMSCs or culture-expanded ATPCs. Genes expressed by ATMSCs but not by ATPCs were also identified. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that PCs are SCs in vascularized tissues, highlight gene expression changes they undergo as they assume an MSC phenotype, and provide new insights into PC biology.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2016-11-04", "authors": ["Lindolfoda Silva Meirelles", "Virg\u00ednia Marade Deus Wagatsuma", "Tathiane MaistroMalta", "Patr\u00edcia VianaBonini Palma", "Am\u00e9lia GoesAra\u00fajo", "Rodrigo AlexandrePanepucci", "Wilson Ara\u00fajoSilva", "SimoneKashima", "Dimas TadeuCovas"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2016.10.017"}
{"title": "Brown adipose tissue as a secretory organ.", "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is the main site of adaptive thermogenesis and experimental studies have associated BAT activity with protection against obesity and metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia. Active BAT is present in adult humans and its activity is impaired in patients with obesity. The ability of BAT to protect against chronic metabolic disease has traditionally been attributed to its capacity to utilize glucose and lipids for thermogenesis. However, BAT might also have a secretory role, which could contribute to the systemic consequences of BAT activity. Several BAT-derived molecules that act in a paracrine or autocrine manner have been identified. Most of these factors promote hypertrophy and hyperplasia of BAT, vascularization, innervation and blood flow, processes that are all associated with BAT recruitment when thermogenic activity is enhanced. Additionally, BAT can release regulatory molecules that act on other tissues and organs. This secretory capacity of BAT is thought to be involved in the beneficial effects of BAT transplantation in rodents. Fibroblast growth factor 21, IL-6 and neuregulin 4 are among the first BAT-derived endocrine factors to be identified. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of the regulatory molecules (the so-called brown adipokines or batokines) that are released by BAT that influence systemic metabolism and convey the beneficial metabolic effects of BAT activation. The identification of such adipokines might also direct drug discovery approaches for managing obesity and its associated chronic metabolic diseases.", "journal": "Nature reviews.

This study demonstrates the generation of a vascularized skin equivalent with a perfused vascular network by combining a biological vascularized scaffold (BioVaSc) based on a decellularized segment of a porcine jejunum and a tailored bioreactor system. Briefly, the BioVaSc was seeded with human fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and human microvascular endothelial cells. After 14 days at the air-liquid interface, hematoxylin & eosin and immunohistological staining revealed a specific histological architecture representative of the human dermis and epidermis including a papillary-like architecture at the dermal-epidermal-junction. The formation of the skin barrier was measured non-destructively using impedance spectroscopy. Additionally, endothelial cells lined the walls of the formed vessels that could be perfused with a physiological volume flow. Due to the presence of a complex in-vivo-like vasculature, the here shown skin equivalent has the potential for skin grafting and represents a sophisticated in vitro model for dermatological research.", "journal": "ALTEX", "date": "2016-11-04", "authors": ["FlorianGroeber", "LisaEngelhardt", "JuliaLange", "SzymonKurdyn", "Freia FSchmid", "ChristophR\u00fccker", "StephanMielke", "HeikeWalles", "JanHansmann"], "doi": "10.14573/altex.1604041"}

Very little is known on the expression of these two growth factors in the avian ovary. The aim of this study was to determine for the first time the localization of VEGF and FGF-2 in the ovary of the ostrich using immunohistochemical techniques to investigate the vascularization of the rapidly growing huge ostrich oocyte. At the oocyte periphery, distinct VEGF-positive granules are visible. In our opinion, the expression of VEGF in the growing oocytes, which does not occur in mammals such as bovines, does not significantly contribute to angiogenesis in the theca interna and externa, where all the original and developing vessels are located, but may contribute to the mitoses and survival of granulosa cells during folliculogenesis. A different immunostaining can be demonstrated for FGF-2: from late pre-vitellogenic follicles, FGF-2 immunopositivity can be observed at the inner perivitelline layer area. In the stroma, the smooth muscle cells of small arteries and the endothelial cells of venules and veins are positively stained for FGF-2. Another interesting finding of this study is the occurrence of a significant number of VEGF- and FGF-2 positive heterophilic granulocytes within the ovarian stroma, which migrate from the periphery of the ovary towards the growing follicles. We assume that the growth factors of the heterophilic granulocytes contribute significantly to the angiogenesis seen in both theca layers.", "journal": "Anatomia, histologia, embryologia", "date": "2016-11-04", "authors": ["DRodler"], "doi": "10.1111/ahe.12211"}

The model is obtained by repopulating the extracellular matrix of a decellularized rat liver with a human hepatocyte cell line.

Another advantage is the humanized nature of the model, which is closer to human physiology than animal models. In this study, we demonstrate the transduction of this liver model with a viral vector derived from adeno-associated viruses (AAV vector). The perfusion circuit that supplies the 3D liver model with media provides an easy means to apply the vector. The system permits monitoring of the major metabolic parameters of the liver. For final analysis, tissue samples can be taken to determine the extent of recellularization by histological techniques. Distribution of the virus vector and expression of the delivered transgene can be analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.

Three different hydrogel variants, silk-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (SP), silk-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (SH) and silk-sonicated (SS) hydrogels were studied. Hydrogels were loaded with the M1 and M2 polarizing cytokines interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), respectively. Functional cytokine release and macrophage polarization studies were conducted using three cytokine exposure approaches: only cytokine encapsulation (macrophage in culture well), only macrophage encapsulation (cytokine in culture media) and cytokine with macrophage encapsulation. The extent of macrophage polarization by cytokine-eluting and macrophage-encapsulating hydrogels was investigated using gene expression analysis for C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), cluster of differentiation 206 (CD206) and cluster of differentiation 209 (CD209). The released cytokines polarized macrophages from an M0 phenotype to an M1/M2 phenotype. Also, lineage committed M1/M2 macrophages could be \"switched\" to their M2/M1 counterparts (M1-to-M2 or M2-to-M1 transition) exhibiting their well-established plasticity. When macrophages were encapsulated in hydrogels, polarization could be induced to the lineage committed M1 or M2 phenotypes either in polarizing media or when coencapsulated with cytokines.

Here, a novel polymer vascular graft is presented, whose inner surface contains an assembled circular microgroove pattern decorated with a combination of concentric circular microgrooves and radial, straight microgrooves inspired by the orientation of SMCs and ECs in natural tissues. The surface micropatterns can produce dynamically tunable variations via the thermally switched shape memory. The results from the in vitro EC/SMC co-cultures reveal that the surface micropatterns have a great capacity to regulate the specific distribution of ECs/SMCs because the ECs grow along the radial, straight microgrooves and the SMCs grow along concentric circular microgrooves. The in vivo vascularization is further analyzed by implanting the vascular graft in the rabbit carotid artery.

Is it well established that blood flow is a main driver for vascular remodelling. It has also been proposed that vessel pruning is a central process within physiological vessel remodelling. However, despite its central function, the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating vessel regression, and their interaction with blood flow patterns, remain largely unexplained. We investigated the cellular process governing developmental vascular remodelling in mouse and zebrafish. We established that polarised reorganization of endothelial cells is at the core of vessel regression, representing vessel anastomosis in reverse. Moreover, we established for the first time an axial polarity map for all endothelial cells together with an in silico method for the computation of the haemodynamic forces in the murine retinal vasculature. Using network-level analysis and microfluidics, we showed that endothelial non-canonical Wnt signalling regulates endothelial sensitivity to shear forces. Loss of Wnt5a/11 renders endothelial cells more sensitive to shear, resulting in axial polarisation at lower shear stress levels. Collectively our data suggest that non-canonical Wnt signalling stabilizes forming vascular networks by reducing endothelial shear sensitivity, thus keeping vessels open under low flow conditions that prevail in the primitive plexus.", "journal": "Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation", "date": "2016-11-02", "authors": ["PedroBarbacena", "Joana RCarvalho", "Claudio AFranco"], "doi": "10.3233/CH-168006"}

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to answer the focused question: In animal models, does cotransplantation of osteogenic and vasculogenic cells enhance bone regeneration in craniofacial defects, compared with solely osteogenic cell-seeded constructs? Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, electronic databases were searched for controlled animal studies reporting cotransplantation of endothelial cells (ECs) with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or osteoblasts in craniofacial critical size defect (CSD) models. Twenty-two studies were included comparing outcomes of MSC/scaffold versus MSC+EC/scaffold (co)transplantation in calvarial (n\u2009=\u200915) or alveolar (n\u2009=\u20097) CSDs of small (rodents, rabbits) and large animal (minipigs, dogs) models. On average, studies presented with an unclear to high risk of bias. MSCs were derived from autologous, allogeneic, xenogeneic, or human (bone marrow, adipose tissue, periosteum) sources; in six studies, ECs were derived from MSCs by endothelial differentiation. In most studies, MSCs and ECs were cocultured in vitro (2-17 days) before implantation. Coculture enhanced MSC osteogenic differentiation and an optimal MSC:EC seeding ratio of 1:1 was identified. Alloplastic copolymer or composite scaffolds were most often used for in vivo implantation. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for histomorphometric and radiographic new bone formation (%NBF) and vessel formation in rodents' calvarial CSDs.

{"title": "Medically resistant pediatric insular-opercular/perisylvian epilepsy. Part 2: outcome following resective surgery.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Seizure onset in the insular cortex as a cause of refractory epilepsy is underrepresented in the pediatric population, possibly due to difficulties localizing seizure onset in deep anatomical structures and limited surgical access to the insula, a complex anatomical structure with a rich overlying vascular network. Insular seizure semiology may mimic frontal, temporal, or parietal lobe semiology, resulting in false localization, incomplete resection, and poor outcome. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of all pediatric patients who underwent insular cortical resections for intractable epilepsy at Miami Children's Hospital from 2009 to 2015. Presurgical evaluation included video electroencephalography monitoring and anatomical/functional neuroimaging. All patients underwent excisional procedures utilizing intraoperative electrocorticography or extraoperative subdural/depth electrode recording. RESULTS Thirteen children (age range 6 months-16 years) with intractable focal epilepsy underwent insular-opercular resection. Seven children described symptoms that were suggestive of insular seizure origin. Discharges on scalp EEG revealed wide fields. Four patients were MRI negative (i.e., there were no insular or brain abnormalities on MRI), 4 demonstrated insular signal abnormalities, and 5 had extrainsular abnormalities. Ten patients had insular involvement on PET/SPECT. All patients underwent invasive investigation with insular sampling; in 2 patients resection was based on intraoperative electrocorticography, whereas 11 underwent surgery after invasive EEG monitoring with extraoperative monitoring. Four patients required an extended insular resection after a failed initial surgery. Postoperatively, 2 patients had transient hemiplegia. No patients had new permanent neurological deficits. At the most recent follow-up (mean 43.8 months), 9 (69%) children were seizure free and 1 had greater than 90% seizure reduction. CONCLUSIONS Primary insular seizure origin should be considered in children with treatment-resistant focal seizures that are believed to arise within the perisylvian region based on semiology, widespread electrical field on scalp EEG, or insular abnormality on anatomical/functional neuroimaging. There is a reasonable chance of seizure freedom in this group of patients, and the surgical risks are low.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

We have addressed these issues by engineering multiphasic bone-ligament-bone (BLB) constructs that develop structural and mechanical properties similar to native ACL. The purpose of this study was to examine the acute remodeling process that occurs as the BLB grafts advance toward the adult ligament phenotype in vivo. Thus, we implanted BLB constructs fabricated from male cells into female host sheep and allowed 3, 7, 14, or 28 days (n = 4 at each time point) for recovery. To address whether or not graft-derived cells were even necessary, a subset of BLB constructs (n = 3) were acellularized, implanted, and allowed 28 days for recovery. At each recovery time point, the following histological analyses were performed: picrosirius red staining to assess collagen alignment and immunohistochemistry to assess both graft development and host immune response. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, performed on every explanted BLB, was used to detect the presence of graft-derived male cells remaining in the constructs and/or migration into surrounding host tissue. The analysis of the PCR and histology samples revealed a rapid migration of host-derived macrophages and neutrophils into the graft at 3 days, followed by increased collagen density and alignment, vascularization, innervation, and near complete repopulation of the graft with host cells within 28 days.

{"title": "A Novel Physiological Glycosaminoglycan-Deficient Splice Variant of Neuropilin-1 Is Anti-Tumorigenic In Vitro and In Vivo.", "abstract": "Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a transmembrane protein acting as a co-receptor for several growth factors and interacting with other proteins such as integrins and plexins/semaphorins. It is involved in axonal development, angiogenesis and cancer progression. Its primary mRNA is subjected to alternative splicing mechanisms generating different isoforms, some of which lack the transmembrane domain and display antagonist properties to NRP1 full size (FS). NRP1 is further post-translationally modified by the addition of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) side chains through an O-glycosylation site at serine612. Here, we characterized a novel splice variant which has never been investigated, NRP1-\u03947, differing from the NRP1-FS by a deletion of 7 amino acids occurring two residues downstream of the O-glycosylation site. This short sequence contains two aspartic residues critical for efficient glycosylation. As expected, the high molecular weight products appearing as a smear in SDS-PAGE and reflecting the presence of GAG in NRP1-FS were undetectable in the NRP1-\u03947 protein. NRP1-\u03947 mRNA was found expressed at an appreciable level, between 10 and 30% of the total NRP1, by various cells lines and tissues from human and murine origin. To investigate the biological properties of this isoform, we generated prostatic (PC3) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cells able to express recombinant NRP1-FS or NRP1-\u03947 in a doxycycline-inducible manner. Cells with increased expression of NRP1-\u03947 were characterized in vitro by a significant reduction of proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth, while NRP1-FS had the expected opposite \"pro-tumoral\" effects. Upon VEGF-A165 treatment, a lower internalization rate was observed for NRP1-\u03947 than for NRP1-FS. Finally, we showed that NRP1-\u03947 inhibited growth of prostatic tumors and their vascularization in vivo.

Notably, instead of through the induction of angiogenesis, tumor vascularization can occur through the nonangiogenic mechanism of vessel co-option. Here we show that vessel co-option is associated with a poor response to the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Moreover, we find that vessel co-option is also prevalent in human breast cancer liver metastases, a setting in which results with anti-angiogenic therapy have been disappointing. In preclinical mechanistic studies, we found that cancer cell motility mediated by the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3) is required for vessel co-option in liver metastases in vivo and that, in this setting, combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co-option is more effective than the inhibition of angiogenesis alone. Vessel co-option is therefore a clinically relevant mechanism of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy and combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co-option might be a warranted therapeutic strategy.", "journal": "Nature medicine", "date": "2016-11-01", "authors": ["SophiaFrentzas", "EveSimoneau", "Victoria LBridgeman", "Peter BVermeulen", "ShaneFoo", "EleftheriosKostaras", "MarkNathan", "AndrewWotherspoon", "Zu-HuaGao", "YuShi", "GertVan den Eynden", "FrancesDaley", "ClarePeckitt", "XianmingTan", "AyatSalman", "AnthoulaLazaris", "PatrycjaGazinska", "Tracy JBerg", "ZakEltahir", "LailaRitsma", "JaccoVan Rheenen", "AllaKhashper", "GinaBrown", "HannaNystrom", "MalinSund", "StevenVan Laere", "EvelyneLoyer", "LucDirix", "DavidCunningham", "PeterMetrakos", "Andrew RReynolds"], "doi": "10.1038/nm.4197"}

Because the first embryonic TSPs enter a non-vascularized thymic rudiment, we were able to directly image and establish the functional and molecular properties of embryonic thymopoiesis-initiating progenitors (T-IPs) before their entry into the thymus and activation of Notch signaling. T-IPs did not include multipotent stem cells or molecular evidence of T cell-restricted progenitors. Instead, single-cell molecular and functional analysis demonstrated that most fetal T-IPs expressed genes of and had the potential to develop into lymphoid as well as myeloid components of the immune system.

We report our experience with a stepwise approach including aggressive debridement, jet lavage, vacuum assisted closure dressing, and finally coverage with well-vascularized and immune-active omental flaps in VAD patients with infective mediastinitis. We retrospectively collected and analyzed data of patients with continuous flow VAD who underwent plasty with the omental flap because of mediastinitis at Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin between January 1, 2008 and October 30, 2015. Eight hundred forty-five patients underwent VAD implantation during the study period. Omentoplasty due to infective mediastinitis was performed in 17 cases. Nine had a HeartWare HVAD as left ventricular assist device (LVAD), three patients had two Heart-Ware HVAD as biventricular assist device (BIVAD), four had a HeartMate II LVAD device, and one patient had a Berlin Heart Incor LVAD. The microorganisms most frequently isolated from the sternal wound were Gram-positive Staphylococcus spp. Four cases of bleeding requiring surgical revision were recorded: three of intraabdominal and one of wound bleeding. Eight patients (47%) survived, whereas the other nine patients (53%) died. Sixteen (94%) required intensive care unit admission, and median hospital stay was 21 (1-182) days. Postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis and septic shock requiring vasopressors were associated with hospital mortality (p = 0.009 and p = 0.05, respectively).

VPs (n\u00a0=\u00a012) underwent right ventricular outflow tract substitution using AVC allografts and were studied for 15-month follow-up. VPs were randomized into two groups, receiving AVCs treated with decellularization alone (D; n\u00a0=\u00a06) or decellularization/cryopreservation (DC; n\u00a0=\u00a06), respectively. Serial echocardiography was carried out to follow up hemodynamic function. All explanted AVCs were processed for light and electron microscopy. No signs of dilatation, progressive stenosis, regurgitation, and macroscopic calcification were echocardiographically observed in both D and DC groups. Explanted D grafts exhibited near-normal features, whereas the presence of calcification, inflammatory infiltrates, and disarray of elastic lamellae occurred in some DC grafts. In the unaltered regions of AVCs from both groups, almost complete re-endothelialization was observed for both valve cusps and aorta walls. In addition, side-by-side repopulation by recipient's fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells was paralleled by ongoing tissue remodeling, as revealed by the ultrastructural identification of typical canals of collagen fibrillogenesis and elastogenesis-related features. Incipient neo-vascularization and re-innervation of medial and adventitial tunicae of grafted aortic walls were also detected for both D and DC groups. Cryopreservation did not affect post-implantation AVC hemodynamic behavior and was topically propensive to cell repopulation and tissue renewal, although graft deterioration including calcification was present in several areas.

{"title": "Exposure to high-concentration oxygen in the neonatal period induces abnormal retinal vascular patterning in mice.", "abstract": "The interruption of vascular development could cause structural and functional abnormalities in tissues. We have previously reported that short-term treatment of newborn mice with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors induces abnormal retinal vascular growth and patterns. An exposure of neonatal mice to high-concentration oxygen disturbs normal retinal vascular development. The present study aimed to determine (1) whether vascular abnormalities are observed in the retina of newborn mice exposed to high concentrations of oxygen, and (2) how astrocyte network formation is affected following the exposure to hyperoxia. Newborn (postnatal day 0) mice were exposed to 75% oxygen for 48 or 96 hr. During hyperoxia exposure, VEGF expression decreased, and the onset of retinal vascularization was completely suppressed. After completion of the hyperoxic period, retinal vascularization occurred, but it was delayed in a hyperoxic exposure duration-dependent manner. In retinas of hyperoxia-exposed mice, dense capillary plexuses were found, and the number of arteries and veins decreased. The astrocyte network formation was slightly delayed under hyperoxic conditions, and the network became denser in retinas of mice with an episode of hyperoxia. Expression of VEGF levels in the avascular retina of mice that were exposed to hyperoxia was higher than that of control mice. These results suggest that short-term interruption of the onset of vascular development resulting from the reduction in VEGF signals induces abnormal vascular patterns in the mouse retina. The abnormalities in retinal astrocyte behavior might contribute to the formation of an abnormal retinal vascular growth.", "journal": "Birth defects research.

{"title": "Immune Modulation of Cardiac Repair and Regeneration: The Art of Mending Broken Hearts.", "abstract": "The accumulation of immune cells is among the earliest responses that manifest in the cardiac tissue after injury. Both innate and adaptive immunity coordinate distinct and mutually non-exclusive events governing cardiac repair, including elimination of the cellular debris, compensatory growth of the remaining cardiac tissue, activation of resident or circulating precursor cells, quantitative and qualitative modifications of the vascular network, and formation of a fibrotic scar. The present review summarizes the mounting evidence suggesting that the inflammatory response also guides the regenerative process following cardiac damage. In particular, recent literature has reinforced the central role of monocytes/macrophages in poising the refreshment of cardiomyocytes in myocardial infarction- or apical resection-induced cardiac insult. Macrophages dictate cardiac myocyte renewal through stimulation of preexisting cardiomyocyte proliferation and/or neovascularization. Nevertheless, substantial efforts are required to identify the nature of these macrophage-derived factors as well as the molecular mechanisms engendered by the distinct subsets of macrophages pertaining in the cardiac tissue. Among the growing inflammatory intermediaries that have been recognized as essential player in heart regeneration, we will focus on the role of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-13. Finally, it is likely that within the mayhem of the injured cardiac tissue, additional types of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, will enter the dance to ignite and refresh the broken heart. However, the protective and detrimental inflammatory pathways have been mainly deciphered in animal models.

{"title": "Designer Leptin Receptor Antagonist Allo-aca Inhibits VEGF Effects in Ophthalmic Neoangiogenesis Models.", "abstract": "Experimental and clinical data suggest that pro-angiogenic, pro-inflammatory and mitogenic cytokine leptin can be implicated in ocular neovascularization and other eye pathologies. At least in part, leptin action appears to be mediated through functional interplay with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a potent regulator of neoangiogenesis and vascular leakage with a proven role in conditions such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Accordingly, drugs targeting VEGF are becoming mainstream treatments for these diseases. The crosstalk between leptin and VEGF has been noted in different tissues, but its involvement in the development of eye pathologies is unclear. Leptin is coexpressed with VEGF during ocular neovascularization and can potentiate VEGF synthesis and angiogenic function. However, whether or not VEGF regulates leptin expression or signaling has never been studied. Consequently, we addressed this aspect of leptin/VEGF crosstalk in ocular models, focusing on therapeutic exploration of underlying mechanisms. Here we show, for the first time, that in retinal (RF/6A) and corneal (BCE) endothelial cells, VEGF (100 ng/mL, 24 h) stimulated leptin mRNA synthesis by 70 and 30%, respectively, and protein expression by 56 and 28%, respectively. In parallel, VEGF induced RF/6A and BCE cell growth by 33 and 20%, respectively. In addition, VEGF upregulated chemotaxis and chemokinesis in retinal cells by ~40%. VEGF-dependent proliferation and migration were significantly reduced in the presence of the leptin receptor antagonist, Allo-aca, at 100-250 nmol/L concentrations. Furthermore, Allo-aca suppressed VEGF-dependent long-term (24 h), but not acute (15 min) stimulation of the Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The efficacy of Allo-aca was validated in the rat laser-induced choroidal neovascularization model where the compound (5 \u03bcg/eye) significantly reduced pathological vascularization with the efficacy similar to that of a standard treatment (anti-VEGF antibody, 1 \u03bcg/eye). Cumulatively, our results suggest that chronic exposure to VEGF upregulates leptin expression and function. As leptin can in turn activate VEGF, the increased abundance of both cytokines could amplify pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory environement in the eye.

Iris nevus turns into melanoma in approximately 8% of cases at a mean of 15 years. This case report provides the first description of an iris tumor examined with iris optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) compared to iris fluorescein angiography (IFA). A 60-year-old man with a diagnosis of iris nevus in the left eye was referred to our department for IFA and iris OCTA. The iris vasculature in IFA was visible only in the early phases, but not clearly. OCTA, however, gave visualization of the vascular network and very precisely defined the vessels of the whole lesion, except for the pupillary portion, which was masked by superficial pigment accumulations. IFA and iris OCTA can add information about the vascular architecture compared to slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and anterior-segment OCT. However, IFA is time-consuming and invasive and can - very occasionally - cause serious adverse reactions. In contrast, OCTA defines the texture of the iris vasculature better. In conclusion, OCTA is a new method, easy to execute, needing no dye injection, and provides useful information on the vascular network of iris lesions. It could therefore be helpful in the diagnosis and follow-up of these lesions.", "journal": "Case reports in ophthalmology", "date": "2016-10-30", "authors": ["DavideAllegrini", "GiovanniMontesano", "AlfredoPece"], "doi": "10.1159/000450572"}

MATERIAL AND METHODS OECs were isolated, expanded, characterized, eGFP-transfected and seeded on DBM scaffold and cultured under static or dynamic perfusion conditions, and continuously observed under fluorescence microscope. DBM scaffolds were harvested on day six for RT-PCR and western blot assay to analyze the mRNA and protein expression level of CD34, VE-cadherin, and VEGF. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the tube formation of OECs seeded on DBM scaffolds. RESULTS The results showed the cell density of OECs on DBM was higher when exposed to shear stress generated by a dynamic perfusion system. Shear stress also markedly increased the expression level of VE-cadherin and VEGF and decreased the expression of CD34, at both mRNA and protein levels. SEM showed that the shear-stressed OECs formed tube-like structures inside the pores of DBM scaffolds.

{"title": "Could Sentinel Skin Transplants Have Some Utility in Solid Organ Transplantation?", "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of allograft rejection can be hazardous and challenging. A strategy that has emerged from experience with vascularized composite allografts (VCAs) is the use of sentinel skin transplants (SSTs)-portions of donor skin transplanted synchronously to an allograft. Work in nonhuman animal models and experience with VCAs suggest concordance between rejection occurring in the primary allograft and the SST, and that appearance of rejection in the SST may precede rejection in the primary allograft, permitting early therapeutic intervention that may improve outcomes with lower rates of chronic rejection. The encouraging findings reported in VCA transplantation raise the possibility that SST may also be useful in solid organ transplantation. Some evidence is provided by experience with abdominal wall transplantation in some intestinal and multivisceral transplant recipients. Results from those reports raise the possibility that rejection may manifest in the skin component before emergence in the intestinal allograft, providing a \"lead time\" during which treatment of rejection of the abdominal wall could prevent the emergence of intestinal rejection. It is plausible that these findings may be extrapolated to other solid organ allografts, especially those for which obtaining an accurate diagnosis of acute rejection can be hazardous and challenging, such as the lung or pancreas.

Although current animal models and in vitro cell culture platforms are informative, they have significant shortcomings. Mouse models can reproduce tissue-level and systemic responses to tumor growth and treatments observed in humans, but xenografts from patients often do not grow, or require months to develop. On the other hand, current in vitro assays are useful for studying the molecular bases of tumorigenesis or drug activity, but often lack the appropriate in vivo cell heterogeneity and natural microenvironment. Therefore, there is a need for novel tools that allow rapid analysis of patient-derived tumors in a robust and representative microenvironment. We have developed methodology for maintaining harvested tumor tissue in vitro by placing them in a support bed with self-assembled stroma and vasculature. The harvested biopsy or tumor explant integrates with the stromal bed and vasculature, providing the correct extracellular matrix (collagen I, IV, fibronectin), associated stromal cells, and a lumenized vessel network.

At the time it was a brilliant concept and breakthrough. In the last decade, the DRIL procedure has become less used. With the increasing age of the dialysis population, patients developing AVAIS are more likely to be elderly with advanced peripheral arterial disease, making the distal revascularization anastomosis difficult and risky if not impossible to perform. In addition, the distal ligation of the main artery to the arm is something most surgeons are reluctant to do. The occlusion of the arterial bypass over time is not uncommon with recurrence of hand ischemia. The multistep DRIL procedure requires general anesthesia and the need to harvest the saphenous vein for the bypass, add to the surgical risk in patients with multiple co-morbidities. For these reasons, some surgeons prefer to do only the DR (distal re-vascularization) portion of the procedure omitting the IL (interval ligation). Increasing the bypass distance from the original anastomosis, makes this modification similar to the less invasive proximal arterial inflow (PAI) procedure.

In this study, we assessed wound and tumor vascularization in mice with genetic ablation of both integrin subunits \u03b11 and \u03b12, which resulted in loss of integrins \u03b11\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21.

Angiogenesis induced by tumors arising from intradermal injection of B16 F1 melanoma cells was also reduced in comparison to controls 7 days after injection. This reduction in angiogenesis correlated with increased levels and activity of circulating matrix metalloproteinase 9 and elevated angiostatin levels in plasma of mutant mice, which reduced endothelial cell proliferation.

{"title": "Exercise during pregnancy in normal-weight women and risk of preterm birth: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled\u00a0trials.", "abstract": "Preterm birth is the major cause of perinatal mortality in the United States. In the past, pregnant women have been recommended to not exercise because of presumed risks of preterm birth. Physical activity has been theoretically related to preterm birth because it increases the release of catecholamines, especially norepinephrine, which might stimulate myometrial activity. Conversely, exercise may reduce the risk of preterm birth by other mechanisms such as decreased oxidative stress or improved placenta vascularization. Therefore, the safety of exercise regarding preterm birth and its effects on gestational age at delivery remain controversial.\nThe objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of exercise during pregnancy on the risk of preterm birth.\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, Scopus, ClinicalTrial.gov, OVID, and Cochrane Library were searched from the inception of each database to April\u00a02016.\nSelection criteria included only randomized clinical trials of pregnant women randomized before 23 weeks to an aerobic exercise regimen or not. Types of participants included women of normal weight with uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies without any obstetric contraindication to physical activity. The summary measures were reported as relative risk or as mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. The primary outcome was the incidence of preterm birth <37 weeks.\nOf the 2059 women included in the meta-analysis, 1022 (49.6%) were randomized to the exercise group and 1037 (50.4%) to the control group. Aerobic exercise lasted about 35-90 minutes 3-4 times per week. Women who were randomized to aerobic exercise had a similar incidence of preterm birth of <37 weeks (4.5% vs 4.4%; relative risk, 1.01, 95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.50) and a similar mean gestational age at delivery (mean difference, 0.05 week, 95% confidence interval, -0.07 to 0.17) compared with controls. Women in the exercise group had a significantly higher incidence of vaginal delivery (73.6% vs 67.5%; relative risk, 1.09, 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.15) and a significantly lower incidence of cesarean delivery (17.9% vs 22%; relative risk, 0.82, 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.97) compared with controls. The incidence of operative vaginal delivery (12.9% vs 16.5%; relative risk, 0.78, 95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.01) was similar in both groups. Women in the exercise group had a significantly lower incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (2.9% vs 5.6%; relative risk, 0.51, 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.82) and a significantly lower incidence of hypertensive disorders (1.0% vs 5.6%; relative risk, 0.21, 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.45) compared with controls.

{"title": "The Role of Klotho Protein in Chronic Kidney Disease: Studies in Animals and Humans.", "abstract": "The identification of Klotho gene was a major discovery as the gene encodes a protein regulating multiple functions. A defect in Klotho gene expression in mice results in a phenotype of premature aging including shortened life span, growth retardation, hypogonadism, skin and muscle atrophies, vascular calcification, cognition impairment, motor neuron degeneration and others. This phenotype is associated with phosphate balance disorders and underlines the major function of Klotho in mineral metabolism. As another 2 related paralogs were discovered (beta-Klotho, which is involved in bile acid and energy metabolism, and gamma-Klotho, with a yet to be defined function), this led to the revised naming of Klotho as alpha-Klotho. Two forms of alpha-Klotho protein have been reported: a membrane-bound and a soluble one. Membrane Klotho forms a complex with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors and functions as an obligate co-receptor for the FGF-23 phosphatonin in distal tubules. The soluble form of Klotho seems to function as a humoral factor and regulates glycoproteins on the cell surface including ion channels and growth factors. There is data suggesting that soluble Klotho exerts phosphaturic effects independently of FGF-23. Circulating soluble Klotho is produced either by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of the transmembrane form by two membrane-anchored proteases (ADAM10 and ADAM17) or by alternative mRNA splicing. In animal models Klotho has been shown to exert pleiotropic actions, including cytoprotection, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis, protection of vasculature, promotion of angiogenesis and vascularization, inhibition of fibrogenesis and preservation of stem cells.

{"title": "Resveratrol Reverses Functional Chagas Heart Disease in Mice.", "abstract": "Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) develops years after acute infection by Trypanosoma cruzi and does not improve after trypanocidal therapy, despite reduction of parasite burden. During disease, the heart undergoes oxidative stress, a potential causative factor for arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction. Here we tested whether antioxidants/ cardioprotective drugs could improve cardiac function in established Chagas heart disease. We chose a model that resembles B1-B2 stage of human CCC, treated mice with resveratrol and performed electrocardiography and echocardiography studies. Resveratrol reduced the prolonged PR and QTc intervals, increased heart rates and reversed sinus arrhythmia, atrial and atrioventricular conduction disorders; restored a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, improved stroke volume and cardiac output. Resveratrol activated the AMPK-pathway and reduced both ROS production and heart parasite burden, without interfering with vascularization or myocarditis intensity. Resveratrol was even capable of improving heart function of infected mice when treatment was started late after infection, while trypanocidal drug benznidazole failed. We attempted to mimic resveratrol's actions using metformin (AMPK-activator) or tempol (SOD-mimetic).

However, the bio-inert nature of titanium alloy is poorly compatible with bone ingrowth. We previously observed that simvastatin/poloxamer 407 thermosensitive hydrogel induces endogenous angiogenic/osteogenic growth factors and promotes angiogenesis and osteogenesis, but the mechanical properties of this hydrogel are poor. The purpose of this study was to construct 3D-printed porous titanium scaffolds (pTi scaffolds) filled with simvastatin/hydrogel and evaluate the effects of this composite on osseointegration, bone ingrowth and neovascularization using a tibial defect rabbit model. Four and eight weeks after implantation, the bone volume, bone mineral density, mineral apposition rate, and push-in maximum force of the pTi scaffolds filled with simvastatin/hydrogel were significantly higher than those without simvastatin (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, filling with simvastatin/hydrogel significantly enhanced vascularization in and around the pTi scaffolds, and a significant correlation was observed between the volume of new bone and neovascularization (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

Vascularized bone grafts are proposed to augment the local biology and increase the likelihood of union but long-term outcomes are sparse. In this work, we present the mid- to long-term outcome of 140 scaphoid nonunions managed with vascularized bone grafts from the distal radius. Sixteen patients underwent concomitant closed wedge osteotomy of the distal radius because of arthritic changes. There were 130 males and ten females, with mean time from injury to surgery 3.3\u00a0years. Delayed presentation was associated with arthritic changes. Forty-two patients had avascular necrosis of the proximal pole and sixteen had more severe arthritic changes. The mean follow-up was 10\u00a0years. Pain decreased postoperatively but range of motion did not improve but only in early reconstructions. Grip strength reached 79% of the non-injured hand. Mayo modified wrist score improved from 56 to 84 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Except one, all the rest 139 nonunions healed in a mean time of 9\u00a0weeks.

We report on porcine decellularized liver scaffolds (DLSs) heparinized by the end-point attachment (EPA) technique. The heparinized DLSs (HEP-DLSs) have the ability to bind and slowly release heparin-binding growth factors. We hypothesized that DLS-immobilized heparin acts as an antithrombotic coating reagent and binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to induce angiogenesis in the DLSs. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) seeded on HEP-VEGF-DLSs attached and remained bioactive. Using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, we found that the HEP-VEGF-DLSs induced a significant and rapid enhancement of angiogenesis compared with native DLSs. Scaffolds were implanted in the greater omentum of rats and evaluated after 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. There were significant increases in the numbers of blood vessels in the HEP-VEGF-DLSs compared with native DLSs at all time-points.

The greater omentum has in several experimental studies been suggested as an alternative implantation site for clinical use, but there has been no direct functional comparison to the liver. In this experimental study in mice, we characterized the engraftment of mouse and human islets in the omentum and compared engraftment and functional outcome with those in the intraportal site. The vascularization and innervation of the islets transplanted into the omentum were restored within the first month by paralleled ingrowth of capillaries and nerves. The hypoxic conditions in the islets early posttransplantation were transient and restricted to the first days. Newly formed blood vessels were fully functional, and the blood perfusion and oxygenation of the islets became similar to that of endogenous islets. Furthermore, islet grafts in the omentum showed at 1 month posttransplantation functional superiority to intraportally transplanted grafts.

{"title": "Targeting the Notch Pathway to Prevent Rejection.", "abstract": "Immune rejection is mediated by a complex interplay of cellular and humoral mechanisms. Current therapeutic strategies, which rely on global immunosuppression, can result in serious complications and are not completely effective. Notch signaling is a cell-to-cell communication pathway that plays an important role during T cell development and in the regulation of peripheral immune responses. Initial work, performed mainly through gain-of-function approaches, paradoxically identified Notch as an inducer of tolerance; however, recent studies using loss-of-function approaches in mouse models of transplant rejection and graft-versus-host disease have clarified an important role for Notch as a central mediator of T cell alloreactivity. Short-term inhibition of individual Notch ligands in the peritransplant period had long-lasting protective effects. In a vascularized heart allograft model, blockade of Delta-like Notch ligands dampened both cellular and humoral rejection. In this minireview, we summarize current knowledge about the role of Notch signaling during allograft rejection and provide an overarching mechanism through which Notch acts to promote T cell pathogenicity and allograft damage.

{"title": "The Present and Future for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration.", "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury can have a potentially devastating impact on a patient's quality of life, resulting in severe disability with substantial social and personal cost. Refined microsurgical techniques, advances in peripheral nerve topography, and a better understanding of the pathophysiology and molecular basis of nerve injury have all led to a decisive leap forward in the field of translational neurophysiology. Nerve repair, nerve grafting, and nerve transfers have improved significantly with consistently better functional outcomes. Direct nerve repair with epineural microsutures is still the surgical treatment of choice when a tension-free coaptation in a well-vascularized bed can be achieved. In the presence of a significant gap (>2-3 cm) between the proximal and distal nerve stumps, primary end-to-end nerve repair often is not possible; in these cases, nerve grafting is the treatment of choice. Indications for nerve transfer include brachial plexus injuries, especially avulsion type, with long distance from target motor end plates, delayed presentation, segmental loss of nerve function, and broad zone of injury with dense scarring. Current experimental research in peripheral nerve regeneration aims to accelerate the process of regeneration using pharmacologic agents, bioengineering of sophisticated nerve conduits, pluripotent stem cells, and gene therapy. Several small molecules, peptides, hormones, neurotoxins, and growth factors have been studied to improve and accelerate nerve repair and regeneration by reducing neuronal death and promoting axonal outgrowth. Targeting specific steps in molecular pathways also allows for purposeful pharmacologic intervention, potentially leading to a better functional recovery after nerve injury. This article summarizes the principles of nerve repair and the current concepts of peripheral nerve regeneration research, as well as future perspectives.

Serum samples were collected from 48 patients whose teeth were clinically recommended for surgical extraction. The group comprised an equal number of males and females, mostly agriculture workers and housewives, respectively. The majority (64.6%) received less than one minimum wage and were ill educated (less than four years of school years). An enzyme immune assay was used to detect antibodies to HCV and the 9 (18.8%) positive samples were submitted to nucleic acid extraction in the blood (using the EXTRAzol) and the pulp (QIAamp DNA Micro Kit e kit RNeasy Plus Micro).

Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates inhibit prenylation of small G-proteins (e.g. Ras, Rac, Rho) and thus may affect proliferation and migration. In our preclinical work, we investigated the effect of an aminobisphosphonate compound (zoledronic acid) on mutant and wild type KRAS-expressing human NSCLC cell lines.\nWe confirmed that zoledronic acid was unable to inhibit the prenylation of mutant K-Ras unlike in the case of wild type K-Ras. In case of in vitro proliferation, the KRAS-mutant human NSCLC cell lines showed resistance to zoledronic acid wild-type KRAS-cells proved to be sensitive. Combinatory application of zoledronic acid enhanced the cytostatic effect of cisplatin. Zoledronic acid did not induce significant apoptosis. In xenograft model, zoledronic acid significantly reduced the weight of wild type KRAS-EGFR-expressing xenograft tumor by decreasing the proliferative capacity. Futhermore, zoledronic acid induced VEGF expression and improved in vivo tumor vascularization.\nMembrane association of K-Ras was examined by Western-blot. In vitro cell viability, apoptotic cell death and migration were measured in NSCLC lines with different molecular background. The in vivo effect of zoledronic acid was investigated in a SCID mouse subcutaneous xenograft model.\nThe in vitro and in vivo inhibitory effect of zoledronic acid was based on the blockade of cell cycle in wild type KRAS-expressing human NSCLC cells.

{"title": "Skeletonization algorithm-based blood vessel quantification using in vivo 3D photoacoustic imaging.", "abstract": "Blood vessels are the only system to provide nutrients and oxygen to every part of the body. Many diseases can have significant effects on blood vessel formation, so that the vascular network can be a cue to assess malicious tumor and ischemic tissues. Various imaging techniques can visualize blood vessel structure, but their applications are often constrained by either expensive costs, contrast agents, ionizing radiations, or a combination of the above. Photoacoustic imaging combines the high-contrast and spectroscopic-based specificity of optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging, and image contrast depends on optical absorption. This enables the detection of light absorbing chromophores such as hemoglobin with a greater penetration depth compared to purely optical techniques. We present here a skeletonization algorithm for vessel architectural analysis using non-invasive photoacoustic 3D images acquired without the administration of any exogenous contrast agents. 3D photoacoustic images were acquired on rats (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20094) in two different time points: before and after a burn surgery. A skeletonization technique based on the application of a vesselness filter and medial axis extraction is proposed to extract the vessel structure from the image data and six vascular parameters (number of vascular trees (NT), vascular density (VD), number of branches (NB), 2D distance metric (DM), inflection count metric (ICM), and sum of angles metric (SOAM)) were calculated from the skeleton. The parameters were compared (1) in locations with and without the burn wound on the same day and (2) in the same anatomic location before (control) and after the burn surgery. Four out of the six descriptors were statistically different (VD, NB, DM, ICM, p\u2009\u2009<\u2009\u20090.05) when comparing two anatomic locations on the same day and when considering the same anatomic location at two separate times (i.e. before and after burn surgery).

{"title": "From glioblastoma to endothelial cells through extracellular vesicles: messages for angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma has one of the highest mortality rates among cancers, and it is the most common and malignant form of brain cancer. Among the typical features of glioblastoma tumors, there is an aberrant vascularization: all gliomas are among the most vascularized/angiogenic tumors. In recent years, it has become clear that glioblastoma cells can secrete extracellular vesicles which are spherical and membrane-enclosed particles released, in vitro or in vivo, by both normal and tumor cells; they are involved in the regulation of both physiological and pathological processes; among the latter, cancer is the most widely studied. Extracellular vesicles from tumor cells convey messages to other tumor cells, but also to normal stromal cells in order to create a microenvironment that supports cancer growth and progression and are implicated in drug resistance, escape from immunosurveillance and from apoptosis, as well as in metastasis formation; they are also involved in angiogenesis stimulation, inducing endothelial cells proliferation, and other pro-angiogenic activities. To this aim, the present paper assesses in detail the extracellular vesicles phenomenon in the human glioblastoma cell line U251 and evaluates extracellular vesicles ability to promote the processes required to achieve the formation of new blood vessels in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, highlighting that they stimulate proliferation, motility, and tube formation in a dose-response manner. Moreover, a molecular characterization shows that extracellular vesicles are fully equipped for angiogenesis stimulation in terms of proteolytic enzymes (gelatinases and plasminogen activators), pro-angiogenic growth factors (VEGF and TGF\u03b2), and the promoting-angiogenic CXCR4 chemokine receptor.", "journal": "Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine", "date": "2016-10-27", "authors": ["IlariaGiusti", "SimonaDelle Monache", "MariannaDi Francesco", "PatriziaSanit\u00e0", "SandraD'Ascenzo", "Giovanni LucaGravina", "ClaudioFestuccia", "VincenzaDolo"], "doi": "10.1007/s13277-016-5165-0"}

LIM-only protein 4 (LMO4) and LIM-domain binding protein 1 (LDB1), two directly interacting transcriptional adaptors that have important roles in normal epithelial cell differentiation, have been associated with increased metastasis, decreased differentiation, and shortened survival in carcinoma of the breast. Here, we implicate two LDB1-binding proteins, single-stranded binding protein 2 (SSBP2) and 3 (SSBP3), in controlling LMO4 and LDB1 protein abundance in HNSCC and in regulating specific tumor cell functions in this disease. First, we found that the relative abundance of LMO4, LDB1, and the two SSBPs correlated very significantly in a panel of human HNSCC cell lines. Second, expression of these proteins in tumor primaries and lymph nodes involved by metastasis were concordant in 3 of 3 sets of tissue. Third, using a Matrigel invasion and organotypic reconstruct assay, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of LDB1 in the VU-SCC-1729 cell line, which is highly invasive of basement membrane and cellular monolayers, reduced tumor cell invasiveness and migration, as well as proliferation on tissue culture plastic. Finally, inactivation of the LDB1 gene in these cells decreased growth and vascularization of xenografted human tumor cells in vivo. These data show that LMO4, LDB1, and SSBP2 and/or SSBP3 regulate metastasis, proliferation, and angiogenesis in HNSCC and provide the first evidence that SSBPs control LMO4 and LDB1 protein abundance in a cancer context.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-10-26", "authors": ["Elizabeth ASimonik", "YingCai", "Katherine NKimmelshue", "Dana MBrantley-Sieders", "Holli ALoomans", "Claudia DAndl", "Grant MWestlake", "Victoria MYoungblood", "JinChen", "Wendell GYarbrough", "Brandee TBrown", "LalithaNagarajan", "Stephen JBrandt"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0164804\n10.1172/JCI59889\n10.1126/science.1206923\n10.1126/science.1207203\n10.1073/pnas.1416074111\n10.1073/pnas.0502990102\n10.1073/pnas.251547698\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4511-12.2013\n10.1016/j.mcn.2004.04.010\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.10.034\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2011.03765.x\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6600952\n10.3892/ijo.2011.921\n10.1038/onc.2009.221\n10.1007/s10585-010-9332-1\n10.1002/path.2109\n10.1101/gad.1528507\n10.1074/jbc.M110603200\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208167\n10.1016/j.joms.2013.02.019\n10.1126/science.1246981\n10.1128/MCB.23.21.7585-7599.2003\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3396.\n10.1038/35036374\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-14-0142\n10.1016/j.canlet.2009.01.033\n10.3892/or.2014.3209\n10.4317/medoral.19076\n10.1128/MCB.23.21.7585-7599.2003\n10.1074/jbc.M209148200\n10.1016/j.molcel.2009.11.002\n10.1101/gr.164830.113\n10.1182/blood-2008-07-169417\n10.1155/2012/450179\n10.1038/onc.2010.306\n10.1038/onc.2016.1\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2012.05.003\n10.1146/annurev.cellbio.042308.113231\n10.1038/cdd.2015.7\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2778\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4763\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2013.09.006\n10.1097/CCO.0000000000000072\n10.1016/j.oraloncology.2013.09.008\n10.1002/cam4.424\n10.1038/ni.1978\n10.4049/jimmunol.1300337\n10.1200/JCO.2007.15.1613\n10.1038/onc.2011.184\n10.3892/ijo.2014.2362\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2009.09.001\n10.1016/j.canlet.2014.12.013\n10.1038/sj.onc.1205285\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2010.03676.x\n10.1073/pnas.0703738104\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.06.027"}

Patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes were analyzed. After trauma, 39 (34.2%) patients developed wound infections, of which 74.4 per cent of infections occurred before soft tissue coverage.

In Type 1, both feeder and draining vessels are visible on ICGA and network vessels are numerous. In Type 2, neither feeder nor draining vessels are detectable, and the number of network vessels is small. The patients were treated with intravitreal conbercept (IVC) for 3 months.

The multiple role of NO in physiology and pathophysiology has triggered a massive interest in the strategies of delivering exogenous NO for biomedical applications. Hence, different kinds of NO prodrugs have been developed up to date, including diazeniumdiolates, S-nitrosothiol, metal-nitrosyl, nitrobenzene, and so on. However, the clinical application of these low molecular weight NO donors has been restricted due to the problems of burst release, low payloads, and untargeted delivery. The delivery of NO by biomaterialbased carrier offers a beneficial strategy to realize the controlled and sustained delivery of NO to the targeted tissues or organs. In detail, NO-donor prodrugs have been attached and loaded to diverse biomaterials to fabricate nanoparticles, hydrogels, and coating platforms by means of physical, chemical, or supramolecular techniques. These NO-releasing biomaterials hold promise for a number of biomedical applications ranging from therapy of the ischemic disease and several types of cancer to cardiovascular devices and wound dressing. First, surface coating with NO-releasing biomaterials could mimic the physiological function of vascular endothelium, therefore promoting vascularization and improving the patency of cardiovascular implants. Next, because NO also mediates many important processes that take place after cutaneous injury, NO-releasing biomaterials could serve as ideal wound dressing to accelerate tissue regeneration. Finally, biomaterials enable localized delivery of high dose of NO to tumors in a sustained manner, thus generating potent tumoricidal effect.

{"title": "Ts14 from Tityus serrulatus boosts angiogenesis and attenuates inflammation and collagen deposition in sponge-induced granulation tissue in mice.", "abstract": "We have previously described a 25mer anti-hypertensive peptide, previously named TsHpt-I (Tityus serrulatus Hypotensin-I), now Ts14, as an agonist of B2 kinin receptor. Bradykinin is known to play physiological roles in angiogenic, inflammatory, and fibrogenic processes, mostly mediated by B2 receptor. Therefore, we investigated whether Ts14 could modulate key events (neovascularization, inflammatory cell recruitment, and extracellular matrix deposition) of the fibrovascular tissue, induced by polyether-polyurethane sponge implants in mice. Sponges were implanted in the dorsum of 7-week-old C57Bl/6 male mice that received daily intrasponge treatment with Ts14 (27.25\u03bcg/sponge/day in 10\u03bcL PBS) or vehicle (10\u03bcL PBS/sponge/day) and were assessed on day 7 after surgery. Hemoglobin content, blood flow (laser Doppler perfusion imaging), and VEGF levels in the implants, used as indices of vascularization, indicated that Ts14 enhanced angiogenesis in implants relative to the PBS-treated group. Interestingly, Ts14 reduced TNF-\u03b1 levels and neutrophil infiltration, although stimulated macrophage infiltration into implants, as determined by myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) enzyme activities, respectively. Regarding the fibrogenic component (soluble collagen content and Sirius-red histological staining), we observed that Ts14 inhibited collagen deposition in the implants. Overall, our results suggest that Ts14 exerts proangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrogenic activities. These effects may indicate a therapeutical potential of this peptide in conditions where angiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrogenesis contribute to disease progression and chronicity.", "journal": "Peptides", "date": "2016-10-25", "authors": ["PueblaCassini-Vieira", "MarianeFelipetto", "Leandro BarbosaPrado", "ThiagoVerano-Braga", "Silvia PassosAndrade", "Robson A SSantos", "Mauro MartinsTeixeira", "Maria Elenade Lima", "Adriano M CPimenta", "Luciola SilvaBarcelos"], "doi": "10.1016/j.peptides.2016.10.002"}

The expression of TGF-\u03b21 and ALK5 mRNA and protein were significantly increased in D5 hyperoxia group, while that of ALK1 mRNA and protein were significantly decreased. The level of phosphorylated Smad1/5 was significantly decreased in D7 hyperoxia group, whereas that of phosphorylated Smad2/3 was oppositely increased. In addition, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA was increased at D1 with subsequent decrease in D7 hyperoxia group.

Neurological examination revealed severe hearing loss in the left ear. Radiologic examination presented a round mass in the left PA and significant fluid collection in the mastoid air cells of the left temporal bone.

Clinical trials have included small numbers of patients and results have varied depending on the patient cohorts and the cells used. Results of preclinical studies have also varied but show a more favorable outcome. This difference was most likely explained by the fact that animal modeling is not directly translatable to the human condition. However, preclinical studies have identified an exciting new approach to regeneration of the urinary sphincter using the components of cells (secretomes) or chemokines that home reparative cells to sites of injury.\nCell therapy will continue to be explored.

We questioned whether physiologic levels of anti-inflammatory A20 influence TA severity.\nWe performed major histocompatibility complex mismatched aorta to carotid artery interposition grafts, using wild type (WT) or A20 heterozygote (HET) C57BL/6 (H-2) donors and BALB/c (H-2) recipients, and conversely BALB/c donors and WT/HET recipients. We analyzed aortic allografts by histology, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and gene profiling (quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). We validated select in vivo A20 targets in human and mouse smooth muscle cell (SMC) cultures.\nWe noted significantly greater intimal hyperplasia in HET versus WT allografts, indicating aggravated TA. Inadequate upregulation of A20 in HET allografts after transplantation was associated with excessive NF-\u043aB activation, gauged by higher levels of IkB\u03b1, p65, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, CXCL10, CCL2, TNF, and IL-6 (mostly localized to SMC). Correspondingly, cytokine-induced upregulation of TNF and IL-6 in human and mouse SMC cultures inversely correlated with A20 expression. Aggravated TA in HET versus WT allografts correlated with increased intimal SMC proliferation, and a higher number of infiltrating IFN\u03b3 and Granzyme B CD4 T cells and natural killer cells, and lower number of FoxP3 regulatory T cells. A20 haploinsufficiency in allograft recipients did not influence TA.\nA20 haploinsufficiency in vascular allografts aggravates lesions of TA by exacerbating inflammation, SMC proliferation, and infiltration of pathogenic T cells.

We found 2 distinct growth patterns of UM metastasis: infiltrative (n = 12) and nodular (n = 3). In the infiltrative pattern, individual UM cells with a CD133+ cancer stem cell-like phenotype were present and formed aggregates of stage I <50-\u03bcm-diameter micrometastases in the sinusoidal spaces. These micrometastases appeared to expand, destroy adjacent hepatocytes, and form stage II 51- to 500-\u03bcm-diameter and then stage III >500\u03bcm-diameter metastases, which were encapsulated by collagenized fibrous septae. In the nodular growth pattern, CD133+ melanoma cells aggregated adjacent to portal venules and subsequently appeared to grow and efface the adjacent hepatocytes to form stage II 51- to 500-\u03bcm-diameter nodules that surrounded the portal venule. These avascular nodules appeared to further expand to form stage III >500-\u03bcm-diameter nodules that exhibited vascularization with minimal fibrosis. The tumor stem cell-like phenotype seen in individual UM cells was lost as the tumors progressed. There were CD56+ natural killer cells in sinusoidal spaces and CD3+ lymphocytes in periportal areas. The nodular growth pattern showed UM cells expressing MMP9 and VEGF. UM cells in both above-described growth patterns exhibited variable BAP1 expression.

True vascular malformations are divided according to their flow. Low flow lesions are venous (orbital varix), capillarovenous or lymphatic (lymphangioma). High flow malformations, more rare, are either arteriovenous or arterial malformations (aneurisms). Complex malformations include both low and high flow elements. Lesions leading to modifications of the orbito-palpebral blood flow are mainly due to cavernous sinus abnormalities, either direct carotid-cavernous fistula affecting young adults after severe head trauma, or dural fistula, more insidious, found in older adults. The last section is devoted to congenital syndromic vascular malformations (Sturge-Weber, Rendu-Olser\u2026). This classification allows for a better understanding of these pathologies and their specific imaging features.", "journal": "Journal francais d'ophtalmologie", "date": "2016-10-23", "authors": ["FHeran Dreyfus", "OGalatoire", "PKoskas", "FLafitte", "ENau", "OBerg\u00e8s"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jfo.2016.07.007"}

Angiogenesis and rapid growth of vasculature in velvet antler cartilage (VAC) make it an ideal model for discovering the novel angiogenic regulatory factors. However, the proteomic analysis of VAC is challenging due to the serious interference of proteoglycans (PGs) and collagens. To achieve a comprehensive proteome characterization of VAC, herein, we developed an ionic liquid-based method using 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C12-mim]Cl) for selective extraction of cellular proteins from VAC. Compared with the previous cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)-based method, the developed [C12-mim]Cl-based method takes much less processing time, shows facile preparation procedure and good compatibility towards downstream proteomic analysis, leading to the identification of more protein groups (1543 vs 753), membrane proteins (663 vs 279) and transmembrane proteins (217 vs 58).", "journal": "Talanta", "date": "2016-10-23", "authors": ["ZhigangSui", "YejingWeng", "QunZhao", "NanDeng", "FeiFang", "XudongZhu", "YichuShan", "LihuaZhang", "YukuiZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.talanta.2016.08.083"}

Analytical chemistry methods do not permit in situ analysis of Gln, including visualization within the vascular network. Their cost and tissue requirement are barriers to exploring the complexity of Gln dynamics. We previously reported a biosensor, GlnLux, which can measure relative Gln levels inexpensively with tiny amounts of tissue.\nHere, maize seedlings were given different N rates for multiple uptake/assimilation durations, after which >\u20091500 leaf disk extracts were analyzed. A second technique permitted in situ imaging of Gln for all leaves sampled simultaneously. We demonstrate that multifactorial interactions govern Gln accumulation involving position within each leaf (mediolateral/proximodistal), location of leaves along the shoot axis, N rate, and uptake duration. In situ imaging localized Gln in leaf veins for the first time. A novel hypothesis is that leaf Gln may flow along preferential vascular routes, for example in response to mechanical damage or metabolic needs.\nThe GlnLux technology enabled the most detailed map of relative Gln accumulation in any plant, and the first report of in situ Gln at vein-level resolution.

{"title": "A dynamic, sex-specific expression pattern of genes regulating thyroid hormone action in the developing zebra finch song control system.", "abstract": "The zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) song control system consists of several series of interconnected brain nuclei that undergo marked changes during ontogeny and sexual development, making it an excellent model to study developmental neuroplasticity. Despite the demonstrated influence of hormones such as sex steroids on this phenomenon, thyroid hormones (THs) - an important factor in neural development and maturation - have not been studied in this regard. We used in situ hybridization to compare the expression of TH transporters, deiodinases and receptors between both sexes during all phases of song development in male zebra finch. Comparisons were made in four song control nuclei: Area X, the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN), HVC (used as proper name) and the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). Most genes regulating TH action are expressed in these four nuclei at early stages of development. However, while general expression levels decrease with age, the activating enzyme deiodinase type 2 remains highly expressed in Area X, HVC and RA in males, but not in females, until 90days post-hatch (dph), which marks the end of sensorimotor learning. Furthermore, the L-type amino acid transporter 1 and TH receptor beta show elevated expression in male HVC and RA respectively compared to surrounding tissue until adulthood. Differences compared to surrounding tissue and between sexes for the other TH regulators were minor. These developmental changes are accompanied by a strong local increase in vascularization in the male RA between 20 and 30dph but not in Area X or HVC. Our results suggest that local regulation of TH signaling is an important factor in the development of the song control nuclei during the song learning phase and that TH activation by DIO2 is a key player in this process.", "journal": "General and comparative endocrinology", "date": "2016-10-23", "authors": ["Sander RRaymaekers", "WoutVerbeure", "Sita MTer Haar", "Charlotte ACornil", "JacquesBalthazart", "Veerle MDarras"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ygcen.2016.09.016"}

Leptin protein expression was elevated in C-PVAT compared to IMA-PVAT, independent of serum leptin levels. Compared to IMA-PVAT, C-PVAT exhibited more pronounced angiogenesis and inflammation, as indicated by significantly higher numbers of PECAM1-positive vessels and CD68-positive macrophages, and was characterized by a greater extent of fibrosis and hypoxia. Increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 and Fos-like antigen (FOSL)2, factors known to enhance leptin gene transcription, was observed in C-PVAT. As a proof of concept, exposure of human adipocytes to chemical hypoxia resulted in significantly increased FOSL2 and leptin mRNA levels.\nA higher degree of local tissue hypoxia and up-regulation of leptin expression in the perivascular adipose tissue, along with increased vascularization, inflammation, and fibrosis, may contribute to the increased atherosclerotic plaque burden in the coronary arteries compared to the IMA.", "journal": "Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society", "date": "2016-10-23", "authors": ["IoannisDrosos", "GeorgiosChalikias", "MariaPavlaki", "DimitraKareli", "GrigoriosEpitropou", "GeorgiosBougioukas", "DimitriosMikroulis", "FotiosKonstantinou", "AlexandraGiatromanolaki", "KonstantinosRitis", "ThomasM\u00fcnzel", "DimitriosTziakas", "StavrosKonstantinides", "KatrinSch\u00e4fer"], "doi": "10.1007/s00392-016-0996-7"}

In three independent tumor types including breast cancer, melanoma, and fibrosarcoma, inoculation of tumor cells in the subcutaneous tissue, white adipose tissue (WAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) resulted in markedly differential tumor growth rates and angiogenesis, which were in concordance with the degree of pre-existing vascularization in these tissues.

In this study, we analyzed FOXO3-phosphorylation and cellular localization in tumor biopsies and determined the function of this homeostasis regulator in vitro and in vivo. FOXO3-phosphorylation at threonine-32 (T32) and nuclear localization in biopsies significantly correlated with stage IV disease. DNA-damaging drugs induced nuclear accumulation of FOXO3, which was associated with elevated T32-phosphorylation in stage IV-derived neuroblastoma cells, thereby reflecting the in situ results. In contrast, hypoxic conditions repressed PKB-activity and caused dephosphorylation of FOXO3 in both, stroma-like SH-EP and high-stage-derived STA-NB15 cells. The activation of an ectopically-expressed FOXO3 in these cells reduced viability at normoxia, but promoted growth at hypoxic conditions and elevated VEGF-C-expression. In chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays STA-NB15 tumors with ectopic FOXO3 showed increased micro-vessel formation and, when xenografted into nude mice, a gene-dosage-dependent effect of FOXO3 in high-stage STA-NB15 cells became evident: low-level activation increased tumor-vascularization, whereas hyper-activation repressed tumor growth.The combined data suggest that, depending on the mode and intensity of activation, cellular FOXO3 acts as a homeostasis regulator promoting tumor growth at hypoxic conditions and tumor angiogenesis in high-stage neuroblastoma.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-10-22", "authors": ["JudithHagenbuchner", "MartinaRupp", "ChristinaSalvador", "BernhardMeister", "UrsulaKiechl-Kohlendorfer", "ThomasM\u00fcller", "KathrinGeiger", "ConsolatoSergi", "PetraObexer", "Michael JAusserlechner"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.12728\n10.18632/oncotarget.953\n10.18632/oncotarget.1147"}

Alendronate, a well-known antiresorptive agent, was formulated into microspheres under optimized conditions and effectively loaded within the novel multifunctional scaffolds with a high encapsulation percentage. The size of the cation used for the alginate crosslinking impacted directly on porosity and viscoelastic properties, and thus, on the degradation rate and the release profile of copper, calcium and alendronate. According to this, even though highly porous structures were created with suitable pore sizes for cell ingrowth and vascularization in both cases, copper-crosslinked scaffolds showed higher values of porosity, elastic modulus, degradation rate and the amount of copper and alendronate released, when compared with calcium-crosslinked scaffolds. In addition, in all cases, the scaffolds showed bioactivity and mechanical properties close to the endogenous trabecular bone tissue in terms of viscoelasticity. Furthermore, the scaffolds showed osteogenic and angiogenic properties on bone and endothelial cells, respectively, and the extracts of the biomaterials used promoted the formation of blood vessels in an ex vivo model.

Women who are affected by this syndrome suffer from irregular menstrual cycles, decline in their fertility, excessive hair growth, obesity, acne and most importantly cardiac function problems. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a pivotal role in tissue vascularization in general and in the pathogenesis of many diseases. The PCOS was found to be associated with high expression levels of VEGF. In women who undergo assisted reproductive procedures (ART), VEGF was found to be a key mediator of other factors to control ovary angiogenesis. Here, we set out to examine the association of VEGFA gene polymorphism with PCOS and its components in a population of Tunisia women to enhance our understanding of the genetic background leading angiogenesis and vascularization abnormalities in PCOS.\nThe association of VEGFA gene with PCOS and its components was examined in a cohort of 268 women from Tunisia involving 118 PCOS patients and 150 controls. VEGFA gene variations were assessed through the analysis of the following SNPs rs699947 (A/C), rs833061 (C/T), rs1570360 (G/A), rs833068 (G/A), rs3025020 (C/T), and rs3025039 (C/T). The linkage disequilibrium between SNPs was assessed using HAPLOVIEW software while combination of SNPs into haplotypes in the population and the reconstruction of the cladogram were carried-out by PHASE and ARLEQUIN programs, respectively.

This deformity was reconstructed with a free fibular osteoseptocutaneous flap associated to arthrodesis of the distal radioulnar joint and an ulnar resection osteotomy proximal to the arthrodesis in order to restore rotation of the forearm (Sauv\u00e9-Kapandji procedure). The flap fully survived and no complications were seen in the early postoperative period at both recipient and donor sites. Radius alignment was restored. At 5-month follow-up, the skeleton was healed. There was minimal osteopenia at the distal radial segment. Wrist extension was 48 degrees, flexion 24 degrees, and pronation-supination was 58-0-48 degrees, with full finger flexion. The patient could hold a 4 kg dumbbell with the elbow flexed without discomfort. His DASH score-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire was 15.83. Combined free fibular osteoseptocutaneous flap and Sauve-Kapandji procedure may be considered in severe forms of postraumatic radial club hand, however, further data are necessary. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Patch coverage of the pancreatic stump is often used with the intention to prevent POPF. Despite numerous investigations, the effects of patch coverage remain unclear. The present meta-analysis aims to clarify the effects of patch coverage in distal pancreatectomy on the incidence of POPF.\nA systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed and the Cochrane Database according to the PRISMA Statement was performed. Subsequently a meta-analysis on rates and overall incidence of POPF and length of hospital stay was carried out. By applying the inverse variance weighting method, the combined effect size and 95\u00a0% confidence interval were calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using I \nFive randomized controlled trials and six observational clinical studies were included for final analysis. A cumulative incidence of 43\u00a0% of POPF grades A-C was identified. Patch coverage in distal pancreatectomy is significantly associated with a decreased rate of POPF grade C (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Patches of autologous vascularized tissue significantly reduce the overall incidence of POPF (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and clinically relevant POPF grade B and C (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Fibrin sealant patches do not influence rates of POPF after distal pancreatectomy. None of the outcomes evaluated showed adverse results for the patch group.\nPatch coverage after distal pancreatectomy can reduce the rate of POPF.

{"title": "Targeting heterogeneity of adrenocortical carcinoma: Evaluation and extension of preclinical tumor models to improve clinical translation.", "abstract": "In recent years it has been recognized that clinical translation of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) often fails. These disappointing results indicate that the currently utilized tumor models only poorly reflect relevant pathophysiology and, thereby, do not predict clinical applicability of novel pharmacological approaches. However, also the development of new preclinical ACC models has remained a challenge with only one human cell line (NCI-H295R) and one recently established human pediatric xenograft model (SJ-ACC3) being available for this highly heterogeneous malignancy. Our current study furthermore reveals a poor reproducibility of therapeutic action between different clones of the most commonly used tumor model NCI-H295R. In an attempt to broaden the current preclinical armamentarium, we aimed at the development of patient-individual tumor models. During these studies, one xenograft (MUC-1) displayed marked engraftment and sustained tumor growth. MUC-1 tumor analysis revealed highly vascularized, proliferating and SF-1 positive xenografts. In a next step, we characterized all currently available human tumor models for ACC for Ki67, SF-1 and EGF-receptor status in comparison with MUC-1-xenografts. In addition, we established a primary culture, which is now viable over 31 passages with sustained nuclear SF-1 and cytoplasmic 3\u03b2HSD immuno-positivity. Subsequent investigation of therapeutic responsiveness upon treatment with the current systemic gold standard EDP-M (etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin and mitotane) demonstrated maintenance of the clinically observed drug resistance for MUC-1 exclusively. In summary, we provide evidence for a novel patient-derived tumor model with the potential to improve clinical prediction of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with ACC.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-10-21", "authors": ["ConstanzeHantel", "IgorShapiro", "GiadaPoli", "CostanzaChiapponi", "MartinBidlingmaier", "MartinReincke", "MichaelaLuconi", "SaraJung", "FelixBeuschlein"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.12685"}

Patients with pre-existing morbidities are often at increased risk of urethral stricture recurrence brought upon in-part by delayed vascularization accompanied by overactive inflammatory responses following surgery. Within the context of this study, we demonstrate the functional utility of a cell/scaffold composite graft comprised of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) combined with CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) to modulate inflammation and wound healing in a rodent model of substitution urethroplasty. Composite grafts demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects with regards to tissue macrophage and neutrophil density following urethral tissue analyses. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and further resulted in an earlier transition to tissue remodeling and maturation with a shift in collagen type III to I. Grafted animals demonstrated a progressive maturation and increase in vessel size compared to control animals. Overall, MSC/CD34+ HSPC composite grafts reduce inflammation, enhance an earlier transition to wound remodeling and maturation concurrently increasing neovascularization in the periurethral tissue.

Main factors to consider when deciding treatment are the type of fracture and fracture stability. In the stable nonunion (Type D1 according to the Filan and Herbert classification, or linear type of Ikeda's classification), percutaneous screw fixation without bone graft is recommended. The indications of non-vascularized bone grafting are as follows: (1) arthroscopic cancellous bone graft in type D1 and cystic type of Ikeda's classification. (2) tricortical bone graft from the iliac crest in type D2 or D3 if the possibility of avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment is excluded.

{"title": "Skeletal Muscle Regeneration, Repair and Remodelling in Aging: The Importance of Muscle Stem Cells and Vascularization.", "abstract": "Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength. Ultimately, sarcopenia results in the loss of independence, which imposes a large financial burden on healthcare systems worldwide. A critical facet of sarcopenia is the diminished ability for aged muscle to regenerate, repair and remodel. Over the years, research has focused on elucidating underlying mechanisms of sarcopenia and the impaired ability of muscle to respond to stimuli with aging. Muscle-specific stem cells, termed satellite cells (SC), play an important role in maintaining muscle health throughout the lifespan. It is well established that SC are essential in skeletal muscle regeneration, and it has been hypothesized that a reduction and/or dysregulation of the SC pool, may contribute to accelerated loss of skeletal muscle mass that is observed with advancing age. The preservation of skeletal muscle tissue and its ability to respond to stimuli may be impacted by reduced SC content and impaired function observed with aging. Aging is also associated with a reduction in capillarization of skeletal muscle. We have recently demonstrated that the distance between type II fibre-associated SC and capillaries is greater in older compared to younger adults. The greater distance between SC and capillaries in older adults may contribute to the dysregulation in SC activation ultimately impairing muscle's ability to remodel and, in extreme circumstances, regenerate. This viewpoint will highlight the importance of optimal SC activation in addition to skeletal muscle capillarization to maximize the regenerative potential of skeletal muscle in older adults.", "journal": "Gerontology", "date": "2016-10-21", "authors": ["SophieJoanisse", "Joshua PNederveen", "TimSnijders", "Bryon RMcKay", "GianniParise"], "doi": "10.1159/000450922"}
{"title": "Endochondral Priming: A Developmental Engineering Strategy for Bone Tissue Regeneration.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have significant potential to treat bone pathologies by exploiting the capacity for bone progenitors to grow and produce tissue constituents under specific biochemical and physical conditions. However, conventional tissue engineering approaches, which combine stem cells with biomaterial scaffolds, are limited as the constructs often degrade, due to a lack of vascularization, and lack the mechanical integrity to fulfill load bearing functions, and as such are not yet widely used for clinical treatment of large bone defects. Recent studies have proposed that in vitro tissue engineering approaches should strive to simulate in vivo bone developmental processes and, thereby, imitate natural factors governing cell differentiation and matrix production, following the paradigm recently defined as \"developmental engineering.\" Although developmental engineering strategies have been recently developed that mimic specific aspects of the endochondral ossification bone formation process, these findings are not widely understood. Moreover, a critical comparison of these approaches to standard biomaterial-based bone tissue engineering has not yet been undertaken. For that reason, this article presents noteworthy experimental findings from researchers focusing on developing an endochondral-based developmental engineering strategy for bone tissue regeneration. These studies have established that in vitro approaches, which mimic certain aspects of the endochondral ossification process, namely the formation of the cartilage template and the vascularization of the cartilage template, can promote mineralization and vascularization to a certain extent both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, this article outlines specific experimental challenges that must be overcome to further exploit the biology of endochondral ossification and provide a tissue engineering construct for clinical treatment of large bone/nonunion defects and obviate the need for bone tissue graft.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, EriB treatment (50, 100 nM) could significantly block vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)-induced cell proliferation, tube formation, cell migration and cell invasion. Furthermore, EriB also caused G1 phase cell cycle arrest which was correlated with the down-regulation of the cyclin D1 and CDK4 leading to the inhibition of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein expression. Investigation of the signal transduction revealed that EriB inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2 via the interaction with the ATP-binding sites according to the molecular docking simulations. The suppression of VEGFR-2 downstream signal transduction cascades was also observed. EriB was showed to inhibit new blood vessel formation in Matrigel plug model and mouse 4T1 breast tumor model.

Despite in vitro studies demonstrating this principle, this knowledge has not translated into the use of MMP inhibitors (MMPi) as effective cancer therapeutics, or been corroborated by evidence of in vivo ECM degradation mediated by MT1-MMP, suggesting that our understanding of the role of MT1-MMP in cancer progression is incomplete.\nMCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cell lines were created that stably overexpress different levels of MT1-MMP. Using 2D culture, we analyzed proMMP-2 activation (gelatin zymography), ECM degradation (fluorescent gelatin), ERK signaling (immunoblot), cell migration (transwell/scratch closure/time-lapse imaging), and viability (colorimetric substrate) to assess how different MT1-MMP levels affect these cellular parameters. We also utilized Matrigel 3D cell culture and avian embryos to examine how different levels of MT1-MMP expression affect morphological changes in 3D culture, and tumourigenecity and extravasation efficiency in vivo.\nIn 2D culture, breast cancer cells expressing high levels of MT1-MMP were capable of widespread ECM degradation and TIMP-2-mediated proMMP-2 activation, but were not the most migratory. Instead, cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP were the most migratory, and demonstrated increased viability and ERK activation. In 3D culture, MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP demonstrated an invasive protrusive phenotype, whereas cells expressing high levels of MT1-MMP demonstrated loss of colony structure and cell fragment release. Similarly, in vivo analysis demonstrated increased tumourigenecity and metastatic capability for cells expressing low levels of MT1-MMP, whereas cells expressing high levels were devoid of these qualities despite the production of functional MT1-MMP protein.\nThis study demonstrates that excessive ECM degradation mediated by high levels of MT1-MMP is not associated with cell migration and tumourigenesis, while low levels of MT1-MMP promote invasion and vascularization in vivo.", "journal": "Molecular cancer", "date": "2016-10-21", "authors": ["Mario ACepeda", "Jacob J HPelling", "Caitlin LEvered", "Karla CWilliams", "ZoeyFreedman", "IoanaStan", "Jessica AWillson", "Hon SLeong", "SashkoDamjanovski"], "doi": "10.1186/s12943-016-0547-x\n10.1038/nrc865\n10.1038/nature04872\n10.1056/NEJMra0805239\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.07.050\n10.1161/01.RES.0000070112.80711.3D\n10.1186/bcr65\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210982\n10.1016/j.tcb.2008.08.007\n10.1083/jcb.201311112\n10.1093/jnci/89.17.1260\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2010.05.002\n10.1038/nrc745\n10.1128/MCB.01288-07\n10.1038/nm.3508\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2009.04.009\n10.1016/S0304-3835(02)00699-7\n10.1016/j.chembiol.2015.07.008\n10.1016/S0006-291X(03)01405-0\n10.1093/emboj/20.17.4782\n10.1371/journal.pone.0136797\n10.1016/S0014-5793(01)02985-4\n10.1074/jbc.M110.188714\n10.1074/jbc.M705492200\n10.1093/emboj/cdf411\n10.1074/jbc.M111.256644\n10.1074/jbc.M007921200\n10.1083/jcb.201501034\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4376\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.10.008\n10.1186/1471-2407-9-20\n10.1186/1471-2407-9-188\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2177\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2005.05.001\n10.1038/nprot.2016.050\n10.1038/labinvest.2010.97\n10.1007/978-1-60327-299-5_16\n10.1007/978-1-61779-207-6_8\n10.1083/jcb.201501081\n10.1074/jbc.274.30.21362\n10.1016/j.molmed.2005.01.007\n10.1042/bj20021573\n10.1006/excr.2000.5063\n10.1186/jbiol213\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2008.03.013\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.06.010\n10.1016/j.biochi.2004.07.012\n10.1074/jbc.M111.297069\n10.1002/jcp.24717\n10.1074/jbc.M110.132704\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6600310\n10.1023/A:1023047431869\n10.1126/science.1067100\n10.1093/jnci/83.11.775\n10.1093/jnci/82.7.589\n10.1016/j.gendis.2014.12.002\n10.1016/S0945-053X(03)00003-9\n10.1007/s10555-007-9105-8\n10.1023/A:1018421431388\n10.1002/ijc.2910590308\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000320)89:2<118::AID-IJC3>3.0.CO;2-8\n10.1006/gyno.1999.5381\n10.1023/A:1006723011835\n10.1038/518027a\n10.1074/jbc.M900273200\n10.1242/jcs.129510\n10.1038/onc.2015.87\n10.1083/jcb.201506002\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2225"}
{"title": "The History of GalaFLEX P4HB Scaffold.", "abstract": "The GalaFLEX Scaffold (Galatea Surgical, Inc., Lexington, MA) for plastic and reconstructive surgery belongs to a new generation of products for soft tissue reinforcement made from poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB). Other members of this new family of products include MonoMax Suture (Aesculap AG, Tuttlingen, Germany) for soft tissue approximation, BioFiber Scaffold (Tornier, Inc., Edina, MN) for tendon repair, and Phasix Mesh (C.R. Bard, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ) for hernia repair. Each of these fully resorbable products provides prolonged strength retention, typically 50% to 70% strength retention at 12 weeks, and facilitates remodeling in vivo to provide a strong, lasting repair. P4HB belongs to a naturally occurring class of biopolymers and fibers made from it are uniquely strong, flexible, and biocompatible. GalaFLEX Scaffold is comprised of high-strength, resorbable P4HB monofilament fibers. It is a knitted macroporous scaffold intended to elevate, reinforce, and repair soft tissue. The scaffold acts as a lattice for new tissue growth, which is rapidly vascularized and becomes fully integrated with adjacent tissue as the fibers resorb. In this review, we describe the development of P4HB, its production, properties, safety, and biocompatibility of devices made from P4HB. Early clinical results and current clinical applications of products made from P4HB are also discussed. The results of post-market clinical studies evaluating the GalaFLEX Scaffold in rhytidectomy and cosmetic breast surgery demonstrate that the scaffold can reinforce lifted soft tissue, resulting in persistent surgical results in the face and neck at one year, and provide lower pole stability after breast lift at one year.", "journal": "Aesthetic surgery journal", "date": "2016-10-21", "authors": ["Simon FWilliams", "David PMartin", "Arikha CMoses"], "doi": "10.1093/asj/sjw141\n10.1155/2012/216137\n10.1155/2013/238067"}

Progression of both plaques and tangles throughout the brain follows a hierarchical distribution which is defined by intrinsic cytoarchitectonic features and extrinsic connectivity patterns. What has less well been studied is how cortical convolutions influence the distribution of AD pathology. Here, the distribution of both plaques and tangles within subsulcal gyral components (fundi) to components forming their top regions at the subarachnoidal brain surface (crowns) by stereological methods in seven different cortical areas was systematically compared. Further, principle differences in cytoarchitectonic organization of cortical crowns and fundi that might provide the background for regionally selective vulnerability were attempted to identify. It was shown that both plaques and tangles were more prominent in sulcal fundi than gyri crowns. The differential distribution of pathology along convolutions corresponds to subgyral differences in the vascular network, GFAP-positive astrocytes and intracortical and subcortical connectivity. While the precise mechanisms accounting for these differences remain open, the presence of systematic inhomogeneities in the distribution of AD pathology along cortical convolutions indicates that the phylogenetic shaping of the cortex is associated with features that render the human brain vulnerable to AD pathology.", "journal": "Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)", "date": "2016-10-21", "authors": ["ThomasArendt", "MarkusMorawski", "UlrichG\u00e4rtner", "NadineFr\u00f6hlich", "FalkoSchulze", "NilsWohmann", "CarstenJ\u00e4ger", "ChristianEisenl\u00f6ffel", "Hermann-JosefGertz", "WolfMueller", "KurtBrauer"], "doi": "10.1111/bpa.12442"}

Ex vivo MLRs were prepared by culturing cavernous tissue for 48h in media alone, in media with autologous PBMCs, or in media with allogenic PBMCs to simulate control, autotransplant, and allogenic transplant conditions with or without 1\u03bcM cyclosporine A (CsA) or 20nM tacrolimus (FK506) treatment.\nRejection was characterized by PBMC flow cytometry and gene expression transplant array. Cavernous tissues were evaluated by histomorphology and myography to assess contraction and relaxation. Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance and unpaired Student t test.\nFlow cytometry and tissue array demonstrated allogenic PBMC activation consistent with rejection. Rejection impaired cavernous tissue physiology and was associated with cellular infiltration and apoptosis. CsA prevented rejection but did not improve tissue relaxation. CsA treatment impaired relaxation in tissues cultured without PBMCs compared with media and FK506.

This study was intended to identify the barriers to widespread application of REVAR in Australia and New Zealand.\nA cross-sectional survey of members of the Australia and New Zealand Society of Vascular Surgeons was performed in late 2013. Primary themes explored were (1) perceived barriers to performing REVAR and (2) advantages of REVAR compared with open repair. Secondary data measures were the volume of AAA surgery, standard protocol use, and staff accreditation among vascular units.\nA total of 85 surgeons responded to an anonymous online questionnaire (41% response rate); of these, 23 surgeons (27%) had no experience with REVAR, and 65% currently perform more EVAR than open repair for elective procedures, compared with 18% for ruptured AAA. Of the perceived barriers explored, respondents agreed that poor availability of endovascular facilities (73% agreed or strongly agreed) and ancillary staff (56%) were barriers to REVAR. Most surgeons agreed that the advantages of REVAR include reduced intraoperative blood loss, length of stay, and postoperative complications. Four of 11 vascular units performing REVAR had standard protocols in use, and four had mandatory staff accreditation.\nThe most common barrier to REVAR identified by surgeons was the poor availability of endovascular facilities, many of which are not ideally suited for this type of procedure.

{"title": "Targeting soluble CD146 with a neutralizing antibody inhibits vascularization, growth and survival of CD146-positive tumors.", "abstract": "CD146 (MUC-18, MCAM) expression on cancer cells correlates with cancer progression and a bad prognosis in several tumors, including melanoma and pancreatic tumors. Deciphering the mechanism mediating the CD146 role in cancer is essential for generating new therapeutic strategies. We found that CD146 expression in cancer cells is associated with a secretion of soluble CD146 (sCD146) that constitutes an active player in tumor development. Indeed, sCD146 induces the overexpression of its binding protein, angiomotin, on both endothelial and cancer cells and promotes both paracrine effects on angiogenesis and autocrine effects on cancer cells proliferation and survival. These last effects are mediated in part through the induction and phosphorylation of c-myc in cancer cells. In mice models xenografted with human CD146-positive melanoma or pancreatic cancer cells, administration of a novel monoclonal antibody specifically targeting sCD146, but not its membrane form, successfully suppresses tumor vascularization and growth. Our findings demonstrate that sCD146 secreted by CD146-positive tumors mediates important pro-angiogenic and pro-tumoral effects.

{"title": "Insight into microenvironment remodeling in pancreatic endocrine tissue engineering: Biological and biomaterial approaches.", "abstract": "The treatment of diabetes mellitus, as a chronic and complicated disease, is a valuable purpose. Islet transplantation can provide metabolic stability and insulin independence in type 1 diabetes patients. Diet and insulin therapy are only diabetes controllers and cannot remove all of the diabetes complications. Moreover, islet transplantation is more promising treatment than whole pancreas transplantation because of lesser invasive surgical procedure and morbidity and mortality. According to the importance of extracellular matrix for islet viability and function, microenvironment remodeling of pancreatic endocrine tissue can lead to more success in diabetes treatment by pancreatic islets. Production of bioengineered pancreas and remodeling of pancreas extracellular matrix provide essential microenvironment for re-vascularization, re-innervation and signaling cascades triggering. Therefore, islets show better viability and function in these conditions. Researchers conduct various scaffolds with different biomaterials for the improvement of islet viability, function and transplantation outcome.

{"title": "Microengineered platforms for co-cultured mesenchymal stem cells towards vascularized bone tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Bone defects are common disease requiring thorough treatments since the bone is a complex vascularized tissue that is composed of multiple cell types embedded within an intricate extracellular matrix (ECM). For past decades, tissue engineering using cells, proteins, and scaffolds has been suggested as one of the promising approaches for effective bone regeneration. Recently, many researchers have been interested in designing effective platform for tissue regeneration by orchestrating factors involved in microenvironment around tissues. Among factors affecting bone formation, vascularization during bone development and after minor insults via endochondral and intramembranous ossification is especially critical for the long-term support for functional bone. In order to create vascularized bone constructs, the interactions between human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) have been investigated using both direct and indirect co-culture studies. Recently, various culture methods including micropatterning techniques, three dimensional scaffolds, and microfluidics have been developed to create micro-engineered platforms that mimic the nature of vascularized bone formation, leading to the creation of functional bone structures. This review focuses on MSCs co-cultured with endothelial cells and microengineered platforms to determine the underlying interplay between co-cultured MSCs and vascularized bone constructs, which is ultimately necessary for adequate regeneration of bone defects.", "journal": "Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2016-10-20", "authors": ["HyeryeonPark", "Dong-JinLim", "MinheeSung", "Soo-HongLee", "DokyunNa", "HansooPark"], "doi": "10.1007/s13770-016-9080-7\n10.1023/B:ABME.0000007799.60142.78\n10.1146/annurev.bioeng.1.1.19\n10.1002/mabi.200900107\n10.1016/j.bone.2004.02.027\n10.1016/j.addr.2012.01.016\n10.1002/jbm.a.31559\n10.1172/JCI5028\n10.1038/428138a\n10.1016/j.abb.2014.07.006\n10.2217/17460751.1.4.539\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0637\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1016/j.injury.2005.07.019\n10.1634/stemcells.22-3-377\n10.1182/blood-2007-10-118273\n10.1016/j.addr.2011.01.009\n10.1002/term.1617\n10.1016/j.jht.2011.08.003\n10.1038/sj.bdj.4807835\n10.1007/s00198-009-0860-y\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.01.002\n10.1016/j.biocel.2015.05.008\n10.1007/s40610-015-0024-0\n10.1084/jem.20110132\n10.1172/JCI28568\n10.1002/path.2469\n10.1530/JOE-11-0048\n10.1016/S0736-0266(02)00017-7\n10.1016/j.tcb.2003.12.003\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2008.07.004\n10.1016/0169-6009(90)90084-S\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.09.014\n10.1007/s00161-014-0380-7\n10.1055/s-2007-971995\n10.1115/1.3138584\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.02.023\n10.1007/s13770-014-0095-7\n10.1007/s13770-013-1109-6\n10.1038/272501a0\n10.1242/jcs.00656\n10.1163/092050610X496260\n10.1016/j.otsr.2015.01.014\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0474\n10.2174/1874120701004010190\n10.1177/2041731412443236\n10.1002/term.1870\n10.1089/ten.teb.2013.0541\n10.1016/j.biocel.2003.10.015\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.2685\n10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0267\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.09.058\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.05.004\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.05.032\n10.1002/jbm.a.32142\n10.1371/journal.pone.0028352\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.010\n10.1021/bp980031m\n10.1007/s13770-014-0068-x\n10.2116/analsci.24.67\n10.1021/ja037677h\n10.1371/journal.pone.0020909\n10.2144/000114051\n10.1039/C0SM00852D\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.04.091\n10.1039/c4cc01932f\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.08.068\n10.1016/S1534-5807(04)00075-9\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.06.029\n10.1002/term.231\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.04.003\n10.3390/cells1041225\n10.1039/b314469k\n10.1016/j.rbmret.2005.04.008\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.07.037\n10.1096/fj.08-122820\n10.1002/adhm.201300012\n10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.09.009"}

{"title": "Bioprinted thrombosis-on-a-chip.", "abstract": "Pathologic thrombosis kills more people than cancer and trauma combined; it is associated with significant disability and morbidity, and represents a major healthcare burden. Despite advancements in medical therapies and imaging, there is often incomplete resolution of the thrombus. The residual thrombus can undergo fibrotic changes over time through infiltration of fibroblasts from the surrounding tissues and eventually transform into a permanent clot often associated with post-thrombotic syndrome. In order to understand the importance of cellular interactions and the impact of potential therapeutics to treat thrombosis, an in vitro platform using human cells and blood components would be beneficial. Towards achieving this aim, there have been studies utilizing the capabilities of microdevices to study the hemodynamics associated with thrombosis. In this work, we further exploited the utilization of 3D bioprinting technology, for the construction of a highly biomimetic thrombosis-on-a-chip model. The model consisted of microchannels coated with a layer of confluent human endothelium embedded in a gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel, where human whole blood was infused and induced to form thrombi. Continuous perfusion with tissue plasmin activator led to dissolution of non-fibrotic clots, revealing clinical relevance of the model. Further encapsulating fibroblasts in the GelMA matrix demonstrated the potential migration of these cells into the clot and subsequent deposition of collagen type I over time, facilitating fibrosis remodeling that resembled the in vivo scenario. Our study suggests that in vitro 3D bioprinted blood coagulation models can be used to study the pathology of fibrosis, and particularly, in thrombosis. This versatile platform may be conveniently extended to other vascularized fibrotic disease models.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2016-10-19", "authors": ["Yu ShrikeZhang", "FaridehDavoudi", "PhilippWalch", "AmirManbachi", "XuanLuo", "ValeriaDell'Erba", "Amir KMiri", "HassanAlbadawi", "AndreaArneri", "XiaoyunLi", "XiaoyingWang", "Mehmet RemziDokmeci", "AliKhademhosseini", "RahmiOklu"], "doi": "10.1039/c6lc00380j"}
{"title": "Interstitial flow regulates the angiogenic response and phenotype of endothelial cells in a 3D culture model.", "abstract": "A crucial yet ill-defined phenomenon involved in the remodeling of vascular networks, including angiogenic sprouting, is flow-mediated endothelial dynamics and phenotype changes. Despite interstitial flow (IF) being ubiquitously present in living tissues surrounding blood capillaries, it is rarely investigated and poorly understood how endothelial cells respond to this flow during morphogenesis. Here we develop a microfluidic 3D in vitro model to investigate the role of IF during vasculogenic formation and angiogenic remodeling of microvascular networks. In the presented model, human blood endothelial cells co-cultured with stromal fibroblasts spontaneously organize into an interconnected microvascular network and then further expand to adjacent avascular regions in a manner of neovessel sprouting. We found that in the presence of IF, vasculogenic organization of the microvascular network was significantly facilitated regardless of the flow direction, whereas angiogenic sprouting was promoted only when the directions of flow and sprouting were opposite while angiogenic activity was suppressed into the direction of flow. We also observed that the vasculatures switch between active angiogenic remodeling and quiescent/non-sprouting state in the contexts provided by IF. This regulatory effect can be utilized to examine the role of anti-angiogenic compounds, clearly distinguishing the differential influences of the compounds depending on their mechanisms of action. Collectively, these results suggest that IF may serve as a critical regulator in tissue vascularization and pathological angiogenesis.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2016-10-19", "authors": ["SudongKim", "MinhwanChung", "JunghoAhn", "SominLee", "Noo LiJeon"], "doi": "10.1039/c6lc00910g"}

This study explores whether antiangiogenic therapy influences the tumor vascular network and/or the vessels feeding the hepatic tumor.\nMice implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were subcutaneously injected 3 times (once every other day starting 1 week after LLC implantation) with either an antiangiogenic agent [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-Trap] or control agent (bovine serum albumin) at a dose of 25 mg/kg before performing angiography. Hepatic arteriography and portography were performed using a vascular cast method with vascular latex.\nArteriography of the control-treated LLC-implanted mice showed marked staining of the mass with a prominent feeding artery, suggesting that the tumor is supplied by arterial perfusion. No significant staining was observed on portography. By contrast, 33% (n = 3/9) of the LLC-implanted mice treated with the antiangiogenic agent VEGF-Trap showed intratumoral staining during portography, indicating that these tumors received perfusion via the portal vein.\nAntiangiogenic treatment can induce rearrangement of the hepatic tumor vascular network to establish communication with the portal vein.

In order to generate large vascularized tissues of custom geometry, bioreactors were implanted against the rib periosteum of 3-4year-old sheep for nine weeks. Bioreactors were filled with either morcellized autologous bone, synthetic ceramic particles, or a combination thereof. Tissues generated within synthetic graft-filled bioreactors were transferred into a large right-sided mandibular angle defect as either avascular grafts (n=3) or vascularized free flaps (n=3). After twelve additional weeks, reconstructed mandibular angles were harvested and compared to contralateral control angles. Per histologic and radiologic evaluation, a greater amount of mineralized tissue was generated in bioreactors filled with autologous graft although the quality of viable bone was not significantly different between groups. Genetic analyses of soft tissue surrounding bioreactor-generated tissues demonstrated similar early and late stage osteogenic biomarker expression (Runx2 and Osteocalcin) between the bioreactors and rib periosteum. Although no significant differences between the height of reconstructed and control mandibular angles were observed, the reconstructed mandibles had decreased bone volume. There were no differences between mandibles reconstructed with bioreactor-generated tissues transferred as flaps or grafts. Tissues used for mandibular reconstruction demonstrated integration with native bone as well as evidence of remodeling. In this study, we have demonstrated that synthetic scaffolds are sufficient to generate large volumes of mineralized tissue in an in vivo bioreactor for mandibular reconstruction.\nA significant clinical challenge in craniofacial surgery is the reconstruction of large mandibular defects.

{"title": "[Facial trauma and injury in children].", "abstract": "Facial traumas are common in children but often unconsidered. Facial injury is responsible of impressive bleeding because of the rich vascularization of the face; this bleeding is often underestimated because of the immediate arterial vasoconstriction that is very strong for children. The blood volume is 80ml/kg for a newborn, with a total of 250ml, reaching 70ml/kg at one year of age. The evaluation must be rigorously performed due to the risk of a sudden decompensation. Regarding the wounds, the primary repair must be performed directly neat or optimal in case of damaged tissues. The rule is to keep maximum of the integrity and to limit debridement. Careful repair often requires general anesthesia, especially in young children, to facilitate a perfect joining of the edges and of the mucocutaneous lines. Losses of substance should be treated by directed cicatrization. Flaps are never performed in children as a first intention for reasons developed below. Given the elasticity of the facial skeleton, fractures require a brutal shock to occur, but the clinical signs can be misleading. For instance, too specific and sometimes ignored, fractures can show weakly symptomatic signs\u00a0: the fractures of the condylar and the orbital floor, with their respective complication that are temporomandibular bone ankylosis and definitive diplopia. Possible children abuse should be suspected in case of different age lesions and discrepancies between the told story and types of injuries. Once the vital urgency is eliminated, the orbital emergency should be first considered in facial traumas within the ophthalmology specialty because wounds and contusions of the globe are often under-evaluated and threaten the vision. The second emergency is the orbital floor fracture in its 'trapdoor' type, specific to the child. Combined with a motionless eye and uncontrollable vomiting, this is the second true urgency because it involves the prognosis of the oculomotricity and requires emergency surgery. Finally, dental trauma should not be overlooked because of their functional and aesthetic consequences. Primary cicatrization is usually rapid but scars remain inflammatory during a long time. The risk of hypertrophy exists in case of contusions and lacerations associated with wounds but also during puberty and in some locations. Age interfere with the result because growth will either improve or worsen the initial result, depending on the location and mechanism.

Materials and Methods For this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant secondary analysis of a prospective phase III trial, adult patients with digital CT images and metastatic clear-cell RCC treated with sunitinib were included (n = 275). Target lesions were selected by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 guidelines, and the CT images obtained after one cycle of sunitinib therapy were evaluated in comparison with baseline images. Tumor-response software was created to quantify tumor metrics (length, area, VTB, and mean attenuation) and automate response assessment. Progression-free survival (PFS) in responders and nonresponders according to VTB criteria was compared by using the Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess interobserver agreement among three readers evaluating 28 randomly selected patients. Results VTB criteria nonresponders (n = 120) according to the initial posttherapy CT study were 5.7 times more likely to experience progression of disease (HR = 5.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.07, 7.97; P < .001) than responders (n = 155). There was not a statistically significant difference in PFS between RECIST nonresponders (n = 255) and responders (n = 20; HR = 1.54; 95% CI: 0.85, 2.77; P = .148). In a patient-level analysis, interobserver agreement was very good for assessing percentage change in length, area, and VTB (ICC = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.91], 0.89 [95% CI: 0.79, 0.94], and 0.88 [95% CI: 0.79, 0.94], respectively) but was very poor for assessing percentage change in mean attenuation (ICC = 0.17 [95% CI: -0.05, 0.45]).

Here, we investigated the feasibility of generating an immunoregulatory environment in a highly vascularized macroporous alginate scaffold by affinity-binding of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in a manner mimicking its binding to heparan sulfate. Using this device to transplant allofibroblasts under the kidney capsule resulted in the induction of local and peripheral TGF-\u03b2-dependent immunotolerance, characterized by higher frequency of immature dendritic cells and regulatory T cells within the device and by markedly reduced allofibroblast-specific T-cell response in the spleen, thereby increasing the viability of the transplanted cells. Culturing whole splenocytes in the TGF-\u03b2-bound scaffold indicated that the regulatory function of TGF-\u03b2 is IL-10-dependent. We thus demonstrate a novel platform for transplantation devices, designed to promote an immunoregulatory microenvironment suitable for cell transplantation and autoimmune regulation.\nAllogeneic cell graft transplantation is a potentially optimal treatment for many clinical deficiencies. It is yet challenging to overcome chronic rejection without compromising host immunity to pathogens. We present the features and function of a cell transplantation device designed based on the principle of affinity binding of angiogenic and immunoregulatory factors to extracellular matrix in aim to achieve sustained release of these factors. We show that presentation of these factors in such manner generates the infrastructure for device vascularization and induces profound local allocell-specific tolerance, which then evokes peripheral T-cell tolerance. The tolerance is antigen specific, does not cause immune deficits and may thus serve to improve allocell survival as well as a platform to mitigate pathogenic autoimmunity.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-10-19", "authors": ["ShiraOrr", "ItaiStrominger", "EkatrinaEremenko", "EkaterineVinogradov", "EmilRuvinov", "AlonMonsonego", "SmadarCohen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.08.015"}

Rapid vascularization and tissue incorporation are crucial for the prevention of migration, extrusion, and infection of the biomaterial. Therefore, we analyzed whether surface modification by plasma etching may improve the early tissue response to Medpor\u00ae. Medpor\u00ae samples were treated in a plasma chamber at low (20 W; LE-PE) and high energy levels (40 W; HE-PE). The samples and non-treated controls were implanted into mouse dorsal skinfold chambers to analyze angiogenesis, inflammation, and granulation tissue formation over 14 days using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses revealed that elevating energy levels of plasma etching progressively increase the oxygen surface content and surface roughness of Medpor\u00ae. This did not affect the leukocytic response to the implants. However, LE-PE and HE-PE samples exhibited an impaired vascularization. This was associated with a reduced formation of a collagen-rich granulation tissue at the implantation site. Additional in vitro experiments showed a reduced cell attachment on plasma-etched Medpor\u00ae. Thus, plasma etching may not be recommended to improve the clinical outcome of reconstructive interventions using Medpor\u00ae.

In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 \u03bcm were created using materials (50 \u03bcm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 \u03bcm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 \u03bcm.

Histopathologic evaluation revealed a reduced vascularization and a lower amount of proliferating cells in the treated tumors. Surprisingly, a simultaneous significant accumulation of extracellular matrix structures with positive elastin-van Gieson staining was observed following foretinib/FK228 exposure. Expression analysis of treated animal tumors exhibited various changes including increased mouse transcript levels of elastin, laminin, and fibronectin. In parallel, markers for mesenchymal stroma/stem cells (MSC) including CD73 and CD90 were detectable in all mouse tumors suggesting a possible involvement of these cells in extracellular matrix restructure. Indeed, incubation of MSC with FK228 or foretinib/FK228 demonstrated morphologic alterations and enhanced expression of laminin and fibronectin. Moreover, a co-culture of MSC with lentiviral-labeled SCCOHT-1GFP cells contributed to protection of the tumor cells against FK228-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, explant cultures of SCCOHT-1GFP-induced tumors acquired an increased resistance to FK228 and a combination of foretinib/FK228 in contrast to foretinib alone.

However, these approaches required the use of osteogenic supplements, namely dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, and \u03b2-glycerophosphate, none of which are endogenous mediators of bone formation in vivo. Rather MSCs, endothelial progenitor cells, and chondrocytes all reside in proximity within the cartilage template and might paracrineally regulate osteogenic differentiation. Thus, this study tests the hypothesis that an in vitro bone regeneration approach that mimics the cellular niche existing during endochondral ossification, through coculture of MSCs, endothelial cells, and chondrocytes, will obviate the need for extraneous osteogenic supplements and provide an alternative strategy to elicit osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and mineral production. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) mimic the cellular niche existing during endochondral ossification and (2) investigate whether osteogenic differentiation could be induced without the use of any external growth factors.

{"title": "Decellularized Human Kidney Cortex Hydrogels Enhance Kidney Microvascular Endothelial Cell Maturation and Quiescence.", "abstract": "The kidney peritubular microvasculature is highly susceptible to injury from drugs and toxins, often resulting in acute kidney injury and progressive chronic kidney disease. Little is known about the process of injury and regeneration of human kidney microvasculature, resulting from the lack of appropriate kidney microvascular models that can incorporate the proper cells, extracellular matrices (ECMs), and architectures needed to understand the response and contribution of individual vascular components in these processes. In this study, we present methods to recreate the human kidney ECM (kECM) microenvironment by fabricating kECM hydrogels derived from decellularized human kidney cortex. The majority of native matrix proteins, such as collagen-IV, laminin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and their isoforms were preserved in similar proportions as found in normal kidneys. Human kidney peritubular microvascular endothelial cells (HKMECs) became more quiescent when cultured on this kECM gel compared with culture on collagen-I-assessed using phenotypic, genotypic, and functional assays; whereas human umbilical vein endothelial cells became stimulated on kECM gels. We demonstrate for the first time that human kidney cortex can form a hydrogel suitable for use in flow-directed microphysiological systems. Our findings strongly suggest that selecting the proper ECM is a critical consideration in the development of vascularized organs on a chip and carries important implications for tissue engineering of all vascularized organs.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Genetic normalization of Dyrk1a is sufficient to normalize early cortical developmental phenotypes in DS mouse models. Gyrencephalic human neocortical development is more complex than that in lissencephalic mice; hence, cerebral organoids (COs) can be used to model early neurodevelopmental defects of DS. Single copy DYRK1A knockout COs (scDYRK1AKO-COs) can be generated from manipulated DS derived (DS-) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and genetic normalization of DYRK1A is expected to result in corrected neurodevelopmental phenotypes that can be reminiscent of normal COs. DYRK1A knock-in (DYRK1AKI) COs can be derived after genetic manipulations of normal iPSCs and would be valuable to evaluate impaired neocortical development as can be seen in DS-COs. DYRK1A mutations cause severe human primary microcephaly; hence, dose optimization studies of DYRK1A inhibitors will be critical for prenatal therapeutic applications in DS. Several doses of DYRK1A inhibitors can be tested in the neurodevelopment process of DS-COs and DS-scDYRK1AKO-COs would be used as optimum models for evaluating phenotypic ameliorations. Overdose drug exposure in DS-COs can be explained by similar defects present in DS-baDYRK1AKO-COs and DYRK1AKO-COs. There are several limitations in the current CO technology, which can be reduced by the generation of vascularized brain-like organoids giving opportunities to mimic late-stage corticogenesis and complete hippocampal development. In the future, improved DS-DYRK1AKO-COs can be efficient in studies that aim to generate efficiently transplantable and implantable neurons for tissue regeneration alternatives in DS individuals.", "journal": "Cell biology international", "date": "2016-10-16", "authors": ["E Sacide\u00c7a\u011flayan"], "doi": "10.1002/cbin.10694"}

Here we report a method to preserve limbus during PKP for small, irregular, and scleralized cornea.\nA 12-year-old boy with multiple congenital anomalies diagnosed as PHACES syndrome suffered from bilateral total sclerocornea and poor visual acuity. Due to the fact that the left eye cornea was small (6.5\u200amm\u200a\u00d7\u200a10\u200amm), lamellar dissection and posterior recession of inferior limbus was first performed and followed by a 6\u200amm trephination and PKP with a 6.5\u200amm graft for left eye. At the same time, lens aspiration and release of peripheral anterior synechia were performed.\nAfter 6 years of follow-up, the cornea remained clear, and there has been no sign of inflammation and conjunctivalization.

Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A) is a new noninvasive method that uses several algorithms to detect blood movement. This enables the creation of high-resolution vascular images with contrast depicting motionless tissue.\nThis review presents the results of articles relevant to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and OCT-A. The OCT-A technique can successfully be used in the diagnosis of neovascularization, retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and retinal artery occlusion (RAO), vessel abnormalities and even anterior segment neovascularization. OCT-A can also be applied to compute data such as vessel density, and flow index in both superficial and deep plexuses.\nMany studies have compared fluorescein angiography with OCT-A. Other studies have reported differences in vascular density in AMD patients and have compared them with people having healthy eyes. Although OCT-A offers rapid picture acquisition, high repeatability and resolution, it also has many drawbacks. The most common are: motion artifacts, projections from overlying vessels and limited field of view.An interesting new application is the possibility to assess changes during antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. Another function of OCT-A is the possible application in the study of choriocapillaries in many fields of ocular pathology.\nOCT-A is a new promising method that allows the visualization of the retinal vascular network and the counting of blood flow parameters.

Although recent evidence suggests the role of different macrophage phenotypes in adipose tissue expansion, metabolism, and remodeling, the spectrum of macrophage phenotype in the adipose tissue engineering field remains unknown. The present study established a rat model of adipose tissue regeneration using a tissue engineering chamber. Macrophage phenotypes were assessed during the regenerative process in the model. Neo-adipose tissue was generated 6 weeks after implantation. Macrophages were obvious in the chamber constructs 3 days after implantation, peaked at day 7, and significantly decreased thereafter. At day 3, macrophages were predominantly M1 macrophages (CCR7+), and there were few M2 macrophages (CD206+). At day 7, the percentage of M2 macrophages significantly increased and remained stable at day 14. M2 macrophages became the predominant macrophage population at 42 days. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated transition of cytokines from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory, which was consistent with the transition of macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2. These results showed distinct transition of macrophage phenotypes from a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to an anti-inflammatory M2 in adipose tissue regeneration in our tissue engineering model.

Here, we characterize an orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma model based on the injection of luciferase-expressing human hepatoma Huh-7 (Huh-7-Luc) cells in immunodeficient mice. Luciferase allows for an easy repeated monitoring of tumor growth by in vivo bioluminescence. The intrahepatic injection was more efficient than intrasplenic or intraportal injection in terms of survival, rate of orthotopic engraftment, and easiness. A positive correlation between luciferase activity and tumor size, evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, allowed to define the endpoint value for animal experimentation with this model. Response to standard of care, sorafenib or doxorubicin, were similar to those previously reported in the literature, with however a strong toxicity of doxorubicin. Tumor vascularization was visible by histology seven days after Huh-7-Luc transplantation and robustly developed at day 14 and day 21. The model was used to explore different imaging modalities, including microtomography, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy, full-field optical coherence tomography, and ultrasound imaging.

To elucidate novel pathways involved in erlotinib resistance, we compared the gene expression profiles of erlotinib-resistant (ER) vs. erlotinib-sensitive (ES) HNSCC cell lines. Enrichment analysis of microarray data revealed a deregulation of the IL-1 signaling pathway in ER versus ES-HNSCC cells. Gene expression of interleukin-1 alpha (IL1A) and interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) were significantly upregulated by > 2 fold in ER-SQ20B and ER-CAL 27 cells compared to their respective ES-cells. Secretion of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) was significantly reduced in ER-cells compared to ES-cells. Blockade of IL-1 signaling using a recombinant IL-1R antagonist (anakinra) was able to inhibit the growth of ER-SQ20B and ER-CAL 27 but not ES-SQ20B and ES-CAL 27 xenografts as a single agent and in combination with erlotinib.

Mice bearing ER-SQ20B xenografts had significantly lesser circulating levels of G-CSF and IL-1\u03b2 when treated with anakinra \u00b1 erlotinib compared to those treated with water or erlotinib alone. Furthermore, augmented mRNA levels of IL1A or interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) were associated with shortened survival in HNSCC patients. Altogether, blockade of the IL-1 pathway using anakinra overcame erlotinib resistance in HNSCC xenografts and may represent a novel strategy to overcome EGFR inhibitor resistance for treatment of HNSCC patients.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-10-16", "authors": ["AdityaStanam", "Katherine NGibson-Corley", "LaurieLove-Homan", "NnamdiIhejirika", "Andrean LSimons"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.12590\n10.1146/annurev.ento.49.061802.123354"}
{"title": "Sonography of the Achilles Tendon After Complete Rupture Repair: What the Radiologist Should Know.", "abstract": "This review aims to provide the radiologist with simple and systematic guidelines for evaluation of the Achilles tendon after complete rupture repair. Currently, there is a plethora of nonsurgical and surgical treatments, but sonographic examination has shown no significant differences between them. A systematic analysis of several parameters (morphologic characteristics, structure, color Doppler vascularization, and mobility) should be undertaken. Morphologically, the repaired tendon is larger, wider, or both. The loss of the fibrillary structure, inhomogeneity, and the surgical material in the context of the tendon are \"normal\" aspects after a repaired rupture. The presence of fluid collections when affecting greater than 50% of the surface of the tendon and extensive calcifications should be considered pathologic aspects. In the immediate postoperative period, there is the absence of vascularization detectable by color Doppler imaging. During the first 3 months, there is an increase in intratendinous vascularization with hypervascularization. From 3 to 6 months, stabilization and regression of the vascularization occur. Beyond the first 6 months, the hypervascularization is pathologic. The pattern of motion is, generally, reduced considerably more often in surgically treated tendons than in non-surgically treated ones. Elastography generally shows a hard appearance, with only a relatively heterogeneous pattern. In conclusion, a treated tendon will never regain a normal sonographic appearance, and the operator must distinguish between normal posttreatment changes and real pathologic characteristics.", "journal": "Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine", "date": "2016-10-16", "authors": ["SalvatoreGitto", "Anna GujaDraghi", "ChandraBortolotto", "FerdinandoDraghi"], "doi": "10.7863/ultra.16.01092"}

{"title": "Episomal Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Promote Functional Recovery of Transected Murine Peripheral Nerve.", "abstract": "Traumatic peripheral nerve neurotmesis occurs frequently and functional recovery is often slow and impaired. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have shown much promise in recent years due to its regenerative properties similar to that of embryonic stem cells. However, the potential of iPSCs in promoting the functional recovery of a transected peripheral nerve is largely unknown. This study is the first to investigate in vivo effects of episomal iPSCs (EiPSCs) on peripheral nerve regeneration in a murine sciatic nerve transection model. Episomal iPSCs refer to iPSCs that are generated via Oct3/4-Klf4-Sox2 plasmid reprogramming instead of the conventional viral insertion techniques. It represents a relatively safer form of iPSC production without permanent transgene integration which may raise questions regarding risks of genomic mutation. A minimal number of EiPSCs were added directly to the transected nerve. Functional recovery of the EiPSC group was significantly improved compared to the negative control group when assessed via serial five-toe spread measurement and gait analysis of ankle angles. EiPSC promotion of nerve regeneration was also evident on stereographic analysis of axon density, myelin thickness, and axonal cross-sectional surface area. Most importantly, the results observed in EiPSCs are similar to that of the embryonic stem cell group. A roughly ten-fold increase in neurotrophin-3 levels was seen in EiPSCs which could have contributed to peripheral nerve regeneration and recovery. No abnormal masses or adverse effects were noted with EiPSC administration after one year of follow-up. We have hence shown that functional recovery of the transected peripheral nerve can be improved with the use of EiPSC therapy, which holds promise for the future of nerve regeneration.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-10-14", "authors": ["Charles Yuen YungLoh", "Aline Yen LingWang", "Huang-KaiKao", "EstebanCardona", "Sheng-HaoChuang", "Fu-ChanWei"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0164696\n10.1016/j.hcl.2015.12.002\n10.1097/MOT.0000000000000247\n10.1016/j.hcl.2015.12.001\n10.1038/nature05944\n10.1126/science.1151526\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.11.008\n10.1038/nrg2937\n10.1038/nature05934\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0696\n10.1126/science.1164270\n10.1038/nmeth.1591\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3765-08.2009\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2009.12.033\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3182a3bfeb\n10.1177/0192623310387618\n10.1111/j.1365-2990.2008.00938.x\n10.4103/1673-5374.170318\n10.3969/j.issn.1673-5374.2012.19.006\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0333\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181923d07\n10.1002/jbm.a.34816\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.01.154\n10.3171/FOC.2009.26.2.E3\n10.3727/096368913X673450\n10.1038/mt.2014.143\n10.1371/journal.pone.0017899\n10.1089/107632700320748\n10.4252/wjsc.v7.i1.11\n10.1038/nrneurol.2013.227\n10.1097/01.prs.0000244863.71080.f0\n10.1038/ncomms6999\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3007529\n10.1016/j.nbd.2015.06.011"}

Vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) is a surgical treatment for lymphedema that has shown promising results, but limited studies in the United States have investigated outcomes for single-stage VLNT to the axilla. The goal of this prospective, ongoing study was to investigate the clinical, psychosocial, and functional outcomes of patients who underwent VLNT for the treatment of upper extremity lymphedema after breast cancer therapy.\nVLNT to the axilla were performed on patients with upper extremity lymphedema after breast cancer therapy. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month intervals by circumferential measurements, pain/heaviness scales, and the LYMQOL questionnaire.\nFifty patients met the study criteria. Preliminary results showed a decrease in arm volumes by 34.57\u00a0% at 1\u00a0month, 52.03\u00a0% at 3\u00a0months, 42.34\u00a0% at 6\u00a0months, 65.23\u00a0% at 9\u00a0months, and 58.68\u00a0% at 12\u00a0months. Pain and heaviness consistently decreased over time to 0.38 and 1.67 respectively at 12\u00a0months. Overall quality of life scores steadily improved from 5.72 preoperatively to 7.79 at 12\u00a0months. There was a significant decrease in the number of infections of the affected arm postoperatively and a decreased need for physiotherapy. Complications occurred in 17 patients and consisted mainly of minor wound complications.\nVLNT continues to demonstrate its value as a safe and effective treatment option for lymphedema after breast cancer therapy.

{"title": "Vascularization and VEGF expression altered in bovine yolk sacs from IVF and NT technologies.", "abstract": "Reproductive technologies are widely used in cattle, although many are associated with high-embryonic mortality, especially during early gestation, when the yolk sac undergoes macroscopic changes in structure. We hypothesized that vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are affected, thereby affecting embryonic and placental differentiation. To test this, we studied yolk sac development and gene expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor system (VEGF-A, VEGFR-1/Flt-1, VEGFR-2/KDR). Samples from Days 25 to 40/41 of pregnancy from control cattle (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and from pregnancies established with IVF, (n\u00a0=\u00a07) or somatic cell nuclear transfer/clones (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were examined by histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Yolk sacs in IVF- and nuclear transfer-derived pregnancies were immature. Development of villi was sparse in IVF yolk sacs, whereas vascularization was barely formed in clones and was associated, in part, with thin or interrupted endothelium. Transcript levels of the genes characterized exceed minimum detection limits for all groups, except in the mentioned clone with interrupted endothelium. Levels of mRNA for VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 were significantly higher in IVF yolk sacs. Clones had substantial individual variation in gene expression (both upregulation and downregulation). Our data confirmed the broad range in expression of VEGF genes. Furthermore, overexpression in IVF yolk sacs may compensate for an immature yolk sac structure, whereas in clones, patchy expression may cause structural alterations of blood vessels. In conclusion, we inferred that disturbances of yolk sac vasculature contributed to increased early embryonic mortality of bovine pregnancies established with reproductive technologies.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2016-10-13", "authors": ["Andrea MariaMess", "Ana Claudia OliveiraCarreira", "Cl\u00e1udiaMarinovic de Oliveira", "PaulaFratini", "Phelipe OliveiraFavaron", "Rodrigo da Silva NunesBarreto", "ChristianePfarrer", "Fl\u00e1vio VieiraMeirelles", "Maria AngelicaMiglino"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.09.012"}

In this study, we sought to evaluate the differentiation potential of adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) into urothelial lineage and smooth muscle lineage and to assess the possibility of ureter reconstruction using differentiated cells seeded vessel extracellular matrix (VECM) in a rabbit model. ADSCs were isolated from adipose tissue and identified in vitro. Subsequently, they were cultured with induction medium for urothelium and smooth muscle phenotypes differentiation. After 14 days inducing, differentiation was evaluated by Quantitative PCR and western blot studies. After fluorescent protein labeling, the differentiated cells were seeded onto VECM and cultured under dynamic conditions in vitro. After 7 days culturing, the cell-seeded graft was tubularized and wrapped by two layers of the omentum in a rabbit. Three weeks later, the maturated graft was used for ureter reconstruction in vivo. The ADSCs were isolated and cultured in vitro. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the ADSCs expressed CD29 and CD90, but did not express CD34. After induction, urothelium phenotypes gene (cytokeratin 7) and smooth muscle expression gene (a-SMA and SM-MHC) was confirmed in mRNA and protein level. After cells seeding onto VECM, the induced urothelium cells formed a single epithelial layer, and the induced smooth muscle cells formed a few cell layers during dynamic culture.

We propose a multiscale mathematical model to study this mechanism, explore tumor growth under various initial and microenvironmental conditions, and investigate the effects of blocking this crosstalk.\nWe develop a hybrid continuum-discrete model of highly organized vascularized tumors. VEC-GSC crosstalk is modeled via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by tumor cells and by secretion of soluble factors by VECs that promote GSC self-renewal and proliferation.\nVEC-GSC crosstalk increases both tumor size and GSC fraction by enhancing GSC activity and neovascular development. VEGF promotes vessel formation, and larger VEGF sources typically increase vessel numbers, which enhances tumor growth and stabilizes the tumor shape. Increasing the initial GSC fraction has a similar effect. Partially disrupting the crosstalk by blocking VEC secretion of GSC promoters reduces tumor size but does not increase invasiveness, which is in contrast to antiangiogenic therapies, which reduce tumor size but may significantly increase tumor invasiveness.\nMultiscale modeling supports the targeting of VEC-GSC crosstalk as a promising approach for cancer therapy.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2016-10-11", "authors": ["HuamingYan", "MonicaRomero-Lopez", "Hermann BFrieboes", "Christopher C WHughes", "John SLowengrub"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2016.2615566"}

{"title": "Tumor-associated mutant p53 promotes cancer cell survival upon glutamine deprivation through p21 induction.", "abstract": "Cancer cells depend on glutamine to sustain their increased proliferation and manage oxidative stress, yet glutamine is often depleted at tumor sites owing to excessive cellular consumption and poor vascularization. We have previously reported that p53 protein, although a well-known tumor suppressor, can contribute to cancer cell survival and adaptation to low-glutamine conditions. However, the TP53 gene is frequently mutated in tumors, and the role of mutant p53 (mutp53) in response to metabolic stress remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-associated mutp53 promotes cancer cell survival upon glutamine deprivation both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, cancer cells expressing mutp53 proteins are more resistant to glutamine deprivation than cells with wild-type p53. Depletion of endogenous mutp53 protein in human lymphoma cells leads to cell sensitivity to glutamine withdrawal, whereas expression of mutp53 in p53 null cells results in resistance to glutamine deprivation. Furthermore, we found that mutp53 proteins hyper-transactivate p53-target gene CDKN1A upon glutamine deprivation, thus triggering cell cycle arrest and promoting cell survival.

We then collected data of the injuries, modes of conventional reconstruction (CR), and deficits. For the FT recipients, we critically reviewed the psychosocial screening process and post-transplantation aesthetic, functional, and psychosocial outcomes.\nA total of six individuals post-SIGSWs were screened for FT. All of them had undergone CR, with five receiving loco-regional flaps and free tissue transfers, and one undergoing serial debridement and primary soft-tissue repair.

In this report, we describe a novel missense mutation of the Norrie disease gene (NDP) in a Chinese family with X-linked FEVR. Ophthalmologic evaluation was performed on four male patients and seven unaffected individuals after informed consent was obtained. Venous blood was collected from the 11 members of this family, and genomic DNA was extracted using standard methods. The coding exons 2 and 3 and their corresponding exon-intron junctions of NDP were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and then subjected to direct DNA sequencing. A novel missense mutation (c.310A>C) in exon 3, leading to a lysine-to-glutamine substitution at position 104 (p.Lys104Gln), was identified in all four patients with X-linked FEVR. Three unaffected female individuals (III2, IV3, and IV11) were found to be carriers of the mutation. This mutation was not detected in other unaffected individuals. The mutation c.310A>C (p.Lys104Gln) in exon 3 of NDP is associated with FEVR in the studied family.

Recent technological advances in biofabrication and bioprinting have been reported which present significant steps toward achieving this aim. While many approaches to address this challenge derive from microfabrication techniques, progress in the material science field and 3D printing technologies fields have introduced exciting new possibilities for the creation of increasingly complex and functional vascularized tissues. Here, we provide a brief overview of the process of vascularization and its importance within the fields of RM and tissue engineering (TE). We give a brief synopsis of various strategies that have been reported to induce cell patterning for a designed vascular network within a TE construct, including material-based strategies, structural molding approaches, and direct cell-patterning techniques. As well as highlighting advances in the field, we discuss possible areas for further development; in particular, we advocate a combination of strategies to successfully overcome current limitations in developing functional artificial tissues.

This is due in part to the lack of integration of image-based patient specific design with 3D biomaterial printing within a relevant regulatory framework, namely design control, required by the FDA. In this manuscript, we describe the integration of image-based, multi-scale patient specific design with 3D biomaterial printing within a design control framework for clinical translation. Specifically, we define design inputs for patient specific implants and scaffolds, and utilize image-based patient specific design to achieve these design inputs. We then illustrate realization of these topology designed patient specific implants by laser sintering of polycaprolactone (PCL). Finally, we present initial results in large animal models using 3D printed PCL implants addressing two challenging problems in tissue reconstruction: 1) designing and 3D printing implantable devices to allow growth in pediatric airway applications and 2) utilizing 3D printed scaffolds as foundations for pre-fabricated flaps to obtain vascularization and bone formation for large volume bone/soft tissue reconstruction.

The goal of this study was to compare local versus intravenous administration of autologous skeletal muscle precursor cells (skMPCs) when administered to nonhuman primates (NHPs) with either acute or chronic ISD.\nThirty-two adult female monkeys were divided into eight groups (n\u2009=\u20094/group): (1) control; (2) surgically induced ISD/no treatment; (3) acute ISD (6-week duration)/local vehicle only; (4) acute ISD/local skMPC injection; (5) acute ISD/systemic skMPC; (6) chronic ISD (6-month duration)/local vehicle; (7) chronic ISD/local skMPC; (8) chronic ISD/systemic skMPC. Maximal urethral pressures (MUP) were measured prior to ISD, prior to treatment and at 3 and 6\u00a0months following treatment. Quantitative histology was used to measure muscle/collagen content, somatic innervation, and vascularity of the sphincter complexes.\nIn NHPs with acute ISD both systemic and local administration of skMPCs increased resting MUP values and sphincter muscle content (p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. ISD/vehicle). However, the effects of systemic skMPC administration were significantly lower than those of local injection (p\u2009>\u20090.05). In NHPs with chronic ISD local skMPC administration had reduced (compared to NHPs with acute ISD) effects on MUP and sphincter muscle values (p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. acute ISD/skMPC); systemic administration had no effect. Pudendal nerve-stimulated increases in MUP were significant only in acute ISD NHPs with local skMPC treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. resting MUP). The extent of sphincter vascularization and innervation were directly related to MUP and sphincter muscle content.\nBoth the chronicity of ISD and the route of cell injection influence the efficacy of cell therapy in monkey models of ISD.

Hydrogel has achieved some promising results as scaffolds for vascularization. However, the vascularization of hydrogel is still constrained by its inherent submicron- or nano-sized pores. In this study, two gelatin-based micro-cavitary gel (Gel-MCG) constructs with varying densities of micro-cavities were developed with a photocrosslinkable gelatin methacrylate (Gel-MA) precursor and porogenic gelatin microspheres (MS), and their functions in supporting vascularization within hydrogels were evaluated with endothelial progenitor outgrowth cells (EPOCs). The increase of cavitary density could enhance the vascularization of Gel-MCG constructs. After 14 d of culture in vitro, the vascularization of Gel-MCG constructs with higher cavitary density was significantly superior to that of gelatin spongy control and the fusion of vascularized cavities in the constructs could be observed. Further subcutaneous implantation of the Gel-MCG constructs with higher cavitary density into nude mice also showed obvious vascular invasion from host tissues. Taken together, these results indicate that the increase in cavitary density can efficiently facilitate the vascularization of Gel-MCG constructs both in vitro and in vivo and that such highly-porous Gel-MCG constructs have great potential to be a promising scaffold for the development of vascularized tissue constructs.", "journal": "Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)", "date": "2016-10-08", "authors": ["JiayinFu", "ChangjiangFan", "Wei ShanLai", "DonganWang"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-6041/11/5/055012"}

A rat orthotopic lung transplantation model was developed in the early 1970s, and using this model, our laboratory has shown that the immunopathogenesis of CLAD involves both allogeneic immunity and autoimmunity. However, further investigation of CLAD is limited by the scarcity of transgenic and knockout strains. The model most widely used to study CLAD, the mouse model of heterotopic tracheal transplantation, has some incomplete pathophysiologic features of CLAD, which limits the utility of this model. Unlike other solid organ transplants, vascularized and aerated murine lung transplantation has only recently been developed. We have also reported that minor, but not major, histocompatibility antigens mismatch induced the development of CLAD in murine orthotopic lung transplants and that CLAD development was interleukin-17-dependent. This mini-review underscores the history and development of rodent models of CLAD after lung transplant, including the findings from our previous studies.

Intraoperative standard B-mode images were acquired using a 3.5-MHz to 12-MHz ultrasonographic probes (linear and curvilinear) on various ultrasound machines. The benefits and disadvantages of iUS were assessed for each case.\nA total number of 158 intradural spinal lesions were operated on using iUS. Of these, 107 lesions (68%) were intradural extramedullary and 51 (32%) were intramedullary. All lesions were clearly visible using the ultrasound probe. The high-frequency linear probes (10-12 MHz) provided a better image quality compared with lower-frequency probes. Color and power-angiography modes were helpful in assessing the vascularization of the tumors and location of the major vessels in the vascular lesions.\nWe document how iUS was used to facilitate safe and efficient spinal tumor resection at each stage of the operation. iUS was beneficial in confirmation of tumor location and extension, planning myelotomy, and estimation of degree of resection of the intramedullary tumors. It was particularly helpful in guiding the approach in redo surgeries for recurrent spinal cord tumors.\niUS has a fast learning curve and offers additional intraoperative information that can help improve surgical accuracy and therefore may reduce procedure-related morbidity.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2016-10-08", "authors": ["MarcelIvanov", "AlexandruBudu", "HughSims-Williams", "IonPoeata"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2016.09.097"}
{"title": "Improving the accuracy of mandibular reconstruction with vascularized iliac crest flap: Role of computer-assisted techniques.", "abstract": "While vascularized iliac crest flap is widely used for mandibular reconstruction, it is often challenging to predict the clinical outcome in a conventional operation based solely on the surgeon's experience. Herein, we aimed to improve this procedure by using computer-assisted techniques. We retrospectively reviewed records of 45 patients with mandibular tumor who underwent mandibulectomy and reconstruction with vascularized iliac crest flap from January 2008 to June 2015. Computer-assisted techniques including virtual plan, stereomodel, pre-bending individual reconstruction plate, and surgical navigation were used in 15 patients. The other 30 patients underwent conventional surgery based on the surgeon's experience. Condyle position and reconstructed mandible contour were evaluated based on post-operative computed tomography. Complications were also evaluated during the follow-up. Flap success rate of the patients was 95.6% (43/45). Those in the computer-assisted group presented with better outcomes of the mandibular contour (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and condyle position (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026). Further, they also experienced beneficial dental restoration (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011) and postoperative appearance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028). The difference between postoperative effect and virtual plan was within the acceptable error margin. There is no significant difference in the incidence of post-operative complications.

{"title": "A Computational Model of Osteochondral Defect Repair Following Implantation of Stem Cell-Laden Multiphase Scaffolds.", "abstract": "Developing successful tissue engineering strategies requires an understanding of how cells within an implanted scaffold interact with the host environment. The objective of this study was to use a computational mechanobiological model to explore how the design of a cell-laden scaffold influences the spatial formation of cartilage and bone within an osteochondral defect. Tissue differentiation was predicted using a previously developed model, in which cell fate depends on the local oxygen tension and the mechanical environment within a damaged joint. This model was first updated to include a rule through which mature cartilage was resistant to both terminal differentiation and vascularization, and then used to simulate osteochondral defect repair following the implantation of various cell-free and cell-laden scaffolds. While delivery of a cell-free scaffold led to only marginal improvements in joint repair, implantation of a cell-laden bilayered scaffold was predicted to significantly increase cartilage formation in the chondral phase of the scaffold. Despite these improvements, bone still progressed into the chondral regions of these engineered implants by means of endochondral ossification during the later stages of repair. This led to thinning of the cartilage tissue, which in turn resulted in a prediction of increased tissue strain and, eventually, increases in fibrocartilage formation as a result of this altered mechanical stimulus. In contrast to this, the model predicted that implantation of a trilayered scaffold, which included a compact layer to confine angiogenesis to the osseous phase of the defect, further improves joint regeneration. This is achieved by allowing chondrogenically primed mesenchymal stem cells, which are seeded into the chondral phase of the implant, to form stable cartilage, which was ultimately resistant to both vascularization and endochondral ossification. These models provide a framework for exploring how environmental factors impact bone, cartilage, and joint regeneration and can be used to inform the design of new tissue engineering strategies for use in orthopedic medicine.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The need of integrating blood vessels brings additional complexity, limiting the available approaches that are suitable to produce integrated cardiovascular organoids. In this work we propose a novel hybrid strategy based on 3D bioprinting, to fabricate endothelialized myocardium. Enabled by the use of our composite bioink, endothelial cells directly bioprinted within microfibrous hydrogel scaffolds gradually migrated towards the peripheries of the microfibers to form a layer of confluent endothelium. Together with controlled anisotropy, this 3D endothelial bed was then seeded with cardiomyocytes to generate aligned myocardium capable of spontaneous and synchronous contraction. We further embedded the organoids into a specially designed microfluidic perfusion bioreactor to complete the endothelialized-myocardium-on-a-chip platform for cardiovascular toxicity evaluation. Finally, we demonstrated that such a technique could be translated to human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to construct endothelialized human myocardium. We believe that our method for generation of endothelialized organoids fabricated through an innovative 3D bioprinting technology may find widespread applications in regenerative medicine, drug screening, and potentially disease modeling.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-10-07", "authors": ["Yu ShrikeZhang", "AndreaArneri", "SimoneBersini", "Su-RyonShin", "KaiZhu", "ZahraGoli-Malekabadi", "JulioAleman", "CristinaColosi", "FabioBusignani", "ValeriaDell'Erba", "ColinBishop", "ThomasShupe", "DaniloDemarchi", "MatteoMoretti", "MarcoRasponi", "Mehmet RemziDokmeci", "AnthonyAtala", "AliKhademhosseini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.003"}

Studying the miRNome of locally advanced breast tumors we unsuspectedly found a dramatically repression of miR-204, a small non-coding RNA with no previous involvement in tumor angiogenesis. Downregulation of miR-204 was confirmed in an independent cohort of patients and breast cancer cell lines. Gain-of-function analysis indicates that ectopic expression of miR-204 impairs cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration, invasion, and the formation of 3D capillary networks in vitro. Likewise, in vivo vascularization and angiogenesis were suppressed by miR-204 in a nu/nu mice model. Genome-wide profiling of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing miR-204 revealed changes in the expression of hundred cancer-related genes. Of these, we focused on the study of pro-angiogenic ANGPT1 and TGF\u03b2R2. Functional analysis using luciferase reporter and rescue assays confirmed that ANGPT1 and TGF\u03b2R2 are novel effectors downstream of miR-204. Accordingly, an inverse correlation between miR-204 and ANGPT1/TGF\u03b2R2 expression was found in breast tumors. Knockdown of TGF\u03b2R2, but not ANGPT1, impairs cell proliferation and migration whereas inhibition of both genes inhibits angiogenesis.

{"title": "Identification of HIF-2\u03b1-regulated genes that play a role in human microvascular endothelial sprouting during prolonged hypoxia in vitro.", "abstract": "During prolonged hypoxic conditions, endothelial cells change their gene expression to adjust to the low oxygen environment. This process is mainly regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factors, HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1. Although endothelial cells do not form sprouts during prolonged hypoxic culturing, silencing of HIF-2\u03b1 partially restores sprout formation. The present study identifies novel HIF-2\u03b1-target genes that may regulate endothelial sprouting during prolonged hypoxia. The gene expression profile of primary human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVECs) that were cultured at 20\u00a0% oxygen was compared to hMVECs that were cultured at 1\u00a0% oxygen for 14\u00a0days by using genome-wide RNA-sequencing. The differentially regulated genes in hypoxia were compared to the genes that were differentially regulated upon silencing of HIF-2\u03b1 in hypoxia.

During further development, differentiating podocytes regain mesenchyme-like cell characteristics by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to formation of the terminally differentiated, non-dividing cell. Both MET and EMT processes involve changes in content and organization of cytoskeletal and actin filaments, accompanied by the increased glomerular vascularization. Here, we analyze and compare normal human developing, postnatal and nephrotic podocytes and glomeruli, using immunohistochemical and double immunofluorescent methods for detection of markers of cytoskeletal filaments (nestin, cytokeratin 10-CK10, vimentin and \u03b1-SMA), vasculogenesis (CD31 and VEGF) and podocyte function (receptor for advanced glycation end products, RAGE). In addition, electron microscopy is used to detect ultrastructural changes of the podocytes. Early metanephric cup mesenchyme expresses all investigated markers except \u03b1-SMA, which characterizes only surface mesenchymal cells. In differentiating podocytes and cells of Bowman's capsule (parietal podocytes) nestin decreases, vimentin increases, while CK10 gradually disappears. Increase in \u03b1-SMA is associated with blood vessels development, appearance of podocyte pedicles and slit diaphragm and loss of intercellular connections (zonulae adherentes). Increase in CD31 characterizes vascular glomerular tufts development, while decrease in RAGE expression accompanies normal podocyte differentiation. In congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type, dedifferentiated podocytes display changes in cytoskeletal filaments and depletion of podocyte pedicles, while glomerular vascular supply is diminished. Our data also suggest high potential of metanephric mesenchyme and parietal podocytes in possible regeneration of the damaged podocytes.", "journal": "Histochemistry and cell biology", "date": "2016-10-04", "authors": ["NatalijaFilipovic", "KatarinaVukojevic", "IvanaBocina", "MarijanSaraga", "Merica GlavinaDurdov", "BorisKablar", "MirnaSaraga-Babic"], "doi": "10.1007/s00418-016-1507-7"}

Periodontal tissue regeneration has therefore always been the ultimate goal of dentists and researchers. Existing fabrication methods mainly focused on a top-down tissue engineering strategy in which several drawbacks remain, including low throughput and limited diffusion properties resulting from a large sample size. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) is a kind of photocrosslinkable and biocompatible hydrogel, with the capacities of enabling cell encapsulation and regeneration of functional tissues. Here, we developed a novel method to fabricate GelMA/nanohydroxylapatite (nHA) microgel arrays using a photocrosslinkable strategy. The viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation and in vivo osteogenesis of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) encapsulated in microgels were evaluated. The results suggested that such microgels provide great potential for periodontal tissue repair and regeneration.\nMicrogel arrays were fabricated by blending different weight ratios of GelMA and nHA. hPDLSCs were encapsulated in GelMA/nHA microgels of various ratios for a systematic evaluation of cell viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo osteogenesis in nude mice was also studied.\nThe GelMA/nHA microgels exhibited appropriate microarchitecture, mechanical strength, and surface roughness, thus enabling cell adhesion and proliferation.

Angiogenesis, playing a predominant role in tumor progression, is widely considered as a key point of tumor treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of miR-383 on proliferation, migration, tube formation and angiogenesis of glioma-exposed endothelial cells (GECs) in vitro and to further elucidate its possible molecular mechanisms. The expression of miR-383 in GECs was significantly downregulated compared with that in normal endothelial cells (ECs). Overexpression of miR-383 dramatically inhibited the proliferation, migration, tube formation and spheroid-based angiogenesis of GECs in vitro. Dual-luciferase reporter results demonstrated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a target gene of miR-383. Furthermore, overexpression or silencing of either miR-383 or VEGF was performed simultaneously to further clarify that miR-383 inhibited proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of GECs in vitro by targeting VEGF. Finally, VEGF/VEGFR2-mediated FAK and Src signaling pathways might contribute to anti-angiogenesis of GECs.

The types of ossification as well as the evolution of different tissues in the regenerate were determined using histomorphometry and inmunohistochemical studies. The evolution of trabeculae thickness, osteoblast and osteoclast densities, relationship between collagen types and changes in vascularization were also studied.\nOssification was primarily intramembranous, with some focus of endochondral ossification in isolated animals. The cell counts showed a progression of cellular activity from the periphery to the centre, presenting the same progression as the growth of bone trabeculae, whose trabeculae thickness was quadrupled at the end of remodelling. Inmunohistochemical studies confirmed the prevalence of type I collagen and the ratio of the Type I/Type II collagen ratio was found to be 2.48. The percentages of the vascularized areas were proximally higher than distally in all animals, but distal zone obtained higher rates than the central region.\nBone transport regenerate exhibits a centripetal ossification model and a mixed pattern with predominance of intramembranous over endochondral ossification. The data obtained resemble partially to those found in models of bone lengthening applied to large animals.

TAMP scaffolds were prepared and sterilized. Patients were screened for eligibility, and 6 patients accounting for 14 extraction sockets were included in this stage. Sockets were randomly allocated to either control (left empty) or test (grafted with TAMP scaffold particles). Follow-up was done after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 to 17 wk with digital periapical radiographs to evaluate changes in crestal bone height and bone mineral density (BMD), 3-dimensional volumetric analysis of impression casts, and histologic analysis of core biopsies. Furthermore, alveolar bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were cultured from control and test sockets following biopsy retrieval to evaluate the ability of TAMP bioactive glass scaffolds to recruit host progenitor cells. Results showed that sockets grafted with TAMP bioactive glass scaffolds better preserved height after 3 mo where mesially 57.1% of test cases showed preservation of socket height, compared with 28.6% of control cases. Distally, this was 42.9% of test cases versus none of the control cases. Regarding BMD, the test sides had higher BMD in all 3 sections of the socket, with the greatest reduction in BMD found in the coronal third. Results were not statistically significant. Histologically, sockets grafted with TAMP bioactive glass scaffolds showed a distinct pattern of bone healing characterized by vertical trabeculae and large vascularized marrow spaces with sockets showing corticalization. Volumetric analysis showed a better preservation of socket contour with TAMP bioactive glass scaffolds. TAMP bioactive glass scaffolds appeared to enhance the recruitment of stem cells from the grafted sockets.

Given their straightforward and relatively easy isolation from extracted third molars, dental stem cells (DSCs) have become an attractive source of mesenchymal-like stem cells. Over the past decade, there have been numerous studies supporting the angiogenic, neuroprotective, and neurotrophic effects of the DSC secretome. Together with their ability to differentiate into endothelial cells and neural cell types, this makes DSCs suitable candidates for dental tissue engineering and nerve injury repair.", "journal": "Stem

Thirty pregnant agoutis that ranged in size from small to medium and weighed between 2.5 and 3\u00a0kg underwent B-mode and Doppler ultrasonography for the biometric evaluation of the foetal organs. The foetal aortic blood flow proved to be predominantly systolic, and the measured flow velocity was 78.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.95\u00a0cm/s, with a maximum pressure gradient of 2.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27\u00a0mmHg.

{"title": "Tissue metabolism and host-microbial interactions in the intestinal mucosa.", "abstract": "In recent years, studies in the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa have taught us a number of important lessons related to tissue oxygenation and metabolism in health and disease. The highly vascularized mucosa lies immediately adjacent to an anaerobic lumen containing trillions of metabolically active microbes (i.e. the microbiome) that results in one of the more austere tissue microenvironments in the body. These studies have also implicated a prominent role for oxygen metabolism and hypoxia in inflammation, so called \"inflammatory hypoxia\", that results from the activation of multiple oxygen consuming enzymes. Inflammation-associated shifts in the composition of the microbiome and microbial-derived metabolites have revealed a prominent role for the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in the regulation of key target genes that promote inflammatory resolution. Analyses of these pathways have provided a multitude of opportunities for understanding basic mechanisms of both homeostasis and disease and have defined new targets for intervention.

{"title": "In vitro and in vivo assessment of controlled release and degradation of acoustically responsive scaffolds.", "abstract": "Spatiotemporally controlled release of growth factors (GFs) is critical for regenerative processes such as angiogenesis. A common strategy is to encapsulate the GF within hydrogels, with release being controlled via diffusion and/or gel degradation (i.e., hydrolysis and/or proteolysis). However, simple encapsulation strategies do not provide spatial or temporal control of GF delivery, especially non-invasive, on-demand controlled release post implantation. We previously demonstrated that fibrin hydrogels, which are widely used in tissue engineering and GF delivery applications, can be doped with perfluorocarbon emulsion, thus yielding an acoustically responsive scaffold (ARS) that can be modulated with focused ultrasound, specifically via a mechanism termed acoustic droplet vaporization. This study investigates the impact of ARS and ultrasound properties on controlled release of a surrogate payload (i.e., fluorescently-labeled dextran) and fibrin degradation in vitro and in vivo. Ultrasound exposure (2.5MHz, peak rarefactional pressure: 8MPa, spatial peak time average intensity: 86.4mW/cm\nSimple encapsulation of a molecular payload within a conventional hydrogel scaffold does not provide spatial or temporal control of payload release. Yet, spatiotemporally controlled release of bioactive payloads is critical for tissue regeneration, which often utilizes hydrogel scaffolds to facilitate processes such as angiogenesis. This work investigates the design and performance (both in vitro and in vivo) of hydrogel scaffolds where release of a fluorescent payload is non-invasively and spatiotemporally-controlled using focused ultrasound. We also quantitatively characterize the degradation and vascularization of the scaffolds.

These limitations include an inability to adequately, rapidly, and reproducibly regenerate new bone; high costs and limited manufacturing capacity; and lack of surgical ease of handling. To address these shortcomings, we generated a new, synthetic osteoregenerative biomaterial, hyperelastic \"bone\" (HB). HB, which is composed of 90 weight % (wt %) hydroxyapatite and 10 wt % polycaprolactone or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), could be rapidly three-dimensionally (3D) printed (up to 275 cm(3)/hour) from room temperature extruded liquid inks. The resulting 3D-printed HB exhibited elastic mechanical properties (~32 to 67% strain to failure, ~4 to 11 MPa elastic modulus), was highly absorbent (50% material porosity), supported cell viability and proliferation, and induced osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in vitro over 4 weeks without any osteo-inducing factors in the medium. We evaluated HB in vivo in a mouse subcutaneous implant model for material biocompatibility (7 and 35 days), in a rat posterolateral spinal fusion model for new bone formation (8 weeks), and in a large, non-human primate calvarial defect case study (4 weeks).

{"title": "Influence of Pulse Repetition Frequency on 3-D Power Doppler\u00a0Quantification.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional power Doppler quantification has limited application because of its high dependency on attenuation. The purpose of the study described here was to assess if different degrees of attenuation, depending on pulse repetition frequency (PRF) adjustment, alter 3-D power Doppler quantification in a region of 100% moving blood when using vascularization index, flow index and vascularization flow index (VFI). A cubic-shaped gelatin phantom with a 1.8-mm-internal-diameter silicon tube was used. The tube, placed at 45\u00b0 to the phantom's surface, was filled with blood-mimicking fluid with as constant maximum velocity of 30\u00a0cm/s. Two different attenuation blocks (low and high attenuation) were alternatively placed between the phantom and the transvaginal transducer. One single observer acquired 10 data sets for each PRF level from 0.3 to 7.5\u00a0kHz, using the high- and low-attenuation blocks, for a total of 200 3-D power Doppler data sets. We assessed VFI from 1.5-mm-diameter spherical samples, virtually placed inside the tube, always at the same position. No difference was noted between high- and low-attenuation VFI values when using a PRF of 0.3\u00a0kHz. As PRF increased, it was observed that VFI quantification progressively differed between low and high attenuation. Also, a slope on VFI values for both high- and low-attenuation models could be observed when increasing PRF, particularly above 4.0\u00a0kHz. We concluded that PRF adjustment is very relevant when using VFI to quantify 3-D power Doppler signal.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2016-09-30", "authors": ["Carlos A MSoares", "Theo ZPavan", "Andre HMiyague", "MarekKudla", "Wellington PMartins"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2016.08.015"}

Different approaches are reported in literature but a gold standard treatment has not yet been achieved. Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (TEM) is a miniinvasive approach with well known advantages as magnification, 3D view and lighting of the operative field. Aim of the present review is to report the current evidence in literature about technique and results of RUF treatment by TEM and to suggest some key points for its correct management.\nAfter a medline in Pubmed and Scopus databases, seven papers were eligible for the present study. Data were reviewed on the basis of the cases reported, patient's characteristics, surgical techniques and results.\nEighteen cases have been reported in the literature from 1996 to 2005. The healing success rate was 77.8%. Fecal and urinary diversion were performed before TEM-assisted procedure in the 83% and 94% of cases, respectively. Recurrence was observed in four patients (22%).\nA gold standard treatment of RUF should ensure the complete removal of scar tissue around the fistula, in order to perform a tension free suture on healthy margins with adequate vascularization. Preoperative stoma improves the healing of the fistula, reducing local inflammation and infections.\nThere is not common view of this topic in literature and clarify which could be the best treatment is a key condition due to high failure rate of the surgical proposed techniques.

{"title": "Freestanding 3-D microvascular networks made of alginate hydrogel as a universal tool to create microchannels inside hydrogels.", "abstract": "The diffusion of molecules such as nutrients and oxygen through densely packed cells is impeded by blockage and consumption by cells, resulting in a limited depth of penetration. This has been a major hurdle to a bulk (3-D) culture. Great efforts have been made to develop methods for generating branched microchannels inside hydrogels to support mass exchange inside a bulk culture. These previous attempts faced a common obstacle: researchers tried to fabricate microchannels with gels already loaded with cells, but the fabrication procedures are often harmful to the embedded cells. Herein, we present a universal strategy to create microchannels in different types of hydrogels, which effectively avoids cell damage. This strategy is based on a freestanding alginate 3-D microvascular network prepared by in-situ generation of copper ions from a sacrificial copper template. This alginate network could be used as implants to create microchannels inside different types of hydrogels. This approach effectively addresses the issue of cell damage during microfabrication and made it possible to create microchannels inside different types of gels. The microvascular network produced with this method is (1) strong enough to allow handling, (2) biocompatible to allow cell culturing, and (3) appropriately permeable to allow diffusion of small molecules, while sufficiently dense to prevent blocking of channels when embedded in different types of gels. In addition, composite microtubules could be prepared by simply pre-loading other materials, e.g., particles and large biomolecules, in the hydrogel. Compared with other potential strategies to fabricate freestanding gel channel networks, our method is more rapid, low-cost and scalable due to parallel processing using an industrially mass-producible template. We demonstrated the use of such vascular networks in creating microchannels in different hydrogels and composite gels, as well as with a cell culture in a nutrition gradient based on microfluidic diffusion. In this way, the freestanding hydrogel vascular network we produced is a universal functional unit that can be embedded in different types of hydrogel; users will be able to adopt this strategy to achieve vascular mass exchange in the bulk culture without changing their current protocol. The method is readily implementable to applications in vascular tissue regeneration, drug discovery, 3-D culture, etc.", "journal": "Biomicrofluidics", "date": "2016-09-30", "authors": ["ChongHu", "HanSun", "ZhengzhiLiu", "YinChen", "YangfanChen", "HongkaiWu", "KangningRen"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4961969\n10.1038/nrd1226\n10.1016/j.drudis.2008.11.006\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.007\n10.1126/science.1116995\n10.1038/nbt.2958\n10.1073/pnas.1309408110\n10.1038/nature12298\n10.1073/pnas.0910666106\n10.1038/nrm2236\n10.1126/science.1140171\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.12.003\n10.1039/C3CS60040H\n10.1007/s11095-010-0067-0\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.08.027\n10.1089/ten.tec.2009.0053\n10.1039/C4LC00973H\n10.1021/am300292v\n10.1039/c3lc50079a\n10.1002/mabi.201100351\n10.1002/adma.201305348\n10.1016/j.copbio.2013.09.004\n10.1021/ar300314s\n10.1038/nmat2203\n10.1038/nbt.2989\n10.1038/nmat2022\n10.1073/pnas.1201240109\n10.1021/am400065f\n10.1002/adhm.201200404\n10.1039/b618409j\n10.1038/nmat3357\n10.1002/adma.201305506\n10.1002/adhm.201500792\n10.1039/C6MH00058D\n10.1088/1758-5082/2/3/035003\n10.1002/smll.200801667\n10.1039/B813518E\n10.1021/acsami.5b11445\n10.1021/la960238u\n10.1021/cm011513n\n10.1002/adma.200601787\n10.1002/adma.201501058\n10.1002/smll.201500612\n10.1038/srep17265\n10.1016/S0142-9612(98)00180-X\n10.1021/bm301180c\n10.1021/am508469h\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00299\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.11.021\n10.1039/c4lc00069b\n10.1590/S0100-40422003000600020\n10.1021/i560096a006\n10.1021/ja01545a015\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.07.001\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2011.06.003\n10.4236/jsemat.2013.34A1001\n10.1016/S0168-3659(02)00349-8\n10.1007/BF00500829\n10.1002/bit.260390210\n10.1039/c0lc00466a\n10.1021/nn401768s"}

{"title": "Vascular patterns in the heads of crocodilians: blood vessels and sites of thermal exchange.", "abstract": "Extant crocodilians are a highly apomorphic archosaur clade that is ectothermic, yet often achieve large body sizes that can be subject to higher heat loads. Therefore, the anatomical and physiological roles that blood vessels play in crocodilian thermoregulation need further investigation to better understand how crocodilians establish and maintain cephalic temperatures and regulate neurosensory tissue temperatures during basking and normal activities. The cephalic vascular anatomy of extant crocodilians, particularly American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) was investigated using a differential-contrast, dual-vascular injection technique and high resolution X-ray micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT). Blood vessels were digitally isolated to create representations of vascular pathways. The specimens were then dissected to confirm CT results. Sites of thermal exchange, consisting of the oral, nasal, and orbital regions, were given special attention due to their role in evaporative cooling and cephalic thermoregulation in other diapsids. Blood vessels to and from sites of thermal exchange were studied to detect conserved vascular patterns and to assess their ability to deliver cooled blood to neurosensory tissues. Within the orbital region, both the arteries and veins demonstrated consistent branching patterns, with the supraorbital, infraorbital, and ophthalmotemporal vessels supplying and draining the orbit. The venous drainage of the orbital region showed connections to the dural sinuses via the orbital veins and cavernous sinus. The palatal region demonstrated a vast plexus that comprised both arteries and veins. The most direct route of venous drainage of the palatal plexus was through the palatomaxillary veins, essentially bypassing neurosensory tissues. Anastomotic connections with the nasal region, however, may provide an alternative route for palatal venous blood to reach neurosensory tissues. The nasal region in crocodilians is probably the most prominent site of thermal exchange, as it offers a substantial surface area and is completely surrounded by blood vessels. The venous drainage routes from the nasal region offer routes directly to the dural venous sinuses and the orbit, offering evidence of the potential to directly affect neurosensory tissue temperatures. The evolutionary history of crocodilians is complex, with large-bodied, terrestrial, and possibly endothermic taxa that may have had to deal with thermal loads that likely provided the anatomical building-blocks for such an extensive vascularization of sites of thermal exchange. A clear understanding of the physiological abilities and the role of blood vessels in the thermoregulation of crocodilians neurosensory tissues is not available but vascular anatomical patterns of crocodilian sites of thermal exchange indicate possible physiological abilities that may be more sophisticated than in other extant diapsids.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2016-09-30", "authors": ["William RugerPorter", "Jayc CSedlmayr", "Lawrence MWitmer"], "doi": "10.1111/joa.12539\n10.1002/ar.23375"}

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been proposed as a feasible and minimally invasive technique for in vivo visualization of neovascularization in the evaluation of tumors and atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was the evaluation of mural thrombus and AAAs wall with CEUS. CEUS was performed in a group of seventeen patients with AAAs. The mural thrombus enhancement was recognized in 12 cases, yet no significant correlation between the degree of contrast enhancement and AAAs diameter, thrombus width, and thrombus echogenicity was found. We observed a rise in AAAs thrombus heterogeneity with the increase in the aneurysm diameter (r\u2009=\u20090.62, p\u2009=\u20090.017).

{"title": "Investigating Neovascularization in Rat Decellularized Intestine: An In Vitro Platform for Studying Angiogenesis.", "abstract": "One of the main challenges currently faced by tissue engineers is the loss of tissues postimplantation due to delayed neovascularization. Several strategies are under investigation to create vascularized tissue, but none have yet overcome this problem. In this study, we produced a decellularized natural vascular scaffold from rat intestine to use as an in vitro platform for neovascularization studies for tissue-engineered constructs. Decellularization resulted in almost complete (97%) removal of nuclei and DNA, while collagen, glycosaminoglycan, and laminin content were preserved. Decellularization did, however, result in the loss of elastin and fibronectin. Some proangiogenic factors were retained, as fragments of decellularized intestine were able to stimulate angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. We demonstrated that decellularization left perfusable vascular channels intact, and these could be repopulated with human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Optimization of reendothelialization of the vascular channels showed that this was improved by continuous perfusion of the vasculature and further improved by infusion of human dermal fibroblasts into the intestinal lumen, from where they invaded into the decellularized tissue. Finally we explored the ability of the perfused cells to form new vessels. In the absence of exogenous angiogenic stimuli, Dll4, a marker of endothelial capillary-tip cell activation during sprouting angiogenesis, was absent, indicating that the reformed vasculature was largely quiescent. However, after addition of vascular endothelial growth factor A, Dll4-positive endothelial cells could be detected, demonstrating that this engineered vascular construct maintained its capacity for neovascularization. In summary, we have demonstrated how a natural xenobiotic vasculature can be used as an in vitro model platform to study neovascularization and provide information on factors that are critical for efficient reendothelialization of decellularized tissue.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

These studies were divided into 7 in vitro, 11 in vivo, and 31 clinical studies. In summary, 6 out of 7 (85.7%) and 11 out of 11 (100%) of the in vitro and in vivo studies, respectively, demonstrated a statistically significant advantage for combining PRF to their regenerative therapies. Out of the remaining 31 clinical studies, a total of 8 reported the effects of PRF in a randomized clinical trial, with 5 additional studies (13 total) reporting appropriate controls. In those clinical studies, 9 out of the 13 studies (69.2%) demonstrated a statistically relevant positive outcome for the primary endpoints measured. In total, 18 studies (58% of clinical studies) reported positive wound-healing events associated with the use of PRF, despite using controls. Furthermore, 27 of the 31 clinical studies (87%) supported the use of PRF for soft tissue regeneration and wound healing for a variety of procedures in medicine and dentistry. In conclusion, the results from the present systematic review highlight the positive effects of PRF on wound healing after regenerative therapy for the management of various soft tissue defects found in medicine and dentistry.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Angiogenesis in alkaptonuria.", "abstract": "Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a rare genetic disease that affects the entire joint. Current standard of AKU treatment is palliative and little is known about its physiopathology. Neovascularization is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, a family of related disorders that includes AKU. Here, we investigated the presence of neoangiogenesis in AKU synovium and healthy controls. Synovium from AKU patients, who had undergone total joint replacement or arthroscopy, or from healthy patients without any history of rheumatic diseases, who underwent surgical operation following sport trauma was subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining. Histologic grades were assigned for clinical disease activity and synovitis based on cellular content of the synovium. By immunofluorescence microscopy, using different endothelial cell markers, we observed large vascularization in AKU but not in healthy synovium. Moreover, Western blotting and quantification analyses confirmed strong expression of endothelial cell markers in AKU synovial tissues. Importantly, AKU synovium vascular endothelium expressed high levels of \u03b2-dystroglycan, a protein previously involved in the regulation of angiogenesis in osteoarthritic synovium. This is the first report providing experimental evidences that new blood vessels are formed in AKU synovial tissues, opening new perspectives for AKU therapy.", "journal": "Journal of inherited metabolic disease", "date": "2016-09-28", "authors": ["LiaMillucci", "GiuliaBernardini", "BarbaraMarzocchi", "DanielaBraconi", "MichelaGeminiani", "SilviaGambassi", "MarcellaLaschi", "BrunoFrediani", "FedericoGalvagni", "MaurizioOrlandini", "AnnalisaSantucci"], "doi": "10.1007/s10545-016-9976-3"}

However, it is not clear how VEGF signaling and mechanobiological activation due to interstitial flow cooperate during angiogenesis. Here, we show that endothelial morphogenesis is histone deacetylase-1- (HDAC1) dependent and that interstitial flow increases the phosphorylation of HDAC1, its activity, and its export from the nucleus.

{"title": "A Comparative Animal Study of Tendon Grafts Healing After Remnant-Preserving Versus Conventional Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine if anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction by remnant preservation promotes cell proliferation, vascularization, proprioception recovery, and improved biomechanical properties of the tendon grafts. MATERIAL AND METHODS 75 New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned into the control group (group A), conventional ACL reconstruction group (group B), ACL reconstruction using remnant preservation and graft through remnant sleeve technique group (group C), and ACL reconstruction using remnant preservation and remnant tensioning technique group (group D). The remnant and healing of tendon grafts in groups C and D were observed at 3, 6, and 12 weeks after surgery, and the mRNA expression levels of VEGF, NT-3 and GAP-43 in ACL (group A) or tendon graft samples (groups B, C, and D) were determined by real-time PCR. Tendon graft cell count, microvessel density (MVD), and proprioceptors were determined by H&E staining, CD34, and S-100 immunohistochemical staining. The biomechanical properties of the tendon graft at week 12 in groups B, C, and D were examined by using a tensile strength test. RESULTS Remnant and tendon grafts were not healed at 3, 6, and 12 weeks after the operation in groups C and D. VEGF, NT-3, and GAP-43 mRNA expressions in groups B, C, and D were higher than those in group A (P<0.05), but no significant difference was observed between groups B, C, and D (P>0.05). Furthermore, tendon graft cell count, MVD, proprioception, and biomechanical properties showed no significant differences (P>0.05) among groups B, C, and D at various time points.

{"title": "PlGF and VEGF-A Regulate Growth of High-Risk MYCN-Single Copy Neuroblastoma Xenografts via Different Mechanisms.", "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood and is a rapidly growing, highly-vascularized cancer. NBs frequently express angiogenic factors and high tumor angiogenesis has been associated with poor outcomes. Placental growth factor (PlGF) is an angiogenic protein belonging to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and is up-regulated mainly in pathologic conditions. Recently, PlGF was identified as a member of a gene expression signature characterizing highly malignant NB stem cells drawing attention as a potential therapeutic target in NB. In the present study, we sought to investigate the expression of PlGF in NB patients and the effect of PlGF inhibition on high-risk MYCN-non-amplified SK-N-AS NB xenografts. Human SK-N-AS cells, which are poorly differentiated and express PlGF and VEGF-A, were implanted subcutaneously in athymic nude mice. Treatment was done by intratumoral injection of replication-incompetent adenoviruses (Ad) expressing PlGF- or VEGF-specific short hairpin (sh)RNA, or soluble (s)VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). The effect on tumor growth and angiogenesis was analyzed. High PlGF expression levels were observed in human advanced-stage NBs. Down-regulating PlGF significantly reduced NB growth in established NB xenografts by reducing cancer cell proliferation but did not suppress angiogenesis. In contrast, blocking VEGF by administration of Ad(sh)VEGF and Ad(s)VEGFR2 reduced tumor growth associated with decreased tumor vasculature. These findings suggest that PlGF and VEGF-A modulate MYCN-non-amplified NB tumors by different mechanisms and support a role for PlGF in NB biology.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2016-09-27", "authors": ["KarinZins", "DanielKovatchki", "TrevorLucas", "DietmarAbraham"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms17101613\n10.1016/S1470-2045(03)01166-5\n10.1056/NEJMra0804577\n10.1016/j.ejca.2008.05.015\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2012.11.004\n10.1038/onc.2008.15\n10.1002/ijc.10742\n10.1016/j.scr.2015.08.008\n10.1038/87904\n10.1101/cshperspect.a011056\n10.1182/blood-2002-11-3423\n10.1007/s00281-013-0367-7\n10.1530/ERC-12-0223\n10.1038/nm0603-669\n10.1056/NEJMra0706596\n10.1016/S0959-8049(01)00337-9\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2004.09.006\n10.1053/jpsu.2002.31614\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1936\n10.1016/S0304-3835(03)00082-X\n10.1016/j.canlet.2005.01.049\n10.1200/JCO.2007.11.9230\n10.1093/annonc/mdm510\n10.18632/oncotarget.8694\n10.1038/nrc2152\n10.3858/emm.2012.44.1.023\n10.1016/j.mvr.2012.05.009\n10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00082-2\n10.1016/j.febslet.2005.01.017\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.039\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.033\n10.1016/j.ccr.2011.05.007\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2687\n10.1038/nrd3455\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990331)81:1<113::AID-IJC19>3.0.CO;2-L\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.07.013\n10.1200/JCO.2006.09.0696\n10.1002/stem.145\n10.3390/ijms140917958\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3523\n10.18632/oncotarget.10070\n10.1186/1479-5876-11-295"}

The keratopathy occurs due to limbal stem cell deficiency. When conventional treatments fail, surgical treatments such as corneal limbal transplantation or cultivated oral mucosal epithelium transplantation are the alternatives. Here, we report our experience with the management and monitoring of the progress of a case with aniridic keratopathy treated with a scleral lens.\nWe describe the case of a 30-year-old woman with aniridic keratopathy in both eyes. She visited our outpatient clinic for treatment of visual disturbances in her left eye, which showed a 360\u00b0 invasion of the conjunctiva. Despite conventional treatment with artificial tears and autologous serum eye drops, the left eye started to suffer from recurrent corneal erosions at 19 months after the initial visit. At 50 months after the initial visit, it presented with persistent epithelial defects and decrease in vision because of the invasion of the vascularized conjunctiva with subepithelial fibrosis. Upon concluding that conventional treatment was ineffective, we tried using a scleral lens (Prosthetic Replacement of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem; PROSE). After the scleral lens treatment, the epithelial defect quickly healed, and visual acuity improved. Six years after the initial visit, the patient's right eye also started to show epithelial irregularities, which were also treated with a scleral lens. The visual acuity in the right eye too recovered, and corneal transparency was maintained until 3 years after the scleral lens treatment.\nThe current case showed that long-term scleral lens treatment is a promising option to maintain a healthy ocular surface and visual function in eyes with aniridia caused by limbal stem cell deficiency.

This study evaluated the extent of laryngeal nerve lesions and the individual characteristics for patients with NSUVFP.\nRetrospective, case series.\nPatients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) were evaluated using videolaryngostroboscopy and quantitative laryngeal electromyography. The side of nerve lesions, involvement of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (eSLN), and complete vocal fold motion recovery were evaluated after \u2265 6 month follow-up.\nA total of 207 UVFP patients were recruited, including 153 surgery-related UVFP and 54 NSUVFP patients. Thirty-four (63%) and 20 (37%) NSUVFP patients were further assigned to idiopathic and nonsurgery-related-nonidiopathic (NSNI) groups, respectively. In the idiopathic group, eSLN lesions occurred in all six (100%) patients with right-side paralysis, but in only six of 28 (21%) patients with left-side paralysis (P < 0.001). The turn frequency of the paralyzed thyroarytenoid-lateral cricoarytenoid muscle complex is lower in the NSNI group (333.1 \u00b1 192.1) compared with the idiopathic group (490.2 \u00b1 255.1) (P = 0.02). The probability of complete vocal fold motion recovery did not differ among groups (P > 0.05).\nIdiopathic and NSNI UVFP have different clinical presentations defined by laryngeal electromyography. NSNI UVFP had more severe denervation changes compared with idiopathic UVFP. These results may support two pathogenic mechanisms for idiopathic UVFP: 1) neuropathy specifically involving left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), and 2) neuropathy affecting nerves proximal to the RLN.\n4.

In this technique, the magnetic gradients of an MRI scanner perform image-based steering of magnetically-labelled therapeutics through the vasculature and into tumours. A major challenge of current techniques for MRN is that they alternate between pulse sequences for particle imaging and propulsion. Since no propulsion occurs while imaging the particles, this results in a significant reduction in imaging frequency and propulsive force. We report a new approach in which an imaging sequence is designed to simultaneously image and propel particles. This sequence provides a tradeoff between maximum propulsive force and imaging frequency. In our reported example, the sequence can image at 27\u2009Hz while still generating 95% of the force produced by a purely propulsive pulse sequence. We implemented our pulse sequence on a standard clinical scanner using millimetre-scale particles and demonstrated high-speed (74\u2009mm/s) navigation of a multi-branched vascular network phantom.

Moreover, secretion of various cytokines from pancreatic islets is detrimental to the viability of islet cells in vitro. In this study, we aimed to protect pancreatic islet cells against apoptosis by establishing a method for in situ delivery of curcumin to the pancreatic islets. Self-assembled heterospheroids composed of pancreatic islet cells and curcumin-loaded polymeric microspheres were prepared by the three-dimensional cell culture technique. Release of curcumin in the microenvironment of pancreatic islets promoted survival of the islets. In hypoxic culture conditions, which mimic the in vivo conditions after transplantation, viability of the islets was significantly improved, as indicated by a decreased expression of pro-apoptotic protein and an increased expression of anti-apoptotic protein. Additionally, oxidative stress-induced cell death was suppressed. Thus, unlike co-transplantation of pancreatic islets and free microspheres, which provided a wide distribution of microspheres throughout the transplanted area, the heterospheroid transplantation resulted in colocalization of pancreatic islet cells and microspheres, thereby exerting beneficial effects on the cells.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-09-27", "authors": ["ShivaPathak", "ShobhaRegmi", "BikiGupta", "Bijay KPoudel", "Tung ThanhPham", "Jae-RyongKim", "Pil-HoonPark", "Chul SoonYong", "Jong OhKim", "Young KyungBae", "Sang KyoonKim", "Jee-HeonJeong"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b07897"}

{"title": "Formation and maturation of the murine meniscus.", "abstract": "Meniscal injuries are commonplace, but current surgical repair procedures do not prevent degenerative joint changes that occur after meniscal injury and often lead to osteoarthritis. Successful tissue regeneration in adults often recapitulates events that occur during embryogenesis, suggesting that understanding the regulatory pathways controlling these early processes may provide clues for developing strategies for tissue repair. While the mouse is now widely used to study joint diseases, detailed knowledge of the basic biology of murine meniscus is not readily available. Here, we examine meniscal morphogenesis in mice from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) to 6 months of age using histology, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. We find that the meniscus is a morphologically distinct structure at E16 when it begins to regionalize. At birth, the meniscus has a distinguishable inner, avascular, round chondrocyte cell region, an outer, vascularized, fibroblast cell region, and a surface superficial zone. Maturation begins at 2 weeks of age when the meniscus expresses type I collagen, type II collagen, type X collagen, and MMP-13 in specific patterns. By 4 weeks of age, small areas of ossification are detected in the anterior meniscal horn, a common feature seen in rodents. Maturation appears complete at 8 weeks of age, when the meniscus resembles the adult structure complete with ossifying tissue that contains bone marrow like areas.

{"title": "Structural and functional alterations in the prefrontal cortex after post-weaning social isolation: relationship with species-typical and deviant aggression.", "abstract": "Although the inhibitory control of aggression by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the cornerstone of current theories of aggression control, a number of human and laboratory studies showed that the execution of aggression increases PFC activity; moreover, enhanced activation was observed in aggression-related psychopathologies and laboratory models of abnormal aggression. Here, we investigated these apparently contradictory findings in the post-weaning social isolation paradigm (PWSI), an established laboratory model of abnormal aggression. When studied in the resident-intruder test as adults, rats submitted to PWSI showed increased attack counts, increased share of bites directed towards vulnerable body parts of opponents (head, throat, and belly) and reduced social signaling of attacks. These deviations from species-typical behavioral characteristics were associated with a specific reduction in the thickness of the right medial PFC (mPFC), a bilateral decrease in dendritic and glial density, and reduced vascularization on the right-hand side of the mPFC. Thus, the early stressor interfered with mPFC development. Despite these structural deficits, aggressive encounters enhanced the activation of the mPFC in PWSI rats as compared to controls. A voxel-like functional analysis revealed that overactivation was restricted to a circumscribed sub-region, which contributed to the activation of hypothalamic centers involved in the initiation of biting attacks as shown by structural equation modeling. These findings demonstrate that structural alterations and functional hyperactivity can coexist in the mPFC of rats exposed to early stressors, and suggest that the role of the mPFC in aggression control is more complex than suggested by the inhibitory control theory.", "journal": "Brain structure & function", "date": "2016-09-25", "authors": ["LaszloBiro", "MateToth", "EszterSipos", "BiborkaBruzsik", "AronTulogdi", "SamuelBendahan", "CarmenSandi", "JozsefHaller"], "doi": "10.1007/s00429-016-1312-z"}

{"title": "Improvement of ischemic or congested wound conditions by reconstruction with microsurgical flaps.", "abstract": "Intractable chronic wounds share the basic problem of the environment being unfavorable for wound healing and prone to infection, inflammation, and recurrences. Microsurgical flap provides a healthy, well-vascularized normal tissue to compromised intractable environment, and promotes wound healing. In this report, we present the results of microsurgical flaps used for the reconstruction of chronic intractable conditions including chronic ulcer with an ischemic environment and pathologic lesions with a congestive environment.\nFrom 1997 to 2015, 18 patients received microsurgical flaps for chronic intractable conditions. Among them, three patients had radiation ulcers with an ischemic environment and 15 had pathologic lesions with a congested environment, such as vascular malformations. Nine patients were male, and nine were female. The mean age was 31.9 years. All patients were treated using radical excision and reconstruction with microsurgical tissue transfer.\nAll flaps survived completely. Among three patients with radiation ulcers, two had minor wound disruptions, which were managed conservatively. No further episodes of infections or breakdowns occurred. Among 15 patients who had pathologic lesions, one suffered facial palsy of the forehead. No complications in terms of infection, or recurrences were noted, and resolution of the residual surrounding lesions was observed on follow-ups. No donor related problems occurred in any patients. The mean follow-up period was 10.7 years.\nIn this report, we present the results of reconstruction of chronic intractable conditions using microsurgical flaps.

Based on an increasing number of literature reports, maximal safe resection is recommended as the first line of treatment whenever possible. However, distinguishing tumor tissue from the surrounding normal brain is often challenging with infiltrating neoplasms, even with the assistance of intraoperative, microscopic and conventional neuronavigation systems. Therefore, any technique that enhances the detection and visualization of LGGs intraoperatively is certainly desirable.\nIn this paper, we reviewed the role of intraoperative conventional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as a tool for extending tumor resection in LGGs. Moreover, our experience with this technology is reported and discussed.\nBoth B-mode and CEUS are helpful in highlighting LGGs, detecting tumor margins and providing additional information such as vascularization, thus improving the safety of a more radical resection.\nAlthough the full potentialities of the method are yet to be explored, intraoperative ultrasound is a promising tool in oncologic surgery and LGG surgery.", "journal": "Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery", "date": "2016-09-24", "authors": ["LucaMattei", "FrancescoPrada", "Federico GiuseppeLegnani", "AlessandroPerin", "AlessandroOlivi", "FrancescoDiMeco"], "doi": "10.1007/s00381-016-3186-z"}

A review.", "abstract": "Desmoplastic infantile gangliogliomas (DIGs) and desmoplastic infantile astrocytomas (DIAs) are tumors typical of the infantile age. A large size, with a mixed solid and cystic component, clinical presentation with progressing signs of increased intracranial pressure, a prominent benign desmoplastic structure at histological examination, and a favorable clinical course in the majority of cases are the prominent features of these tumors. The objective of the present paper was to review the pertinent literature on the topic together with our personal experience, with the aim of an updated review of the subject.\nOnly 28 papers are present in the literature devoted to DIGs and DIAs, most of them reporting on single cases or small series, with a total of 107 patients aged from 5\u00a0days to 48\u00a0months with a slight male prevalence. Most of the reported cases refer to supratentorial and hemispheric locations, a few cases involving the hypothalamic region, the posterior fossa, and the spinal cord. The typical MRI appearance is of large mixed solid and cystic tumors with a spontaneous hyperintense T2 appearance of the solid part which also shows a strong contrast enhancement. Mixed ganglionic and astrocytic cells are identifiable in DIGs, whereas DIAs are typically featured by the exclusive presence of glial cells. In both cases, more primitive cells may be observed, which present a higher number of mitoses and these areas can mimic the features of malignant astrocytomas. Surgery represents the treatment of choice; however, radical removal has been reported as possible only in around 30\u00a0% of the cases: the low age of the patients together with their low weight and the large size of and the hyper-vascularized structure of the tumors represent the main factors limiting surgery. Pure observation is considered as first choice in children undergoing a partial/subtotal tumor resection, chemotherapic regimens being considered in cases of recurrences after a second look surgery.

{"title": "A composite critical-size rabbit mandibular defect for evaluation of craniofacial tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "Translational biomaterials targeted toward the regeneration of large bone defects in the mandible require a preclinical model that accurately recapitulates the regenerative challenges present in humans. Computational modeling and in vitro assays do not fully replicate the in vivo environment. Consequently, in vivo models can have specific applications such as those of the mandibular angle defect, which is used to investigate bone regeneration in a nonload-bearing area, and the inferior border mandibular defect, which is a model for composite bone and nerve regeneration, with both models avoiding involvement of soft tissue or teeth. In this protocol, we describe a reproducible load-bearing critical-size composite tissue defect comprising loss of soft tissue, bone and tooth in the mandible of a rabbit. We have previously used this procedure to investigate bone regeneration, vascularization and infection prevention in response to new biomaterial formulations for craniofacial tissue engineering applications. This surgical approach can be adapted to investigate models such as that of regeneration in the context of osteoporosis or irradiation. The procedure can be performed by researchers with basic surgical skills such as dissection and suturing. The procedure takes 1.5-2 h, with \u223c2 h of immediate postoperative care, and animals should be monitored daily for the remainder of the study. For bone tissue engineering applications, tissue collection typically occurs 12 weeks after surgery.

The morphological, histological and molecular studies revealed the presence of fibroblasts on dressing materials which facilitated wound healing, vascularization and regeneration. Further it was also observed that cells secreted extracellular matrix proteins which formed a layer on the surface of membranes and promoted the migration of epidermal cells from the neighboring tissues surrounding the wound.

The degree of pericyte coverage and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin expression on WT and R-Ras KO retinal blood vessels was quantified using confocal microscopy. The correlation of R-Ras with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and human serum albumin on human proliferative diabetic retinopathy membranes was assessed using immunohistochemistry.\nIn retina, R-Ras expression was mostly restricted to the vasculature. Retinal vessels in the R-Ras KO mice were significantly more permeable than WT controls in the OIR model. A significant reduction in the direct physical contact between pericytes and blood vessel endothelium as well as reduced VE-cadherin immunostaining was found in R-Ras-deficient mice. In human proliferative diabetic retinopathy neovascular membranes, R-Ras expression negatively correlated with increased vascular leakage and expression of VEGFR2, a marker of blood vessel immaturity.\nOur results suggest that R-Ras has a role in controlling retinal vessel maturation and stabilization in ischemic retinopathy and provides a potential target for pharmacologic manipulation to treat diabetic retinopathy.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2016-09-23", "authors": ["MariaV\u00e4h\u00e4tupa", "StuartPrince", "SuviVataja", "TeijaMertimo", "MarkoKataja", "KatiKinnunen", "VarpuMarjom\u00e4ki", "HannuUusitalo", "MasanobuKomatsu", "Tero A HJ\u00e4rvinen", "HanneleUusitalo-J\u00e4rvinen"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.16-19212"}

While BMP-2 is well recognized for its role in promoting fracture healing through proliferation and differentiation of osteoclast precursors, it is not a growth factor known to promote the process of angiogenesis, which is also critical for complete bone tissue repair. PDGF, in contrast, is a known regulator of angiogenesis, and also a powerful chemoattractant for osteoblast precursor cells. It has been suggested that presentation of PDGF followed by BMP may better promote vascularized bone tissue formation. Yet, it is unclear as to how cells would respond to various durations of delivery of each growth factor as well as to various amounts of overlap in presentation in terms of angiogenesis. Using a three-dimensional in vitro Matrigel plug model, we observed how various presentation schedules of PDGF and BMP-2 influenced tubule formation by human mesenchymal stem cells and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells. We observed that sequential presentation of PDGF to BMP-2 led to increased tubule formation over simultaneous delivery of these growth factors. Importantly, a 2-4 day overlap in the sequential presentation of PDGF and BMP-2 increased tubule formation as compared with groups with zero or complete growth factor overlap, suggesting that a moderate amount of angiogenic and osteogenic growth factor overlap may be beneficial for processes associated with angiogenesis.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Canine ASCs were isolated and cultured from adipose tissue, and differentiation was induced by culturing ASCs in dermal papilla forming media. DPLTs were embedded in collagen gel, and their structural characteristics and protein expression were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin stain and immunohistochemistry. Athymic nude mice were divided into two groups (control and DPLTs groups), and DPLTs were injected in skin wounds of mice in the DPLTs group. The trichogenicity of DPLTs was assessed by gross and histological evaluations for 30 days. The fate and the growth factor-secretion effect of DPLTs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. DPLTs have a compact aggregated structure, form extracellular matrix and highly express the protein specific for dermal papillae, including ALP and versican.

In such cases, perifascial areolar tissue grafting (PATG) may be performed as a minimally invasive surgical procedure. However, perifascial areolar tissue (PAT) is located deep in the subcutaneous layer. It was considered that grafting of the superficial vascular network might enable less invasive surgery. This study reports use of subdermal areolar tissue (SAT) and superficial fascia (SF) to close avascular areas.\nThis study treated eight areas of exposed bone, tendon, or orthopaedic fixation device in seven patients treated in the department between 2010-2013. The patients included five men and two women aged 15-80 years. Subdermal areolar tissue grafting (SATG) was performed on four areas, and superficial fascia grafting (SFG) on the remaining four areas. In all cases, split thickness skin graft (STSG) was used to cover the grafted tissue in a single procedure.\nThe tissue grafted successfully in seven areas, and primary engraftment of the skin grafts was also achieved in three areas treated with SATG and one area treated with SFG. Additional skin grafting was performed to achieve closure in one site treated with SATG and two sites treated with SFG. The tissue graft became necrotic in one site treated with SFG. There were no problems at any donor sites and no graft site infections or other complications.\nSATG and SFG achieved good clinical results for the closure of exposed avascular tissue or artifacts.", "journal": "Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery", "date": "2016-09-20", "authors": ["MasahideGondo", "HajimeMatsumura", "KatsuekiWatanabe"], "doi": "10.1080/2000656X.2016.1223088"}
{"title": "The Janus-Faced Role of Antioxidants in Cancer Cachexia: New Insights on the Established Concepts.", "abstract": "Chronic inflammation and excessive loss of skeletal muscle usually occur during cancer cachexia, leading to functional impairment and delaying the cure of cancer. The release of cytokines by tumor promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn regulate catabolic pathways involved in muscle atrophy. ROS also exert a dual role within tumor itself, as they can either promote proliferation and vascularization or induce senescence and apoptosis. Accordingly, previous studies that used antioxidants to modulate these ROS-dependent mechanisms, in cancer and cancer cachexia, have obtained contradictory results, hence the need to gather the main findings of these studies and draw global conclusions in order to stimulate more oriented research in this field. Based on the literature reviewed in this paper, it appears that antioxidant supplementation is (1) beneficial in cancer cachectic patients with antioxidant deficiencies, (2) most likely harmful in cancer patients with adequate antioxidant status (i.e., lung, gastrointestinal, head and neck, and esophageal), and (3) not recommended when undergoing radiotherapy. At the moment, measuring the blood levels of antioxidants may help to identify patients with systemic deficiencies. This approach is simple to realize but could not be a gold standard method for cachexia, as it does not necessarily reflect the redox state in other organs, like muscle.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2016-09-20", "authors": ["MohamadAssi", "Am\u00e9lieR\u00e9billard"], "doi": "10.1155/2016/9579868\n10.1002/bjs.1800840214\n10.1016/s1470-2045(10)70218-7\n10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2011.01.001\n10.1159/000227407\n10.1080/01926230290166724\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03907.x\n10.1016/j.tibs.2006.07.005\n10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.034\n10.1089/ars.2006.8.1865\n10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19961127)68:58216;637::aid-ijc148217;3.0.co;2-z\n10.1016/j.ygyno.2011.12.435\n10.1016/j.clnu.2011.10.005\n10.1634/theoncologist.2009-0153\n10.1158/1055-9965.epi-05-0538\n10.1080/10715760303849\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.12.019\n10.1016/s0140-6736(04)17138-9\n10.1023/a:1020552501345\n10.1007/s13539-013-0116-8\n10.1016/j.jhep.2010.08.012\n10.1124/jpet.114.216879\n10.1200/jco.2007.13.5905\n10.1093/jnci/djn148\n10.1152/physrev.00016.2008\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.11.006\n10.1152/ajpendo.90529.2008\n10.1002/ijc.10143\n10.1093/emboj/20.23.6712\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6600448\n10.1002/jcph.112\n10.1016/j.febslet.2005.02.017\n10.1016/j.pathophys.2014.05.003\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00128.2014\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2010.12.009\n10.1016/j.molmet.2015.11.004\n10.1016/j.taap.2005.02.001\n10.1038/nrc927\n10.1097/mco.0b013e328302f3fe\n10.1038/bjc.1997.433\n10.1002/mus.21893\n10.1097/00000658-200303000-00013\n10.3945/ajcn.113.063859\n10.1002/1097-0142(19861015)58:860;1954::aid-cncr282058142562;3.0.co;2-a\n10.1016/j.biocel.2005.03.010\n10.1152/ajpcell.00497.2008\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.05.143\n10.1016/j.biocel.2004.10.017\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6602402\n10.1128/mcb.10.5.2327\n10.1152/ajpendo.00039.2012\n10.1016/j.cmet.2007.11.004\n10.1016/j.redox.2015.06.019\n10.1016/j.biocel.2013.04.023\n10.1097/00075197-200205000-00002\n10.1080/01635580701365068\n10.1007/s00109-009-0547-z\n10.1002/hed.20662\n10.1038/bjc.1996.229\n10.1002/nur.20114\n10.1002/nur.20057\n10.1124/jpet.103.063099\n10.1007/s10059-011-1021-7\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2007.04.003\n10.1038/sj.mn.7800136\n10.1016/j.canlet.2004.12.005\n10.1007/s00394-007-0665-8\n10.1002/ijc.27494\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.05.063\n10.1002/jcsm.12017\n10.1152/physrev.00044.2005\n10.1042/CS20140542\n10.5009/gnl15543\n10.1007/s10147-016-0951-7\n10.1097/maj.0b013e318222e620\n10.1038/onc.2015.162\n10.1007/s13539-011-0037-3\n10.1152/ajpgi.00197.2005\n10.1046/j.1365-201x.1998.0303f.x\n10.2174/092986712803833290\n10.1093/jjco/hyf035\n10.1007/s13277-015-4303-4\n10.1016/j.febslet.2004.05.066\n10.1128/MCB.25.15.6533-6545.2005\n10.1113/expphysiol.2013.072496\n10.3892/ijmm.2010.557\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.03.004\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00503\n10.3892/ijo.2013.1998\n10.1152/ajpregu.00300.2010\n10.1097/mco.0000000000000164\n10.1016/S0891-5849(98)00213-5\n10.2337/diab.46.12.2088\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00408.x\n10.1096/fj.00-0463\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.10.047\n10.1038/nrc3803\n10.1038/nrc2522\n10.3748/wjg.v21.i20.6271\n10.1097/md.0000000000003708\n10.7150/thno.14882\n10.1038/nature15726\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aad3740\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.09.009\n10.1155/2016/6719534\n10.1093/jnci/djk211\n10.1001/archinte.164.21.2335\n10.2174/138161212803216889\n10.1016/j.dld.2014.01.160\n10.1200/jco.2005.05.514\n10.1309/lmzjju6bc86wudhw\n10.1080/07315724.2004.10719340\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.05.045\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3007653\n10.1007/s002800000205\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.12.001\n10.1007/s00109-003-0476-1\n10.3892/etm.2012.602\n10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-08-0167\n10.1093/carcin/bgr218\n10.1093/carcin/20.4.733\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.02.111\n10.3945/jn.113.188367\n10.1080/01635581.2011.563032\n10.1016/j.clnu.2006.12.001\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2002.tb00455.x\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.04.005\n10.1007/s00520-006-0072-3\n10.1046/j.1464-410x.2003.04181.x\n10.1016/j.lungcan.2005.01.004\n10.2105/AJPH.92.10.1606\n10.3322/canjclin.55.5.319\n10.1016/j.hoc.2008.04.012\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.02.001\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00164.2004\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.02.009\n10.1177/1534735409334266\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.10.058\n10.1200/jco.2009.23.2488\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2013.07.001\n10.1002/14651858.cd010804.pub2\n10.1249/01.mss.0000233797.24035.35\n10.1007/s13539-012-0067-5\n10.1038/srep26991\n10.1016/j.metabol.2016.01.014\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2013.10.012\n10.1063/1.368275\n10.1002/jcsm.12042\n10.1097/maj.0b013e318063c6e4\n10.1155/2016/6475624"}
{"title": "Primary Double-Strike Therapy for Cancers to Overcome EGFR Kinase Inhibitor Resistance: Proposal\u00a0from the Bench.", "abstract": "Diverse molecular mechanisms that confer acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in lung cancers with sensitive EGFR mutations have been reported. However, it is not realistic to analyze for all these mechanisms at the time of resistance in clinical practice and establish adequate treatment targeting these numerous resistance mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that we should move our research focus from the exploration of \"established\" diverse resistance mechanisms to the elucidation of molecular mechanisms that enable cancer cells to remain alive at the early phase of the treatment. Here in this review, we summarize up-to-date molecular mechanisms that maintain residual tumor cells against EGFR TKI monotherapy in lung cancers with EGFR mutations. We classified these mechanisms into three categories. The first is a preexisting minor subpopulation with a resistance mechanism such as a pretreatment T790M mutation that can be detected by highly sensitivity methods. The second is the reversible drug-tolerant state that is often observed in cell line models and accounts for the lack of complete response and continued survival of cells exposed to EGFR TKIs in patients. And the last is the role of the microenvironment, including survival signaling from fibroblasts or dying cancer cells and the role of poor vascularization. Primary double-strike cancer therapy, or even initial multiple-strike therapy, to cancer cells that cotarget EGFR and survival mechanism(s) simultaneously would be a promising strategy to improve the outcomes of patients with EGFR mutations.", "journal": "Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer", "date": "2016-09-20", "authors": ["KenichiSuda", "Paul ABunn", "Christopher JRivard", "TetsuyaMitsudomi", "Fred RHirsch"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtho.2016.09.003\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-1179\n10.18632/oncotarget.9662"}

{"title": "An Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptors 1 and 3 Axis Governs Cellular Senescence of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells and Promotes Growth and Vascularization of Multiple Myeloma.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells and there is much interest in how MSCs contribute to the regulation of the tumor microenvironment. Whether MSCs exert a supportive or suppressive effect on tumor progression is still controversial, but is likely dependent on a variety of factors that are tumor-type dependent. Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by growth of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. It has been shown that the progression of MM is governed by MSCs, which act as a stroma of the myeloma cells. Although stroma is created via mutual communication between myeloma cells and MSCs, the mechanism is poorly understood. Here we explored the role of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling in cellular events where MSCs were converted into either MM-supportive or MM-suppressive stroma. We found that myeloma cells stimulate MSCs to produce autotaxin, an indispensable enzyme for the biosynthesis of LPA, and LPA receptor 1 (LPA1) and 3 (LPA3) transduce opposite signals to MSCs to determine the fate of MSCs. LPA3-silenced MSCs (siLPA3-MSCs) exhibited cellular senescence-related phenotypes in vitro, and significantly promoted progression of MM and tumor-related angiogenesis in vivo. In contrast, siLPA1-MSCs showed resistance to cellular senescence in vitro, and efficiently delayed progression of MM and tumor-related angiogenesis in vivo. Consistently, anti-MM effects obtained by LPA1-silencing in MSCs were completely reproduced by systemic administration of Ki6425, an LPA1 antagonist. Collectively, our results indicate that LPA signaling determines the fate of MSCs and has potential as a therapeutic target in MM.

{"title": "Lack of adrenomedullin in mouse endothelial cells results in defective angiogenesis, enhanced vascular permeability, less metastasis, and more brain damage.", "abstract": "Adrenomedullin (AM) is a vasodilating peptide involved in the regulation of circulatory homeostasis and in the pathophysiology of certain cardiovascular diseases. AM plays critical roles in blood vessels, including regulation of vascular stability and permeability. To elucidate the autocrine/paracrine function of AM in endothelial cells (EC) in vivo, a conditional knockout of AM in EC (AM(EC-KO)) was used. The amount of vascularization of the matrigel implants was lower in AM(EC-KO) mice indicating a defective angiogenesis. Moreover, ablation of AM in EC revealed increased vascular permeability in comparison with wild type (WT) littermates. In addition, AM(EC-KO) lungs exhibited significantly less tumor growth than littermate WT mice using a syngeneic model of metastasis.

To study the effects of FOXF1 overexpression in lung development, we generated a Foxf1 overexpression mouse model by knocking-in a Cre-inducible Foxf1 allele into the ROSA26 (R26) locus. The mice were phenotyped using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), head-out plethysmography, ChIP-seq and transcriptome analyses, immunohistochemistry, and lung histopathology. Thirty-five percent of heterozygous R26-Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL)-Foxf1 embryonic day (E)15.5 embryos exhibit subcutaneous edema, hemorrhages and die perinatally when bred to Tie2-cre mice, which targets Foxf1 overexpression to endothelial and hematopoietic cells. Histopathological and micro-CT evaluations revealed that R26Foxf1; Tie2-cre embryos have immature lungs with a diminished vascular network. Neonates exhibited respiratory deficits verified by detailed plethysmography studies. ChIP-seq and transcriptome analyses in E18.5 lungs identified Sox11, Ghr, Ednrb, and Slit2 as potential downstream targets of FOXF1.

AMD was the most common diagnosis, with both nonvascularized PEDs (drusenoid and serous) and vascularized PEDs (type 1 and type 3 neovascularization) associated with drusen and a thin choroid. PCV patients had large, vascularized, peaked PEDs associated with polyps and a variable choroidal thickness, while CSC patients had a thick choroid and predominantly nonvascularized, serous PEDs with an overlying neurosensory detachment. The combined clinical and imaging characteristics form a profile for each PED subtype related to their underlying disease. However, atypical features noted in 11% of patients may complicate the underlying diagnosis.\nTypical phenotypic manifestations of PEDs and other features seen with multimodal imaging were associated with specific underlying etiologies.

Molecular subtypes of GBM have been identified that are related to clinical outcome and response to therapy. Although the mesenchymal type has been ascribed higher angiogenic activity, extensive characterization of the vascular component in GBM subtypes has not been performed. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the differential vascular status and angiogenic signaling levels in molecular subtypes. GBM tissue samples representing proneural IDH1 mutant, classical-like and mesenchymal-like subtypes were analyzed by morphometry for the number of vessels, vessel size and vessel maturity. Also the expression levels of factors from multiple angiogenic signaling pathways were determined. We found that necrotic and hypoxic areas were relatively larger in mesenchymal-like tumors and these tumors also had larger vessels. However, the number of vessels, basement membrane deposition and pericyte coverage did not vary between the subtypes. Regarding signaling patterns the majority of factors were expressed at similar levels in the subtypes, and only ANGPT2, MMP2, TIMP1, VEGFA and MMP9/TIMP2 were higher expressed in GBMs of the classical-like subtype. In conclusion, although morphological differences were observed between the subtypes, the angiogenic signaling status of GBM subtypes seemed to be rather similar.

Results showed that, in the hybrid construct, the cell population in the collagen component dropped by day 7 but then increased by day 14.

Also, the thinner struts resulted in formation of long linear cellular cords structures within the pores. Finite element simulation demonstrated principal stress patterns similar to the observed cell-network pattern.

The signals that instruct hepatocytes to induce timely VEGF remain unidentified.

In this study, we describe a novel technique using a well-vascularized flap of the inner and outer preputial skin.\nA total of 110 male children with hypospadias underwent repair by our technique between 2008 and 2015. The inclusion criteria were children with mid-penile or slightly more proximal hypospadias, with or without ventral chordae, and an intact prepuce of the cobra eyes variety. Recurrent cases, patients with other preputial types, and circumcised children were excluded from this study. The prepared flap was sutured in its natural longitudinal orientation to the created urethral plate strip to form a neo-urethra over a urethral catheter. Outcome measures included surgical success without the formation of a urethra-cutaneous fistula, no ischaemia of the flaps, glans dehiscence or infection and functional outcome and cosmetic appearance.\nThe median follow-up duration was 3.3\u00a0years. There were 63 cases of mid-penile hypospadias (57.3\u00a0%), and in 47 cases (42.7\u00a0%), the meatus was slightly more proximal. The age of the patients ranged from 1.1 to 8.0\u00a0years, with a mean age of 4.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0years. Surgery was successful in 106 (96.4\u00a0%) cases. Minor complications occurred in 11 patients (10\u00a0%) and included oedema of glans in ten patients and bluish discoloration on the ventral aspect of the glans close to the suture line in three patients. All patients improved within 2\u00a0weeks after surgery. Long-term follow-up revealed a properly functioning urethra with a forward, projectile, single, compact, and rifled urinary stream of adequate calibre and cosmetically acceptable repair. No cases of meatal retraction, meatal stenosis, urethral stricture, or acquired urethral diverticulum occurred.\nOur technique is different from the split prepuce in situ technique. We create a narrow strip of the urethral plate that facilitates glanular closure, and we use the inner and adjacent outer skin in a vertical manner to preserve excess skin for penile coverage. Prepuce is split at midline to preserve more preputial skin with favourable dartos tissue for penile skin coverage. The glans is closed using a stitch-by-stitch method that has not been described previously.\nThis study presents a novel technique for mid-penile hypospadias repair using a preputial skin flap with excellent results in terms of short- and long-term outcomes.", "journal": "International urology and nephrology", "date": "2016-09-15", "authors": ["HazemElmoghazy", "Mohamed MHussein", "ElnisrMohamed", "AbdelbassetBadawy", "GamalAlsagheer", "Ahmed MamdouhAbd Elhamed"], "doi": "10.1007/s11255-016-1416-7"}
{"title": "Predicting the Influence of Microvascular Structure On Tumor Response to Radiotherapy.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate how theoretical predictions of tumor response to radiotherapy (RT) depend on the morphology and spatial representation of the microvascular network.\nA hybrid multiscale model, which couples a cellular automaton model of tumor growth with a model for oxygen transport from blood vessels, is used to predict the viable fraction of cells following one week of simulated RT. Both artificial and biologically derived three-dimensional (3-D) vessel networks of well vascularized tumors are considered and predictions compared with 2-D descriptions.\nFor literature-derived values of the cellular oxygen consumption rate there is little difference in predicted viable fraction when 3-D network representations of biological or artificial vessel networks are employed. Different 2-D representations are shown to either over- or under-estimate viable fractions relative to the 3-D cases, with predictions based on point-wise descriptions shown to have greater sensitivity to vessel network morphology.\nThe predicted RT response is relatively insensitive to the morphology of the microvessel network when 3-D representations are adopted, however, sensitivity is greater in certain 2-D representations.\nBy using realistic 3-D vessel network geometries this study shows that real and artificial network descriptions and assumptions of spatially uniform oxygen distributions lead to similar RT response predictions in relatively small tissue volumes. This suggests that either a more detailed description of oxygen transport in the microvasculature is required or that the oxygen enhancement ratio used in the well known linear-quadratic RT response model is relatively insensitive to microvascular structure.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2016-09-14", "authors": ["James AGrogan", "BostjanMarkelc", "Anthony JConnor", "Ruth JMuschel", "Joe MPitt-Francis", "Philip KMaini", "Helen MByrne"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2016.2606563"}

{"title": "Multiple Delayed Scalp Reconstruction for Complicated Cranial Defects.", "abstract": "In cases of skull trauma, emergency surgery for cranial decompression typically involves the shortest approach, with the incision lying directly on or immediately near the bony defect. Subsequent reconstructive plastic surgery for the skull is difficult in such cases because incisions taken on the previous scar overlying the bony defect are prone to dehiscence and infection. Herein, we describe a technique for creating a well-vascularized delayed skin flap via multistaged operation before the actual skull reconstruction. Four patients (age range, 10-25 y) were prepared for skull reconstruction using this technique. Flap elevation was performed in 3 stages, with adequate time intervals (4 wk between each stage) to allow for adequate delay. Dissection under the galea aponeurotica was performed only after initial flap elevation allowing for adequate vascularization. Skull reconstruction was then performed using custom-made implants. The patients were followed up for 6 to 12 months. No complications, including infections, exposure of the artificial bone, or flap necrosis, were observed. All the patients were satisfied with the cosmetic results. Despite the multiple stages required, we consider that our technique of using a delayed, well-vascularized bipedicled skin flap can be successfully used in the skull reconstruction of patients in whom the initial scar lies close to the bone defect. We recommend scalp incision be shifted outside of the foreseen bony flap to limit infectious risks during primary or subsequent cranial reconstruction.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

{"title": "Warburg metabolism in tumor-conditioned macrophages promotes metastasis in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.", "abstract": "Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) face a clinically intractable disease with poor survival rates, attributed to exceptionally high levels of metastasis. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is pronounced at inflammatory foci within the tumor; however, the immunological mechanisms promoting tumor dissemination remain unclear. It is well established that tumors exhibit the Warburg effect, a preferential use of glycolysis for energy production, even in the presence of oxygen, to support rapid growth. We hypothesized that the metabolic pathways utilized by tumor-infiltrating macrophages are altered in PDAC, conferring a pro-metastatic phenotype. We generated tumor-conditioned macrophages in vitro, in which human peripheral blood monocytes were cultured with conditioned media generated from normal pancreatic or PDAC cell lines to obtain steady-state and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), respectively. Compared with steady-state macrophages, TAMs promoted vascular network formation, augmented extravasation of tumor cells out of blood vessels, and induced higher levels of EMT. TAMs exhibited a pronounced glycolytic signature in a metabolic flux assay, corresponding with elevated glycolytic gene transcript levels. Inhibiting glycolysis in TAMs with a competitive inhibitor to Hexokinase II (HK2), 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), was sufficient to disrupt this pro-metastatic phenotype, reversing the observed increases in TAM-supported angiogenesis, extravasation, and EMT. Our results indicate a key role for metabolic reprogramming of tumor-infiltrating macrophages in PDAC metastasis, and highlight the therapeutic potential of using pharmacologics to modulate these metabolic pathways.", "journal": "Oncoimmunology", "date": "2016-09-14", "authors": ["Hweixian LeongPenny", "Je LinSieow", "GiuliaAdriani", "Wei HseunYeap", "PeterSee Chi Ee", "BorisSan Luis", "BernettLee", "TerenceLee", "Shi YaMak", "Ying SwanHo", "Kong PengLam", "Choon KiatOng", "Ruby Y JHuang", "FlorentGinhoux", "OlafRotzschke", "Roger DKamm", "Siew ChengWong"], "doi": "10.1080/2162402X.2016.1191731\n10.1038/nrc949\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.025\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.014\n10.1371/journal.pone.0006562\n10.1084/jem.20141836\n10.1073/pnas.0914433107\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.04.023\n10.4049/jimmunol.1402469\n10.1016/j.cmet.2014.12.005\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.115.305551\n10.1074/jbc.M110.190298\n10.1016/j.ccr.2011.03.009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050582\n10.1039/c3ib40082d\n10.1039/c2ib20209c\n10.18632/oncotarget.5464\n10.18632/oncotarget.4716\n10.1073/pnas.1210182109\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.11.050\n10.1039/c3ib40149a\n10.1038/nm.3394\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.11.007\n10.3858/emm.2010.42.11.079\n10.1016/j.ccr.2012.02.014\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1016/j.immuni.2013.04.005\n10.1038/nature07205\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.008\n10.1038/ni.1937\n10.1002/ijc.28736\n10.1074/jbc.M113.522037\n10.1038/nature11986\n10.1210/edrv.18.1.0287\n10.4161/cc.21384\n10.1182/blood-2009-10-249540\n10.1016/j.molcel.2013.12.019\n10.1016/j.cmet.2011.11.013\n10.1016/j.immuni.2015.02.005\n10.1038/ni.2833\n10.1016/j.immuni.2015.09.001\n10.1038/nature12040\n10.1038/nature11862\n10.4049/jimmunol.1301490\n10.1371/journal.pone.0141392\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.08.016\n10.1038/nrd3504\n10.1038/nprot.2012.051\n10.1002/bit.24445\n10.1021/ac051437y\n10.1038/cddis.2014.38"}

{"title": "Angiopoetin-2 Signals Do Not Mediate the Hypervascularization of Islets in Type 2 Diabetes.", "abstract": "Changes in the islet vasculature have been implicated in the regulation of \u03b2-cell survival and function during the progression to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Failure of the \u03b2-cell to compensate for the increased insulin demand in obesity eventually leads to diabetes; as a result of the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors (e.g. ongoing inflammation within the islets) and impaired vascular function. The Angiopoietin/Tie (Ang/Tie) angiogenic system maintains vasculature and is closely related to organ inflammation and angiogenesis. In this study we aimed to identify whether the vessel area within the islets changes in diabetes and whether such changes would be triggered by the Tie-antagonist Ang-2.\nImmunohistochemical and qPCR analyses to follow islet vascularization and Ang/Tie levels were performed in human pancreatic autopsies and isolated human and mouse islets. The effect of Ang-2 was assessed in \u03b2-cell-specific Ang-2 overexpressing mice during high fat diet (HFD) feeding.\nIslet vessel area was increased in autopsy pancreases from patients with T2D. The vessel markers Tie-1, Tie-2 and CD31 were upregulated in mouse islets upon HFD feeding from 8 to 24 weeks. Ang-2 was transiently upregulated in mouse islets at 8 weeks of HFD and under glucolipotoxic conditions (22.2 mM glucose/ 0.5 mM palmitate) in vitro in human and mouse islets, in contrast to its downregulation by cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u0263 and TNF-\u03b1). Ang-1 on the other hand was oppositely regulated, with a significant loss under glucolipotoxic condition, a trend to reduce in islets from patients with T2D and an upregulation by cytokines. Modulation of such changes in Ang-2 by its overexpression or the inhibition of its receptor Tie-2 impaired \u03b2-cell function at basal conditions but protected islets from cytokine induced apoptosis. In vivo, \u03b2-cell-specific Ang-2 overexpression in mice induced hypervascularization under normal diet but contrastingly led to hypovascularized islets in response to HFD together with increased apoptosis and reduced \u03b2-cell mass.\nIslet hypervascularization occurs in T2D.

{"title": "Inhibition of VEGF mediated corneal neovascularization by anti-angiogenic peptide nanofibers.", "abstract": "Atypical angiogenesis is one of the major symptoms of severe eye diseases, including corneal neovascularization, and the complex nature of abnormal vascularization requires targeted methods with high biocompatibility. The targeting of VEGF is the most common approach for preventing angiogenesis, and the LPPR peptide sequence is known to strongly inhibit VEGF activity by binding to the VEGF receptor neuropilin-1. Here, the LPPR epitope is presented on a peptide amphiphile nanofiber system to benefit from multivalency and increase the anti-angiogenic function of the epitope. Peptide amphiphile nanofibers are especially useful for ocular delivery applications due to their ability to remain on the site of interest for extended periods of time, facilitating the long-term presentation of bioactive sequences. Consequently, the LPPR sequence was integrated into a self-assembled peptide amphiphile network to increase its efficiency in the prevention of neovascularization. Anti-angiogenic effects of the peptide nanofibers were investigated by using both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo models. LPPR-PA nanofibers inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and migration to a greater extent than the soluble LPPR peptide in\u00a0vitro. In addition, the LPPR-PA nanofiber system led to the prevention of vascular maturation and the regression of angiogenesis in a suture-induced corneal angiogenesis model.

These two Ca-Mg-silicates can be coated onto the pore strut, and the coating layers were observed to slowly dissolve in Tris buffer. The vascularization-favorable Cu ions, which had been doped into the bredigite or akermanite coating, could also be measured in the immersion medium. A primary angiogenic test in a panniculus carnosus muscle model in rabbit indicated that the Cu-doped bredigite and akermanite coatings were significantly beneficial for the neovascularization in the early stages.

Mice with xenograft tumors grown from HCC cells were given a monoclonal antibody against IGF1 and IGF2 (xentuzumab), along with sorafenib; tumor growth was measured and tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblots.\nLevels of IGF2 messenger RNA and protein were increased >20-fold in 15% of human HCC tissues compared with non-tumor liver tissues. Methylation at the fetal promoters of IGF2 was reduced in the HCC samples and cell lines that overexpressed IGF2, compared with those that did not overexpress this gene, and non-tumor tissues. Tumors that overexpressed IGF2 had gene expression patterns significantly associated with hepatic progenitor cell features, stellate cell activation, NOTCH signaling, and an aggressive phenotype (P < .0001). In mice engineered to express Myc and Akt1 in liver, co-expression of Igf2 accelerated formation of liver tumors, compared to mice with livers expressing only Myc and Akt1, and shortened survival times (P\u00a0= .02). The antibody xentuzumab blocked phosphorylation of IGF1 receptor in HCC cell lines and reduced their proliferation and colony formation. In mice with xenograft tumors, injection of xentuzumab, with or without sorafenib, slowed tumor growth and increased survival times compared to vehicle or sorafenib alone. Xentuzumab inhibited phosphorylation of IGF1 receptor and AKT and reduced decreased tumor vascularization compared with vehicle.\nA large proportion of HCC samples were found to overexpress IGF2, via demethylation of its fetal promoter. Overexpression of IGF2 accelerates formation of liver tumors in mice with hepatic expression of MYC and AKT1, via activation of IGF1 receptor signaling.

{"title": "Assessing neuronal density in peri-infarct cortex with PET: Effects of cortical topology and partial volume correction.", "abstract": "The peri-infarct cortex (PIC) is the site of long-term physiologic changes after ischemic stroke. Traditional methods for delineating the peri-infarct gray matter (GM) have used a volumetric Euclidean distance metric to define its extent around the infarct. This metric has limitations in the case of cortical stroke, i.e., those where ischemia leads to infarction in the cortical GM, because the vascularization of the cerebral cortex follows the complex, folded topology of the cortical surface. Instead, we used a geodesic distance metric along the cortical surface to subdivide the PIC into equidistant rings emanating from the infarct border and compared this new approach to a Euclidean distance metric definition. This was done in 11 patients with [F-18]-Flumazenil ([18-F]-FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) scans at 2 weeks post-stroke and at 6 month follow-up. FMZ is a PET radiotracer with specific binding to the alpha subunits of the type A \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor. Additionally, we used partial-volume correction (PVC) of the PET images to compensate for potential cortical thinning and long-term neuronal loss in follow-up images.

The ability of membrane for adhesion, growth, and proliferation of fibroblast cells was improved via surface modification with gelatin. The optimized dressing exhibited appropriate tensile strength (4.5MPa) and elongation at break (80%) to protect wound against physical forces. Due to controlled equilibrium water absorption of about 89% and water vapor transmission rate of 2040g/m(2)day, the dressing could maintain the favorable moist environment over moderate to high exuding wounds.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) increase the survival of fat grafts, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, TLR4(-/-) and Nrf2(-/-) mice were used to explore the effects of oxidative stress and inflammation on the viability and function of ADSCs in vitro and in vivo. Enrichment of fat grafts with ADSCs inhibited inflammatory cytokine production, enhanced growth factor levels, increased fat graft survival, downregulated NADPH oxidase (NOX)1 and 4 expression, increased vascularization and reduced ROS production in a manner dependent on toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that exposure to hypoxia enhanced ADSC growth and promoted the differentiation of ADSCs into vascular endothelial cells. Hypoxia-induced inflammatory cytokine, growth factor and NOX1/4 upregulation, as well as increased ROS production and apoptosis in ADSCs were dependent on TLR4 and Nrf2, which also modulated the effect of ADSCs on promoting endothelial progenitor cell migration and angiogenesis. Western blot analyses showed that the effects of hypoxia on ADSCs were regulated by crosstalk between Nrf2 antioxidant responses and NF-\u03baB- and TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses. Taken together, our results indicate that ADSCs can increase the survival of fat transplants through the modulation of inflammatory and oxidative responses via Nrf2 and TLR4, suggesting potential strategies to improve the use of ADSCs for cell therapy.", "journal": "Cell death & disease", "date": "2016-09-09", "authors": ["XiaosongChen", "LiuYan", "ZhihuiGuo", "ZhaohongChen", "YingChen", "MingLi", "ChushanHuang", "XiaopingZhang", "LiangwanChen"], "doi": "10.1038/cddis.2016.261"}
{"title": "A Versatile Method for Fabricating Tissue Engineering Scaffolds with a Three-Dimensional Channel for Prevasculature Networks.", "abstract": "Despite considerable advances in tissue engineering over the past two decades, solutions to some crucial problems remain elusive. Vascularization is one of the most important factors that greatly influence the function of scaffolds. Many research studies have focused on the construction of a vascular-like network with prevascularization structure. Sacrificial materials are widely used to build perfusable vascular-like architectures, but most of these fabricated scaffolds only have a 2D plane-connected network. The fabrication of three-dimensional perfusable branched networks remains an urgent issue. In this work, we developed a novel sacrificial molding technique for fabricating biocompatible scaffolds with a three-dimensional perfusable branched network. Here, 3D-printed poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) filament was used as the sacrificial material. The fused PVA was deposited on the surface of a cylinder to create the 3D branched solid network. Gelatin was used to embed the solid network. Then, the PVA mold was dissolved after curing the hydrogel. The obtained architecture shows good perfusability. Cell experiment results indicated that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) successfully attached to the surface of the branched channel and maintained high viability after a few days in culture. In order to prevent deformation of the channel, paraffin was coated on the surface of the printed structure, and hydroxyapatite (HA) was added to gelatin. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel strategy toward the engineering of prevasculature thick tissues through the integration of the fused PVA filament deposit. This approach has great potential in solving the issue of three-dimensional perfusable branched networks and opens the way to clinical applications.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-09-09", "authors": ["ShuaiLi", "Yuan-YuanLiu", "Li-JunLiu", "Qing-XiHu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b07725"}
{"title": "Small molecule-driven direct conversion of human pluripotent stem cells into functional osteoblasts.", "abstract": "The abilities of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to proliferate without phenotypic alteration and to differentiate into tissue-specific progeny make them a promising cell source for regenerative medicine and development of physiologically relevant in vitro platforms. Despite this potential, efficient conversion of hPSCs into tissue-specific cells still remains a challenge. Herein, we report direct conversion of hPSCs into functional osteoblasts through the use of adenosine, a naturally occurring nucleoside in the human body. The hPSCs treated with adenosine not only expressed the molecular signatures of osteoblasts but also produced calcified bone matrix. Our findings show that the adenosine-mediated osteogenesis of hPSCs involved the adenosine A2bR. When implanted in vivo, using macroporous synthetic matrices, the human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived donor cells participated in the repair of critical-sized bone defects through the formation of neobone tissue without teratoma formation. The newly formed bone tissues exhibited various attributes of the native tissue, including vascularization and bone resorption. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adenosine-induced differentiation of hPSCs into functional osteoblasts and their subsequent use to regenerate bone tissues in vivo. This approach that uses a physiologically relevant single small molecule to generate hPSC-derived progenitor cells is highly appealing because of its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and impact in cell manufacturing, all of which are decisive factors for successful translational applications of hPSCs.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2016-09-08", "authors": ["HeeminKang", "Yu-Ru VShih", "ManandoNakasaki", "HarshaKabra", "ShyniVarghese"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.1600691"}
{"title": "Temporal dynamics of the developing lung transcriptome in three common inbred strains of laboratory mice reveals multiple stages of postnatal alveolar development.", "abstract": "To characterize temporal patterns of transcriptional activity during normal lung development, we generated genome wide gene expression data for 26 pre- and post-natal time points in three common inbred strains of laboratory mice (C57BL/6J, A/J, and C3H/HeJ). Using Principal Component Analysis and least squares regression modeling, we identified both strain-independent and strain-dependent patterns of gene expression. The 4,683 genes contributing to the strain-independent expression patterns were used to define a murine Developing Lung Characteristic Subtranscriptome (mDLCS). Regression modeling of the Principal Components supported the four canonical stages of mammalian embryonic lung development (embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular) defined previously by morphology and histology. For postnatal alveolar development, the regression model was consistent with four stages of alveolarization characterized by episodic transcriptional activity of genes related to pulmonary vascularization. Genes expressed in a strain-dependent manner were enriched for annotations related to neurogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, and Wnt signaling. Finally, a comparison of mouse and human transcriptomics from pre-natal stages of lung development revealed conservation of pathways associated with cell cycle, axon guidance, immune function, and metabolism as well as organism-specific expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix organization and protein modification. The mouse lung development transcriptome data generated for this study serves as a unique reference set to identify genes and pathways essential for normal mammalian lung development and for investigations into the developmental origins of respiratory disease and cancer.

As the skin paddle of the sural neurofasciocutaneous flap and the vascularized peroneus longus tendon graft were linked by the perforator and minimal fascial tissue, the skin paddle was able to rotate and slide with comparative ease. The flap survived completely without any complications. The length of follow-up was 12 months and was uneventful. Range of motion of his left wrist joint was slightly limited to 75 degrees. This novel composite flap may be useful for reconstructing long tendon defects associated with extensive forearm soft tissue defects.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2016-09-07", "authors": ["KenjiHayashida", "HirotoSaijo", "MasakiFujioka"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.30104"}
{"title": "EXPRESS: BDNF Signaling Contributes to Oral Cancer Pain in a Preclinical Orthotopic Rodent Model.", "abstract": "The majority of patients with oral cancer report intense pain that is only partially managed by current analgesics. Thus, there is a strong need to study mechanisms as well as develop novel analgesics for oral cancer pain. Current study employed an orthotopic tongue cancer model with molecular and non-reflexive behavioral assays to determine possible mechanisms of oral cancer pain. Human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells line, HSC2, was injected into the tongue of male athymic mice and tumor growth was observed by day 6. Immunohistological analyses revealed a well-differentiated tumor with a localized immune response and pronounced sensory and sympathetic innervation and vascularization. The tumor expressed TMPRSS2, a protein previously reported with oral squamous cell carcinoma. ATF3 expression in trigeminal ganglia was not altered by tumor growth. Molecular characterization of the model demonstrated altered expression of several pain-related genes, out of which up-regulation of BDNF was most striking. Moreover, BDNF protein expression in trigeminal ganglia neurons was increased and inhibition of BDNF signaling with a tyrosine kinase B antagonist, ANA-12, reversed pain-like behaviors induced by the oral tumor. Oral squamous cell carcinoma tumor growth was also associated with a reduction in feeding, mechanical hypersensitivity in the face, as well as spontaneous pain behaviors as measured by the conditioned place preference test, all of which were reversed by analgesics. Interestingly, injection of HSC2 into the hindpaw did not reproduce this spectrum of pain behaviors; nor did injection of a colonic cancer cell line into the tongue. Taken together, this orthotopic oral cancer pain model reproduces the spectrum of pain reported by oral cancer patients, including higher order cognitive changes, and demonstrates that BDNF signaling constitutes a novel mechanism by which oral squamous cell carcinoma induces pain. Identification of the key role of tyrosine kinase B signaling in oral cancer pain may serve as a novel target for drug development.", "journal": "Molecular pain", "date": "2016-09-04", "authors": ["LeahChodroff", "MicheleBendele", "VanessaValenzuela", "MichaelHenry", "ShivaniRuparel"], "doi": "10.1177/1744806916666841"}
{"title": "Confocal raman microspectral imaging of ex vivo human spinal cord tissue.", "abstract": "Confocal Raman microspectral imaging (CRMI) provides a versatile tool to illustrate the biochemical nature and structure of biological tissue without introducing any external labels. In this work, a precise correlation was established between the biochemical profile and histological architecture of ex vivo human spinal cord tissue by using CRMI with 633nm excitation. After precisely linking the spectral features to the chemical constituents, much information about the molecular composition of both gray and white matter were revealed. Two-dimensional Raman images were generated by integrating the intensities of the characteristic Raman bands in the area of the intermediate column and ventral horn. K-mean cluster analysis was further applied to visualize the underlying morphological basis of spinal cord tissue by chemical component types and their distribution pattern. Lipid-rich white matter could be visually distinguished from gray matter considering a CH2 bending/scissoring band at 1445cm(-1) and an amide III band at 1250cm(-1). Meanwhile, the formation and distribution pattern of perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the scanning area was validated by the integration of saccharides (617cm(-1)) and amide III bands. Moreover, the heme profile indicated a higher degree of vascularization in gray matter. All of the results obtained testified to the possibility that gray matter could be more susceptible to spinal cord injury (SCI) because of capillary network distribution and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) aggregation. These findings are important for interpreting the morphological specificity of human spinal cord tissue, and also for studying the molecular basis of SCI.", "journal": "Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

However, distinct differences arise in brain tissue during the later stages of inflammation, repair, and remodeling, and closely parallel the changes of Alzheimer's disease. Our hypothesis -- Alzheimer's disease is brain wound healing gone awry at least in some cases -- could be tested by measuring progression with biomarkers for the four stages of wound healing in humans or appropriate animal models.

Neither blood vessels nor their accompanying astrocytes enter the fovea during any stage of retinal development; a balance of angiogenic and angiostatic factors probably maintains foveal avascularity throughout life. The aim of this study was to identify potentially angiorepulsive factors involved in the development of the avascular primate retinal fovea.\nRetinas of newborn, juvenile, and adult Callithrix jacchus and Macaca fascicularis monkeys and control human retinas were studied to determine the localization of angiostatin relative to III \u03b2-tubulin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM), and the angiostatin receptor \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin in the foveal, macular, and peripheral retina. Expression studies were performed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on retinal whole-mount and paraffin sections, and Western blotting on frozen material. The complex network of the main retinal cell types was identified by IHC of retinal whole mounts.\nIn general, lifetime expression of angiostatin was found in all retinas. Colabeling with different markers revealed retinal ganglion cells as the main source of angiostatin expression in the primate retina, whereas PECAM-immunopositive blood capillaries expressed the angiostatin receptor \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin, and capillary-associated astrocytes expressed VEGF.\nThis study provides the first evidence of angiostatin expression in the primate retina; the expression of angiostatin in the avascular foveal region and the peripheral retina suggests that angiostatin may play a role in the regulation of retinal vascularization, providing a possible explanation for the development and persistence of an avascular fovea.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2016-09-02", "authors": ["Michael R.

{"title": "Quantitative Analysis of Human Cancer Cell Extravasation Using Intravital Imaging.", "abstract": "Metastasis, or the spread of cancer cells from a primary tumor to distant sites, is the leading cause of cancer-associated death. Metastasis is a complex multi-step process comprised of invasion, intravasation, survival in circulation, extravasation, and formation of metastatic colonies. Currently, in vitro assays are limited in their ability to investigate these intricate processes and do not faithfully reflect metastasis as it occurs in vivo. Traditional in vivo models of metastasis are limited by their ability to visualize the seemingly sporadic behavior of where and when cancer cells spread (Reymond et al., Nat Rev Cancer 13:858-870, 2013). The avian embryo model of metastasis is a powerful platform to study many of the critical steps in the metastatic cascade including the migration, extravasation, and invasion of human cancer cells in vivo (Sung et al., Nat Commun 6:7164, 2015; Leong et al., Cell Rep 8, 1558-1570, 2014; Kain et al., Dev Dyn 243:216-28, 2014; Leong et al., Nat Protoc 5:1406-17, 2010; Zijlstra et al., Cancer Cell 13:221-234, 2008; Palmer et al., J Vis Exp 51:2815, 2011). The chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is a readily accessible and well-vascularized tissue that surrounds the developing embryo. When the chicken embryo is grown in a shell-less, ex ovo environment, the nearly transparent CAM provides an ideal environment for high-resolution fluorescent microcopy approaches. In this model, the embryonic chicken vasculature and labeled cancer cells can be visualized simultaneously to investigate specific steps in the metastatic cascade including extravasation. When combined with the proper image analysis tools, the ex ovo chicken embryo model offers a cost-effective and high-throughput platform for the quantitative analysis of tumor cell metastasis in a physiologically relevant in vivo setting.

The result is a biochemical adaptive response to the application of the orthodontic force with the reorganization of the intracellular and the extracellular matrix, in addition to a change of the local vascularization. This in turn leads to the synthesis and the release of arachidonic acid, growth factors, metabolites, cytokines and various enzymes. Biologically, not only the intensity of the force, but also its duration and the tissue response to the application of the same are important for tooth movement. Having these insights it will possible to examine the concept of optimal orthodontic force, a determining factor for the success of orthodontic treatment. The purpose of this revision was to describe the biological processes and future perspective of the application of orthodontic force, by providing relevant information to understand the changes at the molecular and cellular level occurring when the tissues are subjected to such forces.

Total effective blood flow to the human peritoneum is estimated between 60 and 100 mL/min, representing 1-2\u2006% of the cardiac outflow. The parietal peritoneum accounts for about 30\u2006% of the peritoneal surface (anterior abdominal wall 4\u2006%) and is vascularized from the circumflex, iliac, lumbar, intercostal, and epigastric arteries, giving rise to a quadrangular network of large, parallel blood vessels and their perpendicular offshoots. Parietal vessels drain into the inferior vena cava. The visceral peritoneum accounts for 70\u2006% of the peritoneal surface and derives its blood supply from the three major arteries that supply the splanchnic organs, celiac and superior and inferior mesenteric. These vessels give rise to smaller arteries that anastomose extensively. The visceral peritoneum drains into the portal vein. Drugs absorbed are subject to first-pass hepatic metabolism. Peritoneal inflammation and cancer invasion induce neoangiogenesis, leading to the development of an important microvascular network. Anatomy of neovessels is abnormal and characterized by large size, varying diameter, convolution and blood extravasation. Neovessels have a defective ultrastructure: formation of large \"mother vessels\" requires degradation of venular and capillary basement membranes. Mother vessels give birth to numerous \"daughter vessels\". Diffuse neoangiogenesis can be observed before appearance of macroscopic peritoneal metastasis.

Although NIR fluorescence imaging has been described in pituitary surgery, it has, in contrast to other surgical areas, never become widely used.\nTo evaluate NIR fluorescence imaging in pituitary surgery, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and to assess the additional value of resecting adenoma tissue under NIR fluorescence guidance.\nWe included 10 patients planned to undergo transnasal transsphenoidal selective adenomectomy. Patients received multiple intravenous administrations of 5 mg ICG, up to a maximum of 15 mg per patient. Endoscopic NIR fluorescence imaging was performed at multiple points in time. The NIR fluorescent signal in both the adenoma and pituitary gland was obtained, and the fluorescence contrast ratio was assessed.\nFour patients had Cushing disease, 1 had acromegaly, and 1 had a prolactinoma. Four patients had a nonfunctioning macroadenoma. In 9 of 10 patients with a histologically proven pituitary adenoma, the normal pituitary gland showed a stronger fluorescent signal than the adenoma. A fluorescence contrast ratio of normal pituitary gland to adenoma of 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 was obtained. In 2 patients; adenoma resection was actually performed under NIR fluorescence guidance instead of under white light.\nNIR fluorescence imaging can easily and safely be implemented in pituitary surgery.

Only pregnancies with an entirely visualized anterior placenta were included in the study. Data acquisition was performed before, during (at the peak of contraction), and after uterine contraction. 3D power Doppler indices such as the vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI) were calculated in each placenta.\nThere were no abnormal fetal heart rate tracings during contraction in either group. VI and VFI values were significantly reduced during uterine contraction in both groups (SLG, -33.4% [-97.0-15.2%], and ILG, -49.6% [-78.2--4.0%]), respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The FI value in the ILG group was significantly lower during uterine contraction (P\u00a0=\u00a00.035), whereas it did not change during uterine contraction in the SLG group. After uterine contraction, all vascular indices returned almost to the same level as that before uterine contraction. However, the FI value in ILG (-8.6%, [-19.7-16.0%]) was significantly lower than that in SLG (2.4%, [-13.4-38.1%]) after uterine contraction (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). All 3D power Doppler indices (VI, FI, and VFI) during uterine contraction (at the peak of contraction) showed a correlation greater than 0.7, with good intra- and inter-observer agreements.\nOur findings suggest that uterine contraction in both spontaneous and induced labors causes a significant reduction in placental perfusion. Reduced placental blood flow in induced uterine contraction has a tendency to be marked compared with that in spontaneous uterine contraction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the non-invasive assessment of placental perfusion during uterine contraction in labor using 3D power Doppler ultrasound. However, the data and their interpretation in the present study should be taken with some degree of caution because of the small number of subjects studied.

{"title": "Building the drains: the lymphatic vasculature in health and disease.", "abstract": "The lymphatic vasculature is comprised of a network of endothelial vessels found in close proximity to but separated from the blood vasculature. An essential tissue component of all vertebrates, lymphatics are responsible for the maintenance of fluid homeostasis, dissemination of immune cells, and lipid reabsorption under healthy conditions. When lymphatic vessels are impaired due to invasive surgery, genetic disorders, or parasitic infections, severe fluid build-up accumulates in the affected tissues causing a condition known as lymphedema. Malignant tumors can also directly activate lymphangiogenesis and use these vessels to promote the spread of metastatic cells. Although their first description goes back to the times of Hippocrates, with subsequent anatomical characterization at the beginning of the 20th-century, the lack of identifying molecular markers and tools to visualize these translucent vessels meant that investigation of lymphatic vessels fell well behind research of blood vessels. However, after years under the shadow of the blood vasculature, recent advances in imaging technologies and new genetic and molecular tools have accelerated the pace of research on lymphatic vessel development. These new tools have facilitated both work in classical mammalian models and the emergence of new powerful vertebrate models like zebrafish, quickly driving the field of lymphatic development back into the spotlight. In this review, we summarize the highlights of recent research on the development and function of the lymphatic vascular network in health and disease.

However, GFs are typically delivered in soluble format at supraphysiological doses because of rapid clearance and limited therapeutic impact. These high doses have serious side effects and are expensive. Although it is well established that GF interactions with extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin control GF presentation and activity, a translation-ready approach to unlocking GF potential has not been realized. We demonstrate a simple, robust, and controlled material-based approach to enhance the activity of GFs during tissue healing. The underlying mechanism is based on spontaneous fibrillar organization of fibronectin driven by adsorption onto the polymer poly(ethyl acrylate). Fibrillar fibronectin on this polymer, but not a globular conformation obtained on control polymers, promotes synergistic presentation of integrin-binding sites and bound bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), which enhances mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis in vitro and drives full regeneration of a nonhealing bone defect in vivo at low GF concentrations.

Magnetic targeting has shown to further enhance tumor accumulation in response to a magnetic field gradient. It is widely known that passive accumulation of nanocarriers varies hugely in tumor tissues of different tumor vascularization. It is hypothesized that magnetic targeting is likely to be influenced by such factors. In this work, magnetic targeting is assessed in a range of subcutaneously implanted murine tumors, namely, colon (CT26), breast (4T1), lung (Lewis lung carcinoma) cancer and melanoma (B16F10). Passively- and magnetically-driven tumor accumulation of the radiolabeled polymeric magnetic nanocapsules are assessed with gamma counting. The influence of tumor vasculature, namely, the tumor microvessel density, permeability and diameter on passive and magnetic tumor targeting is assessed with the aid of the retrospective design of experiment (DoE) approach. It is clear that the three tumor vascular parameters contribute greatly to both passive and magnetically targeted tumor accumulation but play different roles when nanocarriers are targeted to the tumor with different strategies.

{"title": "Maternal vitamin A deficiency during pregnancy affects vascularized islet development.", "abstract": "Vitamin A deficiency is known to affect 20 million pregnant women worldwide. However, the prenatal effects of maternal vitamin A deficiency on pancreas development have not been clearly determined. The present study examined how maternal vitamin A deficiency affects fetal islet development. Vitamin A-deficient mice were generated by feeding female mice with a chemically defined diet lacking vitamin A prior to mating as well as during pregnancy. We found that maternal vitamin A deficiency during pregnancy affected fetal pancreas development. Although the exocrine differentiation appeared normal, development of islet tissue was impaired. In the pancreas of neonatal mice, only a few endocrine cell clusters were formed, and these cell clusters lacked capillary endothelial cells. To further determine how vitamin A metabolites, such as retinoic acid, regulate vascularized islet development, ex vivo culture of embryonic pancreas either in the presence of 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB; an inhibitor of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase), all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) or retinoic acid receptor agonist (E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthylenyl)-1-propenyl] benzoic acid (TTNPB) was carried out. We found that the addition of DEAB blocked vascularization and suppressed \u03b2-cell differentiation. Conversely, atRA or TTNPB promoted \u03b2-cell differentiation accompanied by enhanced expression of vascular basement component, laminin. We further demonstrated that atRA regulated vascularization via upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) secretion in embryonic pancreas and treatment with VEGF-A was able to partially rescue vascularization and \u03b2-cell differentiation in DEAB-treated embryonic pancreas cultures.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of miR-145 in pancreatic cancer cells and explore its underlying mechanism.\nQuantitative real time PCR was used to determine the expression level of miR-145 and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) mNRA, and the expression level of Ang-2 protein was measured by western blotting. The anti-cancer activities of miR-145 were tested both in in vitro by using cell invasion and colony formation assay and in vivo by using xenograft assay. The direct action of miR-145 on Ang-2 was predicted by TargetScan and confirmed by luciferase report assay.

{"title": "Bronchial Artery Angiogenesis Drives Lung Tumor Growth.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is vital for tumor growth but in well-vascularized organs such as the lung its importance is unclear. This situation is complicated by the fact that the lung has two separate circulations, the pulmonary and the systemic bronchial circulation. There are few relevant animal models of non-small cell lung cancer, which can be used to study the lung's complex circulations, and mice, lacking a systemic bronchial circulation cannot be used. We report here a novel orthotopic model of non-small cell lung cancer in rats, where we have studied the separate contributions of each of the two circulations for lung tumor growth. Results show that bronchial artery perfusion, quantified by fluorescent microspheres (206% increase in large tumors) or high-resolution computed tomography scans (276% increase in large tumors), parallels the growth in tumor volume, whereas pulmonary artery perfusion remained unchanged. Ablation of the bronchial artery after the initiation of tumor growth resulted in a decrease in tumor volume over a subsequent course of 4 weeks. These results demonstrate that although the existing pulmonary circulation can supply the metabolic needs for tumor initiation, further growth of the tumor requires angiogenesis from the highly proliferative bronchial circulation.

At the start of primary ossification, TrkA-positive axons were observed at perichondrial bone surfaces, coincident with NGF expression in cells adjacent to centers of incipient ossification. Inactivation of TrkA signaling during embryogenesis in TrkA(F592A) mice impaired innervation, delayed vascular invasion of the primary and secondary ossification centers, decreased numbers of Osx-expressing osteoprogenitors, and decreased femoral length and volume. These same phenotypic abnormalities were observed in mice following tamoxifen-induced disruption of NGF in Col2-expressing perichondrial osteochondral progenitors.

Baseline ultrasonography (US) and SE were correlated with clinical and histological features and ROC curves developed for diagnostic accuracy. The non-palpable lesions were all \u22641.5\u00a0cm; 37/106 (34.9%) were malignant, 38 (35.9%) were benign, and 31 (29.2%) were non-neoplastic. Independent risk factors for malignancy were as follows: size (OR 17.788; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), microlithiasis (OR 17.673, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), intralesional vascularization (OR 9.207, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), and hypoechogenicity (OR, 11.509, p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). Baseline US had 89.2% sensitivity (95% CI 74.6-97.0) and 85.5% specificity (95% CI 75.0-92.8) in identifying malignancies, and 94.6% sensitivity (95% CI 86.9-98.5) and 87.1% specificity (95% CI 70.2-96.4) in discriminating neoplasms from non-neoplastic lesions.

However, the interaction of the stem cells-derived endothelial cells with angiogenesis within tumors is not well understood. The aim of this study was to examine the efficiency of endothelial-like cells derived from MSCs in controlling breast tumor growth associated with abnormal angiogenesis. For this purpose, Balb/c mouse model of breast carcinoma was developed and subjected to intra tumor (I.T)/intra venous (I.V) therapy with undifferentiated MSCs or endothelial cells derived from them. The homing of the stem cells was approved by measuring different markers as well as tracing green fluorescence protein (GFP)-labeled MSCs in the tumors. Tumor growth was measured following cell therapy using a digital caliper. At the end of treatment period (30 days) the angiogenesis markers; VEGFR2 expression as well as micro-vessel density (MVD) using CD31 were estimated in tumor tissues. Stem cell transplantation to mice bearing breast tumors resulted in tumor growth suppression in all experimental groups. The endothelial markers; CD31 and VEGFR2 were down regulated following I.T delivery of the endothelial cells. Accordingly, angiogenesis was suppressed following I.T administration of endothelial cells which was associated with increased focal necrosis in the tumors. In conclusion, data show that endothelial cells directly injected into tumors is more efficient compared to undifferentiated MSCs in controlling tumor-associated angiogenesis and tumor growth.", "journal": "Neoplasma", "date": "2016-08-28", "authors": ["MAdelipour", "AAllameh", "S MTavangar", "Z MHassan", "MSoleimani"], "doi": "10.4149/neo_2016_610"}

The aims of this study were to investigate anatomic changes in the lymphatic system in the forelimb of a canine after lymph node dissection and irradiation and to clarify the interaction between the transferred lymph node and recipient lymphatics.\nTwo adult female mongrel canines were used for this exploratory study. The unilateral axillary and lower neck node dissections were performed, and 15-Gy irradiation was applied on postoperative day 3. After 1\u00a0y, a VLNT flap was harvested from the lower abdominal region and inset in the axilla with vascular anastomoses. The girth of each forelimb was determined with a tape measure at different time points. Indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography and lymphangiography were performed before and after each surgery to evaluate morphologic changes in the lymphatics.\nBoth canines revealed identical changes in the lymphatic system, but only one canine developed lymphedema. After lymph node dissection, a collateral lymphatic pathway formed a connection to the contralateral cervical node. After VLNT, an additional collateral pathway formed a connection to the internal mammary node via the transferred node in the axilla.\nThe findings suggest that the lymphatic system has a homing mechanism, which allows the severed lymphatic vessels to detect and connect to adjacent lymph nodes.

The prefabrication of vascular network based on cell sheet technique brings a promising potential for sufficient vascularization due to rich extracellular matrix (ECM) of cell sheets. However, the effect of different cell sheet ECM micro-environment on the formation of a vascular network has not been well understood. Here our goal is to study the effect of different cell sheets on the formation of a vascular network. First we cultured human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) under two culture conditions to obtain osteogenic differentiated cell sheet (ODCS) and undifferentiated cell sheet (UDCS), respectively. Then the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded onto the surface of the two sheets at different seeding densities to fabricate pre-vascularized cell sheets. Our results indicated that the two sheets facilitated the alignment of HUVECs and promoted the formation of vascular networks. Quantitative analysis showed that the number of networks in ODCS was higher than that in the UDCS. The ECM of the two sheets was remodeled and rearranged during the tubulogenesis process. Furthermore, results showed that the optimal seeding density of HUVECs was 5\u00d710(4)cell/cm(2).

Besides UCP1, other compounds are essential not only to thermogenesis, but also to the proliferation and differentiation of BAT, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family, PPARgamma coactivator 1 (PGC1)-alpha, and PRD1-BF-1-RIZ1 homologous domain protein containing protein (PRDM) -16.

Therapeutic inhibition of pathologic angiogenesis has focused on targeting the VEGF pathway, while comparatively little attention has been given to remodeling of the new microcapillaries into a stabilized, functional, and persistent vascular network. Here, we used a novel reversible model of inflammatory angiogenesis in the rat cornea to investigate endogenous factors rapidly invoked to remodel, normalize and regress microcapillaries as part of the natural response to regain corneal avascularity. Rapid reversal of an inflammatory angiogenic stimulus suppressed granulocytic activity, enhanced recruitment of remodelling macrophages, induced capillary intussusception, and enriched pathways and processes involving immune cells, chemokines, morphogenesis, axonal guidance, and cell motility, adhesion, and cytoskeletal functions. Whole transcriptome gene expression analysis revealed suppression of numerous inflammatory and angiogenic factors and enhancement of endogenous inhibitors.

It is difficult to predict if and when these lesions may transform to malignancy, and in turn it is difficult to agree on appropriate management strategies. Understanding underlying molecular pathways would help in predicting the malignant transformation of oral potentially malignant disorders and ultimately identifying effective methods for early detection and prevention of oral cancer.

Such assessment is largely subjective and presents the opportunity to explore the use of emergent technologies.\nEmergent and powerful noninvasive imaging technologies applicable to assess burn and chronic wounds are reviewed.\nThe need to estimate wound depth is critical in both chronic wound and burn injury settings. Harmonic ultrasound technology is powerful to study wound depth. It addresses the limitations of optical imaging with limited depth of penetration. What if a wound appears epithelialized by visual inspection, which shows no discharge yet is covered by repaired skin that lacks barrier function? In this case although the wound is closed as defined by current standards, it remains functionally open, presenting the risk of infection and other postclosure complications. Thus, assessment of skin barrier function is valuable in the context of assessing wound closure. Options for the study of tissue vascularization are many. If noncontact and noninvasive criteria are of importance, laser speckle imaging is powerful. Fluorescence imaging is standard in several clinical settings and is likely to serve the wound clinics well as long as indocyanine green injection is not of concern. A major advantage of harmonic ultrasound imaging of wound depth is that the same system is capable of providing information on blood flow dynamics in arterial perforators.\nWith many productive imaging platforms to choose from, wound care is about to be transformed by technology that would help assess wound severity.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2016-08-25", "authors": ["Chandan KSen", "SubhadipGhatak", "Surya CGnyawali", "SashwatiRoy", "Gayle MGordillo"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0000000000002654"}

{"title": "Direct 3D bioprinting of perfusable vascular constructs using a blend bioink.", "abstract": "Despite the significant technological advancement in tissue engineering, challenges still exist towards the development of complex and fully functional tissue constructs that mimic their natural counterparts. To address these challenges, bioprinting has emerged as an enabling technology to create highly organized three-dimensional (3D) vascular networks within engineered tissue constructs to promote the transport of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products, which can hardly be realized using conventional microfabrication techniques. Here, we report the development of a versatile 3D bioprinting strategy that employs biomimetic biomaterials and an advanced extrusion system to deposit perfusable vascular structures with highly ordered arrangements in a single-step process. In particular, a specially designed cell-responsive bioink consisting of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), sodium alginate, and 4-arm poly(ethylene glycol)-tetra-acrylate (PEGTA) was used in combination with a multilayered coaxial extrusion system to achieve direct 3D bioprinting. This blend bioink could be first ionically crosslinked by calcium ions followed by covalent photocrosslinking of GelMA and PEGTA to form stable constructs. The rheological properties of the bioink and the mechanical strengths of the resulting constructs were tuned by the introduction of PEGTA, which facilitated the precise deposition of complex multilayered 3D perfusable hollow tubes. This blend bioink also displayed favorable biological characteristics that supported the spreading and proliferation of encapsulated endothelial and stem cells in the bioprinted constructs, leading to the formation of biologically relevant, highly organized, perfusable vessels. These characteristics make this novel 3D bioprinting technique superior to conventional microfabrication or sacrificial templating approaches for fabrication of the perfusable vasculature. We envision that our advanced bioprinting technology and bioink formulation may also have significant potentials in engineering large-scale vascularized tissue constructs towards applications in organ transplantation and repair.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-08-24", "authors": ["WeitaoJia", "P SelcanGungor-Ozkerim", "Yu ShrikeZhang", "KanYue", "KaiZhu", "WanjunLiu", "QingmentPi", "BatzayaByambaa", "Mehmet RemziDokmeci", "Su RyonShin", "AliKhademhosseini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.07.038"}
{"title": "Bioelectric impact of pathological angiogenesis on vascular function.", "abstract": "Pathological angiogenesis, as seen in many inflammatory, immune, malignant, and ischemic disorders, remains an immense health burden despite new molecular therapies. It is likely that further therapeutic progress requires a better understanding of neovascular pathophysiology. Surprisingly, even though transmembrane voltage is well known to regulate vascular function, no previous bioelectric analysis of pathological angiogenesis has been reported. Using the perforated-patch technique to measure vascular voltages in human retinal neovascular specimens and rodent models of retinal neovascularization, we discovered that pathological neovessels generate extraordinarily high voltage. Electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that voltage from aberrantly located preretinal neovascular complexes is transmitted into the intraretinal vascular network. With extensive neovascularization, this voltage input is substantial and boosts the membrane potential of intraretinal blood vessels to a suprahyperpolarized level. Coincident with this suprahyperpolarization, the vasomotor response to hypoxia is fundamentally altered. Instead of the compensatory dilation observed in the normal retina, arterioles constrict in response to an oxygen deficiency. This anomalous vasoconstriction, which would potentiate hypoxia, raises the possibility that the bioelectric impact of neovascularization on vascular function is a previously unappreciated pathophysiological mechanism to sustain hypoxia-driven angiogenesis.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2016-08-24", "authors": ["Donald GPuro", "RyohsukeKohmoto", "YasushiFujita", "Thomas WGardner", "Dolly APadovani-Claudio"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1604757113\n10.1111/aos.13025"}

Orf virus-derived proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-E and interleukin (ovIL)-10, enhance angiogenesis and control inflammation and fibrosis in skin wounds of laboratory animals.\nThe study aimed to determine if equine dermal cells respond to VEGF-E and ovIL-10. Equine dermal cells are expected to express VEGF and IL-10 receptors, so viral protein treatment is likely to alter cellular gene expression and behaviour in a manner conducive to healing.\nSkin samples were harvested from the lateral thoracic wall of two healthy thoroughbred horses.\nEquine dermal cells were isolated using a skin explant method and their phenotype assessed by immunofluorescence. Cells were treated with recombinant proteins, with or without inflammatory stimuli. Gene expression was examined using standard and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Cell behaviour was evaluated in a scratch assay.\nCultured cells were half vimentin(+ve) fibroblasts and half alpha smooth muscle actin(+ve) and vimentin(+ve) myofibroblasts. VEGF-E increased basal expression of IL-10 mRNA, whereas VEGF-A and collagenase-1 mRNA expression was increased by ovIL-10. In cells exposed to inflammatory stimulus, both treatments dampened tumour necrosis factor mRNA expression, and ovIL-10 exacerbated expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein. Neither viral protein influenced cell migration greatly.\nThis study shows that VEGF-E and ovIL-10 are active on equine dermal\u00a0cells and exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects that may enhance skin wound healing in horses.", "journal": "Veterinary dermatology", "date": "2016-08-24", "authors": ["Lyn MWise", "Christa JBodaan", "Andrew AMercer", "Christopher BRiley", "Christine LTheoret"], "doi": "10.1111/vde.12370"}

This \"organs-on-chips\" approach aims to capture key structural and physiological characteristics of the target tissue. Here we describe in vitro vascularized microtumors (VMTs). This \"tumor-on-a-chip\" platform incorporates human tumor and stromal cells that grow in a 3D extracellular matrix and that depend for survival on nutrient delivery through living, perfused microvessels. Both colorectal and breast cancer cells grow vigorously in the platform and respond to standard-of-care therapies, showing reduced growth and/or regression. Vascular-targeting agents with different mechanisms of action can also be distinguished, and we find that drugs targeting only VEGFRs (Apatinib and Vandetanib) are not effective, whereas drugs that target VEGFRs, PDGFR and Tie2 (Linifanib and Cabozantinib) do regress the vasculature. Tumors in the VMT show strong metabolic heterogeneity when imaged using NADH Fluorescent Lifetime Imaging Microscopy and, compared to their surrounding stroma, many show a higher free/bound NADH ratio consistent with their known preference for aerobic glycolysis.

Substrates of furin and furin-like PCs play a role in proliferation, metastasis and invasion. Some of them are involved in the progression of the pediatric soft tissue sarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). In this study, we show that PCs, and in particular furin, are expressed in RMS cell lines. To investigate the functional role of furin, we generated RMS cell lines with modulated furin activity. Silencing or stable inhibition of furin delayed tumor growth in Rh30 and RD xenografts in vivo, and was correlated with lower microvessel density. Reduced furin activity also decreased migration and invasion abilities in vitro, and inhibition of furin in RMS cells diminished processing of IGF1R, VEGF-C, PDGF-B and MT1-MMP, leading to lower levels of mature proteins. Furthermore, we found that furin activity is required for proper IGF signaling in RMS cells, as furin silencing resulted in reduced phosphorylation of Akt upon IGF1 stimulation. Taken together, our results suggest that furin plays an important role in the malignant phenotype of RMS cells by activating proteins involved in tumor growth and vascularization, metastasis and invasion.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-08-23", "authors": ["PatriciaJaaks", "ValentinaD'Alessandro", "NicoleGrob", "SinaB\u00fcel", "KatarinaHajdin", "Beat WSch\u00e4fer", "MicheleBernasconi"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0161396\n10.1038/nrd3699\n10.1074/jbc.M005339200\n10.1038/ng0797-303\n10.1002/mc.20134\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61140-6\n10.1074/jbc.M101725200\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208838\n10.1038/sj.onc.1209572\n10.1172/JCI113240\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010445\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.02.003\n10.1200/jco.2002.03.137\n10.1016/j.ccr.2013.11.002\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0639\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4578\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0844\n10.1200/JCO.2009.26.3814\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0582\n10.1155/2011/756982\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63838-2\n10.1016/j.jim.2010.11.008\n10.1093/carcin/bgt345\n10.1155/2011/209736\n10.1038/nrc1093\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0670\n10.1093/emboj/16.13.3898\n10.1096/fj.06-7060com\n10.1172/JCI17220\n10.1038/nm.2575\n10.1172/JCI24652\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.066\n10.1073/pnas.191199198\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0807\n10.3892/ol.2014.1839\n10.1186/1475-2867-14-43"}

{"title": "Engineered Biopolymeric Scaffolds for Chronic Wound Healing.", "abstract": "Skin regeneration requires the coordinated integration of concomitant biological and molecular events in the extracellular wound environment during overlapping phases of inflammation, proliferation, and matrix remodeling. This process is highly efficient during normal wound healing. However, chronic wounds fail to progress through the ordered and reparative wound healing process and are unable to heal, requiring long-term treatment at high costs. There are many advanced skin substitutes, which mostly comprise bioactive dressings containing mammalian derived matrix components, and/or human cells, in clinical use. However, it is presently hypothesized that no treatment significantly outperforms the others. To address this unmet challenge, recent research has focused on developing innovative acellular biopolymeric scaffolds as more efficacious wound healing therapies. These biomaterial-based skin substitutes are precisely engineered and fine-tuned to recapitulate aspects of the wound healing milieu and target specific events in the wound healing cascade to facilitate complete skin repair with restored function and tissue integrity. This mini-review will provide a brief overview of chronic wound healing and current skin substitute treatment strategies while focusing on recent engineering approaches that regenerate skin using synthetic, biopolymeric scaffolds. We discuss key polymeric scaffold design criteria, including degradation, biocompatibility, and microstructure, and how they translate to inductive microenvironments that stimulate cell infiltration and vascularization to enhance chronic wound healing.

{"title": "The choroid plexus in health and in disease: dialogues into and out of the brain.", "abstract": "This article brings the choroid plexus into the context of health and disease. It is remarkable that the choroid plexus, composed by a monolayer of epithelial cells that lie in a highly vascularized stroma, floating within the brain ventricles, gets so little attention in major physiology and medicine text books and in the scientific literature in general. Consider that it is responsible for producing most of the about 150mL of cerebrospinal fluid that fills the brain ventricles and the subarachnoid space and surrounds the spinal cord in the adult human central nervous system, which is renewed approximately 2-3 times daily. As such, its activity influences brain metabolism and function, which will be addressed. Reflect that it contains an impressive number of receptors and transporters, both in the apical and basolateral sides of the epithelial cells, and as such is a key structure for the communication between the brain and the periphery. This will be highlighted in the context of neonatal jaundice, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Realize that the capillaries that irrigate the choroid plexus stroma do not possess tight junctions and that the blood flow to the choroid plexus is five times higher than that in the brain parenchyma, allowing for a rapid sensing system and delivery of molecules such as nutrients and metals as will be revised. Recognize that certain drugs reach the brain parenchyma solely through the choroid plexus epithelia, which has potential to be manipulated in diseases such as neonatal jaundice and Alzheimer's disease as will be discussed. Without further notice, it must be now clear that understanding the choroid plexus is necessary for comprehending the brain and how the brain is modulated and modulates all other systems, in health and in disease. This review article intends to address current knowledge on the choroid plexus, and to motivate the scientific community to consider it when studying normal brain physiology and diseases of the central nervous system. It will guide the reader through several aspects of the choroid plexus in normal physiology, in diseases characteristic of various periods of life (newborns-kernicterus, young adults-multiple sclerosis and the elder-Alzheimer's disease), and how sex-differences may relate to disease susceptibility.", "journal": "Neurobiology of disease", "date": "2016-08-23", "authors": ["FernandaMarques", "Jo\u00e3o CarlosSousa", "Maria AlexandraBrito", "JensPahnke", "CeciliaSantos", "MargaridaCorreia-Neves", "Joana AlmeidaPalha"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nbd.2016.08.011"}
{"title": "Minimizing osteoradionecrosis after mandibular reconstruction and radiation in advanced head and neck cancer patients.", "abstract": "Osteoradionecrosis may develop on the residual mandible or reconstructed fibula because of inadequate soft tissue coverage and compromised tissue perfusion post mandibular reconstruction, and radiation. This study was to investigate the incidence of osteoradionecrosis following class III mandibular defect reconstructions with an OPAC flap versus a fibula OSC flap.\nA retrospective review of a consecutive series of mandibular reconstructions between 1999 and 2010 was performed. Mandibular defects and corresponding flap types were analyzed with emphasis on outcome, complications, and rates of osteoradionecrosis among the two subgroups.\nA total of 121 fibula flaps were performed, consisting of 53 OPAC and 68 fibula OSC flaps. Complications trended higher for OPAC flaps in partial and total flap loss rates as well as venous congestion when compared with the OSC flap cohort. The OPAC group had statistically significant lower rates of osteoradionecrosis and plate exposure than the OSC group (P\u2009=\u20090.04).\nThe OPAC flap may be preferable to fibula OSC flap in mandibular reconstruction given its lower rates of osteoradionecrosis and plate exposure. This flap type may be the flap of choice for class III defects where additional vascularized tissue may be critical for addressing significant soft tissue deficiency. J. Surg.

{"title": "Natural myocardial ECM patch drives cardiac progenitor based restoration even after scarring.", "abstract": "To evaluate the regenerative capacity of non-supplemented and bioactive patches made of decellularized porcine cardiac extracellular matrix (pcECM) and characterize the biological key factors involved in possible cardiac function (CF) restoration following acute and 8weeks chronic MI.\npcECM is a key natural biomaterial that can affect cardiac regeneration following myocardial infarction (MI), through mechanisms, which are still not clearly understood.\nWistar rats underwent MI and received pcECM patch (pcECM-P) treatment in either acute or chronic inflammatory phases. Treated, sham operated (no MI), and control (MI without treatment) animals, were compared through echocardiography, hemodynamics, pathological evaluation and analyses of various mRNA and protein level markers.\nOur results show that in both acute and long-term chronic MI models, pcECM promotes significant cardiac function improvement, which is correlated to progenitor (GATA4(+), c-kit(+)) and myocyte (MYLC(+), TRPI(+)) recruitment. Interestingly, recruited progenitors, isolated using laser capture microdissection (LCM), expressed both early and late cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation markers, suggesting differentiation towards the CM lineage. Recruited CM-like cells organized in a partially striated and immature muscle fiber arrangement that presented connexin43 -a crucial mediator of cardiac electrical conductivity. Concomitantly, pcECM was rapidly vascularized, and induced a constructive remodeling process as indicated by increased M2/M1 macrophage phenotypic ratio and pathological evaluation.\nAcellular pcECM patch implants alone, i.e., without added biologics, are bioactive, and exert potent efficacy, stimulating biological regenerative processes that cooperatively lead to a cardiac progenitor-based restoration of function, even after scar tissue had already formed.\nMI ('heart attack') remains the leading cause of heart failure and death in developed-countries. Restoration of cardiac function requires active turnover of damaged heart contracting cells (CM), however, CM endogenous regeneration is not efficient and is a matter of controversy. We show that a bioactive biomaterial alone-decellularized heart tissue (pcECM)-without added cells or growth factors, can elicit a complex regenerative response even after irreversible scarring. The pcECM patch induces macrophage polarization towards constructive remodeling and cardiomyocyte progenitor cell (GATA4(+), c-kit(+)) recruitment (evidenced at both mRNA and protein levels) resulting in de novo immature striated-like muscle patterns (MLC(+), TrpI(+), connexin43(+)). We, therefore, suggest this bioactive pcECM can model cardiac regeneration, and serve as a candidate for fast-track clinical application.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-08-23", "authors": ["UdiSarig", "HadarSarig", "Eliode-Berardinis", "Su-YinChaw", "Evelyne B VNguyen", "Vaibavi SRamanujam", "Vu DThang", "MuthafarAl-Haddawi", "SusanLiao", "DrorSeliktar", "TheodorosKofidis", "Freddy Y CBoey", "Subbu SVenkatraman", "MarcelleMachluf"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.08.031"}
{"title": "Collagen I hydrogel microstructure and composition conjointly regulate vascular network formation.", "abstract": "Neovascularization is a hallmark of physiological and pathological tissue remodeling that is regulated in part by the extracellular matrix (ECM). Collagen I hydrogels or Matrigel are frequently used to study vascular network formation; however, in isolation these materials do not typically mimic the integrated effects of ECM structure and composition that may influence endothelial cells in vivo. Here, we have utilized microfabricated 3D culture models to control collagen I microstructure in the presence and absence of Matrigel and tested the effect of these variations on vascular network formation by human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs). Varied collagen microarchitecture was achieved by adjusting the gelation temperature and subsequently confirmed by structural analysis. Casting at colder temperature increased collagen fiber thickness and length, and inclusion of Matrigel further pronounced these differences. Interestingly, the presence of Matrigel affected vascular network formation by modulating hCMEC growth, whereas altered collagen fiber structure impacted the morphology and maturity of the developed vascular network. These differences were related to substrate-dependent changes in interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion and were functionally relevant as vascular networks preformed in more fibrillar, Matrigel-containing hydrogels promoted angiogenic sprouting. Our studies indicate that collagen hydrogel microstructure and composition conjointly regulate vascular network formation with implications for translational and basic science approaches.\nNeovascularization is a hallmark of both tissue homeostasis and disease and is in part regulated by cell remodeling that occurs in the extracellular matrix (ECM). The use of bio-mimetic hydrogel cell culture systems has been used to study the effects of the ECM on cell behavior. Here, we employ a hydrogel system that enables control over both the structure and composition of the ECM and subsequently investigated the effects that these have on blood vessel dynamics.

Eschar excision was performed three days later. The wound bed was observed and wound tissue was harvested for counting the quantity of bacteria, tissue dry wet ratio, measuring the level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6, the amount of collagen fibers and the microvessel density instantly and again seven days later.

{"title": "Micropore-induced capillarity enhances bone distribution in vivo in biphasic calcium phosphate scaffolds.", "abstract": "The increasing demand for bone repair solutions calls for the development of efficacious bone scaffolds. Biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) scaffolds with both macropores and micropores (MP) have improved healing compared to those with macropores and no micropores (NMP), but the role of micropores is unclear. Here, we evaluate capillarity induced by micropores as a mechanism that can affect bone growth in vivo. Three groups of cylindrical scaffolds were implanted in pig mandibles for three weeks: MP were implanted either dry (MP-Dry), or after submersion in phosphate buffered saline, which fills pores with fluid and therefore suppresses micropore-induced capillarity (MP-Wet); NMP were implanted dry. The amount and distribution of bone in the scaffolds were quantified using micro-computed tomography. MP-Dry had a more homogeneous bone distribution than MP-Wet, although the average bone volume fraction, BVF\u203e, was not significantly different for these two groups (0.45\u00b10.03 and 0.37\u00b10.03, respectively). There was no significant difference in the radial bone distribution of NMP and MP-Wet, but the BVF\u203e, of NMP was significantly lower among the three groups (0.25\u00b10.02). These results suggest that micropore-induced capillarity enhances bone regeneration by improving the homogeneity of bone distribution in BCP scaffolds. The explicit design and use of capillarity in bone scaffolds may lead to more effective treatments of large and complex bone defects.\nThe increasing demand for bone repair calls for more efficacious bone scaffolds and calcium phosphate-based materials are considered suitable for this application. Macropores (>100\u03bcm) are necessary for bone ingrowth and vascularization. However, studies have shown that microporosity (<20\u03bcm) also enhances growth, but there is no consensus on the controlling mechanisms. In previous in vitro work, we suggested that micropore-induced capillarity had the potential to enhance bone growth in vivo. This work illustrates the positive effects of capillarity on bone regeneration in vivo; it demonstrates that micropore-induced capillarity significantly enhances the bone distribution in the scaffold. The results will impact the design of scaffolds to better exploit capillarity and improve treatments for large and load-bearing bone defects.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-08-22", "authors": ["Laurence ERustom", "ThomasBoudou", "SiyuLou", "IsabellePignot-Paintrand", "Brett WNemke", "YanLu", "Mark DMarkel", "CatherinePicart", "Amy JWagoner Johnson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.08.025\n10.1016/j.spinee.2013.08.060"}

In North America, the only donor registration/card system that facilitated VCAG donation is in Mexico.

{"title": "VEGF expression is regulated by HIF-1\u03b1 and ARNT in 3D KYSE-70, esophageal cancer cell spheroids.", "abstract": "In 3D cultured cell systems, the cells form 3D spheroids that mimic cancer cell spheroids in vivo. Cancer cells form cell spheroids as they grow. The in vivo spheroids do not contain a vascular network; therefore, oxygen and nutrition supplies are insufficient. Specifically, the cells in the core region of the cluster are exposed to higher stress levels than the cells in the outer spheroid layer. As a result, the cells in the spheroid are exposed to low nutrition and hypoxia conditions. To overcome these shortages, angiogenesis is induced in cancer spheroids in vivo. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important molecule involved in angiogenesis. VEGF is secreted by cancer cells in vivo in response to stress conditions such as hypoxia. VEGF expression in cancer cells is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1), which accumulates in cancer cells during hypoxia. In this report, we show that VEGF expression is regulated by HIF1\u03b1 and that VEGF is secreted to the outside of the spheroid in vitro. Several investigators have reported that HIF1\u03b1 forms a protein-protein complex with aryl hydrocarbon receptor translocator (ARNT). We report here that not only HIF1\u03b1 but also ARNT regulates VEGF expression in 3D cancer spheroids.

{"title": "Lactobacilli Modulate Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-1 Regulatory Pathway in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cell Line.", "abstract": "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-1 plays an essential role in the body's response to low oxygen concentrations and regulates expression of several genes implicated in homeostasis, vascularization, anaerobic metabolism as well as immunological responses. Increased levels of HIF-1\u03b1 are associated with increased proliferation and more aggressive breast tumor development. Lactobacilli have been shown to exert anti-cancer effects on several malignancies including breast cancer. However, the exact mechanism of such effect is not clear yet. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of selected genes from HIF pathway in a triple negative breast cancer cell line (expressing no estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as HER-2/Neu), MDA-MB-231, following treatment with two lactobacilli culture supernatants.\nIn this experimental study, we analyzed the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, SLC2A1, VHL, HSP90, XBP1 and SHARP1 genes from HIF pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells, before and after treatment with Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus culture supernatants (LCS and LRS, respectively) by means of quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).\nBoth LRS and LCS had cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB-231 cells, while the former type was more cytotoxic. LRS dramatically down-regulated expression levels of the HIF-1\u03b1, HSP90 and SLC2A1 in the MDA-MB-231 cells. LCS had similar effect on the expression of HSP90, to what was observed in the LRS treatment. The expression level of tumor suppressor genes VHL and SHARP1 were also decreased in LCS treated cells.\nAlthough both LCS and LRS had cytotoxic effects on the MDA-MB-231 cells, it is proposed that LRS could be more appropriate for pathway directed treatment modalities, as it did not decrease expression of tumor suppressor genes involved in HIF pathway. Down-regulation of HIF pathway mediated oncogenes by LRS suggests that the cytotoxic effects of this Lactobacillus may at least be partly caused by this mechanism. As previous studies have shown that inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 and HSP90 expressions have therapeutic impact on cancer treatment, the inhibitory effect of LRS on expression of these genes implies that this Lactobacillus can be used in treatment strategies.", "journal": "Cell journal", "date": "2016-08-20", "authors": ["AliEsfandiary", "ZahraTaherian-Esfahani", "AtiehAbedin-Do", "RezaMirfakhraie", "MahdiehShirzad", "SoudehGhafouri-Fard", "ElaheMotevaseli"], "doi": "10.22074/cellj.2016.4319"}

{"title": "Scalp Reconstruction With Free Latissimus Dorsi Flap in a Patient With Giant Cutis Verticis Gyrata.", "abstract": "Cutis verticis gyrata is a rare skin disorder characterized by formation of thick skin folds and grooves. Because of the risk of malignant transformation, these lesions must be surgically excised. In this study, the authors aimed to present a successful reconstruction of scalp with free latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap after total excision of giant cerebriform intradermal nevus that causes cutis verticis gyrata.\nAn 18-year-old male patient attended to our clinic with a large tumor that covers almost 80% of his scalp. Lesion is diagnosed as cerebriform intradermal nevus. Excision of the tumor and scalp reconstruction with free latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap is planned and the patient is operated.\nFree tissue transfer is one of the best choices for full thickness defects that covers 80% of scalp with its excellent reconstructive and aesthetical results. Reconstruction with free flaps reduces the number of operations necessary to cover the defect unlike serial tissue expansion or staged excision methods. Free flaps are also a good alternative when the patient has not enough hair-bearing tissue to expand. Low donor site morbidity also makes free latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flaps excellent choice.\nCerebriform intradermal nevus is one of the most common causes of cutis verticis gyrata and has an importance due to the current risk of malign transformation. Latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous free flap is a reliable and aesthetically acceptable reconstruction option in the patients of giant cutis verticis gyrata due to sufficient pedicle length, reliable vascularized tissue volume, and large surface area.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2016-08-19", "authors": ["Ozay OzkayaMutlu", "OzlemColak", "MertCanli", "AyberkAkcay"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000002862"}

The goal of the current study was to compare the complications of 2 ADM products-AlloDerm and Cortiva.\nA retrospective analysis of prosthetic-based breast reconstruction in Atlanta, Ga., over 5 years. Inclusion criteria were the use of the ADM types (AlloDerm or Cortiva) and use of a tissue expander or implant. Statistical analysis compared group demographics, risk factors, and early complications.\nOf the 298 breast reconstructions, 174 (58.4%) used AlloDerm and 124 (41.6%) used Cortiva. There was no difference in overall complication frequency (16 AlloDerm and 18 Cortiva; P = 0.195). Within specific categories, there was a difference in mastectomy skin flap necrosis, but, based on further regression analysis, this was attributable to differences in body mass index (P = 0.036). Furthermore, there were no differences in the rates of infection (6 AlloDerm and 5 Cortiva; P = 1.0), seroma/hematoma (9 AlloDerm and 7 Cortiva; P = 1.0), or drain duration (13.2 day AlloDerm and 14.2 day Cortiva, P = 0.2). By using a general estimating equation for binomial logistical regression, it was found that only current tobacco use (P = 0.033) was a significant predictor for a complication. Trending predictors were body mass index (P = 0.074) and age (P = 0.093). The type of matrix was not a significant predictor for any of the recorded complication (P = 0.160).\nAlthough AlloDerm is well established, we have shown that Cortiva has an equivalent complication frequency.

{"title": "The Novel Pig In Vitro Maturation System to Improve Developmental Competence of Oocytes Derived from Atretic Non-Vascularized Follicle.", "abstract": "The in vitro maturation (IVM) technique is beneficial for producing animal offspring, but the blastocyst rate is low after IVM. In this technique, cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) are collected from medium size follicles. The follicles are ultimately selected as large dominant follicles or atretic follicles; therefore it is possible that the COCs collected using IVM are contaminated by follicles that will develop into large follicles and induce atresia. In the dominant follicles, estradiol-17beta and progesterone induce the differentiation of follicular somatic cells which exhibit the ability to respond to ovulation during follicular development. Thus, we hypothesized that changes in the hormonal condition of healthy follicles are essential for oocyte maturation during IVM. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of the steroid hormone concentrations in non-vascularized follicles (NVFs) and vascularized follicles (VFs). The estradiol-17beta concentration increased in medium VFs, whereas the level was low in NVFs of the same size. The progesterone concentration increased with large follicular size in VFs, but the level remained low in follicles of any size among NVFs. To improve the oocyte quality derived from NVFs, NVF COCs were cultured with FSH alone or FSH under theVF hormonal conditions. Cultivation under the VF hormonal conditions dramatically improved the proliferation and survival of cumulus cells, meiotic maturation of oocytes, cumulus expansion, and blastocyst rate following in vitro fertilization. Thus, the cultivation of NVF COCs under VF hormonal conditions improves the developmental potential to the blastocyst stage by NVF oocytes.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2016-08-19", "authors": ["AsakoOkamoto", "MakiIkeda", "AeriKaneko", "ChikaKishida", "MasayukiShimada", "YasuhisaYamashita"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.116.138982"}

It is firmly established that aluminum is a potent neurotoxicant. So, the aim based on is aluminum damage chicken heart, as well as the vitelline circulation. In the first 3\u00a0days of incubation (D0-D2), 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0\u00a0mg aluminum chloride/0.3\u00a0ml avian saline was injected into the center of each viable fertilized egg yolk (AL1, AL2, and AL3 groups, respectively). Control eggs were either uninjected (AL0) or injected (ALS, 0.3\u00a0ml saline). Crown rump length was significantly decreased, while, embryonic mortalities, growth delay, as well as congenital heart defects were increased in the eggs injected 2.0 or 4.0\u00a0mg of Al. Although no relationship is clear about the embryonic mortality induced by Al in chicken embryos to the dose concentration, the higher mortality occurs in early developmental stages in developing chick embryos. Furthermore, chick embryos exposed to 4.0\u00a0mg/Al showed a high incidence of defects of ventricular septation and ventricular myocardium. Configuration and density of branched vitelline vessels were also significantly deteriorated after injection with 4.0\u00a0mg/Al.

{"title": "Hofbauer cells of M2a, M2b and M2c polarization may regulate feto-placental angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The human placenta comprises a special type of tissue macrophages, the Hofbauer cells (HBC), which exhibit M2 macrophage phenotype. Several subtypes of M2-polarized macrophages (M2a, M2b and M2c) exist in almost all tissues. Macrophage polarization depends on the way of macrophage activation and leads to the expression of specific cell surface markers and the acquisition of specific functions, including tissue remodeling and the promotion of angiogenesis. The placenta is a highly vascularized and rapidly growing organ, suggesting a role of HBC in feto-placental angiogenesis. We here aimed to characterize the specific polarization and phenotype of HBC and investigated the role of HBC in feto-placental angiogenesis. Therefore, HBC were isolated from third trimester placentas and their phenotype was determined by the presence of cell surface markers (FACS analysis) and secretion of cytokines (ELISA). HBC conditioned medium (CM) was analyzed for pro-angiogenic factors, and the effect of HBC CM on angiogenesis, proliferation and chemoattraction of isolated primary feto-placental endothelial cells (fpEC) was determined in vitro Our results revealed that isolated HBC possess an M2 polarization, with M2a, M2b and M2c characteristics. HBC secreted the pro-angiogenic molecules VEGF and FGF2. Furthermore, HBC CM stimulated the in vitro angiogenesis of fpEC. However, compared with control medium, chemoattraction of fpEC toward HBC CM was reduced. Proliferation of fpEC was not affected by HBC CM. These findings demonstrate a paracrine regulation of feto-placental angiogenesis by HBC in vitro Based on our collective results, we propose that the changes in HBC number or phenotype may affect feto-placental angiogenesis.", "journal": "Reproduction (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2016-08-19", "authors": ["JLoegl", "UHiden", "ENussbaumer", "CSchliefsteiner", "SCvitic", "ILang", "CWadsack", "BHuppertz", "GDesoye"], "doi": "10.1530/REP-16-0159"}

For the fPCA, blood flow in the PCA originates from the anterior instead of the posterior circulation. We tested whether this blood supply variant impacts the cerebral blood flow assessed by arterial spin labeling (ASL), cerebrovascular reserve as well as resting-state static functional connectivity (sFC) in the sense of a systematic confound.\nThe study included 385 healthy, elderly subjects (mean age: 74.18 years [range: 68.9-90.4]; 243 female). Participants were classified into normal vascular supply (n = 296, 76.88%), right fetal origin (n = 23, 5.97%), left fetal origin (n = 16, 4.16%), bilateral fetal origin (n = 4, 1.04%), and intermediate (n = 46, 11.95%, excluded from further analysis) groups. ASL-derived relative cerebral blood flow (relCBF) maps and cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) maps derived from a CO2 challenge with blocks of 7% CO2 were compared. Additionally, sFC between 90 regions of interest (ROIs) was compared between the groups.\nCVR was significantly reduced in subjects with ipsilateral fPCA, most prominently in the temporal lobe. ASL yielded a non-significant trend towards reduced relCBF in bilateral posterior watershed areas. In contrast, conventional atlas-based sFC did not differ between groups.\nIn conclusion, fPCA presence may bias the assessment of cerebrovascular reserve by reducing the response to CO2. In contrast, its effect on ASL-assessed baseline perfusion was marginal. Moreover, fPCA presence did not systematically impact resting-state sFC.

The \u03b1/\u03b4 islets are variable in shape, composed of \u03b1 and \u03b4 cells evenly intermixed. They are vascularized better but encapsulated poorer than \u03b2 islets in general. During the development, the \u03b2 and \u03b1/\u03b4 islets adjoin and fuse with each other in such a way that \u03b1 and \u03b4 cells form a crescent on \u03b2 cells and, then, progress to encompass and encroach into \u03b2 cells.

Islets at various stages of fusion are present concurrently until late gestation, suggesting that the islet fusion is an ongoing developmental process. The \u03b1/\u03b4 islets appear to play a primary role for the process, approaching toward the fusion partner actively. Direct connection is present between the \u03b1/\u03b4 islets and neural ganglia undergoing active neurogenesis, suggesting an organ-wide neuroendocrine network development.

Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) are highly vascularized tumors in which the earliest genetic event is most commonly the biallelic inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, leading to constitutive activation of the HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 transcription factors, which are known angiogenic factors. However it remains unclear whether either or both HIF-1\u03b1 or HIF-2\u03b1 stabilization in normal renal epithelial cells are necessary or sufficient for alterations in blood vessel formation. We show that renal epithelium-specific deletion of Vhl in mice causes increased medullary vascularization and that this phenotype is completely rescued by Hif1a co-deletion, but not by co-deletion of Hif2a. A physiological consequence of changes in the blood vessels of the vasa recta in Vhl-deficient mice is a diabetes insipidus phenotype of excretion of large amounts of highly diluted urine. This constitutive diuresis is fully compensated by increased water consumption and mice do not show any signs of dehydration, renal failure or salt wasting and blood electrolyte levels remain unchanged. Co-deletion of Hif1a, but not Hif2a, with Vhl, fully restored kidney morphology and function, correlating with the rescue of the vasculature. We hypothesize that the increased medullary vasculature alters salt uptake from the renal interstitium, resulting in a disruption of the osmotic gradient and impaired urinary concentration. Taken together, our study characterizes a new mouse model for a form of diabetes insipidus and non-obstructive hydronephrosis and provides new insights into the physiological and pathophysiological effects of HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization on the vasculature in the kidney.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-08-17", "authors": ["D\u00e9sir\u00e9eSch\u00f6nenberger", "MichalRajski", "SabineHarlander", "Ian JFrew"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.11275"}

She had a facial cleft and ectrodactyly at birth. Right eye-dominant blepharophimosis was obvious. Examination of the right eye revealed inferior corneal opacity with vascularization, downward corectopia, and optic-nerve hypoplasia. The corneal diameter was 8 mm in both eyes, and tonometry by use of a Tono-Pen(\u00ae) XL (Reichert Technologies, Depew, NY, USA) handheld applanation tonometer revealed that her intraocular pressure was 11-22 mmHg (Oculus Dexter) and 8 mmHg (Oculus Sinister). B-mode echo revealed no differences in axial length between her right and left eyes. When she was 15-16 months old, we attempted to examine her eyes before she underwent plastic surgery under general anesthesia. She had a small optic disc in both eyes and the right-eye disc was tilted. After undergoing canthotomy, gonioscopy and ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed that almost all directions were open except for the peripheral anterior synechia. Since magnetic resonance imaging revealed ventriculomegaly associated with an interhemispheric cyst at birth, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted at 12 days of age. At 25 months of age, her condition suddenly deteriorated due to occlusion of the ventricular shunt catheter, and she died 5 days later. In this patient, amniotic band syndrome was presumed to be the primary cause due to the clinical findings.\nWe experienced a case of optic-nerve hypoplasia and anterior segment abnormality that occurred with facial cleft. The cause of these abnormalities is unclear, yet amniotic band syndrome is a possible candidate.", "journal": "International medical case reports journal", "date": "2016-08-16", "authors": ["TomokoMiyake", "ShotaKojima", "TetsuyaSugiyama", "MariUeki", "JunSugasawa", "HidehiroOku", "KensukeTajiri", "YukaShigemura", "KoichiUeda", "AtsukoHarada", "MamiYamasaki", "TakumiYamanaka", "HidetsunaUtsunomiya", "TsunehikoIkeda"], "doi": "10.2147/IMCRJ.S99237"}

A self-setting CPC composited with gelatin fiber is investigated to test the utility of this tissue engineering strategy to support rapid and extensive vascularization process. The interconnected hollow channels in CPC are formed after dissolution of gelatin fibers in vivo. The CPC-gelatin samples exhibit relatively decent/enhanced mechanical property, compared to the control. When implanted in vivo, the pre-established vascular networks in material anastomose with host vessels and accelerate vascular infiltration throughout the whole tissue construct. Different channel sizes induce different vascularization behaviors in vivo. Results indicate that the channel with the size of 250\u03bcm increases the expression of the representative angiogenic factors HIF1\u03b1, PLGF and migration factor CXCR4, which benefit the formation of small vessels. On the other hand, the channel with the size of 500\u03bcm enhances VEGF-A expression, which benefit the development of large vessels. Notably, the intersection area of channels has high invasive, sprouting and vasculogenesis potential under hypoxic condition, because more HIF1\u03b1-positive cells are observed there. Observation of the CD31-positive lumen in the border of scaffold indicates the ingrowth of blood vessels from its host into material through channel, benefited from gradually increased HIF1\u03b1 expression.

We took an iterative approach in optimizing the complex combination of mechanical, biochemical and biological properties of an HA cell scaffold.

Immunostaining of pancreases of Netrin-1-treated and control animals were employed to examine islet morphology, vascularization and macrophage infiltration. Plasma insulin, glucagon and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were quantified by ELISA. Expression of endogenous Netrin-1 was also assessed by PCR and immunohistochemistry. We observed a stimulatory effect of Netrin-1 on in\u00a0vitro insulin secretion by promoting \u03b2-cell Ca(2+) influx and cAMP production. After 4-week continuous exposure, a hypoglycaemic property of Netrin-1 was demonstrated, which is probably attributable to improved \u03b2-cell function, shown as increased insulin content and preproinsulin mRNA expression. Enhanced islet vascularization, reduced islet macrophage infiltration and ameliorated systemic inflammation were detected from HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mice after Netrin-1 administration.

Here, we provide an integrated view of current procedures of immune monitoring in VCA and potential complementary approaches learned from organ transplantation.\nBecause the skin is highly immunogenic and is the main target of the alloimmune response, immune monitoring in VCA essentially relies on visual inspection and pathological examination of for-causes and protocol skin biopsies. Light microscopical and immunohistochemical analyses enable us to identify skin lesions that are characteristic, but not specific, of allograft rejection. Complementary approaches of immunological assessment may assist in reinforcing the diagnosis of rejection and preventing over-immunosuppression or under-immunosuppression. Such approaches can inform either on the patient's global immune status or more specifically on the B-cell-mediated or T-cell-mediated immune responses against donor antigens.\nStrategies that integrate both the current 'gold standards' of monitoring in VCA and a complementary multilayer immunological assessment are likely to provide the highest precision for the personalized determination of the recipients' immunological status.

Here we report such a tumor, measuring 3 cm in diameter, found in the parotid gland of an 81-year-old man. Histologically, approximately 70% of the mass was a component of nodular oncocytic proliferation, and the remaining portion was a component of conventional Warthin's tumor. We performed immunohistochemical analysis to explore what factors determined the morphogenesis of the two components in the single mass. Cytokeratin (CK) 5\u00f76-positive tumor cells, which represent basal cells, were aligned in a layer in the conventional Warthin's tumor component, whereas they were localized around blood vessels in the nodular oncocytic hyperplasia component. Immunostaining for CD34 showed that capillaries were sparsely present beneath the bilayered epithelia in the former component, while blood vessels resembling sinusoids separated the trabeculae of the tumor cells in the latter component. Ki-67 labeling index was slightly higher in the latter component. Double immunostaining for CK5\u00f76 and Ki-67 revealed that most of Ki-67-positive proliferating tumor cells were CK5\u00f76-positive, suggesting that CK5\u00f76-positive population contained proliferative progenitor cells of the tumor. These findings imply that the regional difference in the distribution pattern and proliferative activity of CK5\u00f76-positive putative progenitor cells along with the difference in the pattern of vascular network occurred during the tumorigenic process of the tumor and determined one region to become conventional Warthin's tumor morphology and the other to become nodular oncocytic hyperplasia.", "journal": "Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie", "date": "2016-08-16", "authors": ["HirooKawano", "TokuhiroKimura", "NamiKikuchi", "AyaIshii", "EijiIkeda"], "doi": null}

With further examinations, we discovered that the tumor was invading the both femoral condyles and was vascularized by three major arterial pedicles. The onset of his problems was the femoral fracture and the changes on the major vessels, muscles and nerves. After an interdisciplinary approach of the patient and a meticulous preoperative planning, we decided to make an extensive total resection of the tumor followed by a complex reconstruction surgery for the bone. A very stable fixation of a vascularized graft allowed the bone to heal even if the surrounded soft-tissue was almost completely invaded by the tumor and removed during the excision.

{"title": "Intraepithelial ischemia is a principal factor promoting cancerization of the covering epithelial tissues.", "abstract": "Prominent angiogenesis, which is a hallmark of invasive cancer is preceded at the precancerous stage by marked ischemia. Our hypothesis proposes a structural mechanism responsible for altering blood flow in the covering epithelium and leading to marked reduction of vascularization in the foci of dysplasia. This mechanism varies from one type of epithelium to another. In squamous epithelium only basal cells are in direct contact with stromal vessels. To supply nutrients to the rest of the cells located at different levels, the subjacent stroma forms excrescences which penetrate upward together with blood capillaries. As soon as precancerous dysplastic alterations start and progress the number of intraepithelial blood vessels simultaneously decreases, thus leading to ischemia which precedes or promotes malignization of the covering squamous epithelium. To compensate for the deficit in blood supply, the dysplastic cells penetrate deeper into the underlying stroma, commencing invasion. Thus, the cells destroy the subjacent stroma not because they are initially \"malignant\", but due to ischemia which provokes the search for nutrients. Comparing squamous epithelium with glandular respiratory epithelium shows that the latter contains no blood capillaries at all. However, unlike squamous epithelial coverings, in respiratory epithelial covering, each cell is attached directly to the basal membrane and has ample access to the blood supply. Covering respiratory epithelium itself seldom gives rise directly to malignant growth. Cancerization of this type of epithelium occurs in the foci of squamous metaplasia. The latter are not supplied by a sufficient amount of blood vessels and in the majority of cases remain fragile and vulnerable structures, easily prone to malignization. Further study of these phenomenon should include the clarification of the influence of carcinogenic agents on the mechanism of adequate vascularization at the precancerous stage.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2016-08-16", "authors": ["A IKarseladze"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2016.07.014"}

Herein we focus on the role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3R), which are intracellular Ca(2+) release channels, in placentation. Double knockout (DKO) of type 1 and 3 IP3Rs (IP3R1 and IP3R3, respectively) in mice resulted in embryonic lethality around embryonic day (E) 11.5. Because IP3R1 and IP3R3 were co-expressed in endothelial cells in the labyrinth, allantois, and yolk sac, we investigated extra-embryonic vascular development in IP3R1- and IP3R3-DKO mice. The formation of chorionic plates and yolk sac vessels seemed dysregulated around the timing of the chorio-allantoic attachment, immediately followed by the disorganization of allantoic vessels, the decreased expression of the spongiotrophoblast cell marker Tpbpa and the growth retardation of the embryos in DKO mice. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry demonstrated downregulation of a vascular endothelial marker, CD31, in labyrinth embryonic vessels and poor elongation of extra-embryonic mesoderm into the labyrinth layer in DKO placenta, whereas the branching of the DKO chorionic trophoblast was initiated. In addition, allantoic and yolk sac vessels in extra-embryonic tissues were less remodeled in DKO mice. In vitro endothelial cord formation and migration activities of cultured vascular endothelial cells derived from human umbilical vein were downregulated under the inhibition of IP3R. Our results suggest that IP3R1 and IP3R3 are required for extra-embryonic vascularization in the placenta, allantois, and yolk sac.

METHODS This retrospective cohort study identified patients who underwent surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in a tertiary vascular centre over a 2-year period. Data on demographics and originating unit were recorded. Outcomes assessed included 30-day mortality, operative mortality and postoperative morbidity. RESULTS We identified 70 patients who underwent surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in the 2-year period; 36 presented directly to the vascular unit (VU), 14 to referral unit 1 (RU1) and 20 to referral unit 2 (RU2); 30-day mortality rates were 27.7% (VU), 35.5% (RU1) and 30.0% (RU2), respectively. There was no statistical difference in mortality between units. Postoperative complications were seen in 35.9% of VU patients, 78.6% of RU1 patients and 70% of RU2 patients. This was statistically significant between VU and RU1 (P = 0.006) and VU and RU2 (P = 0.02). Direct operative complications were seen in 9 patients, gastrointestinal complications in 9, limb complications in 6 and systemic complications in 40. CONCLUSION This study found that site of presentation does not affect mortality but is associated with increased morbidity. This is a complex issue, which will require a prospective multicentre study to investigate further.", "journal": "Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England", "date": "2016-08-12", "authors": ["V KProctor", "M JLee", "A HNassef"], "doi": "10.1308/rcsann.2016.0231"}

This paper describes the clinical, histological, ultrastructural, and molecular picture of bone regenerated with patient-customized plate, used for mandibular reconstruction in combination with microvascular osteomyocutaneous fibula flap. The plate was virtually planned and additively manufactured using electron beam melting. This plate was retrieved from the patient after 33 months. Microcomputed tomography, backscattered-scanning electron microscopy, histology, and quantitative-polymerase chain reaction were employed to evaluate the regenerated bone and the flap bone associated with the retrieved plate. At retrieval, the posterior two-thirds of the plate were in close adaptation with the underlying flap, whereas soft tissue was observed between the native mandible and the anterior one-third. The histological and structural analyses showed new bone regeneration, ingrowth, and osseointegration of the posterior two-thirds. The histological observations were supported by the gene expression analysis showing higher expression of bone formation and remodeling genes under the posterior two-thirds compared with the anterior one-third of the plate. The observation of osteocytes in the flap indicated its viability. The present data endorse the suitability of the customized, additively manufactured plate for the vascularized fibula mandibular reconstruction. Furthermore, the combination of the analytical techniques provides possibilities to deduce the structural and molecular characteristics of bone regenerated using this procedure.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2016-08-12", "authors": ["AndreasThor", "AndersPalmquist", "Jan-Micha\u00e9lHirsch", "Lars-ErikR\u00e4nnar", "PerD\u00e9rand", "OmarOmar"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000002939"}

{"title": "The expression profile of angiogenic genes in critical limb ischemia popliteal arteries.", "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and is the leading cause of non-traumatic amputations in western populations. In recent years, therapeutic angiogenesis has been considered to be a potential treatment option for CLI patients, however the molecular mechanism of ischemia-induced vascularization is still not fully understood. The identification of genetic factors underlying vascular responses to ischemia will improve our understanding of the biological causes of the disease and enhance personalized therapies in the future. In this work, we determined, for the first time, the expression profile of angiogenesis-related genes utilizing unique human material: the popliteal arteries retrieved during lower limb amputation from patients with CLI. Using custom-designed TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) cards we investigated the mRNA level of 90 genes on CLI samples compared to healthy donors. We identified three significantly up-regulated genes in CLI group: matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), VE-cadherin (CDH5) and integrin alpha 4 (ITGA4). However, among all investigated genes, only lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1) was significantly reduced. In order to verify whether hypoxic conditions occur in popliteal arteries of CLI patients, we validated the transcription level of selected proangiogenic genes by real-time PCR on a larger number of samples. These results showed that the expression of key genes involved in angiogenesis, such as MMP9, HGF, HIF1A, VEGF-A and FLT1 were elevated in patients with CLI. Moreover, the study revealed that the expression of VEGF-A and FLT1 was associated with activation of HIF1A transcription. In conclusion, our data revealed the alteration in the mRNA level of genes involved in matrix remodelling, cell-cell adhesion as well as endothelial cell migration and proliferation in human popliteal arteries.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society", "date": "2016-08-12", "authors": ["DBaczynska", "DMichalowska", "PBarc", "JSkora", "MKarczewski", "ASadakierska-Chudy"], "doi": null}

A total of 30\u00a0Gy was administered as 2\u00a0Gy/d, 5\u00a0d/wk for 3\u00a0weeks, either by PRT (10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.2\u00a0Gy/d, with a 3-minute break between each 0.2-Gy dose) or SRT (2\u00a0Gy/d, uninterrupted delivery) in combination with concurrent 2\u00a0mg/kg CDDP 3 times per week in the final 2\u00a0weeks of radiation therapy. Treatment-induced growth delays were defined from twice-weekly tumor volume measurements.

In general, we found that decellularized tendon scaffolds without fixative treatments were more effective in inducing osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of hADSCs in vitro. When non-cross-linked decellularized tendon scaffolds were applied together with hydroxyapatite for hADSC transplantation in critical-sized bone defects, they promoted bone-specific collagen deposition and mineralized bone formation 4 and 8 weeks after hADSC transplantation, compared to conventional collagen type I scaffolds.

However, it has been shown that these models fail to reliably mimic patient tumors in different assays(1). Human tumor xenografts represent the gold standard with respect to tumor biology, drug discovery, and metastasis research (2-4). Tumor xenografts can be derived from different types of material like tumor cell lines, tumor tissue from primary patient tumors(4) or serially transplanted tumors. When propagated in vivo, xenografted tissue is infiltrated and vascularized by cells of mouse origin. Multiple factors such as the tumor entity, the origin of xenografted material, growth rate and region of transplantation influence the composition and the amount of mouse cells present in tumor xenografts. However, even when these factors are kept constant, the degree of mouse cell contamination is highly variable. Contaminating mouse cells significantly impair downstream analyses of human tumor xenografts. As mouse fibroblasts show high plating efficacies and proliferation rates, they tend to overgrow cultures of human tumor cells, especially slowly proliferating subpopulations. Mouse cell derived DNA, mRNA, and protein components can bias downstream gene expression analysis, next-generation sequencing, as well as proteome analysis (5). To overcome these limitations, we have developed a fast and easy method to isolate untouched human tumor cells from xenografted tumor tissue. This procedure is based on the comprehensive depletion of cells of mouse origin by combining automated tissue dissociation with the benchtop tissue dissociator and magnetic cell sorting.

In conclusion, this is the first VCA small-animal model that allows for reliable and reproducible measurement of behavioral functional recovery in addition to histologic evaluation of nerve regeneration and graft reinnervation.", "journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "date": "2016-08-09", "authors": ["BKern", "J DBudihardjo", "SMermulla", "AQuan", "CCadmi", "JLopez", "MKhusheim", "SXiang", "JPark", "G JFurtm\u00fcller", "K ASarhane", "SSchneeberger", "W P ALee", "AHoke", "S HTuffaha", "GBrandacher"], "doi": "10.1111/ajt.14007"}
{"title": "Role of the ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway in Osteogenesis of Rat Tendon-Derived Stem Cells in Normoxic and Hypoxic Cultures.", "abstract": "Ectopic ossification and increased vascularization are two common phenomena in the chronic tendinopathic tendon. The increased vascularization usually leads to an elevated local oxygen tension which is one of micro-environments that can influence differentiate status of stem cells.\nThis study aimed to investigate the osteogenesis capacity of rat tendon-derived stem cells TDSCs (rTDSCs) in normoxic and hypoxic cultures, and to study the role of ERK1/2 signaling pathway in this process.\nrTDSCs were subjected to osteogenesis inductive culture in hypoxic (3% O2) and normoxic (20% O2) conditions. The inhibitor U0126 was added along with culture medium to determine the role of ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Cell viability, cell proliferation, alizarin red staining, alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, gene expression (ALP, osteocalcin, collagen I and RUNX2) and protein expression (p-ERK1/2 and RUNX2) of osteogenic-cultured rTSDCs were analyzed in this study.\nHypoxic and normoxic culture had no effects on cell viability of rTDSCs, whereas the proliferation potential of rTDSCs was significantly increased in hypoxic culture. The osteogenesis capacity of rTDSCs in normoxic culture was significantly promoted compared with hypoxic culture, which was reflected by an increased alizarin red staining intensity, an elevated ALP activity, and the up-regulated gene (ALP, osteocalcin, collagen I and RUNX2) or protein (RUNX2) expression of osteogenic makers. However, the osteogenesis capacity of rTDSCs in both hypoxic and normoxic cultures was attenuated by the inhibitor U0126.\nNormoxic culture promotes osteogenic differentiation of rTDSCs compared with the hypoxic culture, and the ERK1/2 signaling pathway is involved in this process.", "journal": "International journal of medical sciences", "date": "2016-08-09", "authors": ["PeiLi", "YuanXu", "YiboGan", "LeiSong", "ChengminZhang", "LiyuanWang", "QiangZhou"], "doi": "10.7150/ijms.16045"}

In the ranibizumab group, the mean gestational age was 26.15\u00b12.08 weeks, with a mean birth weight of 811.15\u00b1287.3 g.

Our hypothesis is that the eventual benefits of carbogen depend on the capacity for vasodilation. We examined, with MRI, changes in fractional cerebral blood volume, blood oxygen saturation, and blood oxygenation level dependent signals in response to carbogen. The analyses were performed in two xenograft models of glioma (U87 and U251) recognized to have different vascular patterns. Carbogen increased fractional cerebral blood volume, blood oxygen saturation, and blood oxygenation level dependent signals in contralateral tissues. In the tumor core and peritumoral regions, changes were dependent on the capacity to vasodilate rather than on resting fractional cerebral blood volume. In the highly vascularised U87 tumor, carbogen induced a greater increase in fractional cerebral blood volume and blood oxygen saturation in comparison to the less vascularized U251 tumor. The blood oxygenation level dependent signal revealed a delayed response in U251 tumors relative to the contralateral tissue. Additionally, we highlight the considerable heterogeneity of fractional cerebral blood volume, blood oxygen saturation, and blood oxygenation level dependent within U251 tumor in which multiple compartments co-exist (tumor core, rim and peritumoral regions).

The paper aims at presenting comprehensive data on all organ transplants, beginning with the first in 1966 (deceased kidney) until the end of\u00a02014.\nSource documents were reports published in Poltransplant Bulletin, a website registry managed by Poltransplant, reports by the Transplantation Council and by the Transplantation Institute of Warsaw. A source data enabled us to establish a preliminary report, presented for verification during the 12th Congress of the Polish Transplantation Society.\nBy the end of 2014, the total number of organ transplants was 26,691. Kidney transplantation is the most common (total number\u00a0= 19,812). The number of living kidney transplants is low, about 50 per year. The number of liver part transplants from living donors is relatively high, 20 to 30 annually. The program of deceased liver transplantation results in more than 300 transplants yearly. The first heart transplantation was in 1985, but the number of these procedures has been decreasing. No significant increase in the number of lung transplantations was noted.\nThe number of organ transplantations from deceased donors places Poland in the middle among European countries. The number of living donor kidney transplants is lower than in other countries; therefore a living donor liver transplantation program belongs to leading programs. Progress of lung transplantation has been slow. The development is highlighted by vascularized composite tissue transplantations of the hands and face.

Alongside the physiological advantage gained in abdominal closure, the authors describe the immunological insight that the skin component can provide and how this contributes to the management of patients. The skin appears to develop a rash with early rejection, which facilitates early systemic treatment before significant visceral rejection occurs. It can also help in cases in which there is diagnostic doubt regarding the cause of bowel dysfunction such as in instances of intestinal infection. Despite the additional immunological burden of donor tissue, there appears to be no requirement for increased immunosuppressive therapy.\nThe technical and immunological feasibility of abdominal wall transplantation has now been demonstrated by several centres.

Because VCA is comprised of different tissues, the sensitivity towards IRI may not be uniform. We, herein, attempt to address mechanistic aspects of IRI in VCA and provide a summary on potential technologies and targets for amelioration or treatment of IRI in this novel field.\nIRI results in a loosened architecture of musculature, hypertrophic, centrally located cell nuclei as well as a high degree of neovascularization. Mitochondria in muscle tissue show a high degree of degeneration after prolonged ischemia whereas the ultrastructure remains normal after short cold ischemia time (CIT). Muscle cell necrosis accompanied by a diffuse inflammatory infiltrate and vasculopathy of small vessels is observed after 30\u200ah of CIT. Nerves revealed a high degree of separation and vacuolization of myelin lamellae because of Wallerian degeneration. Approaches to minimize IRI include use of novel preservation solutions, administration of antioxidative and anti-inflammatory molecules/drugs as well as the implementation of machine perfusion in the setting of VCA.\nHand and face transplantations are logistically challenging procedures.

In this study, a high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)-immobilized material for in situ tissue engineering was prepared to facilitate bone regeneration. The HMGB1-immobilized scaffold accelerated the adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro. Subcutaneous implantation and rat calvarial defect repair experiments proved that the HMGB1-immobilized scaffold induced vascularization and enhanced expression of osteocalcin in vivo. MSCs were recruited into the scaffold, which might due to the high expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1. The bone repair efficiency of the HMGB1-immobilized scaffold was significantly superior to and faster than that of the poly-l-lactide/polycaprolactone nanofibrous scaffold. This research demonstrated the feasibility of using only one pro-inflammatory cytokine HMGB1 as a 'trigger' signal in bone tissue engineering to simultaneously realize multiple functions, including enhancing vascularization, inducing osteogenesis and recruiting stem cells. Consequently, the bone regeneration process was accelerated. The results are of great significance for preparing a new type of scaffold that can promote bone repair in multiple aspects by mimicking a natural manner.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

In this paper, we propose a method to register the immunohistological stainings of serial sections of spleen and bone marrow specimens to enable the visualization and visual inspection of blood vessels. As these vary much in caliber, from mesoscopic (millimeter-range) to microscopic (few micrometers, comparable to a single erythrocyte), we need to utilize a multi-resolution approach. Our method is fully automatic; it is based on feature detection and sparse matching. We utilize a rigid alignment and then a non-rigid deformation, iteratively dealing with increasingly smaller features. Our tool pipeline can already deal with series of complete scans at extremely high resolution, up to 620 megapixels. The improvement presented increases the range of represented details up to smallest capillaries. This paper provides details on the multi-resolution non-rigid registration approach we use. Our application is novel in the way the alignment and subsequent deformations are computed (using features, i.e. \"sparse\"). The deformations are based on all images in the stack (\"global\"). We also present volume renderings and a 3D reconstruction of the vascular network in human spleen and bone marrow on a level not possible before. Our registration makes easy tracking of even smallest blood vessels possible, thus granting experts a better comprehension.

Research has demonstrated the potential of multipotent adult progenitor cells for treating ischemic injury and cardiovascular repair; however, understanding of multipotent adult progenitor cells in orthopedic applications remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the osteogenic and angiogenic capacity of multipotent adult progenitor cells, both in vitro and loaded onto demineralized bone matrix in vivo, with comparison to mesenchymal stem cells, as the current standard. When compared to mesenchymal stem cells, multipotent adult progenitor cells exhibited a more robust angiogenic protein release profile in vitro and developed more extensive vasculature within 2\u2009weeks in vivo. The establishment of this vascular network is critical to the ossification process, as it allows nutrient exchange and provides an influx of osteoprogenitor cells to the wound site. In vitro assays confirmed the multipotency of multipotent adult progenitor cells along mesodermal lineages and demonstrated the enhanced expression of alkaline phosphatase and production of calcium-containing mineral deposits by multipotent adult progenitor cells, necessary precursors for osteogenesis. In combination with a demineralized bone matrix scaffold, multipotent adult progenitor cells demonstrated enhanced revascularization and new bone formation in vivo in an orthotopic defect model when compared to mesenchymal stem cells on demineralized bone matrix or demineralized bone matrix-only control groups. The potent combination of angiogenic and osteogenic properties provided by multipotent adult progenitor cells appears to create a synergistic amplification of the bone healing process.

{"title": "Bone Marrow Immunity and Myelodysplasia.", "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is characterized by an ineffective hematopoiesis with production of aberrant clones and a high cell apoptosis rate in bone marrow (BM). Macrophages are in charge of phagocytosis. Innate Immune cells and specific T cells are in charge of immunosurveillance. Little is known on BM cell recruitment and activity as BM aspirate is frequently contaminated with peripheral blood. But evidences suggest an active role of immune cells in protection against MDS and secondary leukemia. BM CD8(+) CD28(-) CD57(+) T cells are directly cytotoxic and have a distinct cytokine signature in MDS, producing TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CCL3, CCL4, IL-1RA, TNF\u03b1, FAS-L, TRAIL, and so on. These tools promote apoptosis of aberrant cells. On the other hand, they also increase MDS-related cytopenia and myelofibrosis together with TGF\u03b2. IL-32 produced by stromal cells amplifies NK cytotoxicity but also the vicious circle of TNF\u03b1 production. Myeloid-derived suppressing cells (MDSC) are increased in MDS and have ambiguous role in protection/progression of the diseases. CD33 is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells on MDS and might be a potential target for biotherapy. MDS also has impact on immunity and can favor chronic inflammation and emergence of autoimmune disorders. BM is the site of hematopoiesis and thus contains a complex population of cells at different stages of differentiation from stem cells and early engaged precursors up to almost mature cells of each lineage including erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, myelo-monocytic cells (monocyte/macrophage and granulocytes), NK cells, and B cells. Monocytes and B cell finalize their maturation in peripheral tissues or lymph nodes after migration through the blood. On the other hand, T cells develop in thymus and are present in BM only as mature cells, just like other well vascularized tissues. BM precursors have a strong proliferative capacity, which is usually associated with a high risk for genetic errors, cell dysfunction, and consequent cell death.

{"title": "Heme Oxygenase-1 Controls an HDAC4-miR-206 Pathway of Oxidative Stress in Rhabdomyosarcoma.", "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an aggressive soft tissue cancer characterized by disturbed myogenic differentiation. Here we report a role for the oxidative stress response factor HO-1 in progression of RMS. We found that HO-1 was elevated and its effector target miR-206 decreased in RMS cell lines and clinical primary tumors of the more aggressive alveolar phenotype (aRMS). In embryonal RMS (eRMS), HO-1 expression was induced by Pax3/7-FoxO1, an aRMS hallmark oncogene, followed by a drop in miR-206 levels. Inhibition of HO-1 by tin protoporphyrin (SnPP) or siRNA downregulated Pax3/7-FoxO1 target genes and induced a myogenic program in RMS. These effects were not mediated by altered myoD expression; instead, cells with elevated HO-1 produced less reactive oxygen species, resulting in nuclear localization of HDAC4 and miR-206 repression. HO-1 inhibition by SnPP reduced growth and vascularization of RMS tumors in vivo accompanied by induction of miR-206. Effects of SnPP on miR-206 expression and RMS tumor growth were mimicked by pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC. Thus, HO-1 inhibition activates an miR-206-dependent myogenic program in RMS, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of this malignancy.

This study investigated the biochemical and histopathological aspects of the effect of TPP on hyperglycemia-induced retinopathy induced by alloxan in rats.\nThe rats were separated into a diabetic TPP-administered group (DTPG), a diabetes control group (DCG) and a healthy group (HG). While the DTPG was given TPP, the DCG and HG were administered distilled water as a solvent at the same concentrations. This procedure was repeated daily for 3 months. At the end of this period, all of the rats were euthanized under thiopental sodium anesthesia, and biochemical and histopathological analyses of the ocular retinal tissues were performed. The results of the DTPG were compared with those of the DCG and HG.\nTPP prevented hyperglycemia by increasing the amount of malondialdehyde and decreasing endogen antioxidants, including total glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase. In addition, the amounts of the DNA oxidation product 8-hydroxyguanine were significantly lower in the retinas of the DTPG compared to the DCG. In the retinas of the DCG, there was a marked increase in vascular structures and congestion, in addition to edema. In contrast, little vascularization and edema were observed in the DTPG, and there was no congestion.

{"title": "Unexpected outcome of a modification of Bracka repair for proximal hypospadias: High incidence of diverticula with flaps.", "abstract": "Various graft and flap techniques have been proposed for urethral reconstruction in proximal hypospadias repair. The Bracka repair involving the transfer of inner prepuce like a Wolfe graft mostly results in satisfactory results besides a high fistula rate.\nThe aim was to decrease the high fistula rate with Bracka repair; we wanted to use the advantages of vascularized skin in the Bracka method. The aim of this study was to evaluate our results with this modification.\nOur modification involves using a flap instead of a graft. In the first stage, chordee was corrected by transection of the urethral plate and dorsal midline plication when necessary. Instead of a graft as suggested by Bracka, inner preputial skin with ample blood supply was transferred and stitched to the denuded ventral penile surface. In the second stage after 6 months, this flap was tubularized in the Thiersch-Duplay fashion. Hospital records of patients who had undergone two stage modified Bracka repair between June 2007 and July 2012 were reviewed, including complaints, complications, and need for interventions.\nThirty-eight patients had undergone this operation. Four patients were lost to follow-up. The main complaint was obstructed urinary flow. Voiding symptoms were first attributed to urethral stenosis, but were, however, found to be due to diverticulum and vortex of the urine in the dilated urethra. Twenty-one patients (61%) had voiding problems and 10 patients (29%) had urinary tract infections. Fistula was observed in 23 and diverticula were observed in 24 patients. Of these, 16 patients had both fistula and diverticula. Only two patients (5%) were free of complications and totally satisfied with the operation, and 23 of the 34 patients had complications requiring intervention (Figure).\nInner preputial flaps used in proximal hypospadias repairs are prone to diverticula formation.

The complications were analyzed.\nThirty-seven percent of 111 cases showed long term complications. The titanium fracture was the main complication(16%[18/111]), followed by stress-shielding (9%[10/111]), infection(8%[9/111]), and titanium plate exposure(4%[4/111]). Titanium plate fracture occurred within 8 months and 3 years after surgery. The simple titanium plate reconstruction had the highest rate of plate fracture(30%[15/50]). Stress-shielding in non-vascularized bone graft was more significant than that in vascularized bone graft(P<0.05). When replaced by mini-titanium plate, the stress-shielding effect disappeared gradually. When the retention of mandibular margin height was less than 1 cm with the use of reconstruction plate, the postoperative complications were prone to occur.\nBone graft is the best way to reconstruct mandibular defect, and simple reconstruction plate repair is applied only as a transitional means for high degree of malignancy, obvious recurrence tendency tumor or special reasons such as age etc, which are not suitable for bone graft. The reconstruction plate fixation is not recommended for bone graft, especially non-vascularized bone graft.

{"title": "Combination scaffolds of salmon fibrin, hyaluronic acid, and laminin for human neural stem cell and vascular tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSPCs) are good candidates for treating central nervous system (CNS) trauma since they secrete beneficial trophic factors and differentiate into mature CNS cells; however, many cells die after transplantation. This cell death can be ameliorated by inclusion of a biomaterial scaffold, making identification of optimal scaffolds for hNSPCs a critical research focus. We investigated the properties of fibrin-based scaffolds and their effects on hNSPCs and found that fibrin generated from salmon fibrinogen and thrombin stimulates greater hNSPC proliferation than mammalian fibrin. Fibrin scaffolds degrade over the course of a few days in vivo, so we sought to develop a novel scaffold that would retain the beneficial properties of fibrin but degrade more slowly to provide longer support for hNSPCs. We found combination scaffolds of salmon fibrin with interpenetrating networks (IPNs) of hyaluronic acid (HA) with and without laminin polymerize more effectively than fibrin alone and generate compliant hydrogels matching the physical properties of brain tissue. Furthermore, combination scaffolds support hNSPC proliferation and differentiation while significantly attenuating the cell-mediated degradation seen with fibrin alone. HNSPCs express two fibrinogen-binding integrins, \u03b1V\u03b21 and \u03b15\u03b21, and several laminin binding integrins (\u03b17\u03b21, \u03b16\u03b21, \u03b13\u03b21) that can mediate interaction with the scaffold. Lastly, to test the ability of scaffolds to support vascularization, we analyzed human cord blood-derived endothelial cells alone and in co-culture with hNSPCs and found enhanced vessel formation and complexity in co-cultures within combination scaffolds. Overall, combination scaffolds of fibrin, HA, and laminin are excellent biomaterials for hNSPCs.\nInterest has increased recently in the development of biomaterials as neural stem cell transplantation scaffolds to treat central nervous system (CNS) injury since scaffolds improve survival and integration of transplanted cells. We report here on a novel combination scaffold composed of fibrin, hyaluronic acid, and laminin to support human neural stem/progenitor cell (hNSPC) function. This combined biomaterial scaffold has appropriate physical properties for hNSPCs and the CNS, supports hNSPC proliferation and differentiation, and attenuates rapid cell-mediated scaffold degradation. The hNSPCs and scaffold components synergistically encourage new vessel formation from human endothelial cells.

Alternatively, bone-only VCA viability may be maintained in small animal models using surgical angiogenesis from implanted autogenous vessels to develop a neoangiogenic bone circulation that will not be rejected. This study tests the method's efficacy in a large animal model as a bridge to clinical practice, quantifying the remodeling and mechanical properties of porcine tibial VCAs. A segmental tibial defect was reconstructed in Yucatan miniature swine by transplantation of a matched tibia segment from an immunologically mismatched donor. Microsurgical repair of nutrient vessels was performed in all pigs, with simultaneous intramedullary placement of an autogenous arteriovenous (AV) bundle in Group 2. Group 1 served as a no-angiogenesis control. All received 2 weeks of immunosuppression. After 16 weeks, micro-CT and histomorphometric analyses were used to evaluate healing and remodeling. Axial compression and nanoindentation studies evaluated bone mechanical properties. Micro-CT analysis demonstrated significantly more new bone formation and bone remodeling at the distal allotransplant/recipient junction and on the endosteal surfaces of Group 2 tibias (p\u2009=\u20090.03). Elastic modulus and hardness were not adversely affected by angiogenesis. The combination of 2 weeks of immunosuppression and autogenous AV-bundle implantation within a microsurgically transplanted tibial allotransplant permitted long-term allotransplant survival over the study period of 16 weeks in this large animal model.

{"title": "Engineered mesenchymal cell-based patches as controlled VEGF delivery systems to induce extrinsic angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Therapeutic over-expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) by transduced progenitors is a promising strategy to efficiently induce angiogenesis in ischemic tissues (e.g. limb muscle and myocardium), but tight control over the micro-environmental distribution of the dose is required to avoid induction of angioma-like tumors. Therapeutic VEGF release was achieved by purified transduced adipose mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) that homogeneously produce specific VEGF levels, inducing only normal angiogenesis after injection in non-ischemic tissues. However, the therapeutic potential of this approach mostly in the cardiac field is limited by the poor cell survival and the restricted area of effect confined to the cell-injection site. The implantation of cells previously organized in vitro in 3D engineered tissues could overcome these issues. Here we hypothesized that collagen sponge-based construct (patch), generated by ASC expressing controlled VEGF levels, can function as delivery device to induce angiogenesis in surrounding areas (extrinsic vascularization). A 7-mm-thick acellular collagen scaffold (empty), sutured beneath the patch, provided a controlled and reproducible model to clearly investigate the ongoing angiogenesis in subcutaneous mice pockets. VEGF-expressing ASC significantly increased the capillary in-growth inside both the patch itself and the empty scaffold compared to na\u00efve cells, leading to significantly improved survival of implanted cells. These data suggest that this strategy confers control (i) on angiogenesis efficacy and safety by means of ASC expressing therapeutic VEGF levels and (ii) over the treated area through the specific localization in an engineered collagen sponge-based patch.\nDevelopment of efficient pro-angiogenic therapies to restore the micro-vascularization in ischemic tissues is still an open issue. Although extensively investigated, the promising approach based on injections of progenitors transduced to over-express Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) has still several limitations: (i) need of a tight control over the microenvironmental VEGF dose to avoid angioma-like tumor growth; (ii) poor implanted cell survival; (iii) effect area restricted mainly to the injection sites. Here, we aimed to overcome these drawbacks by generating a novel cell-based controlled VEGF delivery device. In particular, transduced mesenchymal cells, purified to release a sustained, safe and efficient VEGF dose, were organized in three-dimensional engineered tissues to improve cell survival and provide a uniform vascularization throughout both the mm-thick implanted constructs themselves and the surrounding area.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-07-30", "authors": ["StefanoBoccardo", "EmanueleGaudiello", "LudovicMelly", "GiuliaCerino", "DavideRicci", "IvanMartin", "FriedrichEckstein", "AndreaBanfi", "AnnaMarsano"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.07.041"}

Clinical and IVCM abnormalities were recorded using a standardized scoring system and statistically compared between dogs with and without SCP. Dogs were split into two groups for analysis; Pugs and non-Pug breeds.\nOf the 57 dogs examined, 32 were Pugs and 25 were non-Pug breeds. Twenty-three Pugs (71.8%) and 10 non-Pugs (40%) displayed SCP. Six of 13 evaluated IVCM features were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with SCP in both Pugs and non-Pugs and included superficial epithelial pigment, basal epithelial pigment, Langerhans cells, anterior stromal dendritic cells, epithelial disorganization, and vascularization. Additionally, superficial epithelial leukocytes and anterior stromal dendritic cells were significantly associated with SCP in Pugs only. Many of the IVCM features associated with SCP were also observed in SCP unaffected dogs; however, they were present at a reduced frequency and confined to the perilimbal region of the cornea.\nBy IVCM, SCP in dogs is characterized by microscopic features of chronic inflammation. Abnormalities were superficial and largely confined to the corneal epithelium.

Here, we demonstrate that ANX2 and PHB also interact in adipocytes. Mice lacking ANX2 have normal WAT vascularization, adipogenesis, and glucose metabolism but display WAT hypotrophy due to reduced fatty acid uptake by WAT endothelium and adipocytes. By using cell culture systems in which ANX2/PHB binding is disrupted either genetically or through treatment with a blocking peptide, we show that fatty acid transport efficiency relies on this protein complex. We also provide evidence that the interaction between ANX2 and PHB mediates fatty acid transport from the endothelium into adipocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate that ANX2 and PHB form a complex with the fatty acid transporter CD36. Finally, we show that the colocalization of PHB and CD36 on adipocyte surface is induced by extracellular fatty acids. Together, our results suggest that an unrecognized biochemical interaction between ANX2 and PHB regulates CD36-mediated fatty acid transport in WAT, thus revealing a new potential pathway for intervention in metabolic diseases.", "journal": "JCI insight", "date": "2016-07-29", "authors": ["AhmadSalameh", "Alexes CDaquinag", "Daniela IStaquicini", "ZhiqiangAn", "Katherine AHajjar", "RenataPasqualini", "WadihArap", "Mikhail GKolonin"], "doi": "10.1172/jci.insight.86351\n10.1038/459340a\n10.1172/JCI45887\n10.1210/en.2007-1713\n10.1074/jbc.M808668200\n10.1007/978-1-59745-261-8_26\n10.1152/physrev.00003.2009\n10.1016/j.cmet.2012.01.004\n10.1016/j.tem.2008.11.001\n10.1172/JCI14596\n10.1038/42408\n10.1021/bi035743m\n10.1152/ajpendo.00259.2007\n10.1038/nature01451\n10.1016/j.tips.2011.01.004\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.05.017\n10.1096/fj.05-5186fje\n10.1038/nm1048\n10.2337/db11-1579\n10.2337/db09-1141\n10.1074/jbc.272.21.13793\n10.1016/j.molmed.2005.02.004\n10.1073/pnas.0407536101\n10.1083/jcb.152.1.165\n10.1073/pnas.1114503108\n10.3390/ijms14036259\n10.1016/S1357-2725(97)00057-5\n10.1055/s-0033-1334143\n10.1371/journal.pone.0034315\n10.1083/jcb.200706072\n10.1172/JCI19684\n10.1007/978-1-59745-245-8_5\n10.1038/ijo.2011.227\n10.1089/ten.tec.2012.0198\n10.1038/nnano.2010.23\n10.1194/jlr.M500112-JLR200\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.05090.x\n10.1074/jbc.M113.473298\n10.1074/jbc.M110970200\n10.2337/db13-1807\n10.1210/en.2011-2071\n10.1073/pnas.1301996110\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-0294\n10.1371/journal.pone.0003452\n10.1182/blood-2005-04-1388\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0212\n10.1073/pnas.1507882112"}

Delivery of the placenta reverses the immediate clinical manifestations and remains the only reliable treatment for PE. Up to now, the causes of PE are not entirely clear. Human cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2, encoded by PTGS2) is a highly inducible enzyme and regulates inflammation, differentiation, mitogenesis, and angiogenesis. COX2 deficiency affects all stages of early pregnancy and leads to various impairments. We hypothesized that COX2 had a role in the occurrence of PE and investigated its expression and function. We found that the expression of COX2 in decidual tissues of PE was significantly lower compared to that of the normal pregnancy. After decidualization stimulation with N6, 2'-O-dibutyryl-cAMP and medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate of human endometrial stromal cells, the expression of COX2, decidualization marker molecules prolactin (PRL) and insulinlike growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) increased significantly. This augmentation was time dependent relative to decidualization. When PTGS2 was depleted, the decidualization was compromised, based on changes in morphology and in decidualization markers. We found that the mRNA and protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) decreased markedly when PTGS2 was knocked down, providing a potential mechanism for decidual impairment. This was consistent with the decrease in mRNA and protein in decidual tissues of PE relative to normal tissues. Our results suggest that COX2 plays a vital role in human decidualization and that its decreased expression jeopardizes decidualization and vascularization of the endometrial stroma; it may be a significant factor in the occurrence of PE.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2016-07-29", "authors": ["DongmeiZhang", "XinlianChang", "JingBai", "Zi-JiangChen", "Wei-PingLi", "CongZhang"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.115.138263"}

Historically, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy complexes are less responsive to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy with no prospective clinical trials evaluating aflibercept in management of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.

Secondary outcome measures included stabilization of vision, presence of subretinal hemorrhage, serous detachment, retinal pigment epithelial detachment, and regression of polypoidal complexes on indocyanine green angiography.\nAt 6\u00a0months, the median visual acuity was 20/40 (range 20/25-20/200) with a mean Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study vision of 68.4 letters. There was a gain of 2.76 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters at 6\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.15).

The present study aimed at evaluating whether the different natural histories and patterns of response to therapy demonstrated for LGSOC and HGSOC, along with a diverse genomic landscape, may also reside in the supporting tumor stroma, specifically in the state of differentiation and activation of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs play complex roles in tumorigenesis since they are believed to possess both tumor rejecting (M1 macrophages) and tumor promoting (M2 macrophages) activities. Here we showed that, when compared to HGSOC (n = 55), LGSOC patients (n = 25) exhibited lower density of tumor-infiltrating CD68+ macrophage, along with an attenuated M2-skewed (CD163+) phenotype. Accordingly, assessment of intratumoral vascularization and of matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression (a key protein involved in tumor invasion and metastasis) revealed lower expression in LGSOC compared to HGSOC patients, in line with emerging evidence supporting a role for TAMs in all aspects of tumor initiation, growth, and development.

{"title": "A pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma subpopulation is sensitive to FK866, an inhibitor of NAMPT.", "abstract": "Treating pancreatic cancer is extremely challenging due to multiple factors, including chemoresistance and poor disease prognosis. Chemoresistance can be explained by: the presence of a dense stromal barrier leading to a lower vascularized condition, therefore limiting drug delivery; the huge intra-tumoral heterogeneity; and the status of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These factors are highly variable between patients making it difficult to predict responses to chemotherapy. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) is the main enzyme responsible for recycling cytosolic NAD+ in hypoxic conditions. FK866 is a noncompetitive specific inhibitor of NAMPT, which has proven anti-tumoral effects, although a clinical advantage has still not been demonstrated. Here, we tested the effect of FK866 on pancreatic cancer-derived primary cell cultures (PCCs), both alone and in combination with three different drugs typically used against this cancer: gemcitabine, 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) and oxaliplatin. The aims of this study were to evaluate the benefit of drug combinations, define groups of sensitivity, and identify a potential biomarker for predicting treatment sensitivity. We performed cell viability tests in the presence of either FK866 alone or in combination with the drugs above-mentioned. We confirmed both inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Interestingly, only the in vitro effect of gemcitabine was influenced by the addition of FK866. We also found that NAMPT mRNA expression levels can predict the sensitivity of cells to FK866. Overall, our results suggest that patients with tumors sensitive to FK866 can be identified using NAMPT mRNA levels as a biomarker and could therefore benefit from a co-treatment of gemcitabine plus FK866.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["MarineBarraud", "JonathanGarnier", "CelineLoncle", "OdileGayet", "CharlotteLequeue", "SophieVasseur", "BenjaminBian", "PaulineDuconseil", "MarineGilabert", "MartinBigonnet", "Aur\u00e9lieMaignan", "VincentMoutardier", "StephaneGarcia", "OlivierTurrini", "Jean-RobertDelpero", "MarcGiovannini", "PhilippeGrandval", "MohamedGasmi", "MehdiOuaissi", "VeroniqueSecq", "FloraPoizat", "NicolasGuibert", "JuanIovanna", "NelsonDusetti"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.10776"}

In this study, we describe a method to investigate microvascular flow anisotropy using a hybrid arterial spin labelling and multi-direction diffusion-weighted MRI sequence. We present evidence that the technique is sensitive to the mean/predominant direction of microvascular flow in localised regions of the rat cortex. The data provide proof of principle for a novel and non-invasive imaging tool to investigate cerebral micro-vascular flow patterns in healthy and disease states.", "journal": "Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["J AWells", "D LThomas", "TSaga", "JKershaw", "IAoki"], "doi": "10.1177/0271678X16660985"}
{"title": "Targeting cellular and microenvironmental multidrug resistance.", "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the major factors restricting the efficacy of chemotherapy. Several pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to MDR, including the overexpression of drug efflux pumps. Strategies to overcome MDR have mostly focused on the modulation of cellular resistance, such as the use of drugs and drug delivery systems to inhibit or bypass drug efflux pumps. Much less attention has been devoted to microenvironmental resistance, both mechanistically and therapeutically. As a reciprocal response to cellular MDR, cancer cells might remodel their microenvironment, resulting in changes in vascularization and oxygenation, as well as in the expression of cell adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix components and matrix metalloproteinases. We here describe the basic principles of cellular and microenvironmental MDR, and discuss drug delivery systems and drug targeting strategies to more efficiently deal with cellular and microenvironmental resistance.", "journal": "Expert opinion on drug delivery", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["OkanTezcan", "TarunOjha", "GertStorm", "FabianKiessling", "TwanLammers"], "doi": "10.1080/17425247.2016.1214570"}

Our previous study corroborated the inhibitory roles of miRNA-451\u00a0(miR-451) in HCC cell growth and invasion. However, its effect on angiogenesis in HCC remains poorly elucidated. In this study, overexpression of miR-451 clearly attenuated the promoting effects of HCC cells on cell proliferation, migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells\u00a0(HUVECs). Importantly, ectopic expression of miR\u2011451 also attenuated tumor growth and angiogenesis in nude mice. In\u00a0vitro, the expression of IL\u20116 receptor\u00a0(IL\u20116R) was reduced and identified as a direct target of miR\u2011451 by bioinformatics and a dual\u2011firefly luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, upregulation of IL\u20116R strikingly ameliorated the inhibitory function of conditioned medium from miR\u2011451\u2011transfected HCC cells in HUVEC proliferation, migration and tube formation. Further mechanistic assay substantiated that miR\u2011451 restrained vascular endothelial growth factor\u00a0(VEGF) production of HCC cells by targeting IL\u20116R\u2011STAT3 signaling as evidenced that IL\u20116R upregulation induced the increase in VEGF levels and interrupting signal transducer and activator of transcription\u00a03\u00a0(STAT3) signaling with ectopic expression of dominant-negative STAT3\u00a0(STAT3D) markedly decreased VEGF expression. Additionally, conditioned medium of miR-451-overexpressed HCC also impaired the VEGF receptor\u00a02\u00a0(VEGFR2) signaling in HUVECs. Accordingly, miR-451 may function as a potential suppressor of tumor angiogenesis in HCC by targeting IL-6R-STAT3-VEGF signaling, suggesting a promising therapeutic avenue for managing HCC.", "journal": "Oncology reports", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["XueminLiu", "AnpengZhang", "JunxiXiang", "YiLv", "XufengZhang"], "doi": "10.3892/or.2016.4971"}
{"title": "Spontaneous In Vivo Chondrogenesis of Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells by Blocking Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Signaling.", "abstract": ": Chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) can be induced by presenting morphogenetic factors or soluble signals but typically suffers from limited efficiency, reproducibility across primary batches, and maintenance of phenotypic stability. Considering the avascular and hypoxic milieu of articular cartilage, we hypothesized that sole inhibition of angiogenesis can provide physiological cues to direct in vivo differentiation of uncommitted MSCs to stable cartilage formation. Human MSCs were retrovirally transduced to express a decoy soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (sFlk1), which efficiently sequesters endogenous VEGF in vivo, seeded on collagen sponges and immediately implanted ectopically in nude mice. Although na\u00efve cells formed vascularized fibrous tissue, sFlk1-MSCs abolished vascular ingrowth into engineered constructs, which efficiently and reproducibly developed into hyaline cartilage. The generated cartilage was phenotypically stable and showed no sign of hypertrophic evolution up to 12 weeks. In vitro analyses indicated that spontaneous chondrogenic differentiation by blockade of angiogenesis was related to the generation of a hypoxic environment, in turn activating the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 pathway. These findings suggest that VEGF blockade is a robust strategy to enhance cartilage repair by endogenous or grafted mesenchymal progenitors. This article outlines the general paradigm of controlling the fate of implanted stem/progenitor cells by engineering their ability to establish specific microenvironmental conditions rather than directly providing individual morphogenic cues.\nChondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) is typically targeted by morphogen delivery, which is often associated with limited efficiency, stability, and robustness. This article proposes a strategy to engineer MSCs with the capacity to establish specific microenvironmental conditions, supporting their own targeted differentiation program. Sole blockade of angiogenesis mediated by transduction for sFlk-1, without delivery of additional morphogens, is sufficient for inducing MSC chondrogenic differentiation. The findings represent a relevant step forward in the field because the method allowed reducing interdonor variability in MSC differentiation efficiency and, importantly, onset of a stable, nonhypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype.", "journal": "Stem cells translational medicine", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["AnnaMarsano", "Carolina MMedeiros da Cunha", "ShahramGhanaati", "SinanGueven", "MatteoCentola", "RomanTsaryk", "MikeBarbeck", "ChiaraStuedle", "AndreaBarbero", "UtaHelmrich", "StefanSchaeren", "James CKirkpatrick", "AndreaBanfi", "IvanMartin"], "doi": "10.5966/sctm.2015-0321"}
{"title": "Fat-Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction Cells Enhance the Bone-Forming Capacity of Devitalized Engineered Hypertrophic Cartilage Matrix.", "abstract": ": Engineered and devitalized hypertrophic cartilage (HC) has been proposed as bone substitute material, potentially combining the features of osteoinductivity, resistance to hypoxia, capacity to attract blood vessels, and customization potential for specific indications. However, in comparison with vital tissues, devitalized HC grafts have reduced efficiency of bone formation and longer remodeling times. We tested the hypothesis that freshly harvested stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells from human adipose tissue-which include mesenchymal, endothelial, and osteoclastic progenitors-enhance devitalized HC remodeling into bone tissue. Human SVF cells isolated from abdominal lipoaspirates were characterized cytofluorimetrically. HC pellets, previously generated by human bone marrow-derived stromal cells and devitalized by freeze/thaw, were embedded in fibrin gel with or without different amounts of SVF cells and implanted either ectopically in nude mice or in 4-mm-diameter calvarial defects in nude rats. In the ectopic model, SVF cells added to devitalized HC directly contributed to endothelial, osteoblastic, and osteoclastic populations. After 12 weeks, the extent of graft vascularization and amount of bone formation increased in a cell-number-dependent fashion (up to, respectively, 2.0-fold and 2.9-fold using 12 million cells per milliliter of gel). Mineralized tissue volume correlated with the number of implanted, SVF-derived endothelial cells (CD31+ CD34+ CD146+). In the calvarial model, SVF activation of HC using 12 million cells per milliliter of gel induced efficient merging among implanted pellets and strongly enhanced (7.3-fold) de novo bone tissue formation within the defects. Our findings outline a bone augmentation strategy based on off-the-shelf devitalized allogeneic HC, intraoperatively activated with autologous SVF cells.\nThis study validates an innovative bone substitute material based on allogeneic hypertrophic cartilage that is engineered, devitalized, stored, and clinically used, together with autologous cells, intraoperatively derived from a lipoaspirate.

Bioactive proteins, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, are proved their osteoinductivity, but their clinical use is currently limited to collagen as biomaterial. Being able to deliver BMP-2 from any other biomaterial would broaden its clinical use. This work presents a novel means for repairing a critical size volumetric bone femoral defect in the rat by combining a osteoinductive surface coating (2D) to a polymeric scaffold (3D hollow tube) made of commercially-available PLGA. Using a polyelectrolyte film as BMP-2 carrier, we tune the amount of BMP-2 loaded in and released from the polyelectrolyte film coating over a large extent by controlling the film crosslinking level and initial concentration of BMP-2 in solution. Using microcomputed tomography and quantitative analysis of the regenerated bone growth kinetics, we show that the amount of newly formed bone and kinetics can be modulated: an effective and fast repair was obtained in 1-2 weeks in the best conditions, including complete defect bridging, formation of vascularized and mineralized bone tissue. Histological staining and high-resolution computed tomography revealed the presence of bone regeneration inside and around the tube with spatially distinct organization for trabecular-like and cortical bones. The amount of cortical bone and its thickness increased with the BMP-2 dose. In view of the recent developments in additive manufacturing techniques, this surface-coating technology may be applied in combination with various types of polymeric or metallic scaffolds to offer new perspectives of bone regeneration in personalized medicine.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["MichaelBouyer", "RaphaelGuillot", "JonathanLavaud", "CedricPlettinx", "C\u00e9cileOlivier", "V\u00e9roniqueCurry", "JeanBoutonnat", "Jean-LucColl", "Fran\u00e7oisePeyrin", "V\u00e9roniqueJosserand", "GeorgesBettega", "CatherinePicart"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.06.001"}

In vitro experiments on human umbilical vein endothelial cells indicated that the statin-loaded TES relieved the high-glucose induced decrease in cell viability and promoted NO synthesis under high-glucose conditions. In a rat model of diabetes, the statin-loaded TES promoted eNOS expression and NO synthesis in/around the regenerated tissues. Subsequently, accelerated vascularization and elevated blood supply were observed, followed by rapid wound healing.

{"title": "KSHV-Mediated Angiogenesis in Tumor Progression.", "abstract": "Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is a malignant human oncovirus belonging to the gamma herpesvirus family. HHV-8 is closely linked to the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and two other B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases: primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and a plasmablastic variant of multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). KS is an invasive tumor of endothelial cells most commonly found in untreated HIV-AIDS or immuno-compromised individuals. KS tumors are highly vascularized and have abnormal, excessive neo-angiogenesis, inflammation, and proliferation of infected endothelial cells. KSHV directly induces angiogenesis in an autocrine and paracrine fashion through a complex interplay of various viral and cellular pro-angiogenic and inflammatory factors. KS is believed to originate due to a combination of KSHV's efficient strategies for evading host immune systems and several pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory stimuli. In addition, KSHV infection of endothelial cells produces a wide array of viral oncoproteins with transforming capabilities that regulate multiple host-signaling pathways involved in the activation of angiogenesis. It is likely that the cellular-signaling pathways of angiogenesis and lymph-angiogenesis modulate the rate of tumorigenesis induction by KSHV. This review summarizes the current knowledge on regulating KSHV-mediated angiogenesis by integrating the findings reported thus far on the roles of host and viral genes in oncogenesis, recent

{"title": "Guided Bone Regeneration With or Without a Collagen Membrane in Rats with Induced Diabetes Mellitus: Histomorphometric and Immunolocalization Analysis of Angiogenesis and Bone Turnover Markers.", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects the processes of repair, wound healing, and bone remodeling. This study was conducted to evaluate autologous bone graft integration, either with or without guided bone regeneration, through analyzing the expression of bone reabsorption markers and neovascularization in rats suffering from DM.\nThirty adult Wistar rats were divided into two groups: The DM group received an injection of alloxan monohydrate (150 mg/kg), and the control group received an injection of sterile saline. Fifteen days afterward, an autologous bone grafting was performed in each of their arches, with the insertion of a membrane into the left arch. Euthanasia occurred in 7, 21, or 60 days after the surgery. Bone samples were processed for histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analyses.\nAfter a statistical analysis of the data, the presence of DM did not interfere negatively in the bone autograft repair. The collagen membrane favored the graft integration into the recipient bed and the bone neoformation around the graft. Greater vascularization was observed between 21 and 60 days after the surgery, which increased bone formation and resulted in the graft integration. Only the RANK marker showed a significant difference in the glycemic groups. Transglutaminase 2 was significant for the membrane presence and experimental time.\nIt is hence concluded that diabetes mellitus does not interfere with bone reabsorption via the RANK/RANKL/OPG. The graft integration was similar between the groups; however, the results of hyperglycemia with the collagen membrane indicate greater bone growth after graft placement.", "journal": "The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants", "date": "2016-07-23", "authors": ["Maria AparecidaJardini", "T\u00e1bata MelloTera", "Augusto AndradeMeyer", "Camilla MagnoniMoretto", "Renata FalchetePrado", "Mauro PedrineSantamaria"], "doi": "10.11607/jomi.4358"}

The purpose of this study is to apply an automated quantitative method for discrimination of different stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR) using conjunctival microvasculature images. Fine structural analysis of conjunctival microvasculature images was performed by ordinary least square regression and Fisher linear discriminant analysis. Conjunctival images between groups of non-diabetic and diabetic subjects at different stages of DR were discriminated. The automated method's discriminate rates were higher than those determined by human observers. The method allowed sensitive and rapid discrimination by assessment of conjunctival microvasculature images and can be potentially useful for DR screening and monitoring.", "journal": "Biomedical optics express", "date": "2016-07-23", "authors": ["Maziyar MKhansari", "WilliamO'Neill", "RichardPenn", "FelixChau", "Norman PBlair", "MahnazShahidi"], "doi": "10.1364/BOE.7.002597\n10.1097/IAE.0b013e3182899326\n10.1109/TBME.2012.2193126\n10.1159/000213638\n10.1136/bjo.2008.149807\n10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2013.1743\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2009.10.047\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2008.05.029\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2010.04.010\n10.1073/pnas.1500185112\n10.1016/j.ajo.2015.04.021\n10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2015.5658\n10.1364/BOE.6.004661\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2005.04.030\n10.1006/mvre.2001.2386\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2008.02.009\n10.4172/2155-9570.1000400\n10.4158/EP.7.5.358\n10.1016/S0161-6420(81)34970-7\n10.2337/db07-0784\n10.1016/j.mvr.2012.10.003\n10.1016/j.mvr.2009.12.003\n10.1097/00007890-199910150-00005\n10.1182/blood.V99.11.3999\n10.1016/j.mvr.2014.01.005"}

{"title": "Shear wave elastography diagnosis of the diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma: A case report.", "abstract": "The present study aimed to report the shear wave elastography (SWE) findings in a patient with the diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (DSVPTC). Since patients with DSVPTC may present with typical clinicopathological features and initially appear to have Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a thorough clinical evaluation and an early diagnosis are important. A 20-year-old female patient presented with a 1-month history of a neck mass and sore throat. Conventional ultrasound and SWE were performed using an AIXPLORER system with 14-5 MHz linear transducer. The patient had undergone total thyroidectomy and bilateral neck lymph node dissection, and an intraoperative pathology consultation to confirm the malignancy of lymph node metastasis. Pathological diagnosis was DSVPTC in both lobes, with lymph node metastases in the bilateral neck. The clinical presentation and serological findings were all indicative of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed diffuse enlargement of the both lobes, heterogenous echogenicity without mass formation, diffuse scattered microcalcifications and poor vascularization.

In total, 1,900 patients that were examined in Gynecological and Cervix Clinic of Maternal and Child Care Service Center of Xuzhou from June 2012 to March 2015 were enrolled in the present study. After admission, the patients underwent TCT, HR-HPV and 3D-CPA examinations, and vascular morphology and typing, vascularization index (VI) were recorded. Colposcopic biopsy was performed in patients with a positive outcome of any of the three indices. Pathological diagnosis was taken as the golden standard to assess the sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic rate, and Youden index of the three methods being used independently or jointly. Of the 1,900 patients, 276 cases (14.53%) were HR-HPV-positive, 214 cases (11.26%) were VI-positive and 164 cases (8.63%) were TCT-positive. A total of 418 cases were confirmed with a positive outcome of any of the three indices and a cervical biopsy was obtained. Of the 418 cases, 162 cases (38.75%) were diagnosed with chronic cervicitis, 146 cases with low-level cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (34.93%), 104 cases (24.88%) with high level CIN, 6 cases (1.44%) with cervical cancer. Histology more than low level CIN was defined as positive: i) screening results when the three methods were used independently: HPV was confirmed with the highest sensitivity (90.63%), VI with the highest specificity (83.95%), and HPV with the highest diagnostic accuracy (83.73%); ii) screening results under HPV+TCT and HPV+TCT+VI: HPV+TCT+VI was confirmed with the highest sensitivity and specificity: sensitivity (94.53%), specificity (81.48%), diagnosis coincidence rate (89.47%) and the highest Youden index of 0.760; and iii) vascular morphology and grading were significantly different in the early stage cervical carcinoma, high level CIM, and cervicitis groups.

The extracts of Inonotus obliquus (Chaga mushroom) demonstrate potent anti-tumor activities and have been used to treat cancer in several countries; however, the actual effect and underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of continuous intake of aqueous extract from I. obliquus on tumor suppression.\nAnticancer activity of the I. obliquus extract was examined in mouse models of Lewis lung carcinoma growth and spontaneous metastasis after 3 weeks of continuous extract intake at the dose of 6 mg/kg/day, which corresponded to that ingested daily with Chaga infusion in Japan.\nThe extract of I. obliquus caused significant tumor suppressive effects in both models. Thus, in tumor-bearing mice, 60% tumor reduction was observed, while in metastatic mice, the number of nodules decreased by 25% compared to the control group. Moreover, I. obliquus extract-treated mice demonstrated the increase in tumor agglomeration and inhibition of vascularization. Interestingly, I. obliquus intake decreased body weight in middle-aged mice and increased body temperature in response to light-dark switching in mature adult mice. Furthermore, I. obliquus prevented temperature drop in mice after tumor implantation.\nOur findings suggest that the I. obliquus extract could be used as a natural remedy for cancer suppression by promoting energy metabolism.", "journal": "Heliyon", "date": "2016-07-22", "authors": ["SatoruArata", "JunWatanabe", "MasakoMaeda", "MasatoYamamoto", "HidetoMatsuhashi", "MamikoMochizuki", "NobuyukiKagami", "KazuhoHonda", "MasahiroInagaki"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2016.e00111"}

Axial, sagittal, and coronal maximum intensity projections were obtained in a subjective comparative evaluation. Asymmetrical versus symmetrical breast vascularity was defined through number of vessels, diameter, and signal intensity.

To overcome this problem, in the last decades, several scaffolding materials have been investigated in the field of adipose tissue engineering. However, a strategy able to recapitulate a suitable environment for adipose tissue reconstruction and maintenance is still missing. To address this need, we adopted a biologically and mechanically driven design to fabricate an RGD-mimetic poly(amidoamine) oligomer macroporous foam (OPAAF) for adipose tissue reconstruction. The scaffold was designed to fulfil three fundamental criteria: capability to induce cell adhesion and proliferation, support of in\u00a0vivo vascularization and match of native tissue mechanical properties. Poly(amidoamine) oligomers were formed into soft scaffolds with hierarchical porosity through a combined free radical polymerization and foaming reaction. OPAAF is characterized by a high water uptake capacity, progressive degradation kinetics and ideal mechanical properties for adipose tissue reconstruction. OPAAF's ability to support cell adhesion, proliferation and adipogenesis was assessed in\u00a0vitro using epithelial, fibroblast and endothelial cells (MDCK, 3T3L1 and HUVEC respectively).

ProPlan CMF surgical planning software was used preoperatively in the virtual planning group. In the virtual planning group, fibula flaps were harvested and osteotomized, and the mandibles were resected and reconstructed assisted by the prefabricated cutting guides and templates. The main outcome measures included the operative time, postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans, facial appearance, and occlusal function. The ischemia time and total operation time were shorter in the virtual planning group than in the conventional surgery group. High precision with the use of the cutting guides and templates was found for both the fibula and mandible, and a good fit was noted among the pre-bent plate, mandible, and fibula segments in the virtual planning group.

{"title": "Leech therapy in flap salvage: Systematic review and practical recommendations.", "abstract": "Medicinal leeches have been part of the therapeutic armamenterium of plastic surgeons for more than 50 years. While their use in hand surgery is a matter of course, their use in salvage of flaps with venous congestion remains facultative depending on teams.\nWe conducted a systematic review of leech therapy for flap salvage between 1960 and 2015, analyzing 121 articles and subsequently taking into consideration 41 studies. In parallel, we collected data from 43 patients for whom leach therapy had recently been applied in treatment of venous insufficiency in pedicled or free flaps after revision surgery had failed to improve flap vascularization, or in cases where flap revision was not appropriate. The data collected pertained to relevant indications, treatment procedure, efficacy, adjuvant therapies, side effects and complications.\nFor this indication, the success rate of leech therapy ranged from 65 to 85% (83.7% in our series) according to the situations encountered. Optimal frequency of application ranged from 2 to 8hours, while average overall duration ranged from 4 to 10 days. The number of leeches to be applied can be determined depending on volume of the flap. In 50% of the cases reported in the literature, the patients required transfusion. Antibiotic prophylaxis against Aeromonas is highly advisable. A ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfametoxazole combination currently appears as the most relevant prophylactic antibiotherapy.\nHirudotherapy is a reliable treatment in cases of patent venous insufficiency of pedicled or free flaps (or when revision surgery is not recommended). Even though the relevant literature is highly heterogeneous, we have attempted to put forward a specific protocol bringing together dosage, delivery route, frequency of administration and appropriate prophylactic antibiotherapy.

{"title": "A role for ion channels in perivascular glioma invasion.", "abstract": "Malignant gliomas are devastating tumors, frequently killing those diagnosed in little over a year. The profuse infiltration of glioma cells into healthy tissue surrounding the main tumor mass is one of the major obstacles limiting the improvement of patient survival. Migration along the abluminal side of blood vessels is one of the salient features of glioma cell invasion. Invading glioma cells are attracted to the vascular network, in part by the neuropeptide bradykinin, where glioma cells actively modify the gliovascular interface and undergo volumetric alterations to navigate the confined space. Critical to these volume modifications is a proposed hydrodynamic model that involves the flux of ions in and out of the cell, followed by osmotically obligated water. Ion and water channels expressed by the glioma cell are essential in this model of invasion and make opportune therapeutic targets. Lastly, there is growing evidence that vascular-associated glioma cells are able to control the vascular tone, presumably to free up space for invasion and growth. The unique mechanisms that enable perivascular glioma invasion may offer critical targets for therapeutic intervention in this devastating disease.

In addition, prenatal environment is known to alter cardiovascular health; however, limited information is available regarding the cerebrovascular consequences of prenatal stress exposure. Vascular disturbances late in life may lead to cerebral hypoperfusion which is linked to a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. The known impact of cerebrovascular compromise on neuronal function and behavior highlights the importance of characterizing the impact of stress on not just neurons and glia, but also cerebrovasculature. Von Willebrand factor has previously been shown to be impacted by prenatal stress and is predictive of cerebrovascular health. Here we assess the impact of prenatal stress on von Willebrand factor and related angiogenic factors. Furthermore, we assess the potential protective effects of concurrent anti-depressant treatment during in utero stress exposure on the assessed cerebrovascular endpoints. Prenatal stress augmented expression of von Willebrand factor which was prevented by concurrent in utero escitalopram treatment. The functional implications of this increase in von Willebrand factor remain elusive, but the presented data demonstrate that although prenatal stress did not independently impact total vascularization, exposure to chronic stress in adulthood decreased blood vessel length. In addition, the current study demonstrates that production of reactive oxygen species in the hippocampus is decreased by prenatal exposure to escitalopram.

{"title": "Predictable Pattern Digital Artery Perforator Flap: An Alternative Concept in Digital Reconstruction.", "abstract": "The proper digital arteries as any other axial vessel give rise to multiple cutaneous perforators either volar or dorsal along their course. Their identification is performed with Doppler flowmetry. The vasculo-cutano-tendino-osseous complex (VCTOC), which was described by the senior authors, was responsible for the vascularization of all digital anatomic structures (extensor apparatus, skin, periosteum). Their consistent appearance to well measured distances from the digital joints led the way to the present clinical study for highlighting this described anatomy in-vivo and demonstrating the predictability in digital artery perforator (DAP) flap harvest.\nFrom November 2012 to March 2014, fifteen patients underwent reconstruction with a predictable pattern digital artery perforator flap (PPDAP), based on the previously described VCTOC mapping, for digital lesions secondary to tumor extirpation. Flaps were designed as V-Y advancement or propeller type. Postoperative control concerned flap viability and digital function.\nSeven males and 8 females underwent elective surgery using PPDAP flaps for digital defects following tumor extirpation. The diameter of the defect ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 cm. The vast majority of the lesions were identified on the right hand, the index, the ring finger and the distal phalanx. All flaps survived without signs of venous congestion. No functional digital problems were observed during follow up (mean of 77 months). A minor wound dehiscence presented in one patient.\nAuthors introduced the concept of a \"predictable pattern\" in the surgery of perforator flaps in the digits. These flaps are reliable and could be a valuable reconstructive option.", "journal": "Hand (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2016-07-16", "authors": ["EpameinondasKostopoulos", "ChristosAgiannidis", "PetrosKonofaos", "AvraamDounavis", "OthonPapadopoulos", "VincentCasoli"], "doi": "10.1177/1558944715614839"}

Recently, a randomized phase 2 study in patients with translocation-related sarcomas unresponsive or intolerable to standard chemotherapy was conducted, which showed clinical benefit of trabectedin compared with best supportive care\u00a0(BSC). Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMCS) and Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (MCS) are very rare malignant soft tissue sarcomas, and are associated with translocations resulting in fusion genes. In addition, the previous in vivo data showed that trabectedin affect tumor necrosis and reduction in vascularization in a xenograft model of a human high-grade chondrosarcoma. The aim of the present analysis was to clarify the efficacy of trabectedin for EMCS and MCS subjects in the randomized phase 2 study.\nFive subjects with EMCS and MCS received trabectedin treatment in the randomized phase 2 study. Three MCS subjects were allocated to the BSC group. Objective response and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by central radiology imaging review.\nThe median follow-up time of the randomized phase 2 study was 22.7\u00a0months, and one subject with MCS was still receiving trabectedin treatment at the final data cutoff. The median PFS was 12.5\u00a0months (95 % CI: 7.4-not reached) in the trabectedin group, while 1.0\u00a0months (95 % CI: 0.3-1.0\u00a0months) in MCS subjects of the BSC group. The six-month progression-free rate was 100\u00a0% in the trabectedin group. One subject with MCS showed partial response, and the others in the trabectedin group showed stable disease. Overall survival of EMCS and MCS subjects was 26.4\u00a0months (range, 10.4-26.4\u00a0months) in the trabectedin group. At the final data cutoff, two of five subjects were still alive.\nThis sub-analysis shows that trabectedin is effective for patients with EMCS and MCS compared with BSC. The efficacy results were better than previously reported data of TRS. These facts suggest that trabectedin become an important choice of treatment for patients with advanced EMCS or MCS who failed or were intolerable to standard chemotherapy.\nThe randomized phase 2 study is registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center, number JapicCTI-121850 (May 31, 2012).", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2016-07-16", "authors": ["HideoMorioka", "ShunjiTakahashi", "NobuhitoAraki", "HideshiSugiura", "TakafumiUeda", "MitsuruTakahashi", "TsukasaYonemoto", "HiroakiHiraga", "ToruHiruma", "ToshiyukiKunisada", "AkihikoMatsumine", "MichiroSusa", "RobertNakayama", "KazumasaNishimoto", "KazutakaKikuta", "KeisukeHoriuchi", "AkiraKawai"], "doi": "10.1186/s12885-016-2511-y\n10.1038/bjc.2014.149\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0848\n10.1593/neo.101202\n10.1016/j.ejca.2005.08.003\n10.1016/j.ejca.2012.05.012\n10.1016/S1470-2045(15)70098-7\n10.1007/s12094-007-0027-2\n10.1111/j.1440-1827.2005.01853.x\n10.1002/gcc.20937\n10.1007/s00402-012-1557-9\n10.1016/S1470-2045(07)70175-4\n10.1016/j.ejca.2015.01.006\n10.1007/s10637-014-0094-5"}

A total of 439 overweight/obese, healthy, postmenopausal women [body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m(2)] ages 50-75 years, recruited between 2005 and 2008 were randomized to a 4-arm 12-month randomized controlled trial, comparing a caloric restriction diet arm (goal: 10% weight loss, N = 118), aerobic exercise arm (225 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous activity, N = 117), a combined diet + exercise arm (N = 117), or control (N = 87) on circulating levels of angiogenic biomarkers. VEGF, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) were measured by immunoassay at baseline and 12 months. Changes were compared using generalized estimating equations, adjusting for baseline BMI, age, and race/ethnicity. Participants randomized to the diet + exercise arms had statistically significantly greater reductions in PAI-1 at 12 months compared with controls (-19.3% vs. +3.48%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Participants randomized to the diet and diet + exercise arms had statistically significantly greater reductions in PEDF (-9.20%, -9.90%, respectively, both P < 0.0001) and VEGF (-8.25%, P = 0.0005; -9.98%, P < 0.0001, respectively) compared with controls. There were no differences in any of the analytes in participants randomized to the exercise arm compared with controls. Increasing weight loss was statistically significantly associated with linear trends of greater reductions in PAI-1, PEDF, and VEGF.

{"title": "Cell-microenvironment interactions and architectures in microvascular systems.", "abstract": "In the past decade, significant advances have been made in the design and optimization of novel biomaterials and microfabrication techniques to generate vascularized tissues. Novel microfluidic systems have facilitated the development and optimization of in vitro models for exploring the complex pathophysiological phenomena that occur inside a microvascular environment. To date, most of these models have focused on engineering of increasingly complex systems, rather than analyzing the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive microvascular network morphogenesis and remodeling. In fact, mutual interactions among endothelial cells (ECs), supporting mural cells and organ-specific cells, as well as between ECs and the extracellular matrix, are key driving forces for vascularization. This review focuses on the integration of materials science, microengineering and vascular biology for the development of in vitro microvascular systems. Various approaches currently being applied to study cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions, as well as biochemical/biophysical cues promoting vascularization and their impact on microvascular network formation, will be identified and discussed. Finally, this review will explore in vitro applications of microvascular systems, in vivo integration of transplanted vascularized tissues, and the important challenges for vascularization and controlling the microcirculatory system within the engineered tissues, especially for microfabrication approaches.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of ASCs on full-thickness skin grafts. Specifically, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of ASCs that are mediated via regulation of the phenotypes of activated macrophages. Methods. ASCs were isolated, cultured, and injected under full-thickness skin grafts in 15 rats (ASC group). An additional 15 rats served as controls (PBS group). Skin graft survival assessment and vascularization detection were assessed with H&E staining and laser Doppler blood flowmetry (LDF). The effects of ASCs on angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, collagen accumulation-promoting, and antiscarring were assessed. Results. We found that the skin graft survival rate was significantly increased in the ASC group. The neovascularization, collagen deposition, collagen type I to type III ratio, and levels of VEGF and TGF-\u03b23 in the ASC group were markedly higher than those in the PBS group at day 14. Additionally, in the ASC group, the levels of iNOS, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 were remarkably decreased, whereas the levels of IL-10 and Arg-1 were substantially increased. Conclusions.

Here we report a novel silk noil-based three-dimensional (3D) nonwoven scaffold produced by carding and needling with no formic acid exposure, which might improve burn healing. Once wetted, it displays human skin-like physical features and a high biocompatibility. Human keratinocyte-like cervical carcinoma C4-I cells seeded onto the carded-needled nonwovens in vitro quickly adhered to them, grew, and actively metabolized glutamine releasing lactate. As on plastic, they released no proinflammatory IL-1\u03b2, although secreting tumor necrosis factor-alpha, an inducer of the autocrine mitogen amphiregulin in such cells. Once grafted into interscapular subcutaneous tissue of mice, carded-needled nonwovens guided the afresh assembly of a connective tissue enveloping the fibroin microfibers and filling the interposed voids within 3 months. Fibroblasts and a few poly- or mononucleated macrophages populated the engineered tissue. Besides, its extracellular matrix contained thin sparse collagen fibrils and a newly formed vascular network whose endothelin-1-expressing endothelial cells grew first on the fibroin microfibrils and later expanded into the intervening matrix. Remarkably, no infiltrates of inflammatory leukocytes and no packed collagen fibers bundles among fibroin microfibers, no fibrous capsules at the grafts periphery, and hence no foreign body response was obtained at the end of 3 months of observation.

But research has yet to explore its potential as an implantable biomaterial for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this study we isolated OVN from egg white by isoelectric precipitation and fabricated scaffolds with tunable porosity by utilizing its foaming property. Gelatin a known biocompatible material was introduced to stabilize the foams, wherein different ratios of OVN and gelatin had a significant effect on the degree of porosity, pore size and stability of the formed hydrogels. The porous scaffolds were crosslinked with EDC resulting in stable scaffolds with prolonged degradation. Improved cell proliferation and adhesion of rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were observed for OVN containing scaffolds. Although, scaffolds with 75% OVN showed decrease in cell proliferation for L929 fibroblast type of cells. Further biocompatibility assessment as implant material was determined by subcutaneous implantation in rats of selected scaffold. H&E staining showed reasonable vascularization over time and little evidence of severe fibrosis at the implant site. Persistent polarization of classically activated macrophage was not observed, potentially reducing inflammatory response, and showed increased expression of alternatively activated macrophage cells that is favorable for tissue repair. Analysis of IgE levels in rat serum after implantation indicated minimal and resolvable allergic response to the OVN implants. The results demonstrate OVN as an acceptable implant scaffold that could provide new opportunities as an alternative natural biocompatible and functional biomaterial in various biomedical applications. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The effect of the addition of nanoparticles to irradiated tissue on the thermal sink behaviour of LBVs was also studied.\nExperiments were performed on a tissue phantom embedded with a simulated blood vessel of 2.2\u2009mm outer diameter (OD)/1.6\u2009mm inner diameter (ID) with a blood flow rate of 10\u2009mL/min. Type I collagen from bovine tendon and agar gel were used as tissue. Two different nanoparticles, gold mesoflowers (AuMS) and graphene nanostructures, were synthesised and characterised. Energy equations incorporating a laser source term based on multiple scattering theories were solved using finite element-based commercial software.\nThe rise in temperature upon NIR irradiation was seen to vary according to the position of the blood vessel and presence of nanoparticles. While the maximum rise in temperature was about 10\u2009\u00b0C for bare tissue, it was 19\u2009\u00b0C for tissue embedded with gold nanostructures and 38\u2009\u00b0C for graphene-embedded tissues. The axial temperature distribution predicted by computational simulation matched the experimental observations.\nA different subsurface temperature distribution has been obtained for different tissue vascular network models.

We show that while LPA caused capillary sprouting and increased vascular length density in adult microvascular networks, LPA did not cause a blood-to-lymphatic phenotypic transition. The results suggest that LPA is not sufficient to cause blood endothelial cells to adopt a lymphatic identity in adult microvascular networks. Similarly, serum stimulation caused robust angiogenesis and increased lymphatic/blood vessel connections, yet did not induce a blood-to-lymphatic phenotypic transition.

First, we studied the effect of chemically cross-linked and photo-cross-linked chitosan-lactide hydrogels on stiffness, degradation rates, and HUVEC behaviors. The photo-cross-linked hydrogel was relatively stiff (E = \u223c15 kPa) and possessed more compact networks, denser surface texture, and lower enzymatic degradation rates than the relatively soft, chemically cross-linked hydrogel (E = \u223c2 kPa). While both hydrogels exhibited nontoxicity, the soft chemically cross-linked hydrogels expedited the formation of cell aggregates compared to the photo-cross-linked hydrogels. Cells on the less stiff, chemically cross-linked hydrogels expressed more matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity than the stiffer, photo-cross-linked hydrogel. This difference in MMP activity resulted in a more dramatic decrease in mechanical stiffness after 3 days of incubation for the chemically cross-linked hydrogel, as compared to the photo-cross-linked one. After determining the physical and biological properties of each hydrogel, we accordingly engineered a dual-layer hydrogel construct consisting of the relatively soft, chemically cross-linked hydrogel layer for HUVEC encapsulation, and the relatively stiff, acellular, photo-cross-linked hydrogel for retention of cell-laden microvasculature above. This dual-layer hydrogel construct enabled a lasting HUVEC aggregate-induced microvascular network due to the combination of stable substrate, enriched cell adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix proteins. We tested the dual-layer hydrogel construct in a mouse model of hind-limb ischemia, where the HUVEC aggregate-induced microvascular networks significantly enhanced blood perfusion rate to ischemic legs and decreased tissue necrosis compared with both no treatment and nonaggregated HUVEC-loaded hydrogels within 2 weeks.

The access to a distal neck requiring an embolization of the internal iliac artery (IIA) may cause buttock claudication, colic ischemia, perineal necrosis, erectile dysfunction, and spinal cord ischemia. The aim of the branched iliac stent grafts is to preserve pelvic vascularization while adapting to the constraints of arterial tortuosity which generate type Ib endoleaks, plications, and limb thromboses. The objective was to analyze and compare the in\u00a0vivo anatomical conformability of the Gore Excluder\nThis was a monocentric retrospective therapeutic study including 13 IBE and 9 ZBIS stent grafts. Three indices of tortuosity were measured with EndoSize: common iliac artery, pelvic artery index (PAI), and the double iliac sign (DIS). The centerline lengths of the iliac axes and the iliac axis and the IIA were measured by 2 different operators as a blind fashion.\nThe interoperator correlation of the measurements was r\u00a0=\u00a00.841 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Twenty-two patients had a high iliac tortuosity: PAI \u2265 1.14 (mean PAI 1.43 [1.16-2.09]). The IBE stent graft modified neither the ipsilateral length nor tortuosity of the common iliac axis or the PAI (P \u2264 0.17, P \u2264 0.16, and P \u2264 0.23, respectively). The ZBIS stent graft significantly modified (P \u2264 0.02) the length and the tortuosity measured by the PAI compared with the IBE group (P \u2264 0.02). The use of IBE or ZBIS did not modify the postoperative length of the IIA (P \u2264 0.34). Three patients of the IBE group presented one DIS. Postoperatively, they did not present any DIS without significant modification of the postoperative PAI (P \u2264 0.07).\nIn patients with a severe iliac tortuosity, the IBE Gore branched iliac stent graft is more conformable than the ZBIS Cook.

{"title": "Mechanical and Vascular Cues Synergistically Enhance Osteogenesis in Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells.", "abstract": "Development and maintenance of a vascular network are critical for bone growth and homeostasis; strategies that promote vascular function are critical for clinical success of tissue-engineered bone constructs. Co-culture of endothelial cells (ECs) with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and exposure to 10% cyclic tensile strain have both been shown to regulate osteogenesis in isolation, but potential synergistic effects have yet to be explored. The objective of this study was to expose an MSC-EC co-culture to 10% cyclic tensile strain to examine the role of this mechanical stimulus on MSC-EC behavior. We hypothesized that paracrine signaling from ECs would stimulate osteogenesis of MSCs, and exposure to 10% cyclic tensile strain would enhance this anabolic signal. Human umbilical vein ECs and human bone marrow-derived MSCs were either monocultured or co-cultured at a 1:1 ratio in a mixed osteo/angiogenic medium, exposed to 10% cyclic tensile strain at 1\u2009Hz for 4\u2009h/day for 2 weeks, and biochemically and histologically analyzed for endothelial and osteogenic markers. While neither 10% cyclic tensile strain nor co-culture alone had a significant effect on osteogenesis, the concurrent application of strain to an MSC-EC co-culture resulted in a significant increase in calcium accretion and mineral deposition, suggesting that co-culture and strain synergistically enhance osteogenesis. Neither co-culture, 10% cyclic tensile strain, nor a combination of these stimuli affected endothelial markers, indicating that the endothelial phenotype remained stable, but unresponsive to the stimuli evaluated in this study. This study is the first to investigate the role of cyclic tensile strain on the complex interplay between ECs and MSCs in co-culture.

Myonecrosis and tissue anoxia induced by vascularization impairment can lead to amputation or motor functional deficit. The objective of this study was to investigate the dynamic behavior of motor function in mice subjected to injection of Bothrops jararacussu venom (Bjssu) and exposed to low-level laser therapy (LLLT). Male Swiss mice received Bjssu injection (830 \u03bcg/kg) into the medial portion of the right gastrocnemius muscle. Three hours later the injected region was irradiated with diode semiconductor Gallium Arsenide (GaAs- 904 nm, 4 J/cm\u00b2) laser following by irradiation at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Saline injection (0.9% NaCl) was used as control. Gait analysis was performed 24 hours before Bjssu injection and at every period post-Bjssu using CatWalk method. Data from spatiotemporal parameters Stand, Maximum Intensity, Swing, Swing Speed, Stride Length and Step Cycle were considered. The period of 3 hours post venom-induced injury was considered critical for all parameters evaluated in the right hindlimb. Differences (p<0.05) were concentrated in venom and venom + placebo laser groups during the 3 hours post-injury period, in which the values of stand of most animals were null. After this period, the gait characteristics were re-established for all parameters.

{"title": "Functional Modification of Fibrous PCL Scaffolds with Fusion Protein VEGF-HGFI Enhanced Cellularization and Vascularization.", "abstract": "The lack of efficient vascularization within frequently used poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds has hindered their application in tissue engineering. Hydrophobin HGFI, an amphiphilic protein, can form a self-assembly layer on the surface of PCL scaffolds and convert their wettability. In this study, a fusion protein consisting of HGFI and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is prepared by Pichia pastoris expression system. Sodium dodecyl sulface-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting confirm that the VEGF-HGFI is successfully isolated and purified. Transmission electron microscope and water contact angle measurement demonstrate that VEGF-HGFI can form a self-assembly layer with about 25 nm in thickness on electrospun PCL fibers and increase their hydrophilicity. VEGF-HGFI modification can effectively enhance the adhesion, migration, and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging shows that the VEGF-HGFI modification on PCL scaffolds can exist at least 21 d in vitro and at least 14 d in vivo. Bioluminescence imaging shows that VEGF-HGFI can effectively activate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 receptors. Subcutaneous implantation in mice and rats reveal that cellularization and vascularization are significantly improved in VEGF-HGFI modified PCL scaffolds. These results suggest that VEGF-HGFI is a useful molecule for functional modification of scaffolds to enhance cellularization and vascularization in tissue engineering.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2016-07-09", "authors": ["LiqiangZhao", "ShaoyangMa", "YiwaPan", "QiuyingZhang", "KaiWang", "DongminSong", "XiangxiangWang", "GuoweiFeng", "RumingLiu", "HaijinXu", "JunZhang", "MingqiangQiao", "DelingKong"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201600226"}
{"title": "The Freestyle Facial Artery Perforator Flap for Reconstruction of Simultaneous Periorbital and Cheek Defects.", "abstract": "The reconstruction of defects involving the nasolabial, paranasal, and periorbital regions may be challenging, because they often involve more than one facial aesthetic unit, and can lead to functional problems. An average of 5 facial artery perforators of caliber >0.5\u200amm can be found above the mandible. A reference point for the location of the most constantly encountered perforator was suggested as being 1.5\u200acm lateral to the oral commissure, and at its same level in height or slightly inferior to the commissure. Based on injection studies, it is known that these perforators can supply an average area of 8\u200acm. The authors have extended the use of the freestyle perforator flap in a 87-year-old woman presented with an advanced melanoma of the paranasal area and nasolabial region (Breslow depth: 9\u200amm; Clark level V). Complete resection of the lesion with 3\u200acm oncological margins was performed. One-stage reconstruction with superior cosmetic results was achieved. The need for a perforator dissection is not necessarily a drawback, and classic concerns should be abandoned. The face is highly vascularized, and flap congestion is a rare event, usually a consequence of excessive pedicle trimming.

Inhibition of CDK5 has been shown to have anti-angiogenic effects in vitro and in vivo. However, potent inhibitors of CDK5, which can be applied in vivo, are still scarce. We have recently developed a new series of 5-substituted 3-isopropyl-7-[4-(2-pyridyl)benzyl]amino-1(2)H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidines that show a preference for inhibiting CDK5 and tested them in vitro and in vivo in a murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma.\nAll compounds were initially examined for effects on proliferation of HUVECs. The most potent compounds were then tested on migration, and one of them, LGR2674, was selected for assessing effects on nuclear fragmentation, cell cycle, cell viability and metabolic activity. Furthermore, LGR2674 was tested in a tube formation assay and in vivo in a murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma, induced by s.c. injection of HUH7 cells (measurement of in vivo toxicity, tumour vascularization, tumour cell proliferation and tumour size).\nLGR2674 showed an EC50 in the low nanomolar range in the proliferation and migration assays. Cytotoxic effects started at 50\u00a0nM, a concentration that did not influence the cell cycle. In vivo, LGR2674 was well tolerated and caused a clear reduction in vessel density in the tumours; also tumour cell proliferation was inhibited and tumour growth retarded.\nPyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine is a novel scaffold for the development of potent CDK inhibitors with in vivo potential.

{"title": "Hyperthermia of magnetic nanoparticles allows passage of sodium fluorescein and Evans blue dye across the blood-retinal barrier.", "abstract": "The blood-retina barrier (BRB) is a biological barrier consisting of tightly interconnected endothelial cells inside the retinal vascular network that protects the neural tissue from harmful pathogens and neurotoxic molecules circulating in the bloodstream. Unfortunately, with regard to retinoblastoma, this barrier also prevents systemically administered therapeutics reaching the retinal tissue. In this study we introduce a novel technique to locally and transiently increase BRB permeability for drug delivery using hyperthermia of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs).\nAn alternating current (AC) magnetic field was used to induce hyperthermia of locally injected MNPs in the left ophthalmic artery of a rat model. To improve adherence on the surface of the endothelium, commercially available MNPs coated with human transferrin glycoproteins were used. After hyperthermia we assessed the extravasation of systemically injected sodium fluorescein (NaF) as well as Evans blue dye (EBD) into the retinal tissue.\nSpectrofluorometry and fluorescent microscopy image analysis show a significant increase of dye penetration in the retina where hyperthermia of MNPs was applied.\nOur proposed new technique can allow both small and large dye molecules to cross the BRB.

{"title": "Neuroinflammation and Behavior in HIV-1 Transgenic Rats Exposed to Chronic Adolescent Stress.", "abstract": "Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved prognosis for people living with HIV (PLWH) and dramatically reduced the incidence of AIDS. However, even when viral load is controlled, PLWH develop psychiatric and neurological disorders more frequently than those living without HIV. Adolescents with HIV are particularly susceptible to the development of psychiatric illnesses and neurocognitive impairments. While both psychiatric and neurocognitive disorders have been found to be exacerbated by stress, the extent to which chronic stress and HIV-1 viral proteins interact to impact behavior and relevant neuroinflammatory processes is unknown. Determination of the individual contributions of stress and HIV to neuropsychiatric disorders is heavily confounded in humans. In order to isolate the influence of HIV-1 proteins and chronic stress on behavior and neuroinflammation, we employed the HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) rat model, which expresses HIV-1 proteins with a gag and pol deletion, allowing for viral protein expression without viral replication. This Tg line has been characterized as a model of HAART-controlled HIV-1 infection due to the lack of viral replication but continued presence of HIV-1 proteins. We exposed male and female adolescent HIV-1 Tg rats to a mixed-modality chronic stress paradigm consisting of isolation, social defeat and restraint, and assessed behavior, cerebral vascularization, and neuroinflammatory endpoints. Stress, sex, and presence of the HIV-1 transgene impacted weight gain in adolescent rats. Female HIV-1 Tg rats showed decreases in central tendency during the light cycle in the open field regardless of stress exposure. Both male and female HIV-1 Tg rats exhibited decreased investigative behavior in the novel object recognition task, but no memory impairments. Adolescent stress had no effect on the tested behaviors. Microglia in female HIV-1 Tg rats exhibited a hyper-ramified structure, and gene expression of complement factor B was increased in the hippocampus. In addition, adolescent stress exposure increased microglial branching and junctions in female wild-type rats without causing any additional increase in HIV-1 rats. These data suggest that the presence of HIV-1 proteins during development leads to alterations in behavioral and neuroinflammatory endpoints that are not further impacted by concurrent chronic adolescent stress.", "journal": "Frontiers in psychiatry", "date": "2016-07-06", "authors": ["Sydney ARowson", "Constance SHarrell", "MandakhBekhbat", "ApoorvaGangavelli", "Matthew JWu", "Sean DKelly", "RenukaReddy", "Gretchen NNeigh"], "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00102\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60604-8\n10.1212/WNL.0b013e318200d727\n10.4088/JCP.10m06304\n10.1212/01.WNL.0000038347.48137.67\n10.1001/archneur.1997.00550160054016\n10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02069.x\n10.1097/QAD.0b013e32832d924f\n10.1097/QAI.0b013e3181d90e8c\n10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.3333\n10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00426-3\n10.4088/JCP.v69n1011\n10.3109/13550280903350200\n10.2174/157016212802138788\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2012.10.008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0108399\n10.1186/1750-1326-9-26\n10.1073/pnas.161290298\n10.1016/j.jneuroim.2009.09.014\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00028.x\n10.1186/1742-6405-5-8\n10.1016/j.yhbeh.2011.03.011\n10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.05.001\n10.1016/j.bbi.2013.01.075\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.12.002\n10.1073/pnas.0406344101\n10.1016/j.bbr.2013.04.003\n10.1007/s11481-007-9078-y\n10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.01.001\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.02.011\n10.1016/S0306-4522(97)00413-2\n10.1016/S0301-0082(98)00069-0\n10.1093/cercor/bhs151\n10.1038/jcbfm.2010.46\n10.1021/pr070220c\n10.1128/JVI.76.7.3179-3188.2002\n10.1034/j.1600-0404.2000.101002116.x\n10.3109/08820139109050792\n10.1093/intimm/3.4.403\n10.1016/j.neuron.2014.11.018\n10.1073/pnas.1107936108\n10.1371/journal.pone.0061046\n10.1385/NI:2:3:303\n10.4161/cib.27670\n10.1371/journal.pone.0059582"}

Bone tissue engineering requires scaffolds with structural properties and functionality similar to the natural bone. Inspired by bone, a collagen-apatite (Col-Ap) nanocomposite was fabricated with bonelike subfibrillar nanostructures using a modified bottom-up biomimetic approach and has a potential role in the healing of large bone defects in unresolved apical periodontitis.\nThe bone regeneration potential of the Col-Ap nanocomposite was investigated by comparing it with inorganic beta-tricalcium phosphate and organic pure collagen using a critical-sized rodent mandibular defect model. Micro-computed tomographic imaging and histologic staining were used to evaluate new bone formation in\u00a0vivo.\nWhen compared with the beta-tricalcium phosphate and collagen scaffolds, the Col-Ap nanocomposite scaffold exhibited superior regeneration properties characterized by profuse deposition of new bony structures and vascularization at the defect center. Immunohistochemistry showed that the transcription factor osterix and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 were highly expressed in the Col-Ap group. The results indicate that the Col-Ap nanocomposite activates more bone-forming cells and stimulates more vascular tissue ingrowth. Furthermore, the Col-Ap nanocomposite induces extracellular matrix secretion and mineralization of rat bone marrow stem cells. The increased expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 may contribute to the formation of a mineralized extracellular matrix.\nThe present study lays the foundation for the development of Col-Ap nanocomposite-based bone grafts for future clinical applications in bone regeneration of large periapical lesions after apical curettage or apicoectomy.", "journal": "Journal of endodontics", "date": "2016-07-06", "authors": ["ShuaiLiu", "YueSun", "YuFu", "DatongChang", "CuicuiFu", "GaonanWang", "YanLiu", "Franklin RTay", "YanhengZhou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joen.2016.04.027"}

IKs were prepared by isolating islets from 70% partial pancreatectomies and injecting them beneath the autologous renal capsule of five rhesus monkey donors at least 3 months before allogeneic IK Tx. HSC Tx was performed after mobilization and leukapheresis of the donors and conditioning of the recipients with total body irradiation, T cell depletion, and cyclosporine. One IK was harvested for histologic analysis and four were transplanted into diabetic recipients. IK Tx was performed either 20-22 (n = 3) or 208 (n = 1) days after HSC Tx. All animals accepted IKs without rejection. All recipients required >20 U/day insulin before IK Tx to maintain <200 mg/dL, whereas after IK Tx, three animals required minimal doses of insulin (1-3 U/day) and one animal was insulin free.

The aim of this study was to investigate if in\u00a0vitro and CAM culture could be used as short-term systems to study cat ovarian tissue development. The ovaries of eight cats were dissected into 3-mm(3) cubes, cultured in\u00a0vitro and in CAM for up to 5\u00a0days, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Gomori trichrome. Cell proliferation was analyzed using anti-Ki67. Possible differences among groups were investigated by analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Bonferroni correction. The T-test or Wilcoxon test was used to verify differences between the CAM and IVC. Results revealed that 87.5% of all follicles were primordial during culture. The percentage of primordial follicles in the morphologically normal follicles (MNF) pool was always higher than 80%, with the exception of Day 3 of CAM culture, but the number of MNF reduced significantly from Day 0 (600 out of 777 follicles) to Day 5 in the CAM (91 out of 171) and IVC (296 out of 686). The number of primordial follicles in 1\u00a0mm(3) in Days 2, 3, and 5 in the CAM was significantly lower than that in the control (Day 0). No cellular proliferation was observed in culture. Vascularization occurred in the CAM culture, but with no association to follicular viability. In addition, both methods showed an increase in connective tissue during culture. Although no significant differences were observed in the percentage of MNF, there was a reduction in the total number of follicles, both for IVC and CAM-cultured ovarian tissue. Furthermore, anti-Ki67 did not stain any follicle after Day 0 in IVC or in CAM culture. Neither system was capable of promoting follicle growth and/or development.

VEGF, a key regulator of angiogenesis, it would seem essential to take action during the embryonic development of the dental germ. The purpose of the study is to investigate the importance of the enzymatic activity of VEGF through protein quantification at different stages of tooth germ development.\nThe quantification of VEGF protein was performed by 3 different laboratory tests: Western-blot analysis, semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-PCR) and finally immunohistochemical analysis. Cell cultures of tooth tissue examined are: endothelial cells, stellate reticulum cells, odontoblasts and ameoblast.\nThe VEGF peptide seems to induce an intense cell proliferation, not concomitant with differentiation towards the endothelial line. The expression of VEGF in the inner enamel epithelium (ameloblasts) would seem to depend on the stage of differentiation, leading us to deduce that VEGF and its respective receptor are expressed in dental germ and that induce alterations not only on the vascularization, but also on the inner epithelium activation and then on dental enamel development, respectively on cap and bell stages of embryogenesis.\nIn our survey, the positive expression of VEGF in all the samples examined, might suggest a fundamental role of angiogenic gene proteins during all stages of embryonic tooth development. It is also characteristic the behavior of stellate reticulum cells, with a significant reduction in VEGF action between early and late stage, which could suggest a possible role of stellate reticulum cells, which would be able to promote and maintain an adequate energy supply to the tissues during early and late stages of differentiation and proliferation.", "journal": "Minerva stomatologica", "date": "2016-07-05", "authors": ["FilibertoMastrangelo", "Maria TSberna", "RaffaeleVinci", "GiovanniIaderosa", "LuciaTettamanti", "GiuseppeCantatore", "AngeloTagliabue", "Enrico FGherlone"], "doi": null}

As part of a survey of reptilian fetal membranes, we used scanning electron microscopy to study fetal membrane morphology in the oviparous Pueblan milksnake, Lampropeltis triangulum campbelli. The chorioallantois initially is an avascular structure lined by enlarged chorionic and allantoic epithelia. Upon vascularization, the chorionic epithelium becomes greatly attenuated, enhancing the potential for gas exchange; the allantoic epithelium also flattens. The bilaminar omphalopleure of the yolk sac lacks blood vessels, but it becomes vascularized by allantoic capillaries and transformed into an omphalallantois. Upon regression of the isolated yolk mass, this membrane is converted to chorioallantois, equipping it for gas exchange. Allantoic fluid serves as a water reservoir, and we postulate that it facilitates water uptake by establishing an osmotic gradient. Early in development, epithelia of both the chorion and the omphalopleure show apical microvilli that greatly increase the cell surface area available for water uptake. However, these features are incompatible with gas exchange and are lost as oxygen needs take precedence. A comparison of the fetal membranes to those of other squamate species (both oviparous and viviparous) reveals characteristics that are probably ancestral for snakes, some of which are plesiomorphic for Squamata. The widespread phylogenetic distribution of these features reflects their utility as adaptations that serve functional requirements of squamate embryos.", "journal": "Journal of experimental zoology.

All defects were reconstructed with a LTIMF based on the transverse cervical artery.\nMean follow-up was 16.5 months (ranging from 5 to 30 months). No major flap failure occurred; minor complications in three patients including lateral superficial skin necrosis were easily handled. In all patients, excellent functional and aesthetic results were achieved.\nThe lower trapezius island myocutaneous flap represents a reliable treatment option to cover complicated defects located between the craniocervical and cervicothoracic junction following wound disturbance after spinal surgery.", "journal": "Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery", "date": "2016-07-04", "authors": ["Jan DRaguse", "MarcusCzabanka", "Jan OliverVoss", "StefanHartwig", "PeterVajkoczy", "PitVoss", "ChristianDoll"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcms.2016.06.005"}

Here, using endothelial progenitor outgrowth cells (EPOCs) as the typical ADCs, a gelatin-based micro-cavitary gel (namely Gel-MCG) is developed with gelatin-methacrylate and gelatin microspheres as precursor and porogens, respectively, to promote cellular focal adhesion and functions. The introduction of micro-cavitary structures within the Gel-MCG improves its physical properties as well as creates numerous gel-microcavity interfaces within gel-based matrices. Compared with conventional gelatin gel (Gel-G) scaffold, the Gel-MCG provides more suitable microenvironments for EPOCs' attachment, spreading, and proliferation, and then which leads to enhanced endothelial differentiation and vascularization as demonstrated by higher expressions of endothelial markers.

{"title": "The Role of Relaxin in Normal and Abnormal Uterine Function During the Menstrual Cycle and Early Pregnancy.", "abstract": "The hormone relaxin is a 6-kDa peptide with high structural similarity to insulin. It is primarily produced by the corpus luteum during pregnancy but is also synthesized by other reproductive organs such as the uterus, decidua, and placenta. Relaxin binds to its receptor RXFP1, which has been localized to a wide variety of reproductive and nonreproductive tissues. The peptide's many uterotropic effects include stimulating uterine growth and vascularization, remodeling extracellular matrix components, and regulating vascular endothelial growth factor in preparation for implantation. Evidence also supports a role for relaxin in the systemic maternal vascular adaptations required for a healthy pregnancy. Diminished relaxin levels in early pregnancy are linked with increased risks of miscarriage and the development of preeclampsia. In addition to pregnancy, relaxin may also play a functional role in the uterus during the menstrual cycle, and modified relaxin activity may contribute to gynecological disorders such as uterine fibrosis and endometriosis. Despite over 75 years of research, we still have a limited understanding of relaxin's broad roles in the uterus, particularly as there are significant species differences in its synthesis and activity, which restricts the use of animal models for human-centric questions. Here, we review current knowledge regarding relaxin actions in the human uterus during the menstrual cycle and in early pregnancy, with a focus on its potential roles in various gynecological disorders, as well as the pregnancy disorders such as preeclampsia, recurrent miscarriage, and early pregnancy loss.", "journal": "Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)", "date": "2016-07-02", "authors": ["Sarah AMarshall", "Sevvandi NSenadheera", "Laura JParry", "Jane EGirling"], "doi": "10.1177/1933719116657189"}

It is possible to harvest a flap with the same skin paddle, vascularized by a septo-cutaneous perforator running through the tensor fascia lata muscle septum and coming from the ascending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery. The DIEP is currently the workhorse of autologous breast reconstruction, but there are some contraindications. The septo-cutaneous tensor fascia latae perforator flap may be an alternative for women with lateral upper thigh lipodystrophy. Between 2010 and 2014, three flaps have been performed in two patients for delayed breast reconstruction (one case of unilateral reconstruction, and one bilateral). Perforators were identified by preoperative angiography. The intervention was performed in a two-team approach, in only one operative position. Perforators were located in the horizontal axis of the upper rim of the pubis bone. One perforator artery was dissected for each flap. The mean caliber of the pedicle was 2.8mm, and the mean length was 6.4cm. The operative time was 240minutes for unilateral flap, 375minutes for bilateral flap. There was no case of total or partial necrosis, or complications on the donor site. Cosmetic results were considered satisfying by patients and surgeons with the reconstructed breast as well as the donor site. Septo-cutaneous fascia lata perforator flap is an attractive flap for breast reconstruction in patients with DIEP contraindication and lateral upper thigh lipodystrophy. It has many advantages: easy to harvest, length and calibre of the pedicle, double team approach, only one operating position, quality of reconstruction.

The study analysed patients undergoing CEA between January 2009 and December 2014 from 100 UK NHS hospitals. Data were collected on patient characteristics, intervals of time from symptoms to surgery, and 30-day postoperative outcomes. The relationship between outcomes and time from symptom to surgery was evaluated using multilevel multivariable logistic regression.\nIn 23,235 patients, the median time from TIA/stroke to CEA decreased over time, from 22 days (IQR 10-56) in 2009 to 12 days (IQR 7-26) in 2014. The proportion of patients treated within 14 days increased from 37% to 58%. This improvement was produced by shorter times across the care pathway: symptoms to referral, from medical review to being seen by a vascular surgeon, and then to surgery. The spread of the median time from symptom to surgery among NHS hospitals shrank between 2009 and 2013 but then grew slightly. Low-, medium-, and high-volume NHS hospitals all improved their performance similarly. Performing CEA within 48\u00a0h of symptom onset was associated with a small increase in the 30-day stroke and death rate: 3.1% (0-2 days) compared with 2.0% (3-7 days); adjusted odds ratio 1.64 (95% CI 1.04-2.59) but not with longer delays.\nThe delay from symptom to CEA in symptomatic patients with ipsilateral 50-99% carotid stenoses has reduced substantially, although 42% of patients underwent CEA after the recommended 14 days.

{"title": "Tyrosine Phosphatase PTPRJ/DEP-1 Is an Essential Promoter of Vascular Permeability, Angiogenesis, and Tumor Progression.", "abstract": "The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRJ/DEP-1 has been implicated in negative growth regulation in endothelial cells, where its expression varies at transitions between proliferation and contact inhibition. However, in the same cells, DEP-1 has also been implicated in VEGF-dependent Src activation, permeability, and capillary formation, suggesting a positive role in regulating these functions. To resolve this dichotomy in vivo, we investigated postnatal angiogenesis and vascular permeability in a DEP-1-deficient mouse. In this study, we report that DEP-1 is required for Src activation and phosphorylation of its endothelial cell-specific substrate, VE-cadherin, after systemic injection of VEGF. Accordingly, VEGF-induced vascular leakage was abrogated in the DEP-1-deficient mice. Furthermore, capillary formation was impaired in murine aortic tissue rings or Matrigel plugs infused with VEGF. In the absence of DEP-1, angiogenesis triggered by ischemia or during tumor formation was defective, which in the latter case was associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Macrophage infiltration was also impaired, reflecting reduced vascular permeability in the tumors or a possible cell autonomous effect of DEP-1. Consequently, the formation of spontaneous and experimental lung metastases was strongly decreased in DEP-1-deficient mice. In clinical specimens of cancer, less vascularized tumors exhibited lower microvascular expression of DEP-1. Altogether, our results established DEP-1 as an essential driver of VEGF-dependent permeability, angiogenesis, and metastasis, suggesting a novel therapeutic route to cancer treatment.

{"title": "Exocrine drainage in vascularized pancreas transplantation in the new millennium.", "abstract": "The history of vascularized pancreas transplantation largely parallels developments in immunosuppression and technical refinements in transplant surgery. From the late-1980s to 1995, most pancreas transplants were whole organ pancreatic grafts with insulin delivery to the iliac vein and diversion of the pancreatic ductal secretions to the urinary bladder (systemic-bladder technique). The advent of bladder drainage revolutionized the safety and improved the success of pancreas transplantation. However, starting in 1995, a seismic change occurred from bladder to bowel exocrine drainage coincident with improvements in immunosuppression, preservation techniques, diagnostic monitoring, general medical care, and the success and frequency of enteric conversion. In the new millennium, pancreas transplants are performed predominantly as pancreatico-duodenal grafts with enteric diversion of the pancreatic ductal secretions coupled with iliac vein provision of insulin (systemic-enteric technique) although the systemic-bladder technique endures as a preferred alternative in selected cases. In the early 1990s, a novel technique of venous drainage into the superior mesenteric vein combined with bowel exocrine diversion (portal-enteric technique) was designed and subsequently refined over the next \u2265 20 years to re-create the natural physiology of the pancreas with first-pass hepatic processing of insulin. Enteric drainage usually refers to jejunal or ileal diversion of the exocrine secretions either with a primary enteric anastomosis or with an additional Roux limb. The portal-enteric technique has spawned a number of newer and revisited techniques of enteric exocrine drainage including duodenal or gastric diversion. Reports in the literature suggest no differences in pancreas transplant outcomes irrespective of type of either venous or exocrine diversion. The purpose of this review is to examine the literature on exocrine drainage in the new millennium (the purported \"enteric drainage\" era) with special attention to technical variations and nuances in vascularized pancreas transplantation that have been proposed and studied in this time period.", "journal": "World journal of transplantation", "date": "2016-07-01", "authors": ["HanyEl-Hennawy", "Robert JStratta", "FowlerSmith"], "doi": "10.5500/wjt.v6.i2.255"}

{"title": "A tunable hydrogel system for long-term release of cell-secreted cytokines and bioprinted in situ wound cell delivery.", "abstract": "For many cellular therapies being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials, the mechanisms behind their therapeutic effects appear to be the secretion of growth factors and cytokines, also known as paracrine activity. Often, delivered cells are transient, and half-lives of the growth factors that they secrete are short, limiting their long-term effectiveness. The goal of this study was to optimize a hydrogel system capable of in situ cell delivery that could sequester and release growth factors secreted from those cells after the cells were no longer present. Here, we demonstrate the use of a fast photocross-linkable heparin-conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA-HP) hydrogel as a cell delivery vehicle for sustained growth factor release, which extends paracrine activity. The hydrogel could be modulated through cross-linking geometries and heparinization to support sustained release proteins and heparin-binding growth factors. To test the hydrogel in vivo, we used it to deliver amniotic fluid-derived stem (AFS) cells, which are known to secrete cytokines and growth factors, in full thickness skin wounds in a nu/nu murine model. Despite transience of the AFS cells in vivo, the HA-HP hydrogel with AFS cells improved wound closure and reepithelialization and increased vascularization and production of extracellular matrix in vivo. These results suggest that HA-HP hydrogel has the potential to prolong the paracrine activity of cells, thereby increasing their therapeutic effectiveness in wound healing. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In 10 animals the reconstruction of sciatic nerve was realized with VNG; in 10 control animals the reconstruction of sciatic nerve was realized with NNG.\nThe VNG group showed a better axonal organization and a significantly higher number of regenerated axons in the early phases (after 30\u00a0days) than the NNG group, whereas the difference in the axonal number at day 90 was less significant; besides, the axon diameter and the myelin thickness were not significantly improved by VNG group.\nOur data suggests that the use of VNG leads to a faster regeneration process and a better functional recovery, although the final results are comparable to those of the NNG. VNG improve the quality of the axonal regeneration (axonal diameter and Schwann cells), although the increase in the axonal number is not significant and does not improve the long-term functional outcome.", "journal": "Neurological research", "date": "2016-06-29", "authors": ["RenatoDonzelli", "CrescenzoCapone", "Francesco GiovanniSgul\u00f2", "GiuseppeMariniello", "FrancescoMaiuri"], "doi": "10.1080/01616412.2016.1198527"}
{"title": "Increased bone formation in a rabbit long-bone defect model after single local and single systemic application of erythropoietin.", "abstract": "Background and purpose - Delayed bone healing with non-union is a common problem. Further options to increase bone healing together with surgery are needed. We therefore evaluated a 1-dose single application of erythropoietin (EPO), applied either locally to the defect or systemically during surgery, in a critical-size rabbit long-bone defect. Material and methods - 19 New Zealand White rabbits received a 15-mm defect in the radius diaphysis. An absorbable gelatin sponge was soaked with saline (control group and systemic treatment group) or EPO (local treatment group) and implanted into the gap. The systemic treatment group received EPO subcutaneously. In vivo micro-CT analysis was performed 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Vascularization was evaluated histologically. Results - Semiquantitative histomorphometric and radiological evaluation showed increased bone formation (2.3- to 2.5-fold) in both treatment groups after 12 weeks compared to the controls. Quantitative determination of bone volume and tissue volume showed superior bone healing after EPO treatment at all follow-up time points, with the highest values after 12 weeks in locally treated animals (3.0- to 3.4-fold). More vascularization was found in both EPO treatment groups. Interpretation - Initial single dosing with EPO was sufficient to increase bone healing substantially after 12 weeks of follow-up. Local application inside the defect was most effective, and it can be administered directly during surgery. Apart from effects on ossification, systemic and local EPO treatment leads to increased callus vascularization.", "journal": "Acta orthopaedica", "date": "2016-06-28", "authors": ["Georg WOmlor", "KerstinKleinschmidt", "SimoneGantz", "AnjaSpeicher", "ThorstenGuehring", "WiltrudRichter"], "doi": "10.1080/17453674.2016.1198200"}

The strategy of developing and executing a clinical transplant was derived on the basis of fostering a cohesive and supportive institutional clinical environment, implementing computer software and advanced technology, establishing a cadaveric transplant model, performing a research facial procurement, and selecting an optimal candidate with the aforementioned burn defect who was well informed and had the desire to undergo face transplantation.\nApproval from the institutional review board and organ procurement organization enabled our face transplant team to successfully perform a total face, eyelids, ears, scalp, and skeletal subunit transplant in a 41-year-old man with a full face and total scalp burn.\nThe culmination of knowledge attained from previous experiences continues to influence the progression of facial vascularized composite allotransplantation. This surgical endeavor methodically and effectively synchronized the fundamental principles of aesthetic, craniofacial, and microvascular surgery to restore appearance and function to a patient suffering from failed conventional surgery for full face and total scalp burns.

Despite availability of a large assortment of wound coverage options, the etiology of wound healing is rather complex leading to significant defects in skin repair. The use of cell-mediated treatment approaches in combination with bioengineered wound coverage constructs may provide the missing tool to improve wound healing outcomes. In this study, we have used an engineered 3D PEGylated fibrin (P-fibrin) gel as a scaffold for adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) delivery into the burn injury model. We were able to confirm the presence of ASCs in the wound site two weeks after the initial injury. Delivery of ASCs-containing gels was associated with improved vascularization of the injured area at early time points accompanied by an increased abundance of mannose receptor expressing cells. Moreover, the application of P-fibrin biomaterial exhibited positive effects on early mononuclear cell recruitment and granulation tissue formation without negatively affecting wound closure kinetics or extent of connective tissue deposition.

In the present paper, we demonstrate that DEET specifically stimulates endothelial cells that promote angiogenesis which increases tumor growth. DEET activates cellular processes that lead to angiogenesis including proliferation, migration and adhesion. This is associated with an enhancement of NO production and VEGF expression in endothelial cells. M3 silencing or the use of a pharmacological M3 inhibitor abrogates all of these effects which reveals that DEET-induced angiogenesis is M3 sensitive. The experiments involving calcium signals in both endothelial and HEK cells overexpressing M3 receptors, as well as binding and docking studies demonstrate that DEET acts as an allosteric modulator of the M3 receptor.

The aim of this study was to follow up on this observation in the absence of the confounding factors of diabetes in non-diabetic Shh-Cre-eGFP/Ptch1-LacZ mice; in this mouse, expression of GFP and \u03b2-Gal is consistent with the transcription patterns of Shh and its receptor patched 1 (Ptch1), respectively. In agreement with studies in diabetic males, MAA beads improved vascularization in large (15\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0mm) wounds in non-diabetic males at day 7. Shh pathway activation was suggested, as the numbers of GFP+ (Shh) and \u03b2-Gal+ (Ptch1, a target of the pathway) cells increased in the granulation tissue. Shh signaling pathway modulation was also suggested in the healthy skin surrounding the wound bed, as evidenced by an increase in the number of GFP+ and \u03b2-Gal+\u00a0cells in males at day 4. Gene expression analysis of the wounds confirmed increase in Ptch1 and showed the upregulation of a downstream transcription factor Gli3, involved in the vascular effect of the Shh pathway, implicating the pathway in the effect of MAA beads. The efficacy of MAA beads was also investigated in females; MAA beads modulated the Shh pathway within granulation tissue similarly as in males, but had no enhancement effect on the healthy skin and on vascularization.

BPD is characterized by an arrest in lung development with marked impairment of alveolar septation and vascular development. The reasons underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes in premature neonates are not known. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that male neonatal mice will be more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury and will display larger arrest in lung alveolarization. Neonatal male and female mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to hyperoxia [95% FiO2, postnatal day (PND) 1-5] and euthanized on PND 7 and 21. Extent of alveolarization, pulmonary vascularization, inflammation, and modulation of the NF-\u03baB pathway were determined and compared with room air controls. Macrophage and neutrophil infiltration was significantly increased in hyperoxia-exposed animals but was increased to a larger extent in males compared with females. Lung morphometry showed a higher mean linear intercept (MLI) and a lower radial alveolar count (RAC) and therefore greater arrest in lung development in male mice. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the expression of markers of angiogenesis (PECAM1 and VEGFR2) in males after hyperoxia exposure compared with females. Interestingly, female mice showed increased activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway in the lungs compared with males. These results support the hypothesis that sex plays a crucial role in hyperoxia-mediated lung injury in this model.

Thus, this study is designed to investigate the effect of 'shunt-restriction' location on venous congestion and flap perfusion in a 'shunt-restricted' arterialized venous flap (AVF).\nAbdominal flaps based on the thoracoepigastric vessels of Sprague-Dawley rats were raised. The inferior epigastric vein was repaired to the femoral artery in order to create an AVF. The superior epigastric vein was preserved for drainage. Microcirculation and laser Doppler flowmetry results were compared between AVFs with 'shunt restriction' at a proximal third (SR-proximal) distance and 'shunt restriction' at a distal third (SR-distal) distance.\nBidirectional sluggish flow was detected at the proximal part of venous flaps in both groups. Unidirectional normal flow was observed in more capillaries of the distal flaps in the SR-proximal group. In the middle of the flaps, blood flow was sluggish and intermittent in the veins and was absent in most capillaries of the SR-distal group. The flow was prompt and unidirectional in more capillaries of the SR-proximal group. Using laser Doppler flowmetry, the average perfusion of the whole SR-proximal flaps was found to be higher than that of SR-distal flaps (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017). The average flux at the middle and distal portions of the SR-proximal group was significantly higher than those of the SR-distal group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049).\n'Shunt restriction' at the proximal third of the AV shunt resulted in enhanced perfusion and reduced venous congestion in an AVF.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2016-06-23", "authors": ["Yu-TeLin", "Chung-ChengHsu", "Cheng-HungLin", "Charles Yuen YungLoh", "Chih-HungLin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2016.05.013"}

Treatments including surgery, radio- and chemo-therapies mostly result in debilitating side effects. Thus, a more accurate evaluation of patients at risk of recurrence after radio/chemo treatment is important for preserving their quality of life. We assessed whether the Telomeric Repeat-binding Factor 2 (TERF2) influences tumor aggressiveness and treatment response. TERF2 is over-expressed in many cancers but its correlation to patient outcome remains controversial in OSCC. Our retrospective study on sixty-two patients showed that TERF2 overexpression has a negative impact on survival time. TERF2-dependent survival time was independent of tumor size in a multivariate analysis. In vitro, TERF2 knockdown by RNA interference had no effect on cell proliferation, migration, senescence and apoptosis. Instead, TERF2 knockdown increased the expression of cytokines implicated in inflammation and angiogenesis, except for vascular endothelial growth factor. TERF2 knockdown resulted in a decrease vascularization and growth of xenograft tumors. Finally, response to erlotinib/Tarceva and cetuximab/Erbitux treatment was increased in TRF2 knocked-down cells. Hence, TERF2 may represent an independent marker of survival for OSCC and a predictive marker for cetuximab/Erbitux and erlotinib/Tarceva efficacy.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-06-23", "authors": ["YordanBenhamou", "VincentPicco", "H\u00e9l\u00e8neRaybaud", "AnneSudaka", "EmmanuelChamorey", "SanjaBrolih", "MartinoMonteverde", "MarcoMerlano", "CristianaLo Nigro", "DamienAmbrosetti", "GillesPag\u00e8s"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.10005"}

Here, we study bioengineered vascularized constructs as a therapeutic modality for diabetic wound healing. We developed a wound model in immunodeficient rodent and treated it with engineered vascularized constructs from endothelial progenitors or early vascular cells-derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) reprogrammed either from healthy donor or type-1 diabetic patient. We found that all vascularized constructs expedited wound closure and reperfusion, with endothelial progenitor constructs having the earliest maximum closure rate followed closely by healthy and diabetic hiPSC-derivative constructs. This was accompanied by rapid granulation layer formation and regression in all vascularized construct groups. Macrophage infiltration into the hydrogel matrix occurred during early stages of healing, seeming to facilitate rapid neovascularization of the wound that could then better persist in the vascularized constructs. Blood perfusion of the human vasculature could be detected after three days, indicating rapid integration with the host vasculature.

In this work, we investigated angiogenesis in 3D scaffolds by in vivo multiphoton microscopy during bone formation in a murine calvarial critical bone defect model and evaluated bone regeneration 8weeks post-implantation. The continuous release of bioactive lentiviral vectors (LV-pdgfb) from the scaffolds could be detected for 5days in vitro. In vivo, the released LV-pdgfb transfected adjacent cells and expressed PDGF-BB, facilitating angiogenesis and enhancing bone regeneration. The expression of both pdgfb and the angiogenesis-related genes vWF and VEGFR2 was significantly increased in the pdgfb gene-carrying scaffold (PHp) group. In addition, microCT scanning and histomorphology results proved that there was more new bone ingrowth in the PHp group than in the PLGA/nHA (PH) and control groups. MicroCT parameters, including BMD, BV/TV, Tb.Sp, and Tb.N indicated that there was significantly more new bone formation in the PHp group than in the other groups.

Therefore, the goal of our present study was to determine if autophagy is involved in early placental development after transfer of in vitro produced (IVP) embryos. To do this, placentae obtained following transfer of IVP sheep embryos were compared with placentae obtained after natural mating (control-CTR). The placentae were collected on day 20 post-fertilization and post-mating, respectively, and were analyzed using molecular (qPCR), ultrastructural and histological/immunological approaches. Our results show drastically increased autophagy in IVP placentae: high levels of expression (p<0.05) of canonical markers of cellular autophagy and a high proportion of autophagic cells (35.08%; p<0.001) were observed.

Whereas histology can give excellent insight into material and tissue remodeling, longitudinal studies are hampered by the invasive character. Noninvasive imaging techniques, which allow longitudinal studies in the same individual and provide functional information, might be beneficial. In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied as a noninvasive tool to monitor the progress of vasculogenesis and inosculation in in vitro prevascularized collagen/fibrin templates implanted in mice during a period of 4 weeks. MRI results were compared with histological findings to evaluate whether the two technologies were complementary and to evaluate the added value of MRI. When in vitro prevascularized templates were implanted in mice, histological analysis showed the presence of mouse blood cells in the engineered vessels 2 weeks after implantation. The MR images showed that template perfusion, a measure of vascularity, became significant at 3 weeks.

We demonstrate that stimulation of FZD2 by Wnt3a and Wnt5a regulates \u03b2-catenin-dependent and -independent Wnt signaling factors. FZD2 blockade suppressed \u03b2-catenin-dependent signaling activity and increased phosphorylation of PKC, AKT and ERK in vitro, consistent with upregulation of \u03b2-catenin-independent signaling activity.

Since miRNAs regulate several cell processes, including angiogenesis, we sought to determine whether they would influence PGE-2-induced VEGF. We compared DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells bearing the mPGES-1 enzyme (mPGES-1+/+) and producing PGE-2, with those in which the enzyme was silenced or deleted (mPGES-1-/-). We demonstrated that mPGES-1/PGE-2 signaling decreased Dicer expression and miRNA biogenesis. Genome-wide sequencing of miRNAs revealed that miR-15a and miR-186, associated with expression of VEGF and hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), were down-regulated in mPGES-1+/+ cells. As a consequence, mPGES-1+/+ tumor cells expressed high levels of VEGF and HIF-1\u03b1, induced endothelial cells activation and formed highly vascularized tumors. Mir-186 mimic inhibited VEGF expression in mPGES-1+/+ tumor xenografts and reduced tumor growth. In human prostate cancer specimens, mPGES-1 was over-expressed in tumors with high Gleason score, elevated expression of VEGF and HIF-1\u03b1, high microvessel density and decreased expression of Dicer, miR15a and miR-186.

A gene pathway analysis concluded that four functional categories were significant, of which angiogenesis and elastic fibre formation were up-regulated in the suprabranchial chamber, indicating that the aerial breathing organ may be more efficient for gas exchange due to its highly vascularized and elastic structure. In contrast, ion uptake and transport and acid-base balance were up-regulated in the gill, indicating that the aquatic breathing organ functions in ion homeostasis and acid-base balance, in addition to breathing.

In vivo single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography revealed bone remodeling and mineralization inside the mandibular transplant during prefabrication and after transplantation. Reconstruction was possible without any further modifications of the graft. A histological evaluation revealed that large sections of the Bio-Oss material were covered with osteoid matrix 3 months after transplantation. The quality of life of the patient significantly increased with acquisition of the ability to masticate and the improvement in pronunciation and aesthetics. Heterotopic bone induction to form a mandibular replacement inside the gastrocolic omentum is possible in human subjects. Heterotopic prefabrication is associated with many advantages, like allowing a reduced operative burden compared with conventional techniques and good three-dimensional outcomes.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "The immunomodulator decoy receptor 3 improves locomotor functional recovery after spinal cord injury.", "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes loss of neurons and axons and results in motor and sensory function impairments. SCI elicits an inflammatory response and induces the infiltration of immune cells, predominantly macrophages, to the injured site. Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), also known as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member (TNFRSF)-6B, is a pleiotropic immunomodulator capable of inducing macrophage differentiation into the M2 phenotype and enhancing angiogenesis. Because M2 macrophages are crucial for the recovery of impaired motor functions, we ask whether DcR3 is beneficial for the functional recovery of locomotion in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats after SCI.\nContusion injury of the spinal cord was performed using a New York University impactor at the ninth thoracic vertebrae, followed by intrathecal injection of 15\u00a0\u03bcg recombinant protein comprising DcR3 (DcR3.Fc) in 5\u00a0\u03bcl of normal saline as the treatment, or 5\u00a0\u03bcl of normal saline as the control, into the injury epicenter. Functional recovery was evaluated using an open-field test weekly up to 6\u00a0weeks after injury. The cavity size and myelin sparing in the rostral-to-caudal region, including the epicenter of the injury, were then examined in SCI rats by histological staining. The expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the presence of M2 macrophages were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry at 7\u00a0day after SCI. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Student's t test.\nIntrathecal administration of DcR3.Fc significantly improved locomotor function and reduced secondary injury with a smaller wound cavity and increased myelin sparing at the lesion site. Compared with the control group, DcR3.Fc-treated rats had increased vascularization at the injury epicenter along with higher levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 and lower level of IL-1\u03b2 on DcR3.Fc-treated rats at day 7 after SCI. Moreover, higher levels of arginase I (Arg I) and CD206 (M2 macrophage markers) and RECA-1 (endothelial marker) were observed in the epicenter on day 7 after SCI by immunofluorescence staining.\nThese results indicated that DcR3.Fc may promote the M2 macrophage infiltration and enhanced angiogenesis at the lesion site, thus preserving a greater amount of spinal cord tissues and enhancing functional recovery after SCI.", "journal": "Journal of neuroinflammation", "date": "2016-06-19", "authors": ["Chuan-WenChiu", "Wen-HungHuang", "Shao-JiLin", "May-JywanTsai", "HsuMa", "Shie-LiangHsieh", "HenrichCheng"], "doi": "10.1186/s12974-016-0623-6\n10.1002/ca.22432\n10.4252/wjsc.v6.i2.120\n10.1016/j.pneurobio.2005.12.004\n10.1038/nrn2398\n10.1002/jnr.21659\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2014.05.001\n10.1002/path.4106\n10.1126/science.273.5274.510\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2592-10.2011\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.02.167\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1151-09.2009\n10.1016/j.brainres.2014.12.045\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3257-09.2009\n10.1016/j.bcp.2011.01.011\n10.1038/25387\n10.1074/jbc.274.20.13733\n10.1016/S1074-7613(02)00283-2\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-0609\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00629.x\n10.4049/jimmunol.176.1.173\n10.4049/jimmunol.168.10.4846\n10.1182/blood-2007-09-114850\n10.1189/jlb.0903448\n10.1182/blood-2007-12-130609\n10.4049/jimmunol.1101101\n10.1007/s00109-015-1291-1\n10.1002/jnr.10303\n10.1006/exnr.1996.0098\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4306-11.2011\n10.1111/j.1365-2818.1988.tb04603.x\n10.3389/fneur.2015.00108\n10.1186/1742-2094-9-224\n10.4049/jimmunol.175.8.5135\n10.1089/neu.2012.2651\n10.1006/exnr.2000.7604\n10.1038/nri2711\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1146-14.2014\n10.1097/BRS.0b013e31815b7e6b\n10.1089/neu.2005.22.529\n10.1007/s10456-013-9381-6\n10.1089/neu.2010.1423\n10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.11.002\n10.1016/j.brainres.2012.01.045\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2927-14.2014"}

Surgical interventions for bone repair are required for varied reasons such as trauma resulting non-union fractures, or diseases including osteoporosis or osteonecrosis. Autologous bone grafting is the gold standard in bone regeneration but it requires a second surgery with associated pain and complications, and is also limited by harvested bone quantity. Synthetic bone substitutes lack the osteoinductive properties to heal large bone defects. Cell therapies based on bone marrow or ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) in association with synthetic calcium phosphate (CaP) bone substitutes may be alternatives to autologous bone grafting. This manuscript reviews the different conventional biological and synthetic bone grafting procedures as well as the more recently introduced cell therapy approaches used in orthopaedic surgery for bone regeneration. Some clinical studies have demonstrated safety and efficacy of these approaches but regeneration of large bone defects remain challenging due to the absence of rapid and adequate vascularisation. Future directions in the field of bone regeneration are presented, such as testing alternative cell sources or in situ fabrication of vascularized bone grafts in patients.", "journal": "Current research in translational medicine", "date": "2016-06-19", "authors": ["JStanovici", "L-RLe Nail", "M ABrennan", "LVidal", "VTrichet", "PRosset", "PLayrolle"], "doi": "10.1016/j.retram.2016.04.006"}

Herein, we analyzed whether this vasculogenic process is regulated by estrogen. Estrogen- and vehicle-treated human EPCs were analyzed for migration and tube formation. Endometriotic lesions were induced in irradiated FVB/N mice, which were reconstituted with bone marrow from FVB/N-TgN (Tie2/green fluorescent protein) 287 Sato mice. The animals were treated with 100 \u03bcg/kg \u03b2-estradiol 17-valerate or vehicle (control) over 7 and 28 days. Lesion growth, cyst formation, homing of green fluorescent protein(+)/Tie2(+) EPCs, vascularization, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were analyzed by high-resolution ultrasonography, caliper measurements, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Numbers of blood circulating EPCs were assessed by flow cytometry. In\u00a0vitro, estrogen-treated EPCs exhibited a higher migratory and tube-forming capacity when compared with controls. In\u00a0vivo, numbers of circulating EPCs were not affected by estrogen. However, estrogen significantly increased the number of EPCs incorporated into the lesions' microvasculature, resulting in an improved early vascularization. Estrogen further stimulated the growth of lesions, which exhibited massively dilated glands with a flattened layer of stroma. This was mainly because of an increased glandular secretory activity, whereas cell proliferation and apoptosis were not markedly affected.

In HD patients CHI may be related to three main conditions: obstruction of the big upper limb arteries, obstruction of the small hand and finger arteries, and the steal effect of a hemodialysis access. The aim of this study was to describe the angiographic pattern of upper limb vascularization and associated cardiovascular risk factors, in a large cohort of consecutive HD patients with CHI studied in our center.\nIn our center 114 HD consecutive patients (age 64\u00b110 years) with a total of 132 upper limbs affected by CHI (21 with rest pain and 93 with tissue loss) underwent angiography in our center.

{"title": "Recent trends in the treatment of benign odontogenic tumors.", "abstract": "The management of benign, locally aggressive odontogenic tumors, namely, keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KOTs) and ameloblastomas, can be challenging. The purpose of this article is to briefly summarize important features of these lesions and review recent trends in the literature regarding their treatment.\nCurrently, KOTs are frequently treated with a conservative approach consisting of enucleation and adjuvant decompression or local microablation with peripheral ostectomies, Carnoy's solution, or cryotherapy. Conversely, ameloblastomas generally require marginal or segmental resection followed by reconstruction using local bone regeneration techniques or vascularized osteocutaneous free flaps, respectively. Bone regeneration techniques have improved with the use of autogenous progenitor cells held in place by autogenous or alloplastic scaffolding. Esthetic results for free flap reconstruction have improved with the use of inconspicuous surgical approaches utilizing intraoral or rhytidectomy incisions. Molecular markers for both neoplasms are being investigated as potential targets for chemotherapeutic agents.\nExcluding hamartomas (i.e., odontomas), KOTs and ameloblastomas are the most common benign odontogenic lesions. Their management is often complicated by their locally infiltrative behavior, responsible for high rates of recurrence. Simple enucleation or excision of these lesions has proven insufficient. When left untreated, these lesions are capable of causing severe disfigurement and loss of function.

Despite adequate initial surgery, 20 to 30\u00a0% of patients will develop local recurrence or metastasis during follow-up. Usual clinical and pathology parameters tend to classify most patients in an intermediate prognosis group, and molecular markers to determine prognosis more accurately are needed. A key feature of CCRCC is its abundant vascularization. Factors that upregulate angiogenesis, such as hypoxia and the presence of immune cells including macrophages, also modulate tumour proliferation and metastasis. We studied angiogenesis, as defined by nestin-positive capillaries, and tumour infiltration by macrophages especially in the good prognosis pT1 subgroup of CCRCC. We assessed whether these parameters are associated with metastatic extension and survival in CCRCC. The expression of HIF1\u03b1, CAIX, nestin, CD68 and CD163 was assessed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing tissue samples from 257 consecutive patients with sporadic CCRCC. Factors associated with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed. The presence of nestin-positive tumour vessels was independently associated with shorter PFS in the whole cohort and in the pT1 subgroup. The presence of tumour-infiltrating macrophages was independently associated with shorter OS in the whole cohort and in the pT1 subgroup. The presence of nestin-positive endothelial cells is associated with early relapse, especially in the pT1 subgroup and may help to select patients for antiangiogenic treatment.

Payload-bearing poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) NPs were converted into polymer-iron-oxide nanocomposites (PINCs) by attaching colloidal Fe3O4 onto the surface, via a simple surface modification method using dopamine polymerization. PINCs formed stable dispersions in serum-supplemented medium and responded quickly to magnetic field gradients above 1\u00a0kG/cm. Under the field gradients, PINCs were rapidly transported across physical barriers and into cells and captured under flow conditions similar to those encountered in postcapillary venules, increasing the local concentration by nearly three orders of magnitude. In\u00a0vivo magnetophoretic delivery enabled PINCs to accumulate in poorly vascularized subcutaneous SKOV3 xenografts that did not support the EPR effect.

According to the WHO definition, an atypical uterine myoma cannot be histologically unambiguously diagnosed as benign or malignant. Atypical leiomyomas are characterized by moderate or high quantity of pleomorphic atypical tumor cells, with a small number of mitotic divisions and lack of coagulative necrosis in the tumor. They have a low rate of extrauterine, intraabdominal recurrence, with a negligible risk for distant metastases. Due to the fact the atypical variant of leiomyomas is very rare, it presents a significant diagnostic challenge for obstetricians. The most reliable diagnosis can be made only on the basis of the histopathological examination. In this paper, we present a case of a patient in whom an echo with the diameter of 92 mm and a heterogeneous echogenicity with visible anechoic fields were discovered in the uterine fundus. HD color Doppler demonstrated high vascularization within the tumor, peripherally as well as centrally. The peripheral and central vascularization was rated at 4/4 points on a scale by Exacoustos. The tumor in the uterus met the criteria of high probability of malignancy i.e. 8 points on the vascular scale (power Doppler scale \u2265 7 pts.), solid tumor and a size over 8 cm.

Deletion of Fibulin-5 in mice results in enhanced skin vascularization and upregulation of the angiogenesis factor angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), suggesting that Fibulin-5 functions as an angiogenesis inhibitor. In this study, we investigate the inhibitory effects of Fibulin-5 on Ang-1/TIE-2 receptor pathway signaling and cell survival in human endothelial cells.\nRecombinant wild-type and RGE-mutant Fibulin-5 proteins were generated through stable transfection of HEK293 and CHO cells, respectively. In vitro solid phase binding assays using pure proteins revealed that wild-type Fibulin-5 does not bind to Ang-1 or TIE-2 proteins but strongly binds to heparin. Binding assays using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) indicated that wild-type Fibulin-5 strongly binds to cells but RGE-mutant Fibulin-5, which is incapable of binding to integrins, does not. Pre-incubation of HUVECs for 1 hr with Fibulin-5 significantly increased caspase 3/7 activity, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and expressions of the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR1) and the dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5). Fibulin-5 also strongly attenuated Ang-1-induced TIE-2 and AKT phosphorylation, decreased Ang-1-induced expressions of the transcription factors Inhibitor of DNA Binding 1 (ID1) and Kruppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2), and reversed the inhibitory effect of Ang-1 on serum deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and caspase 3/7 activity.\nWe conclude that Fibulin-5 strongly binds to the endothelial cell surface through heparin-sulfate proteoglycans and possibly integrins and that it exerts strong anti-angiogenic effects by reducing endothelial cell viability and interfering with the signaling pathways of the Ang-1/TIE-2 receptor axis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-06-16", "authors": ["WilsonChan", "HodanIsmail", "DominiqueMayaki", "VeronicaSanchez", "KerstinTiedemann", "Elaine CDavis", "Sabah N AHussain"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0156994\n10.1007/s12079-009-0065-3\n10.1016/j.biocel.2010.03.009\n10.1093/carcin/bgn199\n10.1074/jbc.M110.162917\n10.1161/JAHA.113.000571\n10.1182/blood-2007-08-110338\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.181073\n10.1038/ncb1714\n10.1074/jbc.M806928200\n10.1152/ajpcell.00058.2009"}
{"title": "miR-145 promotes osteosarcoma growth by reducing expression of the transcription factor friend leukemia virus integration 1.", "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and young adults. miR-145 is a microRNA highly expressed in vascularized tissues and has been widely studied in cancers. In this study, we explored the expression and function of miR-145 in OS. We found that miR-145 was consistently under-expressed in OS tissues and cell lines as compared to normal bone tissues and osteoblast cells. Ectopic expression of miR-145 in OS cells inhibited their proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis. miR-145 targets a putative microRNA regulatory element (MRE) in the 3'-UTR of friend leukemia virus integration 1 gene (FLI-1), and its abundance was inversely related to FLI-1 expression in OS tissues and cell lines. miR-145 decreased expression FLI-1 protein and mRNA, but mutation of the miR-145 MRE sequence in the FLI-1 3'-UTR abolished the activity of miR-145 in a reporter assay. Restored expression of FLI-1 diminished miR-145-mediated suppression of tumor progression. These results suggest that miR-145 acts as a tumor suppressor by directly reducing expression of FLI-1, and that the miR-145/FLI-1 pathway is important for tumor progression in OS.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-06-16", "authors": ["PanfengWu", "JieyuLiang", "FangYu", "ZhengbingZhou", "JuyuTang", "KanghuaLi"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.9948"}

In recent years, the free jejunum flap method has emerged as a reliable means of esophageal reconstruction. However, it may require cutaneous coverage with an additional flap in extensively scarred, secondary reconstructions. Prefabrication of an intestinal/cutaneous composite flap can potentially solve this problem. Materials and Methods\u2003Total 28 Sprague Dawley rats were used in the study protocol. A vascularized jejunal segment was transposed beneath the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap. Contact with underlying abdominal fascia was prevented using a silicone sheet. Animals were distributed into five groups based on the timing of deep inferior epigastric vessel ligation to determine the time required for successful revascularization. The viability and the vascular anatomy of the prefabricated structures were analyzed using histology and microangiography. Results\u2003A jejunum/DIEP composite flap was successfully prefabricated based on mesenteric vessels. The skin component survived intact after 5 days of contact with serosal surface of the jejunal segment.

{"title": "Progression of Diabetic Capillary Occlusion: A Model.", "abstract": "An explanatory computational model is developed of the contiguous areas of retinal capillary loss which play a large role in diabetic maculapathy and diabetic retinal neovascularization. Strictly random leukocyte mediated capillary occlusion cannot explain the occurrence of large contiguous areas of retinal ischemia. Therefore occlusion of an individual capillary must increase the probability of occlusion of surrounding capillaries. A retinal perifoveal vascular sector as well as a peripheral retinal capillary network and a deleted hexagonal capillary network are modelled using Compucell3D. The perifoveal modelling produces a pattern of spreading capillary loss with associated macular edema. In the peripheral network, spreading ischemia results from the progressive loss of the ladder capillaries which connect peripheral arterioles and venules. System blood flow was elevated in the macular model before a later reduction in flow in cases with progression of capillary occlusions. Simulations differing only in initial vascular network structures but with identical dynamics for oxygen, growth factors and vascular occlusions, replicate key clinical observations of ischemia and macular edema in the posterior pole and ischemia in the retinal periphery. The simulation results also seem consistent with quantitative data on macular blood flow and qualitative data on venous oxygenation.

The key to this technique is that all of the grafted autologous bone is wrapped with the vascularized fascia of the ALT free flap to protect the grafted bone from infection and exposure. Two anterior skull base tumors combined with craniofacial bony defects were included in this study. The subjects were a man and a woman, aged 18 and 64. Both patients had preoperative proton beam therapy. First, the skull base defect was filled with vastus lateralis muscle, and then structural reconstruction was performed with an autologous bone graft and a fabricated inner layer of calvarial bone, and then the grafted bone was completely wrapped in the vascularized fascia of the ALT free flap. By applying this technique, there was no intracranial infection or grafted bone exposure in these 2 patients postoperatively, even though both patients had preoperative proton beam therapy. Additionally, the vascularized fascia wrapped bone graft could provide a natural contour and prevent collapse of the craniofacial region, and this gives patients a better facial appearance even though they have had skull base surgery.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2016-06-15", "authors": ["TomoyukiYano", "NobukoSuesada", "SatoshiUsami"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0000000000002704"}
{"title": "Mesonephric Cell Migration into the Gonads and Vascularization Are Processes Crucial for Testis Development.", "abstract": "Testis morphogenesis requires the integration and reorganization of multiple cell types from several sources, one of the more notable being the mesonephric-derived cell population. One of the earliest sex-specific morphogenetic events in the gonad is a wave of endothelial cell migration from the mesonephros that is crucial for (1) partitioning the gonad into domains for testis cords, (2) providing the vasculature of the testis, and (3) signaling to cells both within the gonad and beyond it to coordinately regulate testis development. In addition to endothelial cell migration, there is evidence that precursors of peritubular myoid cells migrate from the mesonephros, an event which is also important for testis cord architecture. Investigation of the mesonephric cell migration event has utilized histology, lineage tracing with mouse genetic markers, and many studies of the signaling molecules/pathways involved. Some of the more well-studied signaling molecules involved include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and neurotrophins. In this chapter, the morphogenetic events, relevant signaling pathways, mechanisms underlying the migration, and the role of the migratory cells within the testis will be discussed.

Patient underwent MRI evaluation and contrast-CT abdominal scan: images with parenchymal aspect, similar to spleen were obtained. Abdominal scintigraphy with 99mTc-albumin nanocolloid was performed and pelvic region was studied with planar scans and SPECT. The results showed the presence of an uptake area of the radiopharmaceutical in the pelvis, while the spleen was normally visualized. These findings confirmed the presence of an accessory spleen with an artery originated from the aorta and a vein that joined with the superior mesenteric vein. To our knowledge, in the literature, there is just only one case of a true ectopic, locally vascularized spleen in the pelvis.\nIl polisplenismo e la milza accessoria sono anomalie congenite generalmente asintomatiche.

Cases are often notoriously difficult to treat and manage owing to associated comorbidities of the patient, post irradiation fibrosis and decreased vascularity at the site, which complicates free tissue flap and graft transfer, that subsequently succumb to failure. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), in which 100\u00a0% oxygen is administered by mask under 2.4\u00a0atm pressure, in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, helps by increasing local vascularity.\nIt was the aim of this study to show that a particularly refractory, compromised and challenging case of osteoradionecrosis can be managed successfully even without HBOT, by mandibular segmental resection followed by reconstruction using a titanium reconstruction plate enveloped within a pedicled Pectoralis Major Myocutaneous flap.\nPost operative recovery of the patient was excellent with good functional and esthetic rehabilitation of the patient with and practically nil donor site morbidity.\nIt is important to have a thorough knowledge of the clinical, radiographic, histopathologic, CT and MRI features of osteoradionecrosis of the jaws in order to make a quick and accurate confirmatory diagnosis and to overcome possible diagnostic dilemmas.

The challenge for the physician is to diagnose malignant tumors early. Fine needle aspiration is an important tool for this purpose.\nThis review is based on pertinent articles (1980-2014) retrieved by a selective search in PubMed and on the current recommendations of guidelines issued by the specialty societies in Germany and abroad.\nClinical, ultrasonographic, and scintigraphic criteria are used to identify high-risk nodules, which are then further studied by fine needle aspiration. Important ultrasonographic criteria for malignancy are low echodensity (positive predictive value [PPV]: 1.85), microcalcifications (PPV: 3.65), irregular borders (PPV: 3.76), and intense vascularization. Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid gland is an inexpensive and technically straight - forward diagnostic procedure that causes little discomfort for the patient. It helps prevent unnecessary thyroid surgery and is used to determine the proper surgical strategy if malignancy is suspected. The cytological study of fine needle aspirates enables highly precise diagnosis of many tumor entities, but follicular neoplasia can only be diagnosed histologically. In the near future, molecular genetic methods will probably extend the diagnostic range of fine needle aspiration beyond what is currently achievable with classic cytology.\nFine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid gland in experienced hands is an easily performed diagnostic procedure with very little associated risk.

Stromal hydration with balanced salt solution (BSS) can improve the self-sealing status. Intracameral cefuroxime has reduced endophthalmitis rates. This study investigates the safety profile of stromal hydration with cefuroxime, as sequestering antibiotic at the wound may potentially provide added protection against infection.\nMF-1 mice underwent bilateral CCI, followed by stromal hydration with 5\u2009\u03bcL of 10\u2009mg/mL cefuroxime, cefuroxime-texas red conjugate (for detection using confocal microscopy), or BSS. Corneas were harvested from 1\u2009h to 12 weeks postoperatively; gross morphology, histology, and apoptotic cell death levels were investigated to determine the safety profile.

However, harvesting the flap in this area to cover defects of the foot and hand is highly important. Repair of soft-tissue defects at the forefoot remains a challenge in reconstructive surgery. This study explores the characteristics of the distal-based lateral dorsal cutaneous neuro-lateral plantar venofasciocutaneous flap pedicled with the lateral plantar artery perforator of the fifth metatarsal bone to establish a repair procedure for ulcers or defects in the forefoot region.\nThis study is divided into two parts: anatomical study and simulated operation. Thirty cadavers were utilized in the anatomical study after arterial injection. The tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone was used as the anatomical landmark. The lateral plantar artery perforator of the fifth metatarsal bone was identified through dissection. The perforators were dissected under a microscope. The details of the lateral plantar artery perforators, the distribution of the lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve and lateral plantar vein, the anastomosis in the lateral plantar artery perforator of the fifth metatarsal bone, the nutrient vessels of the lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve and lateral plantar vein, and other arteries of the lateral foot were recorded. The flap-raising procedure was performed on three fresh cadavers.\nThe lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve originated from sural nerve, traveled obliquely downward along the anterior lateral margin of the foot, and accompanied by the lateral plantar vein after bifurcation, and was eventually distributed on the lateral aspect of the foot. The nutrifying arteries to the lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve and lateral plantar vein were present segmentally and mainly originated from the lateral plantar artery perforator of the fifth metatarsal bone. These nitrifying arteries constantly originated from the lateral plantar artery in the area of tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal, ran along the medial side of the fifth metatarsal, traveled between the fifth metatarsal bone and the lateral muscle group (the flexor digitorum brevis and the abductor digiti minimi muscles), pierced the aponeurosis, vascularized the skin of the anterior lateral plantar region, and resulted in many minute branches, which anastomosed with the lateral tarsal artery and fourth dorsal metatarsal artery. The anatomical study showed that (1) the vasculature pattern can roughly be classified into three types and (2) constant anastomoses occurred between the above-mentioned arteries in the lateral-dorsum region of the foot.\nA reliable large- or medium-sized neuro-venocutaneous flap with lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve, lateral plantar vein, and nutrient vessels can be raised using only the perforator of the lateral plantar artery of the fifth metatarsal bone, which is thin, is in the immediate vicinity of the forefoot, and has a reliable retrograde blood supply.

The purpose of this experiment was to develop a peripheral nerve interface using cultured myoblasts within a scaffold to provide a biologically stable interface while providing signal amplification for neuroprosthetic control and preventing neuroma formation. Methods. A Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface (RPNI) composed of a scaffold and cultured myoblasts was implanted on the end of a divided peroneal nerve in rats (n = 25). The scaffold material consisted of either silicone mesh, acellular muscle, or acellular muscle with chemically polymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) conductive polymer. Average implantation time was 93 days. Electrophysiological tests were performed at endpoint to determine RPNI viability and ability to transduce neural signals. Tissue samples were examined using both light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Results. All implanted RPNIs, regardless of scaffold type, remained viable and displayed robust vascularity. Electromyographic activity and stimulated compound muscle action potentials were successfully recorded from all RPNIs. Physiologic efferent motor action potentials were detected from RPNIs in response to sensory foot stimulation. Histology and transmission electron microscopy revealed mature muscle fibers, axonal regeneration without neuroma formation, neovascularization, and synaptogenesis. Desmin staining confirmed the preservation and maturation of myoblasts within the RPNIs. Conclusions.

This study aims to analyze the outcome of patients with wide diaphyseal bone gap treated with induced-membrane technique (Masquelet technique).\nThis study included 9 patients (7 males and 2 females), all with tibial bone-gap. Eight of the 9 patients were infected and in 3 patients there was associated large soft tissue defect requiring flap cover. This technique is two-stage procedure. Stage I surgery included debridement, fracture stabilization, application of spacer between bone ends, and soft tissue reconstruction. Stage II surgery included removal of spacer with preservation of induced membrane formed at spacer surface and filling the bone-gap with morselized iliac crest bone-graft within the membrane sleeve. Average bone-gap of 5.2 cm was treated. The spacer was always found to be encapsulated by a thick glistening membrane which did not collapse after its removal. All patients were followed up for an average period of 21.5 months.\nSerial Radiographs showed regular uptake of autograft and thus consolidation within themselves in the region of bone gap and also with host bone. Bone-union was documented in all patients and all patients are walking full weight-bearing without support.\nThe study highlights that the technique provide effective and practical management for difficult gap nonunion.

BET proteins regulate transcription by selectively recognizing acetylated lysine residues on chromatin. BETi compete with this process leading to both downregulation and upregulation of gene expression. Hypoxia enables progression of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive form of breast cancer, partly by driving metabolic adaptation, angiogenesis and metastasis through upregulation of hypoxia-regulated genes (for example, carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Responses to hypoxia can be mediated epigenetically, thus we investigated whether BETi JQ1 could impair the TNBC response induced by hypoxia and exert anti-tumour effects. JQ1 significantly modulated 44% of hypoxia-induced genes, of which two-thirds were downregulated including CA9 and VEGF-A. JQ1 prevented HIF binding to the hypoxia response element in CA9 promoter, but did not alter HIF expression or activity, suggesting some HIF targets are BET-dependent. JQ1 reduced TNBC growth in vitro and in vivo and inhibited xenograft vascularization.

However, mechanistic understanding of the role of BM-derived EPCs in cutaneous wound neovascularization and healing remains incomplete, which impedes development of EPC-based wound healing therapies. The objective of this study was to determine the role of EPCs in wound neovascularization and healing both under normal conditions and using single deficiency (EPC) or double-deficiency (EPC\u2009+\u2009diabetes) models of wound healing. MMP9 knockout (MMP9 KO) mouse model was utilized, where impaired EPC mobilization can be rescued by stem cell factor (SCF). The hypotheses were: (1) MMP9 KO mice exhibit impaired wound neovascularization and healing, which are further exacerbated with diabetes; (2) these impairments can be rescued by SCF administration. Full-thickness excisional wounds with silicone splints to minimize contraction were created on MMP9 KO mice with/without streptozotocin-induced diabetes in the presence or absence of tail-vein injected SCF. Wound morphology, vascularization, inflammation, and EPC mobilization and recruitment were quantified at day 7 postwounding. Results demonstrate no difference in wound closure and granulation tissue area between any groups. MMP9 deficiency significantly impairs wound neovascularization, increases inflammation, decreases collagen deposition, and decreases peripheral blood EPC (pb-EPC) counts when compared with wild-type (WT). Diabetes further increases inflammation, but does not cause further impairment in vascularization, as compared with MMP9 KO group. SCF improves neovascularization and increases EPCs to WT levels (both nondiabetic and diabetic MMP9 KO groups), while exacerbating inflammation in all groups. SCF rescues EPC-deficiency and impaired wound neovascularization in both diabetic and nondiabetic MMP9 KO mice. Overall, the results demonstrate that BM-derived EPCs play a significant role during wound neovascularization and that the SCF-based therapy with controlled inflammation could be a viable approach to enhance healing in chronic diabetic wounds.", "journal": "Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society", "date": "2016-06-14", "authors": ["HongkwanCho", "SwathiBalaji", "Natalie LHone", "Chad MMoles", "Abdul QSheikh", "Timothy MCrombleholme", "Sundeep GKeswani", "Daria ANarmoneva"], "doi": "10.1111/wrr.12453"}
{"title": "Cardiac atrial appendage stem cells promote angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.", "abstract": "Cardiac atrial appendage stem cells (CASCs) show extraordinary myocardial differentiation properties, making them ideal candidates for myocardial regeneration. However, since the myocardium is a highly vascularized tissue, revascularization of the ischemic infarct area is essential for functional repair. Therefore, this study assessed if CASCs contribute to cardiac angiogenesis via paracrine mechanisms. First, it was demonstrated that CASCs produce and secrete high levels of numerous angiogenic growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3). Functional in vitro assays with a human microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1) and CASC CM showed that CASCs promote endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation, the most important steps of the angiogenesis process. Addition of inhibitory antibodies against identified growth factors could significantly reduce these effects, indicating their importance in CASC-induced neovascularization. The angiogenic potential of CASCs and CASC CM was also confirmed in a chorioallantoic membrane assay, demonstrating that CASCs promote blood vessel formation in vivo. In conclusion, this study shows that CASCs not only induce myocardial repair by cardiomyogenic differentiation, but also stimulate blood vessel formation by paracrine mechanisms.

The concentration of these proteins was correlated with an increased risk of occurrence of stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). This article examines the effect of the most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs on the concentration of plasma proteins in Wistar rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study involved 36 rats grouped according to the immunosuppressive regimen used (tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A, rapamycin, and prednisone). The rats in all study groups were treated with a 3-drug protocol for 6 months. The treatment dose was adjusted based on available data in the literature. No drugs were administered to the control group. The rats were sacrificed and blood samples collected to determine the concentration of plasma proteins using electrophoresis technique. RESULTS Statistically significant differences were observed between protein concentrations within the studied groups. The differences related to the proteins with masses of 195 kDa, 170 kDa, 103 kDa, and 58 kDa. CONCLUSIONS (1) Immunosuppressive drugs caused changes in the proteinogram of plasma proteins.

{"title": "Tissue Engineering by Intrinsic Vascularization in an In Vivo Tissue Engineering Chamber.", "abstract": "In reconstructive surgery, there is a clinical need for an alternative to the current methods of autologous reconstruction which are complex, costly and trade one defect for another. Tissue engineering holds the promise to address this increasing demand. However, most tissue engineering strategies fail to generate stable and functional tissue substitutes because of poor vascularization. This paper focuses on an in vivo tissue engineering chamber model of intrinsic vascularization where a perfused artery and a vein either as an arteriovenous loop or a flow-through pedicle configuration is directed inside a protected hollow chamber. In this chamber-based system angiogenic sprouting occurs from the arteriovenous vessels and this system attracts ischemic and inflammatory driven endogenous cell migration which gradually fills the chamber space with fibro-vascular tissue. Exogenous cell/matrix implantation at the time of chamber construction enhances cell survival and determines specificity of the engineered tissues which develop. Our studies have shown that this chamber model can successfully generate different tissues such as fat, cardiac muscle, liver and others. However, modifications and refinements are required to ensure target tissue formation is consistent and reproducible.

Cerebrum was devoid of usual convolutions (elevations), gyri, depressions (grooves), and sulci. The cerebral hemispheres were tightly apposed along a median sulcus called interhemispheric fissure and cerebrum and cerebellum were separated by a small transverse fissure. The olfactory bulb was small structures, and the pineal body was clearly visible. The optic lobes were partially hidden under cerebral hemispheres, but laterally, it was large, prominent rounded or spherical bodies of the midbrain.

Therefore, the accuracy of non-invasive diagnosis of these cysts is pivotal. A clinically relevant question is whether the sonographic characteristics of ovarian endometriomas are the same irrespective of the age of the woman.\nThis is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data in the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) database. The database contains clinical and ultrasound information collected pre-operatively between 1999 and 2012 from 5914 patients with adnexal masses in 24 ultrasound centres in 10 countries.\nThere were 1005 histologically confirmed endometriomas in adult premenopausal patients found in the database and these were used in our analysis. The following ultrasound variables (defined using IOTA terminology) were used to describe the ultrasound appearance of the endometriomas: tender mass at ultrasound, largest diameter of lesion, tumour type (unilocular, unilocular-solid, multilocular, multilocular-solid, solid), echogenicity of cyst content, presence of papillations, number of papillations, height (mm) of largest papillation, presence and proportion of solid tissue and number of cyst locules, as well as vascularity in papillations and colour content of the tumour scan (colour score) on colour or power Doppler ultrasounds. Results are reported as median difference or odds ratio (OR) per 10 years increase in age.\nMaximal lesion diameter did not vary substantially with age (+1.3 mm difference per 10 years increase in age, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.4 to 4.0). Tender mass at scan was less common in the older the woman (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.89), as were unilocular cysts relative to multilocular cysts (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85) and to lesions with solid components (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48-0.77), and ground glass echogenicity relative to homogeneous low-level echogenicity (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.94) and other types of echogenicity of cyst contents (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.81). Papillations were more common the older the woman (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.24-2.21), but their height and vascularization showed no clear relation to age.\nIt is a limitation that we have little clinical information on the women included, e.g. previous surgery or medical treatment for endometriosis. It is important to emphasize that we do not know the age of the endometrioma itself and that our study is not longitudinal and so does not describe changes in endometriomas over time. The differences in the ultrasound appearance of endometriomas between women of different ages might be explained by previous surgery or medical treatment and might not be an effect of age per se.\nAwareness of physicians that the ultrasound appearance of endometriomas differs between women of different ages may facilitate a correct diagnosis of endometrioma.\nThis study was supported in part by the Regione Autonoma della Sardegna (project code CPR-24750).

An alternative approach would be to bioprint the developmental precursor to an adult organ, using this engineered rudiment as a template for subsequent organogenesis in vivo. This study demonstrates that developmentally inspired hypertrophic cartilage templates can be engineered in vitro using stem cells within a supporting gamma-irradiated alginate bioink incorporating Arg-Gly-Asp adhesion peptides. Furthermore, these soft tissue templates can be reinforced with a network of printed polycaprolactone fibers, resulting in a \u2248350 fold increase in construct compressive modulus providing the necessary stiffness to implant such immature cartilaginous rudiments into load bearing locations. As a proof-of-principal, multiple-tool biofabrication is used to engineer a mechanically reinforced cartilaginous template mimicking the geometry of a vertebral body, which in vivo supported the development of a vascularized bone organ containing trabecular-like endochondral bone with a supporting marrow structure.

However, because of the lack of central slip formation in the majority of toes, the reconstructed PIPJ often results in extension lag. Extension lag associated with poor central slip formation in the lesser toes can be corrected using central slip reconstruction methods such as the Stack method. However, such methods are often cumbersome and involve extensive dissection and soft tissue manipulation. We present a novel, reproducible, simple yet effective technique in recreating the insertion point of the extensor tendon in the reconstructed finger, hence correcting the issue of extensor lag in vascularized toe joint transfers. The crux of this technique empowers the surgeon with the ability to correct inherent extensor lag of toes in VTJs.

This study aimed to quantify the venous networks within VBs of 15 healthy adolescent controls and 15 AIS patients.\nFive transverse slices through the VBs were examined simultaneously and the observable vascular network traced. The length of the network on the left and right sides of the VB was calculated, and the spatial patterning assessed level-by-level within each subject.\nSignificant differences were seen in the left/right distribution of vessels in both the control and AIS subjects, with both groups having greater length on the right side of all of their VBs. No difference was seen between AIS and control subjects in any region. Large individual variations in patterns were seen in both groups; however, the control group showed more consistent spatial patterning of the vascular networks across levels in comparison to the AIS group.\nThe length of the basivertebral vein was seen to have a significant bias to the right hand side of the VB in both healthy and AIS adolescents. The spatial pattern of this vein showed large variations in branching both within and across individuals.

We investigated the ability of outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) in mono-culture or in co-culture with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) to form capillary networks in silk fibroin hydrogels. Furthermore, the silk fibroin hydrogel was modified with IKVAV peptide revealing a sequence derived from the extracellular matrix component laminin-1 to test its effects on angiogenesis, using unmodified and VVIAK modified silk fibroin hydrogel as controls.

We developed a novel hybrid biomaterial comprising nanocalcium sulfate (nCS) and fibrin hydrogel to deliver mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), to promote neovascularization and bone formation. MSC and growth factor(s)-loaded scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously into mice to examine their angiogenic and osteogenic potential. Micro CT, alkaline phosphatase activity assay, and histological analysis were used to evaluate bone formation, while immunohistochemistry was employed to assess neovessel formation. The presence of fibrin preserved the nCS scaffold structure and promoted de novo bone formation. In addition, the presence of bone morphogenic protein 2-expressing MSC in nCS and fibrin hydrogels improved bone regeneration significantly. While FGF9 alone had no significant effect, the combination FGF9 and VEGF conjugated in fibrin enhanced neovascularization and bone formation more than 4-fold compared to nCS with MSC. Overall, our results suggested that the combination of nCS (to support bone formation) with a fibrin-based VEGF/FGF9 release system (support vascular formation) is an innovative and effective strategy that significantly enhanced ectopic bone formation in vivo.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

A hydrogel is a popular scaffold type and has many biological advantages, however, it is incapable of rapidly recruiting angiogenesis-related cells and cytokines to the wound area under the disturbed microcirculatory conditions of diabetics. For the above reasons, we devised a desferrioxamine (DFO)-loaded photo-crosslinked hydrogel (gelatin methacrylamide (Gelma)) for quickly developing the vascular network and accelerating skin reconstruction. The controlled release of DFO peaking at 16 h followed by a steady release after 48 h through the swelling of the Gelma hydrogel led to a significant increase of neovascularization.

Whereas antiangiogenic agents show poor clinical activity, immunotherapy seems to be a more promising tool with an objective response rate (ORR) of 20\u00a0% in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (R/M SCC). Other targets, located inside the extracellular matrix or on cancer associated fibroblasts, are under preclinical investigation. These new agents all need to be tested in clinical trials alone, or in combination with standard treatment modalities, based on preclinical data. To increase our knowledge of the complex network between the cancer cell and its environment, preclinical studies should consider co-culture models, and clinical studies should incorporate a translational research objective.", "journal": "Current treatment options in oncology", "date": "2016-06-06", "authors": ["SandraSchmitz", "Jean-PascalMachiels"], "doi": "10.1007/s11864-016-0412-6"}
{"title": "Long-term exercise training as a modulator of mammary cancer vascularization.", "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a leading cause of death by cancer worldwide. It is commonly accepted that angiogenesis and the expression of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is associated with the increased risk of metastasis and poor patient outcome.\nThis work aimed to evaluate the effects of long-term exercise training on the growth and vascularization of mammary tumors in a rat model.\nFifty female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: two N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-exposed groups (exercised and sedentary) and two control groups (exercised and sedentary). MNU was administered once, intraperitoneally at 7 weeks-old. Animals were then exercised on a treadmill for 35 weeks. Mammary tumors were evaluated using thermography, ultrasonography [Power Doppler (PDI), B Flow and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)], and immunohistochemistry (VEGF-A).\nBoth, MNU sedentary and exercised groups showed 100% of tumor incidence, but exercised animals showed less tumors with an increased latency period. Exercise training also enhanced VEGF-A immunoexpression and vascularization (microvessel density, MVD) (p<0.05), and reduced histological aggressiveness. Ultrasound and thermal imaging analysis confirmed the enhanced vascularization of tumors on exercised animals.\nLong-term exercise training increased VEGF-A expression, leading to enhanced tumor vascularization and reduced tumor burden, multiplicity and histological aggressiveness.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2016-06-05", "authors": ["A IFaustino-Rocha", "ASilva", "JGabriel", "R MGil da Costa", "MMoutinho", "P AOliveira", "AGama", "RFerreira", "MGinja"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2016.04.030"}
{"title": "l-DOPA as a small molecule surrogate to promote angiogenesis and prevent dexamethasone-induced ischemia.", "abstract": "The foreign body response to implantable biosensors has been successfully countered through the use of corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone. However, while controlling inflammation, dexamethasone also decreases angiogenesis, which may lead to delayed analyte readings. The concurrent application of VEGF with dexamethasone increases angiogenesis, but VEGF has physical stability issues and is not cost-effective. The use of l-DOPA, a small molecule drug shown to up-regulate VEGF in the Parkinsonian brain, can potentially resolve these issues by substituting for VEGF. In this work, l-DOPA was used for the first time as a pro-angiogenic agent to counteract dexamethasone-induced ischemia. Angiogenesis was modeled using the CAM assay and changes in blood vessel formation were recorded with both manual and digital techniques. As expected, dexamethasone reduced blood vessel formation in the CAM. Application of l-DOPA, on the other hand, increased blood vessel formation when dexamethasone and l-DOPA were administered simultaneously. This novel finding suggests the utility of l-DOPA in the field of implantable medical devices, such as biosensors, as well as tissue engineering applications where both a vascularized tissue environment and control of tissue response is desired.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2016-06-05", "authors": ["Claire FPrice", "Diane JBurgess", "MichailKastellorizios"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.05.065"}
{"title": "Effect of Artificial Nerve Conduit Vascularization on Peripheral Nerve in a Necrotic Bed.", "abstract": "Several types of artificial nerve conduit have been used for bridging peripheral nerve gaps as an alternative to autologous nerves. However, their efficacy in repairing nerve injuries accompanied by surrounding tissue damage remains unclear. We fabricated a novel nerve conduit vascularized by superficial inferior epigastric (SIE) vessels and evaluated whether it could promote axonal regeneration in a necrotic bed.\nA 15-mm nerve conduit was implanted beneath the SIE vessels in the groin of a rat to supply it with blood vessels 2 weeks before nerve reconstruction. We removed a 13-mm segment of the sciatic nerve and then pressed a heated iron against the dorsal thigh muscle to produce a burn. The defects were immediately repaired with an autograft (n = 10), nerve conduit graft (n = 8), or vascularized nerve conduit graft (n = 8). Recovery of motor function was examined for 18 weeks after surgery. The regenerated nerves were electrophysiologically and histologically evaluated.\nThe vascularity of the nerve conduit implanted beneath the SIE vessels was confirmed histologically 2 weeks after implantation. Between 14 and 18 weeks after surgery, motor function of the vascularized conduit group was significantly better than that of the nonvascularized conduit group. Electrophysiological and histological evaluations revealed that although the improvement did not reach the level of reinnervation achieved by an autograft, the vascularized nerve conduit improved axonal regeneration more than did the conduit alone.\nVascularization of artificial nerve conduits accelerated peripheral nerve regeneration, but further research is required to improve the quality of nerve regeneration.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

{"title": "Biomimetic microenvironments for regenerative endodontics.", "abstract": "Regenerative endodontics has been proposed to replace damaged and underdeveloped tooth structures with normal pulp-dentin tissue by providing a natural extracellular matrix (ECM) mimicking environment; stem cells, signaling molecules, and scaffolds. In addition, clinical success of the regenerative endodontic treatments can be evidenced by absence of signs and symptoms; no bony pathology, a disinfected pulp, and the maturation of root dentin in length and thickness. In spite of the various approaches of regenerative endodontics, there are several major challenges that remain to be improved: a) the endodontic root canal is a strong harbor of the endodontic bacterial biofilm and the fundamental etiologic factors of recurrent endodontic diseases, (b) tooth discolorations are caused by antibiotics and filling materials, (c) cervical root fractures are caused by endodontic medicaments, (d) pulp tissue is not vascularized nor innervated, and (e) the dentin matrix is not developed with adequate root thickness and length. Generally, current clinical protocols and recent studies have shown a limited success of the pulp-dentin tissue regeneration. Throughout the various approaches, the construction of biomimetic microenvironments of pulp-dentin tissue is a key concept of the tissue engineering based regenerative endodontics. The biomimetic microenvironments are composed of a synthetic nano-scaled polymeric fiber structure that mimics native pulp ECM and functions as a scaffold of the pulp-dentin tissue complex. They will provide a framework of the pulp ECM, can deliver selective bioactive molecules, and may recruit pluripotent stem cells from the vicinity of the pulp apex. The polymeric nanofibers are produced by methods of self-assembly, electrospinning, and phase separation. In order to be applied to biomedical use, the polymeric nanofibers require biocompatibility, stability, and biodegradability. Therefore, this review focuses on the development and application of the biomimetic microenvironments of pulp-dentin tissue among the current regenerative endodontics.", "journal": "Biomaterials research", "date": "2016-06-04", "authors": ["Sagar NKaushik", "BogeunKim", "Alexander M CruzWalma", "Sung ChulChoi", "HuiWu", "Jeremy JMao", "Ho-WookJun", "KyoungaCheon"], "doi": "10.1186/s40824-016-0061-7\n10.1126/science.8493529\n10.1016/j.joen.2006.09.013\n10.1021/bp960073f\n10.1177/0022034514549809\n10.2217/rme.09.45\n10.1016/j.joen.2012.11.025\n10.1089/ten.teb.2011.0041\n10.1097/00004770-200404000-00003\n10.3109/00016356109043395\n10.1016/0030-4220(78)90217-7\n10.2741/e286\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0181\n10.1016/j.joen.2009.09.039\n10.1016/j.joen.2012.06.017\n10.1016/j.joen.2012.06.025\n10.1006/excr.2000.4909\n10.1111/j.1365-2591.2009.01622.x\n10.1016/j.joen.2014.01.018\n10.1111/etp.12037\n10.1016/j.cden.2012.05.005\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.07.008\n10.1016/j.joen.2010.11.004\n10.1111/j.1365-2591.2008.01467.x\n10.1111/j.1365-2591.1996.tb01173.x\n10.1016/j.joen.2015.10.013\n10.1111/j.1600-9657.2010.00963.x\n10.1034/j.1600-9657.2002.00097.x\n10.1111/j.1600-9657.2009.00834.x\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.08.013\n10.1021/nn504617g\n10.1089/ten.2006.12.3265\n10.1177/002203458506400405\n10.1016/S0076-6879(06)19005-9\n10.1002/term.1899\n10.1016/j.joen.2008.02.032\n10.1016/j.joen.2008.04.001\n10.1016/j.joen.2008.03.001\n10.1016/j.joen.2008.09.001\n10.1016/j.joen.2011.08.027\n10.1016/S0099-2399(06)81112-X\n10.14219/jada.archive.2008.0160\n10.1111/j.1365-2591.2006.01116.x\n10.1111/j.1399-302X.1993.tb00661.x\n10.1046/j.1365-2591.2000.00277.x\n10.1016/j.joen.2013.06.019\n10.1016/j.joen.2012.06.018\n10.14219/jada.archive.1966.0017\n10.1111/j.1600-9657.1992.tb00228.x\n10.1016/j.joen.2008.10.019\n10.1016/j.joen.2006.07.010\n10.1111/j.1365-2591.2011.01978.x\n10.1111/j.1600-9657.2006.00453.x\n10.1111/iej.12046\n10.1016/0030-4220(74)90119-4\n10.1016/j.joen.2009.10.006\n10.1016/j.joen.2011.01.011\n10.1016/j.joen.2009.06.021\n10.1111/edt.12169\n10.1016/j.joen.2011.08.025\n10.1016/j.joen.2010.11.010\n10.1016/j.joen.2012.11.041\n10.1111/edt.12108\n10.1002/jor.1100090504\n10.1177/0022034509340867\n10.1016/j.cden.2012.05.004\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000073832.49290.B5\n10.1034/j.1600-9657.2001.017004185.x\n10.1111/j.1600-9657.1986.tb00132.x\n10.1177/0022034514537829\n10.1177/154405910208100806\n10.1371/journal.pone.0000079\n10.1073/pnas.0937635100\n10.1073/pnas.240309797\n10.1097/01.don.0000164138.49923.e5\n10.1111/j.0953-816X.2004.03314.x\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.056\n10.1111/etp.12035\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0393\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2009.10.012\n10.1021/bm301109c\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.10.021\n10.1006/dbio.1994.1063\n10.1038/nbt864\n10.1290/0502014.1\n10.1002/jbm.a.33002\n10.1089/ten.tec.2011.0624\n10.1111/j.1600-0757.2006.00172.x\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.02.010\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2005.08.016\n10.2217/rme.10.96\n10.1016/j.joen.2015.10.012\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0615\n10.1182/blood-2005-04-1417\n10.1007/s12015-011-9240-z\n10.1016/j.blre.2014.01.001\n10.1002/jcp.22538\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0518\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00343-0\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.03.005\n10.1263/jbb.99.598\n10.1002/jctb.1468\n10.1002/1097-4636(20011205)57:3<374::AID-JBM1180>3.0.CO;2-L\n10.1021/nn203247m\n10.1002/adma.200500855\n10.1126/science.1063187\n10.1021/bm9007452\n10.1021/nn900884n\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.10.051\n10.1186/s40824-015-0032-4\n10.1016/j.joen.2010.10.011\n10.1016/S0099-2399(78)80143-5\n10.1016/j.archoralbio.2007.04.015\n10.1016/j.archoralbio.2004.04.009\n10.1177/089875649901600102\n10.1111/edt.12100"}
{"title": "Gene changes may minimize masculinizing and defeminizing influences of exposure to male cotwins in female callitrichine primates.", "abstract": "Sexual differentiation in female mammals can be altered by the proximity of male littermates in utero, a phenomenon known as the intrauterine position effect (IUP). Among simian primates, callitrichines (marmosets and tamarins) are likely candidates for IUP, since they exhibit obligate dizygotic twinning and fetuses share extensive vascularization in utero. In this paper, we determined whether female reproductive parameters are altered by gestating with a male twin and evaluated changes in genes associated with anti-M\u00fcllerian and steroid hormones in twinning callitrichine primates.\nWe assessed the impact of gestation with male cotwins on reproductive performance and survivorship in female marmosets (Callithrix) and lion tamarins (Leontopithecus), contrasting measures for females gestated with one or more littermates (M+) or no male littermates (0M). We compared targeted coding regions for genes involved in steroidal and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone mediation of sexual differentiation for representatives of twinning callitrichines (Callithrix, Saguinus, and Leontopithecus) with closely related New World primates that produce single births (Saimiri and Callimico).\nIUP effects in females were absent in female callitrichine primates: age at first ovulation, average litter size, and the proportion of stillborn infants, and lifetime survivorship did not differ between M+ and 0M females. We documented multiple nonsynonymous substitutions in genes associated with steroid synthesis, transport, and cellular action (SRD5A2, CYP19A1, SHBG, and AR) and with anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH and AMHR2) in callitrichines. In the only callitrichine to produce single infants (Callimico), two genes contained nonsynonymous substitutions relative to twinning callitrichines (CYP19A1 and AMRHR2); these substitutions were identical with nontwinning Saimiri and humans, suggesting a reversion to an ancestral sequence.\nIn spite of a shared placental vasculature with opposite-sex twins throughout embryonic and fetal development, female callitrichine primates gestated with a male cotwin exhibit no decrement in reproductive performance relative to females gestated with female cotwins. Hence, IUP effects on female reproduction in callitrichines are modest. We have identified mutations in candidate genes relevant for steroid hormone signaling and metabolism, and especially in AMH-related genes, that are likely to alter protein structure and function in the callitrichines. These mutations may confer protection for females from the masculinizing and defeminizing influences of gestating with a male cotwin.", "journal": "Biology of sex differences", "date": "2016-06-04", "authors": ["Jeffrey AFrench", "BrettFrye", "JonCavanaugh", "DongrenRen", "Aaryn CMustoe", "LisaRapaport", "JenniferMickelberg"], "doi": "10.1186/s13293-016-0081-y\n10.1055/s-0032-1324718\n10.1152/ajpendo.00187.2011\n10.1016/j.mce.2003.09.007\n10.1016/S0149-7634(02)00038-6\n10.1530/jrf.0.0620633\n10.1111/j.1365-2907.2011.00199.x\n10.3389/fendo.2014.00028\n10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01888.x\n10.1073/pnas.3.7.464\n10.1002/jez.a.107\n10.1016/j.anireprosci.2004.09.008\n10.1073/pnas.1316037111\n10.1002/ajp.20367\n10.1002/ajp.20065\n10.1111/j.1469-7998.1985.tb04951.x\n10.1002/ajpa.20846\n10.1002/aja.1000640305\n10.1126/science.138.3539.513\n10.1159/000129828\n10.1073/pnas.0607426104\n10.1186/1471-2164-13-98\n10.1007/BF02447593\n10.1371/journal.pone.0096845\n10.1046/j.1365-2265.2002.01430.x\n10.1055/s-2002-35381\n10.1111/j.1600-0684.1996.tb00194.x\n10.1002/ajp.22058\n10.1159/000342499\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btv195\n10.1093/nar/gks539\n10.1037/0735-7036.105.2.134\n10.1007/BF00166702\n10.1095/biolreprod.111.092593\n10.1210/me.2014-1058\n10.1210/en.2011-1837\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1218\n10.1038/nrendo.2009.176\n10.1210/jc.2013-3990\n10.1530/EJE-10-0930\n10.1016/j.gene.2013.04.070\n10.1016/j.kjms.2011.10.011\n10.1097/00008571-200007000-00004\n10.1016/S0022-5347(01)68102-3\n10.1074/jbc.M111.336081\n10.1074/jbc.M004571200\n10.1210/me.2003-0358\n10.1093/humupd/dmi014\n10.1590/S0004-27302012000800002\n10.1159/000338343\n10.1016/j.jpurol.2013.03.004\n10.1034/j.1600-0684.2002.t01-1-02002.x\n10.1111/j.1600-0684.2011.00477.x\n10.1292/jvms.14-0378\n10.1016/S0079-6123(08)64446-5\n10.1530/jrf.0.0530155\n10.1002/ajp.20909\n10.1159/000156275\n10.1016/0031-9384(93)90115-V\n10.1006/hbeh.1993.1016\n10.1016/0018-506X(90)90036-W\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1001342\n10.1016/j.ympev.2009.07.019"}
{"title": "Combinatorial therapy with three-dimensionally cultured adipose-derived stromal cells and self-assembling peptides to enhance angiogenesis and preserve cardiac function in infarcted hearts.", "abstract": "Even though stem cell therapy is a promising angiogenic strategy to treat ischaemic diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI), therapeutic efficacy is limited by low survival and retention of transplanted cells in ischaemic tissues. In addition, therapeutic angiogenesis depends on stimulating host angiogenesis with paracrine factors released by transplanted cells rather than on direct blood vessel formation by transplanted cells. In the present study, to overcome these limitations and to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of MI treatment, combinatorial therapy with three-dimensional cell masses (3DCMs) and self-assembling peptides (SAPs) was tested in a rat MI model. Spheroid-type 3DCMs, which are vascular differentiation-induced cells, were prepared by culturing human adipose-derived stromal cells on a fibroblast growth factor-immobilized surface. The SAPs were used as the carrier material to increase engraftment of transplanted cells. After coronary artery ligation, 3DCMs were combined with SAPs and were transplanted into ischaemic lesions. The therapeutic potential was evaluated 4\u00a0weeks after treatment. By combining 3DCMs and SAPs, survival and retention of transplanted cells increased threefold when compared with treatment with 3DCMs alone and transplanted cells established vascular networks in infarcted hearts. In addition, the size of the infarct in the 3DCM\u00a0+\u00a0SAP group was reduced to 6.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.83% by the promotion of host angiogenesis and cardiac function was preserved, as demonstrated by a 54.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.42% increase in the ejection fraction. This study indicates that combinatorial therapy with 3DCM and SAPs could be a promising strategy for therapeutic angiogenesis to treat MI.

We aimed to evaluate the demographic characteristics, ultrasound (US) findings, and cytological results of patients with TT-UMP and compare these findings to a classical variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (CV-PTC) and non-encapsulated follicular variant of PTC (NEFV-PTC) patients; we also evaluated the immunohistochemical characteristics of patients with TT-UMP. Twenty-four patients with TT-UMP, 672 with CV-PTC, and 132 with NEFV-PTC were included in the study. Mean longitudinal nodule size and median nodule volume were higher in the TT-UMP group than in the CV-PTC and NEFV-PTC groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001 and p\u2009<\u20090.001 for CV-PTC; p\u2009<\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.008 for NEFV-PTC). The presence of halo and peripheral vascularization was observed more frequently in the TT-UMP group than in the CV-PTC group (p\u2009=\u20090.002 and p\u2009=\u20090.024). Benign and follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm cytological results were higher in the TT-UMP group than in the CV-PTC group (p\u2009=\u20090.030 and p\u2009=\u20090.001). US findings were similar between TT-UMP and NEFV-PTC groups (all, p\u2009>\u20090.05). However, none of the patients with TT-UMP were called malignant; 105 patients (31.2\u00a0%) of CV-PTC and 11 patients (9.5\u00a0%) of NEFV-PTC (infiltrative FV) were classified as malignant cytologically. Tumor size was higher in the TT-UMP group than in the CV-PTC and NEFV-PTC groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.006). In the TT-UMP group, positive expression of HBME-1, CK-19, and Gal-3 was found in 50, 33.3, and 25\u00a0% of patients, respectively. This study demonstrated that none of the TT-UMP patients were evaluated as malignant in preoperative cytology.

In this study, we evaluated a novel combined approach to the reduction and stabilization of frontozygomatic dislocated fractures without aesthetic damage.\nTen patients (mean age, 52 years) were referred for complex frontozygomatic dislocated fractures. Five patients underwent a transconjunctival approach without canthotomy in association with a transoral maxillary approach and lateral-rim skin incision, also without canthotomy. The other five patients underwent a traditional subciliary incision at the lower eyelid and a vertical lateral incision at the lateral orbital margin. Orbital floor reconstruction was achieved using two to three fixation points and autologous platelet-rich fibrin (PRF). During the 6-month follow-up, the patients were routinely evaluated using computed tomography.\nTreatment was successful in all cases; there were no problems at surgery or postoperatively. During follow-up, all patients had satisfactory facial symmetry, no noticeable scar, ectropion, or lower-eyelid drop, and no functional impairment.\nAesthetic considerations are an important aspect of treatment planning in patients with orbitozygomatic fractures, because of the importance of the eye and lid areas to facial aesthetics. In our patients, good aesthetic results were achieved using a novel combined approach.

Thus this study investigated the protective effect of aerobic training on pathophysiological mechanisms involved in subclinical cardiometabolic alterations in a model with constant exposure to a prejudicial agent. Male Wistar rats were divided into a control group (C), which received drinking water, fructose group (F), which was fed 10% fructose in drinking water for 10 wk, and control training (CT) and fructose training groups (FT), in which moderate aerobic training was added in the last 8 wk of the study. Insulin, triacylglycerol, and isoprostane were higher and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was lower in the F group. There was no difference in thoracic aorta histology, but a decreased vascularization was seen in the F group, avoided by training in left ventricle. Regarding vascular function, the F group exhibited increased vasoconstrictory reactivity to phenylephrine. The F group presented impaired vasodilation to acetylcholine. Regarding endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), the F group presented a lower expression, and phosphorylated eNOS was higher in the trained groups than in their respective control groups. This same pattern was observed for nitric oxide bioavailability, antioxidant protein expression in aorta, left ventricle, and muscle (catalase, SOD, and glutathione peroxidase), serum SOD activity, and muscle mass. These results suggest that exercise training enhanced the antioxidant pathway and, as a consequence, the eNOS pathway, preventing an impairment in vascular vasodilatory capacity.", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "date": "2016-06-04", "authors": ["Renata FMedeiros", "Thaiane GGaique", "ThaisBento-Bernardes", "N\u00e1dia A VMotta", "Fernanda C FBrito", "CarolineFernandes-Santos", "CamilaCastro-Pinheiro", "Karen JOliveira", "Antonio C LN\u00f3brega"], "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.00369.2015"}

Studies on tissue engineering using stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) have yielded promising results. Laser phototherapy (LPT) is able to influence the proliferation and differentiation of these cells, which could improve tissue engineering. SHEDs (eighth passage) were seeded into 96-well culture plates (103 cells/well) and were grown in culture medium supplemented with 15% defined fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 12 h. After determining the appropriate nutrition deficiency status (5% FBS), the cells were assigned into four groups: 1) G1 - 15% FBS (positive control); 2) G2 - 5% FBS (negative control); 3) G3 - 5% FBS+LPT 3 J/cm2; and 4) G4 - 5% FBS+LPT 5 J/cm2. For the LPT groups, two laser irradiations at 6 h intervals were performed using a continuous wave InGaAlP diode laser (660 nm, with a spot size of 0.028 cm2, 10 mW) in punctual and contact mode. Cell viability was assessed via an MTT reduction assay immediately after the second laser irradiation (0 h) and 24, 48, and 72 h later. We found that G3 and G4 presented a significantly higher cell growth rate when compared with G2 (p < 0.01). Moreover, G4 exhibited a similar cell growth rate as G1 throughout the entire experiment (p > 0.05). These findings indicate that LPT with 5 J/cm2 can enhance the growth of SHEDs during situations of nutritional deficiency.

{"title": "Morphology, Structure, and Ontogeny of Trichomes of the Grape Genus (Vitis, Vitaceae).", "abstract": "Trichomes are widely distributed on surfaces of different organs in the grape genus Vitis and are of taxonomic utility. To explore the morphology, structure and ontogeny of Vitis trichomes, we investigated the diversity and distribution of trichomes in 34 species of Vitis. Two main types of trichomes in Vitis are documented: non-glandular and glandular. Within non-glandular trichomes, ribbon and simple trichomes are found on different vegetative plant organs. The morphology and ontogeny of these types of trichomes are further examined with light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The ultrastructure of the glandular trichomes is explored with transmission electron microscopy. The ribbon trichomes are twisted, greatly elongated and unicellular, and this trichome type may be a morphological synapomorphy of Vitis and its closest tropical relative Ampelocissus and Pterisanthes in Vitaceae. The simple trichomes are documented in most species sampled in the genus. The glandular trichomes are multicellular, non-vascularized and composed of both epidermis and subjacent layers. We show that prickles occurring along the stems and petioles of Vitis davidii are modified glandular trichomes. We observed that glandular trichomes of V. romanetii secrete mucilage and volatile substances which trap insectes on the glands. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that metabolic products accumulate in vacuoles, the cytoplasm and intercellular spaces. We infer that glandular trichomes and young prickles are involved in the secretion of these metabolic products and the intercellular spaces may be the places of temporary storage of these secretions.", "journal": "Frontiers in plant science", "date": "2016-06-03", "authors": ["Zhi-YaoMa", "JunWen", "Stefanie MIckert-Bond", "Long-QingChen", "Xiu-QunLiu"], "doi": "10.3389/fpls.2016.00704\n10.2307/2442269\n10.17660/ActaHortic.2008.799.4\n10.1086/297436\n10.1006/anbo.1997.0550\n10.1093/aob/mcn052\n10.1007/s00606-014-1020-1\n10.2307/2443335\n10.1006/anbo.1997.0562\n10.1071/BT9880107\n10.1111/boj.12348\n10.1071/PP98052\n10.1139/b95-039\n10.1139/b11-008\n10.1093/aob/mch180\n10.1111/j.1439-0434.1999.tb03850.x\n10.1111/j.1469-8137.1991.tb04902.x\n10.1086/407484\n10.1016/j.envexpbot.2004.11.008\n10.1016/S0098-8472(97)00005-1\n10.1016/j.ympev.2012.09.003\n10.1016/j.ympev.2015.10.013\n10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00768.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0078680\n10.1086/337858\n10.1016/0889-1605(86)90038-8\n10.1093/aob/mcn237\n10.1007/s10526-008-9151-3\n10.2307/2806659\n10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02410.x\n10.1007/bf00202964\n10.3732/ajb.93.2.278\n10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04913.x\n10.3732/ajb.0900218\n10.1104/pp.124.2.665\n10.1139/b79-091\n10.1093/aob/mch011\n10.1186/1471-2148-13-141\n10.1371/journal.pone.0074394\n10.1016/S0065-2296(00)31005-9\n10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2012.04.011\n10.1007/s00018-012-1147-6\n10.1016/j.ympev.2011.11.015"}
{"title": "Retinopathy of Prematurity: Therapeutic Strategies Based on Pathophysiology.", "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) continues to be a major preventable cause of blindness and visual handicaps globally. With improved perinatal care, improved survival of moderately preterm infants, and limited resources for oxygen delivery and monitoring, more mature preterm infants are developing severe ROP in developing countries. The pathophysiology of ROP is characterized by two phases. Phase I ROP is due to vaso-obliteration beginning immediately after birth secondary to a marked decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Phase II begins around 33 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA). During this phase, VEGF levels increase, especially if there is retinal hypoxia with increasing retinal metabolism and demand for oxygen leading to abnormal vasoproliferation. Since the original description of ROP in 1942 by Terry et al. [Am J Ophthalmol 1942;25:203-204], four epidemics of ROP have been observed. Prevention or early treatment of ROP involves careful titration of oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2). Optimal SpO2 target remains elusive. Most of the large trials have focused on either a low SpO2 (85-89%) or a high SpO2 (91-95%) from the first day of birth to 36 weeks' PMA. Although the incidence of severe ROP and bronchopulmonary dysplasia decreased significantly, predischarge mortality was higher in these studies. Use of graded SpO2 during the 2 different phases of ROP (early, low SpO2 during phase I vs. late, high SpO2 during phase II) may be the best approach to prevent this disabling condition. Further trials should focus on this strategy. Other biological agents that are currently being studied include IGF-1 with IGF-binding protein-3 (rhIGF-1 + rhIGFBP-3) and propranolol. For advanced stages of ROP, laser ablation of avascular retina, early treatment of ROP (ETROP) protocol, intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF antibodies (e.g. bevacizumab) and vitrectomy are used to protect central vision and prevent retinal detachment. Long-term complications such as refractory errors, recurrence of ROP and risk of retinal detachment require continued follow-up with an ophthalmologist through adolescence and beyond. Optimal nutrition including adequate intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and decreasing infection/inflammation to promote normal vascularization are important strategies. Screening guidelines for ROP based on local incidence of ROP in different regions of the world are very important. Oxygen therapy is clearly a modifiable risk factor to decrease ROP that needs further study. Understanding the two phases of ROP will help to identify appropriate therapeutic strategies and improve visual outcomes in many preterm infants globally.", "journal": "Neonatology", "date": "2016-06-03", "authors": ["RowenaCayabyab", "RangasamyRamanathan"], "doi": "10.1159/000444901"}
{"title": "Growth Factor-Free Pre-vascularization of Cell Sheets for Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "The therapeutic efficacy of tissue-engineered constructs is often compromised by inadequate inosculation and neo-vascularization. This problem is considered one of the biggest hurdles in the field and finding a solution is currently the focus of a great fraction of the research community. Many of the methodologies designed to address this issue propose the use of endothelial cells and angiogenic growth factors, or combinations of both, to accelerate neo-vascularization after transplantation. However, an adequate solution is still elusive. In this context, we describe a methodology that combines the use of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from adipose tissue with low oxygen culture to produce pre-vascularized cell sheets as angiogenic tools for Tissue Engineering. The herein proposed approach takes advantage of the SVF angiogenic nature conferred by adipose stem cells, endothelial progenitors, endothelial and hematopoietic cells, and pericytes and further potentiates it using low oxygen, or hypoxic, culture. Freshly isolated nucleated SVF cells are cultured in hyperconfluent conditions under hypoxia (pO2\u2009=\u20095\u2009%) for up to 5 days in medium without extrinsic growth factors enabling the generation of contiguous sheets as described by the cell sheet engineering technique. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry allow confirming the phenotype of the different cell types composing the cell-sheets as well the organization of the CD31(+) cells in branched and highly complex tube-like structures. Overall, a simple and flexible approach to promote growth factor-free pre-vascularization of cell sheets for tissue engineering (TE) applications is described.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2016-06-03", "authors": ["MarinaCosta", "Rog\u00e9rio PPirraco", "Mariana TCerqueira", "Rui LReis", "Alexandra PMarques"], "doi": "10.1007/7651_2016_362"}

{"title": "Fibroblast recruitment as a tool for ovarian cancer detection and targeted therapy.", "abstract": "Metastatic ovarian cancer, the most lethal of gynecologic malignancies, is typically managed by debulking surgery, followed by chemotherapy. However, despite significant efforts, survival rate remains low. We have previously demonstrated, in mouse models, a specific systemic homing of labeled fibroblasts to solid ovarian tumors. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing this specific homing of genetically modified fibroblasts for detection and targeted therapy of orthotopic metastatic ovarian carcinoma model in immune-deficient mice. Using an in vivo metastatic mouse model for ovarian cancer, we demonstrated that fibroblasts expressing fluorescent reporters injected intra-peritoneally, were specifically recruited to peritoneal tumor nodules (resulting in 93-100% co-localization). We further used fibroblasts over expressing the soluble receptor variant of VEGFR1 (s-Flt1). Mice bearing tumors were injected weekly with either control or s-Flt1 expressing fibroblasts. Injection of s-Flt1 expressing fibroblasts resulted in a significant reduction in the ascites volume, reduced vascularization of adherent metastases, and improved overall survival. Using fluorescently labeled fibroblasts for tumor detection with readily available intra-operative fluorescence imaging tools may be useful for tumor staging and directing biopsies or surgical efforts during exploratory or debulking surgery.

Recurrence incidence was 8.3% (20/241) for infants and 7.2% (34/471) for eyes. Recurrence risk factors of greatest significance were appearance of neovascularization as APROP (P\u00a0= 0.006), extended duration of hospitalization (P\u00a0= 0.01), and lower birth weight (P\u00a0= 0.024). Recurrence risk period was between approximately 45 and 55 weeks AA (90.0% [18/20] for infants and 94.1% [32/34] for eyes), with mean recurrence of 51.2 weeks AA (\u00b14.6 weeks; range, 45.7-64.9 weeks) and mean interval of 16.2 weeks (\u00b14.4 weeks) between treatments. Recurrence characteristics included plus disease (20/20 infants [100%]) and neovascularization, which appeared at the following sites: stage 3+ ROP with confluent neovascularization recurred both at the advancing edge and at the initial ridge and extraretinal fibrovascular proliferative complex (12/14 infants [85.7%]). However, APROP (6/6 infants [100%]) and stage 3+ ROP with nonconfluent neovascularization (2/14 infants [14.3%]) recurred only at the advancing edge. Also, the anterior extent of retinal vascularization was decreased (mean, 1.76 disc diameters [DD] vs. 4.48 DD), and the rate of retinal vascularization was delayed (mean, 0.11 DD/week vs. 0.23 DD/week) in those with versus without recurrence, respectively. After retreatment with IVB, retinal vascularization proceeded minimally and slowly.\nPremature children with severe ROP are being treated successfully with IVB monotherapy.

We further show that obese patients with prostate cancer have increased epithelial CXCL1 expression.

Using mouse models, we show that the CXCL1 chemokine gradient is required for the obesity-dependent tumour ASC recruitment, vascularization and tumour growth promotion.

Critical-sized defects are unable to heal via natural regenerative processes and require surgical intervention, traditionally involving autologous bone (mainly in the form of nonvascularized grafts) or alloplasts. Autologous bone grafts remain the gold standard of care in spite of the associated risk of donor site morbidity. Tissue engineering approaches represent a promising alternative that would serve to facilitate bone regeneration even in large craniofacial skeletal defects. This strategy has been tested in a myriad of iterations by utilizing a variety of osteoconductive scaffold materials, osteoblastic stem cells, as well as osteoinductive growth factors and small molecules. One of the major challenges facing tissue engineers is creating a scaffold fulfilling the properties necessary for controlled bone regeneration. These properties include osteoconduction, osetoinduction, biocompatibility, biodegradability, vascularization, and progenitor cell retention. This review will provide an overview of how optimization of the aforementioned scaffold parameters facilitates bone regenerative capabilities as well as a discussion of common osteoconductive scaffold materials.", "journal": "Genes & diseases", "date": "2016-05-31", "authors": ["ViktorTollemar", "Zach JCollier", "Maryam KMohammed", "Michael JLee", "Guillermo AAmeer", "Russell RReid"], "doi": "10.1016/j.gendis.2015.09.004"}

Three hundred seven genes were differentially expressed after training in both groups. Training affected expression levels of genes related to extracellular matrix, glucose metabolism ,and vascularization. Expression of genes that were modulated by exercise training was indicative of muscle strength at baseline. Genes that strongly correlated with strength belonged to the protocadherin gamma gene cluster (\nOur data suggest significant remaining plasticity of ageing skeletal muscle to adapt to resistance-type exercise training.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of knee bracing on tibial rotation in ACL-reconstructed patients with a hamstring autograft during high loading activities. The hypothesis was that there would be a decrease in tibial rotation in the ACL-reconstructed braced knee as compared to the unbraced knee.\nTwenty male patients having undergone unilateral ACL reconstruction with a semitendinosus/gracilis autograft were assessed. Kinematic data were collected with an eight-camera optoelectronic system during two stressful tasks: (1) descending from a stair and subsequent pivoting; and (2) landing from a platform and subsequent pivoting. In each patient, three different experimental conditions were evaluated: (A) wearing a prophylactic brace (braced condition); (B) wearing a patellofemoral brace (sleeved condition); (C) without brace (unbraced condition). The intact knee without brace served as a control.\nTibial rotation was significantly lower in the intact knee compared to all three conditions of the ACL-reconstructed knee (P\u22640.01 for both tasks). Presence of a brace or sleeve resulted in lower tibial rotation than in the unbraced condition (p=0.003 for descending/pivot and P=0.0004 for landing/pivot). The braced condition resulted in lower rotation than the sleeved condition for descending/pivoting (P=0.031) while no differences were found for landing/pivoting (P=0.230).\nKnee bracing limited the excessive tibial rotation during pivoting under high loading activities in ACL-reconstructed knees with a hamstring graft.

We hypothesized that a prolonged inflammatory context, mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), would impact hrATs' secretory profile and mediate detrimental effects on the microvascular network in vitro. Analysis of conditioned media established tissue responsiveness through the increased secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (up to 23 fold), interleukin-6 (up to 69 fold) and angiopoietin-1 (up to 2.7 fold) after 3 and 6 days of cytokine exposure, along with a significant reduction in adiponectin secretion. Imaging of the preformed capillary network within the hrATs revealed increased disorganization in the presence of TNF/IL-1\u03b2, featuring a less extended and less ramified network with apoptotic hMVECs in the remaining capillary structures. These results indicate that a prolonged inflammatory context can be deleterious to the capillary network featured by in vitro engineered tissues. Strategies aiming at preserving the integrity of the vascular network will help develop substitutes that are better suited to face inflammatory conditions upon grafting.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

{"title": "Environmental manipulation to promote stem cell survival in vivo: use of aggregation, oxygen carrier, and BMP-2 co-delivery strategies.", "abstract": "While mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based strategies for critically-sized bone defect repair hold promise, poor cell survival in vivo remains a significant barrier to the translation of these therapeutics. One method employed to extend the survival of MSCs is the formation of three-dimensional aggregates, a strategy which modulates the immunomodulatory secretome of the cells, thereby influencing the local inflammatory environment and potentially bone tissue repair. Enrichment of cell-seeded hydrogels with oxygen carriers to counter the hypoxic conditions encountered in vivo or co-delivery of cells with growth factors, are also strategies employed to modulate the cell micro-environment. In this study, we examined the effect of human MSC (hMSC) and rat MSC (rMSC) aggregation on cell survival and bone tissue regeneration within both immunocompromised (nude) and syngeneic (Lewis) rat models. Despite a heightened release of paracrine factors from stem cell aggregates in vitro, the delivery of hMSC or rMSC aggregates in their respective rat models had no beneficial impact on cell survival, construct vascularization, or critically-sized bone defect repair. Co-delivery of oxygen carrier perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) within the alginate hydrogel delivery vehicle impeded in vivo bone regeneration in both MSC-seeded and acellular constructs. Although rMSC seeding was observed to enhance the osteoinductive potential of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)-containing constructs in vitro, co-delivery of rMSC and BMP-2 to the femoral defect space attenuated bone repair in vivo compared to BMP-2 delivery alone. Overall, despite in vitro evidence to the contrary, the present study observed no beneficial effects of these delivery strategies on cell-based bone tissue repair.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

{"title": "Development of an angiogenesis-promoting microvesicle-alginate-polycaprolactone composite graft for bone tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "One of the major challenges of bone tissue engineering applications is to construct a fully vascularized implant that can adapt to hypoxic environments in vivo. The incorporation of proangiogenic factors into scaffolds is a widely accepted method of achieving this goal. Recently, the proangiogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cell-derived microvesicles (MSC-MVs) has been confirmed in several studies. In the present study, we incorporated MSC-MVs into alginate-polycaprolactone (PCL) constructs that had previously been developed for bone tissue engineering applications, with the aim of promoting angiogenesis and bone regeneration. MSC-MVs were first isolated from the supernatant of rat bone marrow-derived MSCs and characterized by scanning electron microscopic, confocal microscopic, and flow cytometric analyses. The proangiogenic potential of MSC-MVs was demonstrated by the stimulation of tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. MSC-MVs and osteodifferentiated MSCs were then encapsulated with alginate and seeded onto porous three-dimensional printed PCL scaffolds. When combined with osteodifferentiated MSCs, the MV-alginate-PCL constructs enhanced vessel formation and tissue-engineered bone regeneration in a nude mouse subcutaneous bone formation model, as demonstrated by micro-computed tomographic, histological, and immunohistochemical analyses. This MV-alginate-PCL construct may offer a novel, proangiogenic, and cost-effective option for bone tissue engineering.", "journal": "PeerJ", "date": "2016-05-28", "authors": ["HuiXie", "ZhenxingWang", "LimingZhang", "QianLei", "AiqiZhao", "HongxiangWang", "QiubaiLi", "ZhichaoChen", "WenJieZhang"], "doi": "10.7717/peerj.2040\n10.3402/jev.v1i0.18163\n10.1089/biores.2015.0020\n10.1007/s00109-013-1110-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033115\n10.1371/journal.pone.0115316\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2006.06.014\n10.1016/j.tcb.2008.11.003\n10.1016/j.gene.2014.08.041\n10.1093/ndt/gfr015\n10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010814-124630\n10.1038/ncb2441\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.05.011\n10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2013.10.011\n10.1007/s00449-013-0947-x\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.08.008\n10.1089/ten.tec.2012.0651\n10.1007/s00281-011-0250-3\n10.1007/s11064-014-1288-0\n10.1186/1478-811X-12-26\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.11.007\n10.2174/156802608783790983\n10.1186/1749-799X-9-18\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.02.029\n10.1089/scd.2013.0594\n10.1002/term.2013\n10.1038/sj.leu.2404296\n10.1177/0885328211402243\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.07.003\n10.1016/j.abb.2014.07.006\n10.1088/1758-5082/1/1/015003\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.05.013\n10.1038/aps.2013.166\n10.1038/nri2567\n10.1124/pr.112.005983\n10.1089/ten.tea.2015.0071\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.04.046\n10.1089/scd.2012.0095\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.09.078\n10.1634/stemcells.2008-0456"}

Silk protein has been successfully used as a substrate to engineer corneal epithelium and stroma in vitro. Herein, we investigated the in vivo response and the effect of silk crystalline structure (beta sheet) on degradation rate of silk films in rabbit multipocket corneal models.\nThree different surgical techniques (peripheral-median P-M, central-superficial C-S, central-deep C-D) were used to assess the in vivo response as well as the degradation profile of silk films with low, medium and high beta sheet (crystalline) content at 2 and 3 months after surgery.\nApproach C-D showed signs of sample degradation without inflammation, with one single incision and a pocket created by flushing air two thirds deep in the corneal stroma. In comparison, approaches P-M and C-S with multiple incisions presented manually dissected surgical pockets resulted in inflammation and possible extrusion of the samples, respectively. Low beta sheet samples lost structural integrity at 2 months after surgery C-D, while medium and high beta sheet content films showed initial evidence of degradation.\nThe in vivo response to the silk films was dependent on the location of the implant and pocket depth.

Given its scalability, reproducibility, and precise multi-dimensional control that traditional fabrication methods do not provide, 3D bioprinting provides a powerful means to address one of the major challenges in tissue engineering: vascularization. Moderate success of current tissue engineering strategies have been attributed to the current inability to fabricate thick tissue engineering constructs that contain endogenous, engineered vasculature or nutrient channels that can integrate with the host tissue. Successful fabrication of a vascularized tissue construct requires synergy between high throughput, high-resolution bioprinting of larger perfusable channels and instructive bioink that promotes angiogenic sprouting and neovascularization. This review aims to cover the recent progress in the field of 3D bioprinting of vascularized tissues.

The study of some clinical and paraclinical factors for presumed malignancy makes it possible to codify appropriate therapeutic strategy. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of malignancy in nodular goiters and to compare our results with those reported in the literature. This retrospective study consisted of 500 cases of nodular goiter operated in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology (ear, nose and throat or ENT) and Head and Neck Surgery at Avicenne military hospital in Marrakech between 2006 and 2012. The percentage of cancers was 6,8%. The average age of our patients was 46 years, with a sex-ratio of 5 (F/H). The hard nature of the nodule was present in 94,4% of the cases of cancer by palpation; irregular boundaries were present in 64.70% of the cases of cancer. Three nodules were fixed and malignant. Cervical lymphadenopathy were observed in 8 patients, 7 of which had cancer. Ultrasound examination showed hypoechoic appearance in 61,8% of the malignant nodules, with smooth-edges in 88,24% of the cases. Intranodular vascularization was found in 35,3% of the cases of cancers, with microcalcifications in 55,9% of the cases. Perinodular hypoechoic halo was incomplete in 73,5% of the cases of cancer. Our patients were euthyroid in 84,6% of the cases. Predictors of malignancy in nodular goiters were present in our first clinical study: patients over the age of 60 years, hard consistency of nodule, fixity, irregular and poorly defined character by palpation, as well as presence of cervical adenopathy on examination; and echographic features: hypoechoic character, smooth-edges, presence of microcalcifications and visualization of intranodular vascularization with or without peri-nodular vascularization.

The average diameter of the superior lateral genicular artery, proximal to its distribution into the deep articular and superficial patellar branches, was 2 \u00b1 0.5 mm. A communication between deep articular and superficial patellar branches was seen in 96 percent of the dissected thighs. In 24 cases (86 percent), the authors were able to show the iliotibial band perforating vessel and harvest a free lateral femoral condyle flap as an osteochondral fasciocutaneous bone flap with vascularized tendon.\nAltogether, the authors' results indicate that the blood supply of the lateral femoral condyle flap is consistent and the lateral femoral condyle flap could serve as a free composite flap for complex indications in hand or limb reconstructive surgery. Clinical studies to compare the lateral femoral condyle to other well-established microsurgical free flaps are warranted.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2016-05-25", "authors": ["DaryouschParvizi", "AnnaVasilyeva", "PaulWurzer", "AlexandruTuca", "PatriciaLebo", "RaimundWinter", "Robert PClayton", "ThomasRappl", "Michael VSchintler", "Lars-PKamolz", "Heinz KBuerger"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0000000000002182"}

Granulomas and vasculitis, however, can involve many other tissues (especially pulmonary and renal). Dermatologic and subcutaneous components can lead to malignant pyoderma.\nThe authors describe a unique pathologic condition, where significant Le Fort type trauma was associated with subsequent development of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and malignant pyoderma. Successive operations to excise necrotic tissue and reconstruct the defects were followed by worsening inflammation and tissue erosions. Trauma and surgery in proximity to the eye and sinuses masked the initial clinical presentation and led to delay in diagnosis and disease progression. The resultant facial disfigurement and tissue loss were substantial.\nDespite multiple confounding factors, accurate diagnosis was eventually established. This was based on persistence of sinus inflammations in the absence of infective agents, proven sterility of lung lesions, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positivity with proteinase 3 specificity. Skin lesion biopsy specimens were identified as pyoderma gangrenosum and later as malignant pyoderma. Institution of immunosuppressive therapy allowed successful control of the disease and wound healing. The resulting craniofacial destruction, however, necessitated facial vascularized composite allotransplantation.\nRecognition of this rare pathologic association is essential, to prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment that can lead to major craniofacial tissue loss.\nTherapeutic, V.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2016-05-25", "authors": ["BrianGastman", "Ahmed MHashem", "RisalDjohan", "StevenBernard", "MarkHendrickson", "GrahamSchwarz", "Bahar BGharb", "AntonioRampazzo", "AnthonyFernandez", "JamesZins", "Gary SHoffman", "GabyDoumit", "MariaSiemionow", "FrancisPapay"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0000000000002162"}

Vascularized composite allotransplantation in solid organ recipients represents a unique opportunity because immunosuppression has already been accepted. This report of a simultaneous scalp, skull, kidney, and pancreas transplant represents both the first skull-scalp transplant and combination of a vascularized composite allotransplantation with double organ transplantation.\nA previous recipient of a kidney-pancreas transplant presented with osteoradionecrosis of the calvaria and a large area of unstable scalp following successful, curative treatment of a scalp tumor. His kidney and pancreas functions were also critically poor. A multidisciplinary, multi-institutional plan was developed to perform a simultaneous scalp, skull, and repeated kidney and pancreas transplantation, all from a single donor.\nEighteen months after the patient was listed with the United Network for Organ Sharing, a donor was identified and the multiorgan vascularized composite allotransplantation was performed. Twenty physicians and 15 hours were required to perform donor and recipient procedures. The patient recovered well and was discharged on postoperative day 15. He has had one episode of scalp rejection confirmed by biopsy and treated successfully. His creatinine value is currently 0.8 mg/dl, from 5.0 mg/dl, and his blood glucose levels are normal without supplemental insulin. Aesthetic outcome is very satisfactory. The patient is now 1 year post-transplantation and doing well.\nVascularized composite allotransplantation in solid organ recipients is an expansion of current indications to already immunosuppressed patients. Rejection of the vascularized composite allotransplant without solid organ rejection can occur and is treatable.

Although glucose starvation, which mimics ischemic conditions or insufficient vascularization, is known to perturb redox-homeostasis, global and individual protein glutathionylation in response to glucose metabolism or mitochondrial activity remains largely unknown. In this report, we use our clickable glutathione approach, which forms clickable glutathione (azido-glutathione) by using a mutant of glutathione synthetase (GS M4), for detection and identification of protein glutathionylation in response to glucose starvation. We found that protein glutathionylation is readily induced in HEK293 cells in response to low glucose concentrations when mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) are elevated in cells, and glucose is the major determinant for inducing reversible glutathionylation. Proteomic and biochemical analysis identified over 1300 proteins, including SMYD2, PP2C\u03b1, and catalase. We further showed that PP2C\u03b1 is glutathionylated at C314 in a C-terminal domain, and PP2C\u03b1 C314 glutathionylation disrupts the interaction with mGluR3, an important glutamate receptor associated with synaptic plasticity.", "journal": "Molecular bioSystems", "date": "2016-05-25", "authors": ["Kusal T GSamarasinghe", "Dhanushka N PMunkanatta Godage", "YaniZhou", "Fidelis TNdombera", "EranthieWeerapana", "Young-HoonAhn"], "doi": "10.1039/c6mb00175k"}

After 3 months, a mandibular bone construct was obtained and used for autologous transplantation. Osteogenesis and angiogenesis were assessed by real-time imaging, histology, and biomechanical tests during neo-bone formation and up to 6 months after transplantation surgery. A total of 20 animals received implantation of a mandibular bone negative mold along with a contralateral demineralized bone matrix scaffold. Resulting negative mold mandibular bone constructs showed anatomically, histologically, and functionally similar characteristics compared with native controls.

All the three lesions showed Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) characteristics of HGG and, for this reason, in all patients a fluorescein-guided tumor removal was proposed. In the same surgical procedure ICG videoangiography was considered necessary in order to study arterial and venous vasculature, given by the strict relation of the tumor with an unexpected Posterior Communicating Artery (PComA) aneurysm in one case and with cortical drainage veins complexes in the other two cases.

{"title": "Ribosomal Protein Rpl22 Controls the Dissemination of T-cell Lymphoma.", "abstract": "Mutations in ribosomal proteins cause bone marrow failure syndromes associated with increased cancer risk, but the basis by which they do so remains unclear. We reported previously that the ribosomal protein Rpl22 is a tumor suppressor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL), and that loss of just one Rpl22 allele accelerates T-cell lymphomagenesis by activating NF-\u03baB and inducing the stem cell factor Lin28B. Here, we show that, paradoxically, loss of both alleles of Rpl22 restricts lymphoma progression through a distinct effect on migration of malignant cells out of the thymus. Lymphoma-prone AKT2-transgenic or PTEN-deficient mice on an Rpl22(-/-) background developed significantly larger and markedly more vascularized thymic tumors than those observed in Rpl22(+/+) control mice. But, unlike Rpl22(+/+) or Rpl22(+/-) tumors, Rpl22(-/-) lymphomas did not disseminate to the periphery and were retained in the thymus. We traced the defect in the Rpl22(-/-) lymphoma migratory capacity to downregulation of the KLF2 transcription factor and its targets, including the key migratory factor sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1). Indeed, reexpression of S1PR1 in Rpl22-deficient tumor cells restores their migratory capacity in vitro The regulation of KLF2 and S1PR1 by Rpl22 appears to be proximal as Rpl22 reexpression in Rpl22-deficient lymphoma cells restores expression of KLF2 and S1P1R, while Rpl22 knockdown in Rpl22-sufficient lymphomas attenuates their expression. Collectively, these data reveal that, while loss of one copy of Rpl22 promotes lymphomagenesis and disseminated disease, loss of both copies impairs responsiveness to migratory cues and restricts malignant cells to the thymus.

{"title": "Bowel Radiation Injury: Complexity of the Pathophysiology and Promises of Cell and Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Ionizing radiation is effective to treat malignant pelvic cancers, but the toxicity to surrounding healthy tissue remains a substantial limitation. Early and late side effects not only limit the escalation of the radiation dose to the tumor but may also be life-threatening in some patients. Numerous preclinical studies determined specific mechanisms induced after irradiation in different compartments of the intestine. This review outlines the complexity of the pathogenesis, highlighting the roles of the epithelial barrier in the vascular network, and the inflammatory microenvironment, which together lead to chronic fibrosis. Despite the large number of pharmacological molecules available, the studies presented in this review provide encouraging proof of concept regarding the use of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy to treat radiation-induced intestinal damage. The therapeutic efficacy of MSCs has been demonstrated in animal models and in patients, but an enormous number of cells and multiple injections are needed due to their poor engraftment capacity. Moreover, it has been observed that although MSCs have pleiotropic effects, some intestinal compartments are less restored after a high dose of irradiation. Future research should seek to optimize the efficacy of the injected cells, particularly with regard to extending their life span in the irradiated tissue. Moreover, improving the host microenvironment, combining MSCs with other specific regenerative cells, or introducing new tissue engineering strategies could be tested as methods to treat the severe side effects of pelvic radiotherapy.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2016-05-20", "authors": ["LaraMoussa", "Beno\u00eetUsunier", "ChristelleDemarquay", "MarcBenderitter", "RadiaTamarat", "AlexandraS\u00e9mont", "No\u00eblleMathieu"], "doi": "10.3727/096368916X691664"}

In this study, we develop a heparin-based coacervate consisting of poly(ethylene argininylaspartate digylceride) (PEAD) as a storage matrix, heparin as a bridge, and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) as a cargo (namely heparin-FGF2@PEAD) for wound healing. First, in vitro characterization demonstrates the loading efficiency and control release of FGF2 from the heparin-FGF2@PEAD coacervate. The following in vivo studies examine the wound healing efficiency of the heparin-FGF2@PEAD coacervate upon delivering FGF2 to full-thickness excisional skin wounds in vivo, in comparison with the other three control groups with saline, heparin@PEAD as vehicle, and free FGF2. Collective in vivo data show that controlled release of FGF2 to the wounds by the coacervate significantly accelerates the wound healing by promoting cell proliferation, stimulating the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for re-epithelization, collagen deposition, and granulation tissue formation, and enhancing the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (CD31) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) for blood vessel maturation. In parallel, no obvious wound healing effect is found for the control, vehicle, and free FGF2 groups, indicating the important role of the coavervate in the wound healing process.

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was also employed to further evaluate the morphologic alterations of cocultured cells in the biologic bone. Results demonstrated that the coculture system combined with BMSCs and EPCs had significant advantages of (i) upregulating the mRNA expression of VEGF, Osteonectin, Osteopontin, and Collagen Type I and (ii) increasing ALP and OC staining compared to the BMSCs or EPCs only group. Moreover, IHC staining for CD105, CD34, and ZO-1 increased significantly in the implanted PDPBB seeded with coculture system, compared to that of BMSCs or EPCs only, respectively.

Colon interposition is mainly chosen as a second line treatment when the stomach cannot be used, when the stomach has to be resected for oncological or technical reasons, or when the stomach is deliberately kept intact for benign diseases in young patients with long-life expectancy. During the surgery the vascularization of the colon must be carefully assessed, as well as the type of the graft (right or left colon), the length of the graft, the surgical approach and the route of the reconstruction. Early complications such as graft necrosis or anastomotic leaks, and late complications such as redundancy depend on the quality of the initial surgery. Despite a complex and time-consuming procedure requiring at least three or four digestive anastomoses, reported long term functional outcomes of colon interposition are good, with an acceptable operative risk.

Hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) plays an essential role in angiogenesis-osteogenesis coupling during bone regeneration and can activate the expression of angiogenic factors in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) is an angiogenic small molecule that can inhibit prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes and thus regulate the stability of HIF-1\u03b1 in cells at normal oxygen tension. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MSCs (hiPSC-MSCs) are promising alternatives for stem cell therapy. In this study, we evaluated the effect of DMOG on promoting hiPSC-MSCs angiogenesis in tissue-engineered bone and simultaneously explored the underlying mechanisms in vitro. The effectiveness of DMOG in improving the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and its downstream angiogenic genes in hiPSC-MSCs demonstrated that DMOG significantly enhanced the gene and protein expression profiles of angiogenic-related factors in hiPSC-MSCs by sustaining the expression of HIF-1\u03b1. Further analysis showed that DMOG-stimulated hiPSC-MSCs angiogenesis was associated with the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and with an increase in VEGF production. The effects could be blocked by the addition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. In a critical-sized calvarial defect model in rats, DMOG-treated hiPSC-MSCs showed markedly improved angiogenic capacity in the tissue-engineered bone, leading to bone regeneration.

No effective treatments for diabetic bone healing are currently available, and most existing treatments do not directly address the diabetic complications that impair bone healing. We recently demonstrated that sustained and localized delivery of salicylic acid (SA) via an SA-based polymer provides a low-cost approach to enhance diabetic bone regeneration. Herein, we report mechanistic studies that delve into the biological action and local pharmacokinetics of SA-releasing polymers shown to enhance diabetic bone regeneration. The results suggest that low SA concentrations were locally maintained at the bone defect site for more than 1 month. As a result of the sustained SA release, a significantly reduced inflammation was observed in diabetic animals, which in turn, yielded reduced osteoclast density and activity, as well as increased osteoblastogenesis. Based upon these results, localized and sustained SA delivery from the SA-based polymer effectively improved bone regeneration in diabetic animals by affecting both osteoclasts and osteoblasts, thereby providing a positive basis for clinical treatments. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The authors' secondary goal was to study the aesthetic and functional outcomes after radical resection of GOF followed by immediate reconstruction.\nEighteen patients who underwent radical ablative surgery of GOF of the jaw followed by immediate reconstruction with vascularized fibula flap or ilium flap between May 2003 and May 2013 were taken.

{"title": "Rational Design of Prevascularized Large 3D Tissue Constructs Using Computational Simulations and Biofabrication of Geometrically Controlled Microvessels.", "abstract": "A major challenge in the development of clinically relevant 3D tissue constructs is the formation of vascular networks for oxygenation, nutrient supply, and waste removal. To this end, this study implements a multimodal approach for the promotion of vessel-like structures formation in stiff fibrin hydrogels. Computational simulations have been performed to identify the easiest microchanneled configuration assuring normoxic conditions throughout thick cylindrical hydrogels (8 mm height, 6 mm \u2205), showing that in our configuration a minimum of three microchannels (600 \u03bcm \u2205), placed in a non-planar disposition, is required. Using small hydrogel bricks with oxygen distribution equal to the microchanneled configuration, this study demonstrates that among different culture conditions, co-culture of mesenchymal and endothelial cells supplemented with ANG-1 and VEGF leads to the most developed vascular network. Microchanneled hydrogels have been then cultured in the same conditions both statically and in a bioreactor for 7 d. Unexpectedly, the combination between shear forces and normoxic conditions is unable to promote microvascular networks formation in three-channeled hydrogels. Differently, application of either shear forces or normoxic conditions alone results in microvessels outgrowth.

{"title": "Valgus osteotomy for nonunion and neglected neck of femur fractures.", "abstract": "Nonunion neck of femur can be a difficult problem to treat, particularly in the young, and is associated with high complication rates of avascular necrosis due to the precarious blood supply and poor biomechanics. The various treatment options that have been described can be broadly divided according to the aim of improving either biology or biomechanics. Surgeries aimed at improving the biology, such as vascularized fibula grafting, have good success rates but require high levels of expertise and substantial resources. A popular surgical treatment aimed at improving the biomechanics-valgus intertrochanteric osteotomy-optimizes conditions for fracture healing by converting shear forces across the fracture site into compressive forces. Numerous variations of this surgical procedure have been developed and successfully applied in clinical practice. As a result, the proximal femoral orientation for obtaining a good functional outcome has evolved over the years, and the present concept of altering the proximal femoral anatomy as little as possible has arisen. This technical objective supports attaining union as well as a good functional outcome, since excessive valgus can lead to increased joint reaction forces.

{"title": "Intermittent hypoxia training protects cerebrovascular function in Alzheimer's disease.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of death and disability among older adults. Modifiable vascular risk factors for AD (VRF) include obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, and metabolic syndrome. Here, interactions between cerebrovascular function and development of AD are reviewed, as are interventions to improve cerebral blood flow and reduce VRF. Atherosclerosis and small vessel cerebral disease impair metabolic regulation of cerebral blood flow and, along with microvascular rarefaction and altered trans-capillary exchange, create conditions favoring AD development. Although currently there are no definitive therapies for treatment or prevention of AD, reduction of VRFs lowers the risk for cognitive decline. There is increasing evidence that brief repeated exposures to moderate hypoxia, i.e. intermittent hypoxic training (IHT), improve cerebral vascular function and reduce VRFs including systemic hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and mental stress. In experimental AD, IHT nearly prevented endothelial dysfunction of both cerebral and extra-cerebral blood vessels, rarefaction of the brain vascular network, and the loss of neurons in the brain cortex. Associated with these vasoprotective effects, IHT improved memory and lessened AD pathology. IHT increases endothelial production of nitric oxide (NO), thereby increasing regional cerebral blood flow and augmenting the vaso- and neuroprotective effects of endothelial NO. On the other hand, in AD excessive production of NO in microglia, astrocytes, and cortical neurons generates neurotoxic peroxynitrite. IHT enhances storage of excessive NO in the form of S-nitrosothiols and dinitrosyl iron complexes. Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD, and IHT reduces oxidative stress in a number of experimental pathologies. Beneficial effects of IHT in experimental neuropathologies other than AD, including dyscirculatory encephalopathy, ischemic stroke injury, audiogenic epilepsy, spinal cord injury, and alcohol withdrawal stress have also been reported. Further research on the potential benefits of IHT in AD and other brain pathologies is warranted.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2016-05-18", "authors": ["Eugenia BManukhina", "H FredDowney", "XiangrongShi", "Robert TMallet"], "doi": "10.1177/1535370216649060"}
{"title": "Drug delivery strategies to control macrophages for tissue repair and regeneration.", "abstract": "Tissue repair and regeneration is a complex process. Our bodies have an excellent capacity to regenerate damaged tissues in many situations. However, tissue healing is impaired in injuries that exceed a critical size or are exacerbated by chronic inflammatory diseases like diabetes. In these instances, biomaterials and drug delivery strategies are often required to facilitate tissue regeneration by providing physical and biochemical cues. Inflammation is the body's response to injury. It is critical for wound healing and biomaterial integration and vascularization, as long as the timing is well controlled. For example, chronic inflammation is well known to impair healing in chronic wounds. In this review, we highlight the importance of a well-controlled inflammatory response, primarily mediated by macrophages in tissue repair and regeneration and discuss various strategies designed to promote regeneration by controlling macrophage behavior. These strategies include temporally controlled delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs, delivery of macrophages as cellular therapy, controlled release of cytokines that modulate macrophage phenotype, and the design of nanoparticles that exploit the inherent phagocytic behavior of macrophages. A clear outcome of this review is that a deeper understanding of the role and timing of complex macrophage phenotypes or activation states is required to fully harness their abilities with drug delivery strategies.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2016-05-18", "authors": ["RehamGarash", "AnamikaBajpai", "Brandon MMarcinkiewicz", "Kara LSpiller"], "doi": "10.1177/1535370216649444"}

This study characterized mobilization of vascular reparative bone marrow progenitor cells in mouse models of diabetes. Age-matched control or streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic, and db/db mice with lean-controls were studied. Mobilization induced by G-CSF, AMD3100 or ischemia was evaluated by flow cytometric enumeration of circulating Lin(-)Sca-1(+)cKit(+) (LSK) cells, and by colony forming unit (CFU) assay. The circulating WBCs and LSKs, and CFUs were reduced in both models with a shorter duration (10-12\u2009weeks) of diabetes compared to their respective controls. Longer duration of STZ-diabetes (\u226520\u2009weeks) induced impairment of G-CSF- or AMD3100-mobilization (P\u2009<\u20090.01, n\u2009=\u20098). In db/db mice, mobilization by G-CSF or AMD3100 was either increased or unaffected (P\u2009<\u20090.05, n\u2009=\u20096 to 8). Proliferation, migration, and ischemia-induced mobilization, of LSK cells were impaired in both models. Leptin receptor antagonist, PESLAN-1, increased G-CSF- or AMD3100-mobilization of WBCs and LSKs, compared to the untreated. Leptin increased basal WBCs, decreased basal and AMD3100-mobilized LSK cells, and had no effect on G-CSF. These results suggest that mobilopathy is apparent in STZ-diabetes but not in db/db mice.

To date noninvasive intra-operative imaging techniques have been inadequate to evaluate the revascularization of ADM.\nWe investigated the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of sidestream darkfield (SDF) microscopy to assess the status of ADM microvascular architecture in 8 patients at the time of tissue expander to permanent implant exchange during 2-stage ADM-assisted breast reconstruction. The SDF microscopy is a handheld device, which can be used intraoperatively for the real-time assessment of ADM blood flow, vessel density, vessel size, and branching pattern. The SDF microscopy was used to assess the microvascular architecture in the center and border zone of the ADM and to compare the native, non-ADM-associated capsule in each patient as a within-subject control.\nNo incidences of periprosthetic infection, explantation, or adverse events were reported after SDF image acquisition. Native capsules demonstrate a complex, layered architecture with an average vessel area density of 14.9 mm/mm and total vessel length density of 12.3 mm/mm. In contrast to native periprosthetic capsules, ADM-associated capsules are not uniformly vascularized structures and demonstrate 2 zones of microvascular architecture. The ADM and native capsule border zone demonstrates palisading peripheral vascular arcades with continuous antegrade flow. The central zone of the ADM demonstrates punctate perforating vascular plexi with intermittent, sluggish flow, and intervening 2- to 3-cm watershed zones.\nSidestream darkfield microscopy allows for real-time intraoperative assessment of ADM revascularization and serves as a potential methodology to compare revascularization parameters among commercially available ADMs. Thr SDF microscopy demonstrates that the periprosthetic capsule in ADM-assisted implant-based breast reconstruction is not a uniformly vascularized structure.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2016-05-18", "authors": ["Brent RDeGeorge", "J BryceOlenczak", "Patrick SCottler", "David BDrake", "Kant YLin", "Raymond FMorgan", "Christopher ACampbell"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0000000000000832"}

Placental glucocorticoid inactivation by 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11\u03b2-HSD2) plays a key role. We previously discovered that Hsd11b2(-/-) mice, lacking 11\u03b2-HSD2, show marked underdevelopment of the placental vasculature. We now explore the consequences for fetal cardiovascular development and whether this is reversible. We studied Hsd11b2(+/+), Hsd11b2(+/-), and Hsd11b2(-/-) littermates from heterozygous (Hsd11b(+/-)) matings at embryonic day (E)14.5 and E17.5, where all three genotypes were present to control for maternal effects. Using high-resolution ultrasound, we found that umbilical vein blood velocity in Hsd11b2(-/-) fetuses did not undergo the normal gestational increase seen in Hsd11b2(+/+) littermates. Similarly, the resistance index in the umbilical artery did not show the normal gestational decline. Surprisingly, given that 11\u03b2-HSD2 absence is predicted to initiate early maturation, the E/A wave ratio was reduced at E17.5 in Hsd11b2(-/-) fetuses, suggesting impaired cardiac function. Pravastatin administration from E6.5, which increases placental vascular endothelial growth factor A and, thus, vascularization, increased placental fetal capillary volume, ameliorated the aberrant umbilical cord velocity, normalized fetal weight, and improved the cardiac function of Hsd11b2(-/-) fetuses. This improved cardiac function occurred despite persisting indications of increased glucocorticoid exposure in the Hsd11b2(-/-) fetal heart. Thus, the pravastatin-induced enhancement of fetal capillaries within the placenta and the resultant hemodynamic changes correspond with restored fetal cardiac function.

We therefore sought to evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous intramyocardial injection of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microparticles (MPs) loaded with NRG1 and FGF1 using the NOGA MYOSTAR injection catheter in a porcine model of ischemia-reperfusion. NRG1- and FGF1-loaded MPs were prepared using a multiple emulsion solvent-evaporation technique. Infarcted pigs were treated one week after ischemia-reperfusion with MPs containing NRG1, FGF1 or non-loaded MPs delivered via clinically-translatable percutaneous transendocardial-injection. Three months post-treatment, echocardiography indicated a significant improvement in systolic and diastolic cardiac function. Moreover, improvement in bipolar voltage and decrease in transmural infarct progression was demonstrated by electromechanical NOGA-mapping. Functional benefit was associated with an increase in myocardial vascularization and remodeling.

The interactions between the neural ectoderm and oral ectoderm, especially the role of the pituitary organizer in shaping the pituitary precursor, Rathke's pouch, are well described. However, less is known about the role of head mesenchyme in pituitary organogenesis. The head mesenchyme is derived from definitive mesoderm and neural crest, but the relative contributions of these tissues to the mesenchyme adjacent to the pituitary are not known.\nWe carried out lineage tracing experiments using two neural crest-specific mouse cre lines, Wnt1-cre and P0-cre, and determined that the head mesenchyme rostral to the pituitary gland is neural crest derived. To assess the role of the neural crest in pituitary development we ablated it, using Wnt1-cre to delete Ctnnb1 (\u03b2-catenin), which is required for neural crest development. The Wnt1-cre is active in the neural ectoderm, principally in the mesencephalon, but also in the posterior diencephalon. Loss of \u03b2-catenin in this domain causes a rostral shift in the ventral diencephalon, including the pituitary organizer, resulting in pituitary dysmorphology.

{"title": "Incubation Temperature during Fetal Development Influences Morphophysiological Characteristics and Preferred Ambient Temperature of Chicken Hatchlings.", "abstract": "Skin and feather characteristics, which play a critical role in body temperature maintenance, can be affected by incubation circumstances, such as incubation temperature. However, no study to date has assessed the influence of incubation temperature during the fetal stage on morphometric characteristics and vascular development of the skin, feather characteristics, and their relationship to hormone levels and preferred temperature in later life in chickens. Broiler breeder eggs were exposed to low (36\u00b0C), control (37.5\u00b0C), or high (39\u00b0C) temperatures (treatments LT, CK, and HT, respectively) from day 13 of incubation onward, because it is known that the endocrine axes are already established at this time. During this period, eggshell temperature of HT eggs (38.8\u00b10.33\u00b0C) was higher than of LT (37.4\u00b10.08\u00b0C) and CK eggs (37.8 \u00b10.15\u00b0C). The difference between eggshell and incubator air temperature diminished with the increasing incubation temperature, and was approximately zero for HT. HT hatchlings had higher surface temperature on the head, neck, and back, and thinner and more vascularized skin than did CK and LT hatchlings. No differences were found among treatments for body weight, total feather weight, number and length of barbs, barbule length, and plasma T4 concentration. LT hatchlings showed lower plasma T3 and GH, as well as lower T3/T4 ratio and decreased vascularity in the neck, back, and thigh skin compared to CK hatchlings. On the other hand, HT hatchlings had decreased skin thickness and increased vascularity, and preferred a higher ambient temperature compared to CK and HT hatchlings. In addition, for all treatments, surface temperature on the head was higher than of the other body regions. We conclude that changes in skin thickness and vascularity, as well as changes in thyroid and growth hormone levels, are the result of embryonic strategies to cope with higher or lower than normal incubation temperatures.

{"title": "Deterministic and Stochastic Study for a Microscopic Angiogenesis Model: Applications to the Lewis Lung Carcinoma.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis modelling is an important tool to understand the underlying mechanisms yielding tumour growth. Nevertheless, there is usually a gap between models and experimental data. We propose a model based on the intrinsic microscopic reactions defining the angiogenesis process to link experimental data with previous macroscopic models. The microscopic characterisation can describe the macroscopic behaviour of the tumour, which stability analysis reveals a set of predicted tumour states involving different morphologies.

{"title": "Signaling pathways effecting crosstalk between cartilage and adjacent tissues: Seminars in cell and developmental biology: The biology and pathology of cartilage.", "abstract": "Endochondral ossification, the mechanism responsible for the development of the long bones, is dependent on an extremely stringent coordination between the processes of chondrocyte maturation in the growth plate, vascular expansion in the surrounding tissues, and osteoblast differentiation and osteogenesis in the perichondrium and the developing bone center. The synchronization of these processes occurring in adjacent tissues is regulated through vigorous crosstalk between chondrocytes, endothelial cells and osteoblast lineage cells. Our knowledge about the molecular constituents of these bidirectional communications is undoubtedly incomplete, but certainly some signaling pathways effective in cartilage have been recognized to play key roles in steering vascularization and osteogenesis in the perichondrial tissues. These include hypoxia-driven signaling pathways, governed by the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are absolutely essential for the survival and functioning of chondrocytes in the avascular growth plate, at least in part by regulating the oxygenation of developing cartilage through the stimulation of angiogenesis in the surrounding tissues. A second coordinating signal emanating from cartilage and regulating developmental processes in the adjacent perichondrium is Indian Hedgehog (IHH). IHH, produced by pre-hypertrophic and early hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate, induces the differentiation of adjacent perichondrial progenitor cells into osteoblasts, thereby harmonizing the site and time of bone formation with the developmental progression of chondrogenesis. Both signaling pathways represent vital mediators of the tightly organized conversion of avascular cartilage into vascularized and mineralized bone during endochondral ossification.", "journal": "Seminars in cell & developmental biology", "date": "2016-05-18", "authors": ["ChristaMaes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.semcdb.2016.05.007"}

The proposed adaptive sprout spacing model (ASS) determines position, time and number of sprouts which are activated from a parent vessel and also the developed vascular network is modified by a novel sprout branching prediction algorithm. This algorithm couples local vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations, stresses due to the blood flow and stochastic branching to the structural reactions of each vessel segment in response to mechanical and biochemical stimuli. The results provide predictions for the time-dependent development of the network structure, including the position and diameters of each segment and the resulting distributions of blood flow and VEGF. Considering time delays between sprout progressions and number of sprouts activated at different time durations provides information about micro-vessel density in the network.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are both involved in these processes. The in vitro administration of IGF-1 in association with VEGF is able to modulate the osteoblastic or endothelial commitment of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of different origins (e.g. periosteum and skin). In the present study, in order to deepen a possible paracrine effect of IGF-1 and VEGF on periosteum-derived progenitor cells (PDPCs) and skin-derived MSCs (S-MSCs), a Transwell coculture approach was used. We explored the genes involved in endothelial and osteoblastic differentiation, those modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathways as well as genes implicated in stemness (i.e. Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog). Periosteal cells, which are typically committed toward osteoblastogenesis, are driven in the direction of endothelial gene expression when influenced by S-MSCs. The latter, once influenced by PDPCs, lose their endothelial commitment and increase the expression of osteoblast-associated genes. PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways seem to be markedly involved in this behavior. Our results evidence that paracrine signals between MSCs may differently modulate their commitment in a bone microenvironment, opening stimulating viewpoints for skeletal tissue engineering strategies coupling angiogenesis and osteogenesis processes.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2016-05-15", "authors": ["ManuelaDicarlo", "NovellaBianchi", "ConcettaFerretti", "MoniaOrciani", "RobertoDi Primio", "MonicaMattioli-Belmonte"], "doi": "10.1159/000445346"}

Most WBV studies on animals have been performed at acceleration <1g and frequency between 30 and 90Hz. Such WBV conditions trigger bone growth in osteopenia models, but not in healthy animals. In order to test the ability of WBV to promote osteogenesis in young animals, we exposed seven-week-old male mice to vibration at 90Hz and 2g peak acceleration for 15min/day, 5 days/week. We examined the effects on skeletal tissues with micro-computed tomography and histology. We also quantified bone vascularization and mechanosensitive osteocyte proteins, sclerostin and DMP1. Three weeks of WBV resulted in an increase of femur cortical thickness (+5%) and area (+6%), associated with a 25% decrease of sclerostin expression, and 35% increase of DMP1 expression in cortical osteocytes. Mass-structural parameters of trabecular bone were unaltered in femur or vertebra, while osteoclastic parameters and bone formation rate were increased at both sites. Three weeks of WBV resulted in higher blood vessel numbers (+23%) in the distal femoral metaphysis. After 9-week WBV, we have not observed the difference in structural cortical or trabecular parameters. However, the tissue mineral density of cortical bone was increased by 2.5%. Three or nine weeks of 2g/90Hz WBV treatment did not affect longitudinal growth rate or body weight increase under our experimental conditions, indicating that these are safe to use.

Due to lack of available treatment methods to restore the cardiac function, various research strategies have come up to treat the ischemic myocardium. However these have met with limited success due to the complexity of the cardiac tissue, which exhibits a nanofibrous collagenous matrix with spatio-temporal localization of a combination of growth factors. To mimic the topographical and chemical cues of the natural cardiac tissue, we have fabricated a growth factor embedded nanofibrous scaffold through electrospinning. In our previous work, we have reported a nanofibrous matrix made of PLCL and PEOz with an average diameter of 500\u00a0nm. The scaffold properties were specifically characterized in\u00a0vitro for cardio-compatibility. In the present study, we have loaded dual growth factors VEGF and bFGF in the nanofiber matrix and investigated its suitability for cardiac tissue engineering. The encapsulation and release of dual growth factors from the matrix were studied using XPS and ELISA. Bioactivity of the loaded growth factors towards proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (HUVECs) was evaluated through MTS and Boyden chamber assays respectively. The efficiency of growth factors on the nanofibrous matrix to activate signaling molecules was studied in HUVECs through gene expression analysis. Preclinical evaluation of the growth factor embedded nanofibrous patch in a rabbit acute myocardial infarction (AMI) model was studied and cardiac function assessment was made through ECG and echocardiography.

The long term goal of this study was to harness the potential of inflammatory response to enhance angiogenesis and bone formation in three dimensional (3D) scaffolds. Towards this goal, we explored the use of resveratrol, a natural compound commonly used in complementary medicine, to enable the concurrently (i) mediate M1 to M2 macrophage plasticity, (ii) impart natural release of angiogenic factors by macrophages and (iii) enhance osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We mapped the time-dependent response of macrophage gene expression as well as hMSC osteogenic differentiation to varying doses of resveratrol. The utility of this approach was evaluated in 3D poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) sintered microsphere scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications.

{"title": "Maternal environment and placental vascularization in small ruminants.", "abstract": "Uteroplacental development is a crucial step facilitating conceptus growth. Normal placental development comprises extensive placental angiogenesis to support fetoplacental transport, meeting the metabolic demands of the fetus. Compromised pregnancies due to maternal stressors such as over or undernutrition, maternal age or parity, altered body mass index, or genetic background result in altered vascular development of the placenta. This negatively affects placental growth and placental function and ultimately results in poor pregnancy outcomes. Nonetheless, the placenta acts as a sensor to the maternal stressors and undergoes modifications, which some have termed placental programming, to ensure healthy development of the conceptus. Sex steroid hormones such as estradiol-17\u03b2 and progesterone, chemokines such as chemokine ligand 12, and angiogenic/vasoactive factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors, placental growth factor, angiopoietins, and nitric oxide regulate uteroplacental development and hence are often used as therapeutic targets to rescue compromised pregnancies. Interestingly, the presence of sex steroid receptors has been identified in the fetal membranes (developing fetal placenta). Environmental steroid mimetics known as endocrine disrupting compounds disrupt conceptus development and lead to transgenerational impairments by epigenetic modification of placental gene expression, which is another area deserving intense research efforts.

{"title": "Imaging in Chronic Kidney Disease.", "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis and staging are based on estimated or calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinalysis and kidney structure at renal imaging techniques. Ultrasound (US) has a key role in evaluating both morphological changes (by means of B-Mode) and patterns of vascularization (by means of color-Doppler and contrast-enhanced US), thus contributing to CKD diagnosis and to the follow-up of its progression. In CKD, conventional US allows measuring longitudinal diameter and cortical thickness and evaluating renal echogenicity and urinary tract status. Maximum renal length is usually considered a morphological marker of CKD, as it decreases contemporarily to GFR, and should be systematically recorded in US reports. More recently, it has been found to be a significant correlation of both renal longitudinal diameter and cortical thickness with renal function. Conventional US should be integrated by color Doppler, which shows parenchymal perfusion and patency of veins and arteries, and by spectral Doppler, which is crucial for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis and provides important information about intrarenal microcirculation. Different values of renal resistive indexes (RIs) have been associated with different primary diseases, as they reflect vascular compliance. Since RIs significantly correlate with renal function, they have been proposed to be independent risk factors for CKD progression, besides proteinuria, low GFR and arterial hypertension.

{"title": "Clinical Scenarios in Chronic Kidney Disease: Kidneys' Structural Changes in End-Stage Renal Disease.", "abstract": "Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are the most important manifestations of end-stage kidneys' structural changes. ACKD is caused by kidney damage or scarring and it is characterized by the presence of small, multiple cortical and medullary cysts filled with a fluid similar to preurine. ACKD prevalence varies according to predialysis and dialysis age and its pathogenesis is unknown, although it is stated that progressive destruction of renal tissue induces hypertrophy/compensatory hyperplasia of residual nephrons and may trigger the degenerative process. ACKD is almost asymptomatic, but it can lead to several complications (bleeding, rupture, infections, RCC). Ultrasound (US) is the first level imaging technique in ACKD, because of its sensitivity and reliability. The most serious complication of ACKD is RCC, which is stimulated by the same growth factors and proto-oncogenes that lead to the genesis of cysts. Two different histological types of RCC have been identified: (1) RCC associated with ACKD and (2) papillary renal clear cell carcinoma. Tumors in end-stage kidneys are mainly small, multifocal and bilateral, with a papillary structure and a low degree of malignancy. At US, RCC appears as a small inhomogeneous nodule (<3 cm), clearly outlined from the renal profile and hypoechoic if compared with sclerotic parenchyma. In some cases, tumor appears as a homogeneous and hyperechoic multifocal mass. The most specific US sign of a small tumor in end-stage kidney is the important arterial vascularization, in contrast with renal parenchymal vascular sclerosis.", "journal": "Contributions to nephrology", "date": "2016-05-14", "authors": ["MarioMeola", "SaraSamoni", "IlariaPetrucci"], "doi": "10.1159/000445475"}
{"title": "Phenotypic Transition as a Survival Strategy of Glioma.", "abstract": "Malignant glioma is characterized by rapid proliferation, invasion into surrounding central nervous system tissues, and aberrant vascularization. There is increasing evidence that shows gliomas are more complex than previously thought, as each tumor comprises considerable intratumoral heterogeneity with mixtures of genetically and phenotypically distinct subclones. Heterogeneity within and across tumors is recognized as a critical factor that limits therapeutic progress for malignant glioma. Recent genotyping and expression profiling of gliomas has allowed for the creation of classification schemes that assign tumors to subtypes based on similarity to defined expression signatures. Also, malignant gliomas frequently shift their biological features upon recurrence and progression. The ability of glioma cells to resist adverse conditions such as hypoxia and metabolic stress is necessary for sustained tumor growth and strongly influences tumor behaviors. In general, glioma cells are in one of two phenotypic categories: higher proliferative activity with angiogenesis, or higher migratory activity with attenuated proliferative ability. Further, they switch phenotypic categories depending on the situation. To date, a multidimensional approach has been employed to clarify the mechanisms of phenotypic shift of glioma. Various molecular and signaling pathways are involved in phenotypic shifts of glioma, possibly with crosstalk between them. In this review, we discuss molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity of glioma cells and mechanisms of phenotypic shifts in regard to the glioma proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie phenotypic shifts of glioma may provide new insights into targeted therapeutic strategies.", "journal": "Neurologia medico-chirurgica", "date": "2016-05-14", "authors": ["TomotsuguIchikawa", "YoshihiroOtani", "KazuhikoKurozumi", "IsaoDate"], "doi": "10.2176/nmc.ra.2016-0077"}

{"title": "Long-range enhancers modulate Foxf1 transcription in blood vessels of pulmonary vascular network.", "abstract": "Intimate crosstalk occurs between the pulmonary epithelium and the vascular network during lung development. The transcription factor forkhead box f1 (Foxf1) is expressed in the lung mesenchyme and plays an indispensable role in pulmonary angiogenesis. Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a signalling molecule, is expressed in lung epithelium and is required to establish proper angiogenesis. It has been suggested that Foxf1, a downstream target of the Shh signalling pathway, mediates interaction between angiogenesis and the epithelium in lung. However, there has been no clear evidence showing the mechanism how Foxf1 is regulated by Shh signalling pathway during lung development. In this study, we investigated the lung-specific enhancers of Foxf1 and the Gli binding on the enhancers. At first, we found three evolutionarily conserved Foxf1 enhancers, two of which were long-range enhancers. Of the long-range enhancers, one demonstrated tissue-specific activity in the proximal and distal pulmonary blood vessels, while the other one demonstrated activity only in distal blood vessels. At analogous positions in human, these long-range enhancers were included in a regulatory region that was reportedly repeatedly deleted in alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary vein patients, which indicates the importance of these enhancers in pulmonary blood vessel formation. We also determined that Gli increased the activity of one of these long-range enhancers, which was specific to distal blood vessel, suggesting that Shh regulates Foxf1 transcription in pulmonary distal blood vessel formation.", "journal": "Histochemistry and cell biology", "date": "2016-05-12", "authors": ["HyejinSeo", "JinsunKim", "Gi-HeePark", "YuriKim", "Sung-WonCho"], "doi": "10.1007/s00418-016-1445-4"}

{"title": "[Age-related Macular Degeneration in the Japanese].", "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the Japanese often shows different clinical features from those described in Caucasians. For example, we often observe choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in elderly patients without drusen in the fundus. The high incidence of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in AMD among Japanese is well-known. The reason why such differences occur in clinical manifestations of AMD has been one of my main interests. In this review article, I will discuss the characteristics of AMD in the Japanese population, as found in our recent study. I. Prevalence and clinical characteristics of AMD in the Japanese population. Cohort studies are important to determine the prevalence and incidence of diseases. In Japan, cohort studies began to be carried out rather late compared with Western countries. Although good cohort studies from Japan are reported in the literature, the size of the cohorts was not sufficiently large to determine the prevalence of AMD. However, a recent meta-analysis of Asian cohorts has shown that the prevalence of late AMD in Asians is not different from that reported in Caucasians. On the other hand, the prevalence of early AMD appears lower in the Japanese than in Caucasians. Recently, we have published the results of the Nagahama Cohort study. In this cohort study, we found a high prevalence of drusen. It seems that the incidence of dry AMD is likely to increase among Japanese. In Japan, most retina specialists classify AMD into three categories : typical AMD, PCV, and retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP). However, there are no definite diagnostic criteria to distinguish between the three conditions. To compare the clinical features of Japanese and Western cases of AMD, and to determine the incidence of the three types of AMD, we exchanged data about 100 consecutive cases between Kyoto University and Centre d'Ophtalmologie de Paris, France. Interestingly, the diagnoses made by the two institutes were not always in agreement. We also found more cases of PCV among the Japanese than among the French. II. PCV. About 50% of exudative AMD cases in the Japanese population are PCV. Because of its peculiar angiographic findings, PCV has long been considered to be a distinct clinical entity different from the usual exudative AMD. Also, there have been serious discussions on the nature of PCV. In our analyses, about 20% of PCV cases show rather large lesion sizes that exceed the vascular arcade. Scar formation in the macula and compromised vision are frequent findings in such cases. The occurrence of PCV in the inferior staphyloma or in angioid streaks shows heterogeneity in PCV. These findings suggest that PCV may be a finding on indocyanine green angiography rather than a distinct clinical entity. Spectral domain OCT examination shows that the branching vascular network of PCV is located between the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch's membrane. In cases with retinal pigment epithelial detachment, CNV from the branching vascular network was found to extend along the roof of the detached retinal pigment epithelium. Such findings show that the branching vascular network of PCV is type 1 CNV. Complement factor H (CFH) and age-related maculopathy 2 (ARMS2)/High temperature requirement 1 (HTRA1) located on chromosome 10 (10q26) are well-established disease susceptible genes of AMD. In the Japanese, the prevalence of CFH Y402H gene polymorphism is low and ARMS2/HITRA1 plays a more important role in the development of AMD. In ARMS2 A69S polymorphism, a large deletion/insertion (443de1/54ins) that is reported in Caucasians was also found in Japanese. Thus, the genetic background of Caucasian and Japanese AMD is quite similar, as is also the case with exudative AMD and PCV. Our findings show that PCV is not a distinct clinical entity but is a subtype of exudative AMD. III. Exudative AMD with choroidal vascular hyperpermeability. Choroidal vascular hyperpermeability observed in central serous chorioretinopathy can be found in about 20% to 30% of exudative AMD cases in Japanese. Such cases often show a thick choroid, lack of drusen, and rather good visual prognosis with slow progression of the disease. Recently, \"pachychoroid neovasculopathy\" has been described by a group from New York. Such cases of AMD with choroidal vascular hyperpermeability, a thick choroid, and lack of drusen appears to belong to pachychoroid neovasculopathy. We studied the risk allele frequencies of CFH I62V and ARMS2 A69S gene polymorphisms in three groups : usual exudative AMD, pachychoroid neovasculopathy, and normal controls. Interestingly, cases of pachychoroid neovasculopathy show different gene polymorphisms of CFH I62V and ARMS2 A69S from the usual cases of exudative AMD and a more similar pattern to normal controls. Therefore, the possible mechanisms of the CNV development in such cases may differ from the classic well-documented drusen-dependent pathways. IV. Atrophic AMD in Japanese. Data from the Nagahama Cohort study show an increasing prevalence of drusen in Japanese. Recently, more extensive information on drusen has become available and the redefinition of drusen is currently in progress. In particular, the importance of reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) is more widely appreciated. This type of drusen is often found in Japanese AMD. Although the nature and location of RPD are still debatable, many investigators believe that this type of drusen is located under the sensory retina rather than under Bruch's membrane. In our analyses, RPD was found in 18.4% of late AMD cases in Japanese. It was more common in eyes with RAP or atrophic AMD and was seldom found in PCV. ARMS2 A69S gene polymorphism was found more frequently in cases of exudative AMD with RPD, than in cases of exudative AMD without RPD. Eyes with RPD show a thin choroid and diminished vascular densities of choroidal vessels.", "journal": "Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi", "date": "2016-05-12", "authors": ["NagahisaYoshimura"], "doi": null}
{"title": "The Application of Ultrasound in 3D Bio-Printing.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is an emerging and promising technology in tissue engineering to construct tissues and organs for implantation. Alignment of self-assembly cell spheroids that are used as bioink could be very accurate after droplet ejection from bioprinter. Complex and heterogeneous tissue structures could be built using rapid additive manufacture technology and multiple cell lines. Effective vascularization in the engineered tissue samples is critical in any clinical application. In this review paper, the current technologies and processing steps (such as printing, preparation of bioink, cross-linking, tissue fusion and maturation) in 3D bio-printing are introduced, and their specifications are compared with each other. In addition, the application of ultrasound in this novel field is also introduced. Cells experience acoustic radiation force in ultrasound standing wave field (USWF) and then accumulate at the pressure node at low acoustic pressure. Formation of cell spheroids by this method is within minutes with uniform size and homogeneous cell distribution. Neovessel formation from USWF-induced endothelial cell spheroids is significant. Low-intensity ultrasound could enhance the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. Its use is at low cost and compatible with current bioreactor.

The bridges comprise the ligaments of the liver as follows: the falciform ligament, right and left coronary ligaments, lesser omentum including the hepatogastric ligament and hepatoduodenal ligament. Each ligament has specific communications between the intrahepatic and extrahapetic vessels. The venous communications called as the portosystemic shunt would become apparent in patients with portal hypertension, intrahepatic portal vein thrombosis and superior vena cava syndrome. The location of the venous communication is related to the pseudolesion or focal enhancement of the liver demonstrated on the CT scan. The arterial communications called collateral vascularization would become apparent in patients with hepatic artery occlusion, especially post-transhepatic arterial embolization, or in patients with the hepatic tumour abutting diaphragm. The knowledge of these collateral arteries is necessary to accomplish the effective transarterial embolization for the hepatic tumours.

{"title": "Chronic Rejection in Human Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation (Hand and Face Recipients): An Update.", "abstract": "Vascularized composite tissue allografts (VCA) have become a viable option to restore severely damaged parts of the body that cannot be repaired with conventional surgical techniques. Acute rejection develops frequently in the early postgraft period both in human and experimental VCA, but the possibility of human VCA to undergo chronic rejection (CR) remained initially unknown. The experience gained over the years shows that, similar to solid organ transplants (SOT), human VCA can also develop CR. Chronic rejection is clinically mostly apparent on the skin and targets preferentially skin and deep vessels, leading, as in SOT, to graft vasculopathy and often to graft loss. Dermal sclerosis and adnexal atrophy are additional features of CR. The pathogenetic immune mechanisms involved (cell-mediated versus humoral) remain incompletely known. The changes of CR can be detected with skin and deep tissue biopsies. Modern in vivo imaging tools can detect vascular narrowing and have the advantage of being noninvasive. However, the diagnosis and treatment of CR remain challenging, as several important questions remain to be answered: a more accurate definition of CR in VCA is needed to establish criteria allowing an accurate and early diagnosis. The pathogenetic mechanisms of CR need to be better understood to allow more efficacious treatment. Favoring/triggering factors of CR need to be better known so that they can be avoided. As in SOT, there is a need for efficient tolerance-inducing protocols that will favor graft acceptance and (ideally) circumvent the necessity of lifelong immunosuppression.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2016-05-11", "authors": ["JeanKanitakis", "PalminaPetruzzo", "LionelBadet", "AramGazarian", "OlivierThaunat", "SylvieTestelin", "BernardDevauchelle", "Jean-MichelDubernard", "EmmanuelMorelon"], "doi": "10.1097/TP.0000000000001248"}

{"title": "Inosculation and perfusion of pre-vascularized tissue patches containing aligned human microvessels after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "A major goal of tissue engineering is the creation of pre-vascularized tissues that have a high density of organized microvessels that can be rapidly perfused following implantation. This is especially critical for highly metabolic tissues like myocardium, where a thick myocardial engineered tissue would require rapid perfusion within the first several days to survive transplantation. In the present work, tissue patches containing human microvessels that were either randomly oriented or aligned were placed acutely on rat hearts post-infarction and for each case it was determined whether rapid inosculation could occur and perfusion of the patch could be maintained for 6 days in an infarct environment. Patches containing self-assembled microvessels were formed by co-entrapment of human blood outgrowth endothelial cells and human pericytes in fibrin gel. Cell-induced gel contraction was mechanically-constrained resulting in samples with high densities of microvessels that were either randomly oriented (with 420\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0140 lumens/mm(2)) or uniaxially aligned (with 940\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0240\u00a0lumens/mm(2)) at the time of implantation. These patches were sutured onto the epicardial surface of the hearts of athymic rats following permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery. In both aligned and randomly oriented microvessel patches, inosculation occurred and perfusion of the transplanted human microvessels was maintained, proving the in\u00a0vivo vascularization potential of these engineered tissues. No difference was found in the number of human microvessels that were perfused in the randomly oriented (111\u00a0\u00b1\u00a075 perfused lumens/mm(2)) and aligned (173\u00a0\u00b1\u00a097 perfused lumens/mm(2)) patches.

{"title": "PO-12 - The key role of talin-1 in cancer cell extravasation dissected through human vascularized 3D microfluidic model.", "abstract": "Metastases are responsible for more than 90% of cancer related mortality. The hematogenous metastatic invasion is a complex process in which the endothelium plays a key role. Extravasation is a dynamic process involving remodeling and change in cell shape and in cytoskeleton whereby a series of strongly dependent interactions between CTCs and endothelium occurs [1]. Talins are proteins regulating focal adhesions and cytoskeleton remodeling. Talin-1 seems to be involved in the aggressiveness, motility, survival and invadopodia formation of cancer cells throughout the entire metastatic cascade [2], being up-regulated in breast cancer cells and mutated in sarcomas. Understand the implication of talin-1 in extravasation could facilitate the design of new therapies and finally fight cancer.\nWe hypothesized that Talin-1 could be specifically involved in extravasation driving each of its steps.\nWe developed a human 3D microfluidic model that enables the study of human cancer cell extravasation within a perfusable human microvascularized organ specific environment[3]. For the study of extravasation we applied microfluidic approach through the development of a microfluidic device in which endothelial cells and fibroblasts generated a 3D human functional vascular networks. Microvessel characterization was performed with immunofluorescence and permeability assays. We knocked-down talin-1 in triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 and metastatic fibro-sarcoma cell line HT1080 with SiRNA and verified by Western-blot. Cancer cells were then perfused in the vessels and extravasation monitored through confocal imaging.\nWe developed a human vascularized 3D microfluidic device with human perfusable capillary-like structures embedded in fibrin matrix, characterized by mature endothelium markers and physiological permeability (1.5\u00b10.76)\u00d710(-6) cm/s. We focused on the role of Talin-1 in adhesion to endothelium, trans-endothelial migration (TEM) and early invasion. Adhesion to the endothelium, TEM and migration within the ECM were monitored through confocal analyses. We demonstrated that Talin-1 KD significantly reduced the adhesion efficiency and TEM in both cell lines. Early invasion was also strongly and statistically reduced by the SiRNA treatment in both cell lines.\nWe proved Talin-1 function in driving the extravasation mechanism in a human 3D vascularized environment. We demonstrated that Talin-1 is involved in each part of extravasation significantly affecting adhesion, TEM and the invasion stages. Targeting this protein could thus be an effective strategy to block metastasis.", "journal": "Thrombosis research", "date": "2016-05-11", "authors": ["MGilardi", "SBersini", "A BoussomierCalleja", "R DKamm", "MVanoni", "MMoretti"], "doi": "10.1016/S0049-3848(16)30145-1"}

{"title": "Neopterin Release and Tryptophan Degradation in Patients with Uveitis.", "abstract": "Uveitis is an intraocular inflammation affecting the highly vascularized uveal tissue. Early recognition and appropriate therapeutic intervention of uveitis are important since the condition may be associated with systemic disease and untreated uveitis may lead to blindness. Neopterin, an unconjugated pteridine, is an important biomarker of cell-mediated immunity and has a potential function in the process of inflammation. In addition to neopterin release, cellular immune activation also induces indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). In this study, the aim was to investigate possible immune changes in uveitis by determination of neopterin concentrations and tryptophan (Trp) degradation.\nThe participants who attended to the ophthalmology clinic with uveitis were divided into two groups: active (n = 63) and remission (n = 41). Additionally 30 healthy subjects were recruited as a control group.\nIn total, in 104 uveitis patients, urinary and serum neopterin, kynurenine (Kyn), and Kyn/Trp were found to be statistically higher than the 30 controls (all, p < 0.05). It was observed that all of the measured parameters did not differ between active and remission uveitis groups (all, p > 0.05), except for the Kyn/Trp ratio (p < 0.05). Urinary and serum neopterin levels were positively correlated with Kyn/Trp in the uveitis patients (both p < 0.05).\nFrom these results, it can be concluded that uveitis can cause alterations in neopterin levels and the Kyn pathway.

Therefore, an appropriate alternative scaffold is needed to expand the donor pool. In this study, we explored the effectiveness of decellularized spleen matrix (DSM) for culturing of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), and promoting differentiation into hepatic-like cells.\nRats' spleen were harvested for DSM preparation by freezing/thawing and perfusion procedure. Then the mesenchymal stem cells derived from rat bone marrow were reseeded into DSM for dynamic culture and hepatic differentiation by a defined induction protocol.\nThe research found that DSM preserved a 3-dimensional porous architecture, with native extracellular matrix and vascular network which was similar to DLM. The reseeded BMSCs in DSM differentiated into functional hepatocyte-like cells, evidenced by cytomorphology change, expression of hepatic-associated genes and protein markers, glycogen storage, and indocyanine green uptake.

We hypothesized that intraosseous (IO) injections of drug antidotes into the vascularized bone marrow will provide a more rapid and effective means to treat exposure to nerve agents than standard intramuscular (IM) injections. We compared the pharmacokinetics of IM and IO administration of pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM Cl) during normovolemia and hypovolemia, as well as their combined administration during normovolemia in swine.\nTen normovolemic swine were randomly administered 2\u00a0mL, 660\u00a0mg 2-PAM Cl via the IM or IO route and monitored for 180 minutes. IM versus IO also was compared in 8 hypovolemic swine bled to a mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg. In a combined group, an IO injection was administered followed by an IM injection 60 minutes later. Blood samples were collected at times over a 180-minute period to calculate standard pharmacokinetic variables to compare the 2 routes of administration.\nIn the normovolemic swine, IM injection achieved therapeutic levels (4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) in 2 minutes, whereas IO infusion achieved these levels in less than 15 seconds. 2-PAM-Cl concentrations fell below these levels at 60 minutes post-injection in both groups. In the hypovolemic swine, IM injection achieved therapeutic levels in 4 minutes compared to less than 15 seconds in the IO group. 2-PAM-Cl concentrations fell below therapeutic levels at 12 and 90 minutes post-injection in the IM and IO groups, respectively. In the combined IO-IM treatment, plasma levels remained above therapeutic levels for the entire experiment and had two concentration peaks that corresponded to IO and IM injections.\nThe IO route for the delivery of 2-PAM Cl provides a significant time and high initial blood concentrations advantage compared to the IM route for the prehospital treatment of nerve agent exposure even under hypovolemic conditions.

Such network can be exploited to target any parts inside the human body with further accessibility through physiological spaces such as the interstitial microenvironments. This fact has triggered research initiatives towards the development of new medical tools in the form of microscopic robotic agents designed for surgical, therapeutic, imaging, or diagnostic applications. To push the technology further towards medical applications, nanotechnology including nanomedicine has been integrated with principles of robotics. This new field of research is known as medical nanorobotics. It has been particularly creative in recent years to make what was and often still considered science-fiction to offer concrete implementations with the potential to enhance significantly many actual medical practices. In such a global effort, two main strategic trends have emerged where artificial and synthetic implementations presently compete with swimming microorganisms being harnessed to act as medical nanorobotic agents. Recognizing the potentials of each approach, efforts to combine both towards the implementation of hybrid nanorobotic agents where functionalities are implemented using both artificial/synthetic and microorganism-based entities have also been initiated.

The accumulation of targeted microbubbles at tissue sites overexpressing specific molecular markers increases the backscattered signal for noninvasive evaluations of diseases. The aim of this preliminary study was to combine molecular imaging with an in vivo contrast agent quantification to support the early diagnosis of the pathology and to enhance the assessment of neoplastic tissues. Tumor growth was induced by subcutaneous injection of prostate cancer cells in four rats. Microbubbles targeted to tissue factor (TF) were administered. A vascularized region located in proximity to the tumor and centered around the focus depth was analyzed in each animal. The backscattered signals (i.e. the radio-frequency data) were acquired during two different perfusion conditions to evaluate the contribution of attached microbubbles. After image generation by means of a multi-pulse contrast-enhanced technique, a nonlinear regression method based on the support vector machine was employed to estimate the contrast agent concentrations in cubic voxels (1-mm side length). The number of attached microbubbles per mm(3) was estimated based on a multi-dimensional vector of features extracted from the processed radio-frequency signals. A significant correlation (p\u2009<\u20090.05) between the size of the tumors and the estimated microbubble concentration was found, thus opening the possibility for combining molecular imaging and contrast agent concentration mapping to refine pathology evaluation.

{"title": "Turning the gun on cancer: Utilizing lysosomal P-glycoprotein as a new strategy to overcome multi-drug resistance.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a role in the development of drug resistance in cancer cells. Cancer cells must constantly and rapidly adapt to changes in the tumor microenvironment, due to alterations in the availability of nutrients, such as glucose, oxygen and key transition metals (e.g., iron and copper). This nutrient flux is typically a consequence of rapid growth, poor vascularization and necrosis. It has been demonstrated that stress factors, such as hypoxia and glucose deprivation up-regulate master transcription factors, namely hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), which transcriptionally regulate the multi-drug resistance (MDR), transmembrane drug efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Interestingly, in addition to the established role of plasma membrane Pgp in MDR, a new paradigm of intracellular resistance has emerged that is premised on the ability of lysosomal Pgp to transport cytotoxic agents into this organelle. This mechanism is enabled by the topological inversion of Pgp via endocytosis resulting in the transporter actively pumping agents into the lysosome. In this way, classical Pgp substrates, such as doxorubicin (DOX), can be actively transported into this organelle. Within the lysosome, DOX becomes protonated upon acidification of the lysosomal lumen, causing its accumulation. This mechanism efficiently traps DOX, preventing its cytotoxic interaction with nuclear DNA. This review discusses these effects and highlights a novel mechanism by which redox-active and protonatable Pgp substrates can utilize lysosomal Pgp to gain access to this compartment, resulting in catastrophic lysosomal membrane permeabilization and cell death. Hence, a key MDR mechanism that utilizes Pgp (the \"gun\") to sequester protonatable drug substrates safely within lysosomes can be \"turned on\" MDR cancer cells to destroy them from within.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2016-05-08", "authors": ["NicoleSeebacher", "Darius J RLane", "Des RRichardson", "Patric JJansson"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.04.201"}

However, there exist a variety of different harvesting methods, with unclear impact on ASC regenerative potential. The aim of this study was thus to compare the functionality of ASCs derived from the common technique of suction-assisted lipoaspiration (SAL) versus resection.\nHuman adipose tissue was obtained from paired abdominoplasty and SAL samples from three female donors, and was processed to isolate the stromal vascular fraction. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to determine ASC yield, and cell viability was assayed. Adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity were assessed in vitro using phenotypic staining and quantification of gene expression. Finally, ASCs were applied in an in vivo model of tissue repair to evaluate their regenerative potential.\nSAL specimens provided significantly fewer ASCs when compared to excised fat tissue, however, with equivalent viability.\u00a0SAL-derived ASCs demonstrated greater expression of the adipogenic markers FABP-4 and LPL, although this did not result in a difference in adipogenic differentiation. There were no differences detected in osteogenic differentiation capacity as measured by alkaline phosphatase, mineralization or osteogenic gene expression.

It can be pictured as a semiflexible nanofiber (\u223c900 nm long and \u223c8 nm wide) made of a DNA core and a protein shell with the former genetically encoding the latter. Although phage bioengineering and phage display techniques were developed before the 1990s, these techniques have not been widely used for chemistry, materials, and biomedical research from the perspective of supramolecular chemistry until recently. Powered by our expertise in displaying a foreign peptide on its surface through engineering phage DNA, we have employed phage to identify target-specific peptides, construct novel organic-inorganic nanohybrids, develop biomaterials for disease treatment, and generate bioanalytical methods for disease diagnosis. Compared with conventional biomimetic chemistry, phage-based supramolecular chemistry represents a new frontier in chemistry, materials science, and medicine. In this Account, we introduce our recent successful efforts in phage-based supramolecular chemistry, by integrating the unique nanofiber-like phage structure and powerful peptide display techniques into the fields of chemistry, materials science, and medicine: (1) successfully synthesized and assembled silica, hydroxyapatite, and gold nanoparticles using phage templates to form novel functional materials; (2) chemically introduced azo units onto the phage to form photoresponsive functional azo-phage nanofibers via a diazotization reaction between aromatic amino groups and the tyrosine residues genetically displayed on phage surfaces; (3) assembled phage into 2D films for studying the effects of both biochemical (the peptide sequences displayed on the phages) and biophysical (the topographies of the phage films) cues on the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and identified peptides and topographies that can induce their osteogenic differentiation; (4) discovered that phage could induce angiogenesis and osteogenesis for MSC-based vascularized bone regeneration; (5) identified novel breast cancer cell-targeting and MSC-targeting peptides and used them to significantly improve the efficiency of targeted cancer therapy and MSC-based gene delivery, respectively; (6) employed engineered phage as a probe to achieve ultrasensitive detection of biomarkers from serum of human patients for disease diagnosis; and (7) constructed centimeter-scale 3D multilayered phage assemblies with the potential application as scaffolds for bone regeneration and functional device fabrication. Our findings demonstrated that phage is indeed a very powerful supramacromolecule suitable for not only developing novel nanostructures and biomaterials but also advancing important fields in biomedicine, including molecular targeting, cancer diagnosis and treatment, drug and gene delivery, stem cell fate direction, and tissue regeneration. Our successes in exploiting phage in chemistry, materials, and medicine suggest that phage itself is nontoxic at the cell level and can be safely used for detecting biomarkers in vitro.

A total of 130 patients will be randomized to receive either 750\u00a0mg of TXA daily or placebo until complete radiological resolution of the CSDH or for a maximum of 20\u00a0weeks. CSDH volume will be measured on serial computed tomography (CT) scanning. Cognitive function tests, quality of life questionnaires as well as functional autonomy assessments will be performed at enrollment, at 10\u00a0weeks following randomization and at 3\u00a0months following treatment cessation. During the treatment period, patients will undergo standard CSDH management with surgery being performed at the discretion of the treating physician. If surgery is performed, the CSDH and its outer membrane will be sampled for in vitro analysis. The primary outcome is the rate of CSDH resolution by 20\u00a0weeks without intervening unplanned surgical procedure. Secondary outcomes include: CSDH volume, incidence of surgical evacuation procedures, CSDH recurrence, cognitive functions, functional autonomy, quality of life, incidence of complications and length of hospital stay. Planned subgroup analyses will be performed for conservatively versus surgically managed subjects and highly versus poorly vascularized CSDH.\nCSDH is a frequent morbidity for which an effective medical treatment has yet to be discovered. The TRACS trial will be the first prospective study of TXA for CSDH.\nNCT ID: NCT02568124 .", "journal": "Trials", "date": "2016-05-07", "authors": ["ChristianIorio-Morin", "JocelynBlanchard", "MaximeRicher", "DavidMathieu"], "doi": "10.1186/s13063-016-1358-5\n10.2176/nmc.32.207\n10.1007/s00701-011-1203-2\n10.1212/WNL.25.7.669\n10.3346/jkms.1995.10.5.373\n10.1016/S0090-3019(97)00188-2\n10.2176/nmc.38.527\n10.1097/SLA.0000000000000255\n10.1227/01.NEU.0000298907.56012.E8\n10.1007/BF01400868\n10.2176/nmc.45.621\n10.2176/nmc.42.53\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60835-5\n10.1136/bmj.e3054\n10.2165/00003495-200363130-00008\n10.1093/ndt/15.1.107\n10.3171/2013.3.JNS122162\n10.3340/jkns.2010.48.6.518\n10.1001/jama.2013.281053\n10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181d7ac98\n10.3310/hta16130\n10.1186/1745-6215-13-87\n10.5770/cgj.16.81\n10.1016/0895-4356(89)90065-6\n10.1007/s10198-013-0502-3"}

The survival of the implant is only possible if the supply of oxygen and nutrients by developing capillaries from the host is established. The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay is a valuable tool to study the ingrowth and distribution of vessels into scaffolds composed by appropriate biomaterials and stem cell populations that are used in cell-based regenerative approaches. The developing vasculature of chicken embryos within cell-seeded scaffolds can be visualized with microcomputed tomography after intravenous injection of MicroFil\u00ae, which is a radiopaque contrast agent. Here, we provide a step-by-step protocol for the seeding of stem cells into silk fibroin scaffolds, the CAM culture conditions, the procedure of MicroFil\u00ae perfusion, and finally the microcomputed tomography scanning. Three-dimensional imaging of the vascularized tissue engineered constructs provides an important analytical tool for studying the potential of cell seeded scaffolds to attract vessels and form vascular networks, as well as for analyzing the number, density, length, branching, and diameter of vessels.

Our results demonstrate that human dental pulp stem cells and gingival fibroblasts possess equal abilities in attracting vessels within silk fibroin scaffolds.

{"title": "Glucose Tightly Controls Morphological and Functional Properties of Astrocytes.", "abstract": "The main energy source powering the brain is glucose. Strong energy needs of our nervous system are fulfilled by conveying this essential metabolite through blood via an extensive vascular network. Glucose then reaches brain tissues by cell uptake, diffusion and metabolization, processes primarily undertaken by astrocytes. Deprivation of glucose can however occur in various circumstances. In particular, ageing is associated with cognitive disturbances that are partly attributable to metabolic deficiency leading to brain glycopenia. Despite the crucial role of glucose and its metabolites in sustaining neuronal activity, little is known about its moment-to-moment contribution to astroglial physiology. We thus here investigated the early structural and functional alterations induced in astrocytes by a transient metabolic challenge consisting in glucose deprivation. Electrophysiological recordings of hippocampal astroglial cells of the stratum radiatum in situ revealed that shortage of glucose specifically increases astrocyte membrane capacitance, whilst it has no impact on other passive membrane properties. Consistent with this change, morphometric analysis unraveled a prompt increase in astrocyte volume upon glucose deprivation. Furthermore, characteristic functional properties of astrocytes are also affected by transient glucose deficiency. We indeed found that glucoprivation decreases their gap junction-mediated coupling, while it progressively and reversibly increases their intracellular calcium levels during the slow depression of synaptic transmission occurring simultaneously, as assessed by dual electrophysiological and calcium imaging recordings. Together, these data indicate that astrocytes rapidly respond to metabolic dysfunctions, and are therefore central to the neuroglial dialog at play in brain adaptation to glycopenia.", "journal": "Frontiers in aging neuroscience", "date": "2016-05-06", "authors": ["Chun-YaoLee", "GlennDall\u00e9rac", "PascalEzan", "MiroslavaAnderova", "NathalieRouach"], "doi": "10.3389/fnagi.2016.00082\n10.14336/ad.2014.0330\n10.1016/j.tins.2010.12.001\n10.1371/journal.pone.0113444\n10.1006/exnr.1996.6375\n10.1016/j.jchemneu.2004.05.009\n10.1016/j.nbd.2005.02.002\n10.1002/jnr.22663\n10.1002/glia.20820\n10.1002/jnr.21828\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029725\n10.1038/mp.2015.157\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02421.x\n10.1002/jnr.20335\n10.1098/rstb.2013.0596\n10.1016/j.pneurobio.2016.01.003\n10.1152/jn.00206.2015\n10.3389/fnene.2013.00004\n10.1042/bj20140003\n10.1042/an20090048\n10.1016/j.neuron.2012.08.019\n10.1523/jneurosci.1406-14.2014\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0020096\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03689.x\n10.1038/jcbfm.2012.35\n10.1038/ncomms4227\n10.1016/j.brainres.2003.12.046\n10.1097/01.wcb.0000127661.07591.de\n10.1093/cercor/bhs309\n10.1002/(sici)1098-1136(199805)23:1<1::aid-glia1>3.0.co;2-b\n10.1101/cshperspect.a020404\n10.2337/diabetes.47.5.815\n10.1203/00006450-199904020-00260\n10.1038/jcbfm.2013.94\n10.1038/ncomms7807\n10.1523/jneurosci.0341-09.2009\n10.1016/j.neuron.2015.03.035\n10.3389/fnins.2013.00249\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2005.08.014\n10.1093/gerona/56.2.b66\n10.1016/0006-8993(92)91677-7\n10.1016/j.tins.2013.07.001\n10.1097/01.wcb.0000128533.84196.d8\n10.1002/1098-1136(20010101)33:1<72::aid-glia1007>n3.3.co;2-1\n10.1038/nn.3662\n10.1073/pnas.1016650108\n10.1016/s0006-8993(96)01293-0\n10.1126/science.1116916\n10.1073/pnas.1403576111\n10.1097/01.mco.0000232908.84483.e0\n10.1126/science.1164022\n10.1038/srep04955\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2011.12.030\n10.1016/s0006-8993(02)03675-2\n10.1152/jn.00449.2006\n10.1016/j.tins.2004.06.005\n10.1016/s0306-4522(96)00600-8\n10.1016/j.bpj.2015.10.047\n10.1152/ajpendo.00737.2009\n10.1177/1073858411423441\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.018\n10.1016/s0079-6123(01)32087-3\n10.1002/hipo.1101\n10.1002/ana.20331\n10.1038/nn.3966\n10.1523/jneurosci.5784-08.2009"}
{"title": "Smaller Absolute Quantities but Greater Relative Densities of Microvessels Are Associated with Cerebellar Degeneration in Lurcher Mice.", "abstract": "Degenerative affections of nerve tissues are often accompanied by changes of vascularization. In this regard, not much is known about hereditary cerebellar degeneration. In this study, we compared the vascularity of the individual cerebellar components and the mesencephalon of 3-month-old wild type mice (n = 5) and Lurcher mutant mice, which represent a model of hereditary olivocerebellar degeneration (n = 5). Paraformaldehyde-fixed brains were processed into 18-\u03bcm thick serial sections with random orientation. Microvessels were visualized using polyclonal rabbit anti-laminin antibodies. Then, the stacks comprised of three 5-\u03bcm thick optical sections were recorded using systematic uniform random sampling. Stereological assessment was conducted based on photo-documentation. We found that each of the cerebellar components has its own features of vascularity. The greatest number and length of vessels were found in the granular layer; the number of vessels was lower in the molecular layer, and the lowest number of vessels was observed in the cerebellar nuclei corresponding with their low volume. Nevertheless, the nuclei had the greatest density of blood vessels. The reduction of cerebellum volume in the Lurcher mice was accompanied by a reduction in vascularization in the individual cerebellar components, mainly in the cortex. Moreover, despite the lower density of microvessels in the Lurcher mice compared with the wild type mice, the relative density of microvessels in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei was greater in Lurcher mice. The complete primary morphometric data, in the form of continuous variables, is included as a supplement.

After giving off the last middle cerebral artery, the rostral branch continued as the rostral cerebral artery in the cerebral longitudinal fissure, and had one anastomosis with its contralateral homologous artery, the rostral communicating artery, making the first rostral closure of the cerebral arterial circle. Next, the rostral cerebral arteries anastomosed forming a rostral interhemispheric artery, making the second rostral closure of the cerebral arterial circle. The internal carotid artery, after emitting its rostral branch, continued caudally as the caudal branch. The caudal branch ran caudally along the ventral surface of the mesencephalic tegmentum, emitted the caudal cerebral artery and the mesencephalic artery, and continued caudomedially while progressively narrowing, and anastomosed with its contralateral homologous artery, forming the basilar artery. The narrower portion also emitted the trigeminal artery. The anastomosis of the caudal branches closed the cerebral arterial circle caudally. The internal carotid arteries exclusively supplied the cerebral arterial circle of the turtle.

Utilizing our innovative technique of transplantation of a thymus as an isolated vascularized graft in MHC-inbred miniature swine, we have previously demonstrated that aged thymi are rejuvenated after transplantation into juvenile swine. Here we have studied the role of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and forkhead-box protein-N1 (FOXN1) as well as bone marrow (BM) in thymic rejuvenation and involution. We examined thymic rejuvenation and involution by means of histology and flow cytometry. Thymic function was assessed by the ability to induce tolerance of allogeneic kidneys. Aged thymi were rejuvenated in a juvenile environment, and successfully induced organ tolerance, while juvenile thymi in aged recipients involuted and had a limited ability to induce tolerance. However, juvenile BM inhibited the involution process of juvenile thymi in aged recipients. An elevated expression of both FOXN1 and IGF1 receptors (IGF-1R) was observed in juvenile thymi and rejuvenated thymi. Juvenile BM plays a role in promoting the local thymic milieu as indicated by its ability to inhibit thymic involution in aged animals. The expression of FOXN1 and IGF-1R was noted to increase under conditions that stimulated rejuvenation, suggesting that these factors are involved in thymic recovery.", "journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "date": "2016-05-05", "authors": ["MTasaki", "VVillani", "AShimizu", "MSekijima", "RYamada", "I MHanekamp", "J SHanekamp", "T ACormack", "S GMoran", "AKawai", "D HSachs", "KYamada"], "doi": "10.1111/ajt.13855"}
{"title": "Sertoli Cells Modulate Testicular Vascular Network Development, Structure, and Function to Influence Circulating Testosterone Concentrations in Adult Male Mice.", "abstract": "The testicular vasculature forms a complex network, providing oxygenation, micronutrients, and waste clearance from the testis. The vasculature is also instrumental to testis function because it is both the route by which gonadotropins are delivered to the testis and by which T is transported away to target organs. Whether Sertoli cells play a role in regulating the testicular vasculature in postnatal life has never been unequivocally demonstrated. In this study we used models of acute Sertoli cell ablation and acute germ cell ablation to address whether Sertoli cells actively influence vascular structure and function in the adult testis. Our findings suggest that Sertoli cells play a key role in supporting the structure of the testicular vasculature. Ablating Sertoli cells (and germ cells) or germ cells alone results in a similar reduction in testis size, yet only the specific loss of Sertoli cells leads to a reduction in total intratesticular vascular volume, the number of vascular branches, and the numbers of small microvessels; loss of germ cells alone has no effect on the testicular vasculature. These perturbations to the testicular vasculature leads to a reduction in fluid exchange between the vasculature and testicular interstitium, which reduces gonadotropin-stimulated circulating T concentrations, indicative of reduced Leydig cell stimulation and/or reduced secretion of T into the vasculature. These findings describe a new paradigm by which the transport of hormones and other factors into and out of the testis may be influenced by Sertoli cells and highlights these cells as potential targets for enhancing this endocrine relationship.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2016-05-05", "authors": ["DianeRebourcet", "JunxiWu", "LyndseyCruickshanks", "Sarah ESmith", "LauraMilne", "AnuruddikaFernando", "Robert JWallace", "Calum DGray", "Patrick W FHadoke", "Rod TMitchell", "Peter JO'Shaughnessy", "Lee BSmith"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2016-1156"}

{"title": "The Nuclear Receptor, Nor-1, Induces the Physiological Responses Associated With Exercise.", "abstract": "Skeletal muscle remodels metabolic capacity, contractile and exercise phenotype in response to physiological demands. This adaptive remodeling response to physical activity can ameliorate/prevent diseases associated with poor diet and lifestyle. Our previous work demonstrated that skeletal muscle-specific transgenic expression of the neuron-derived orphan nuclear receptor, Nor-1 drives muscle reprogramming, improves exercise endurance, and oxidative metabolism. The current manuscript investigates the association between exercise, Nor-1 expression and the role of Nor-1 in adaptive remodeling. We demonstrate that Nor-1 expression is induced by exercise and is dependent on calcium/calcineurin signaling (in vitro and in vivo). Analysis of fatigue-resistant transgenic mice that express Nor-1 in skeletal muscle revealed increased hypertrophy and vascularization of muscle tissue. Moreover, we demonstrate that transgenic Nor-1 expression is associated with increased intracellular recycling, ie, autophagy, involving 1) increased expression of light chain 3A or LC3A-II, autophagy protein 5, and autophagy protein 12 in quadriceps femoris muscle extracts from Tg-Nor-1 (relative to Wild-type (WT) littermates); 2) decreased p62 expression indicative of increased autophagolysosome assembly; and 3) decreased mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 activity. Transfection of LC3A-GFP-RFP chimeric plasmid demonstrated that autophagolysosome formation was significantly increased by Nor-1 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated a single bout of exercise induced LC3A-II expression in skeletal muscle from C57BL/6 WT mice. This study, when combined with our previous studies, demonstrates that Nor-1 expression drives multiple physiological changes/pathways that are critical to the beneficial responses of muscle to exercise and provides insights into potential pharmacological manipulation of muscle reprogramming for the treatment of lifestyle induced chronic diseases.", "journal": "Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)", "date": "2016-05-05", "authors": ["Joel MGoode", "Michael APearen", "Zewen KTuong", "Shu-Ching MWang", "Tae GyuOh", "Emily XShao", "George E OMuscat"], "doi": "10.1210/me.2015-1300\n10.1007/s12576-016-0440-9"}

Different categories of cell sources - from autologous differentiated urothelial and smooth muscle cells to natural or laboratory procedure-derived stem cells - have been taken into consideration to reach the construction of suitable \"cell seeded\" templates. Current clinically validated bladder tissue engineering approaches essentially consist of augmentation cystoplasty in patients suffering from poorly compliant neuropathic bladder. No clinical applications of wholly tissue engineered neobladder have been carried out to radical-reconstructive surgical treatment of bladder malignancies or chronic inflammation-due vesical coarctation. Reliable reasons why bladder tissue engineering clinical applications so far remain unusual, particularly imply the risk of graft ischemia, hence its both fibrous contraction and even worse perforation.

A strategy to alleviate this problem is to enhance adaptive capacities to face heat exposure using thermal manipulation (TM) during embryogenesis. This strategy was shown to improve thermotolerance during their life span. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of TM (39.5\u00a0\u00b0C, 12\u00a0h/24 vs 37.8\u00a0\u00b0C from d7 to d16 of embryogenesis) and of a subsequent heat challenge (32\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0h) applied on d34 on gene expression in the Pectoralis major muscle (PM). A chicken gene expression microarray (8\u2009\u00d7\u200960\u00a0K) was used to compare muscle gene expression profiles of Control (C characterized by relatively high body temperatures, Tb) and TM chickens (characterized by a relatively low Tb) reared at 21\u00a0\u00b0C and at 32\u00a0\u00b0C (CHC and TMHC, respectively) in a dye-swap design with four comparisons and 8 broilers per treatment. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was subsequently performed to validate differential expression in each comparison. Gene ontology, clustering and network building strategies were then used to identify pathways affected by TM and heat challenge.\nAmong the genes differentially expressed (DE) in the PM (1.5\u00a0% of total probes), 28 were found to be differentially expressed between C and TM, 128 between CHC and C, and 759 between TMHC and TM. No DE gene was found between TMHC and CHC broilers. The majority of DE genes analyzed by RT-qPCR were validated. In the TM/C comparison, DE genes were involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function, cell proliferation, vascularization and muscle growth; when comparing heat-exposed chickens to their own controls, TM broilers developed more specific pathways than C, especially involving genes related to metabolism, stress response, vascularization, anti-apoptotic and epigenetic processes.\nThis study improved the understanding of the long-term effects of TM on PM muscle. TM broilers displaying low Tb may have lower metabolic intensity in the muscle, resulting in decreased metabolic heat production, whereas modifications in vascularization may enhance heat loss.

This in turn leads to the synthesis and the release of arachidonic acid, growth factors, metabolites, cytokines and various enzymes. Biologically, not only the intensity of the force, but also the duration of this and the tissue response to the application of the same are important for the purpose of tooth movement.

At decreased oxygen tensions, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) 1 and 2 are stabilized and mediate a hypoxic response, primarily by acting as transcription factors. HIFs exert differential effects on tumor growth and affect important cancer hallmarks including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, vascularization/angiogenesis, genetic instability, tumor metabolism, tumor immune responses, and invasion and metastasis. As a consequence, HIFs mediate resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy and are associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Intriguingly, perivascular tumor cells can also express HIF-2\u03b1, thereby forming a \"pseudohypoxic\" phenotype that further contributes to tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of HIFs in cancer has the potential to improve treatment efficacy. Different strategies to target hypoxic cancer cells and/or HIFs include hypoxia-activated prodrugs and inhibition of HIF dimerization, mRNA or protein expression, DNA binding capacity, and transcriptional activity.

Flow changes were induced by the pump of the machine perfusion system. The\u00a0induced flow rates were of clinical relevance (150\u200a-\u200a400\u200aml/min for HA and 400\u200a-\u200a1400\u200aml/min for PV). Quantification parameters from time-intensity curves [rise time (RT), mean transit time (MTT), area under the curve (AUC) and\u00a0peak intensity (PI)] were extracted in order to evaluate whether the induced flow changes were reflected in these parameters.\nA linear relationship between the image intensity and the microbubble concentration was confirmed first, while time parameters (RT and MMT) were found to be independent of concentration. The induced flow changes which propagated from the larger vessels to the parenchyma were reflected in the quantification parameters. Specifically, RT, MTT and AUC correlated with flow rate changes.\nMachine-perfused pig liver is an excellent test bed for DCEUS quantification approaches for the study of the hepatic vascular networks. DCEUS quantification parameters (RT, MTT, and AUC) can measure relative flow changes of about 20\u200a% and above in the liver vasculature.

{"title": "Antiangiogenics and Hypoxic Response: Role of Fatty Acid Synthase Inhibitors.", "abstract": "One proposed mechanism through which antiangiogenics exert their effect in epithelial malignancies is by improving the status of the aberrant vascular network and secondarily facilitating the delivery of concurrently administrated cytotoxic agents. During this process, known as vascular normalization, the oxygenation of the tumor is usually improved. Many mechanisms of resistance have been proposed to evade the action of this drug class elicited through this mechanism of action. However, a less explored mechanism of action is vascular choking, as increased hypoxia is thought to be associated with the inevitable progression of certain tumor-promotion features. Here we review the available evidence regarding decreased blood flow as a mechanism of action of antiangiogenics at the preclinical and clinical level. Similar to vascular normalization, there are also escape mechanisms against chronic hypoxia generated by treatment with antiangiogenics. Among other compensatory responses, chronic hypoxia is related with the upregulation of lipidic anabolism. Therefore, we focus on how fatty acid synthase, a key player in this response, can be targeted to delay acquired resistance against antiangiogenics, including experimental data from our group. This effect seems to be specific to those cases in which the antiangiogenic treatment induces a hypoxic response, but not in models where the antiangiogenic agent induced normalizing effects.

{"title": "Reproducibility of first trimester three-dimensional placental measurements.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess intra and interobserver reproducibility of placental volume and vascularization during the first trimester of pregnancy studied by three dimensional ultrasonography and angio power Doppler.\nThis is a prospective study in 69 singleton pregnancies. Once the bi-dimensional protocol study was carried out, we performed a 3D-US (three-dimensional ultrasonography) of the placenta by abdominal ultrasonography. The Virtual Organ Computer-Aided Analysis program was used to evaluate the placental volume (PV), the placental quotient (PQ: placental volume/crown-rump length) and the vascular indices (vascularization index VI, flow index FI and vascularization-flow index VFI). The intraobserver and interobserver variability were respectively expressed as an intraclass correlation coefficient (Intra-CC) and interclass correlation coefficient (inter-CC).\nIntraobserver correlation for PV was excellent with an Intra-CC of 0.97 while an Inter-CC of 0.71 demonstrated less agreement between observers. In the same way, PQ showed better intraobserver than interobserver correlation, with an Intra-CC of 0.97 and an inter-CC of 0.67. The analyzed vascular indices had both excellent intraobserver and interobserver correlation coefficients, with values of 0.98 and 0.96 for VI, 0.93 and 0.89 for FI and 0.97 and 0.95 for VFI, respectively.\nOur study demonstrate an excellent intra and inter-observer reproducibility for vascular indices and a good reproducibility of the evaluated Doppler indices with intra-CC higher than 0.90.

{"title": "In Vitro Multitissue Interface Model Supports Rapid Vasculogenesis and Mechanistic Study of Vascularization across Tissue Compartments.", "abstract": "A significant challenge facing tissue engineers is the design and development of complex multitissue systems, including vascularized tissue-tissue interfaces. While conventional in vitro models focus on either vasculogenesis (de novo formation of blood vessels) or angiogenesis (vessels sprouting from existing vessels or endothelial monolayers), successful therapeutic vascularization strategies will likely rely on coordinated integration of both processes. To address this challenge, we developed a novel in vitro multitissue interface model in which human endothelial colony forming cell (ECFC)-encapsulated tissue spheres are embedded within a surrounding tissue microenvironment. This highly reproducible approach exploits biphilic surfaces (nanostructured surfaces with distinct superhydrophobic and hydrophilic regions) to (i) support tissue compartments with user-specified matrix composition and physical properties as well as cell type and density and (ii) introduce boundary conditions that prevent the cell-mediated tissue contraction routinely observed with conventional three-dimensional monodispersion cultures. This multitissue interface model was applied to test the hypothesis that independent control of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-cell interactions would affect vascularization within the tissue sphere as well as across the tissue-tissue interface. We found that high-cell-density tissue spheres containing 5 \u00d7 10(6) ECFCs/mL exhibit rapid and robust vasculogenesis, forming highly interconnected, stable (as indicated by type IV collagen deposition) vessel networks within only 3 days. Addition of adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) in the surrounding tissue further enhanced vasculogenesis within the sphere as well as angiogenic vessel elongation across the tissue-tissue boundary, with both effects being dependent on the ASC density. Overall, results show that the ECFC density and ECFC-ASC crosstalk, in terms of paracrine and mechanophysical signaling, are critical determinants of vascularization within a given tissue compartment and across tissue interfaces. This new in vitro multitissue interface model and the associated mechanistic insights it yields provide guiding principles for the design and optimization of multitissue vascularization strategies for research and clinical applications.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2016-05-03", "authors": ["Kevin PBuno", "XuemeiChen", "Justin AWeibel", "Stephanie NThiede", "Suresh VGarimella", "Mervin CYoder", "Sherry LVoytik-Harbin"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.6b01194\n10.1520/F3089-14\n10.1002/term.1769"}

The aim of this anatomical study was to investigate the vascular supply to the distal ITB and its role as a free fascial flap. Methods\u2003We dissected 16 fresh-frozen cadaveric legs and injected latex into the superolateral geniculate artery (SLGA).

{"title": "Heparin-gelatin mixture improves vascular reconstruction efficiency and hepatic function in bioengineered livers.", "abstract": "Whole organ decellularization is a cell removal process that creates a natural extracellular matrix for use in transplantation. A lack of an intact endothelial layer in the vascular network of decellularized organs results in blood clotting even with anti-coagulation treatment. Furthermore, shear stress caused by blood flow may affect reseeded parenchymal cells. We hypothesized that a heparin-gelatin mixture (HG) can act as an antithrombotic coating reagent and induce attachment and migration of endothelial cells (ECs) on vascular wall surfaces within decellularized livers, with subsequent parenchymal cell function enhancement. Portal vein (PV) perfusion was performed for right lateral lobe decellularization of porcine livers. We tested if HG-precoating of isolated decellularized PV could increase EC attachment and migration. Additionally, we coated PV and hepatic artery walls in decellularized liver with HG, and then repopulated it with ECs and maintained it under vascular flow in a bioreactor for 10days. Re-endothelialized scaffolds were perfused with porcine blood for thrombogenicity evaluation. We then co-cultured hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells and ECs to evaluate the effect of endothelialization on parenchymal cells. Finally, we transplanted these scaffolds heterotopically in pigs. HG improved ECs' ability to migrate and adhere to vessel discs. ECs efficiently covered the vascular compartments within decellularized scaffolds and maintained function and proliferation after HG-precoating. No thrombosis was observed after 24h blood perfusion in HG-precoated scaffolds, indicating an efficiently endothelialized vascular tree. HepG2 cells displayed a higher function in scaffolds endothelialized after HG-precoating compared to uncoated scaffolds in vitro and after in vivo transplantation. Our results lay the groundwork for engineering human-sized whole-liver scaffolds for clinical applications.\nA major obstacle to successful organ bioengineering is vasculature reconstruction to avoid thrombosis and deliver nutrients through blood to the whole scaffold after in vivo transplantation. Although many attempts have been made to construct endothelial cell layers on the vascular network within decellularized organs, complete coverage has not be achieved. Here, we describe an effective approach for endothelial cell seeding to reconstruct a patent vascular tree within decellularized livers by coating the vasculature using heparin-gelatin mixture. Our results have demonstrate that enhancement of endothelial cell attachment by heparin-gelatin treatment could improve vascular patency and parenchymal cell function in vitro and in vivo.

This review highlights features of the \u03b2-cell, including it being part of a pancreatic islet, a mini-organ that is highly vascularized and highly innervated, and efforts to promote \u03b2-cell proliferation. In addition, the \u03b2-cell in T1D exists in a microenvironment with interactions and input from other islet cell types, extracellular matrix, vascular endothelial cells, neuronal projections, and immune cells, all of which likely influence the \u03b2-cell's capacity for replication.

This review reviews the molecular pathways involved in this \u03b2-cell proliferation and highlights recent work in two areas: 1) Investigators, using high-throughput screening to discover small molecules that promote human \u03b2-cell proliferation, are now focusing on the dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase-1a and cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN2C/p18 or CDKN1A/p21as targets of compounds to stimulate adult human \u03b2-cell proliferation. 2) Local inflammation, macrophages, and the local \u03b2-cell microenvironment promote \u03b2-cell proliferation.

Scopoletin could be useful as a systemic chemotherapeutic agent against angiogenesis-dependent malignancies if its antitumorigenic activity is investigated and scientifically proven using a suitable human tumor xenograft model. In the present study, bioassay-guided (anti-angiogenesis) phytochemical investigation was conducted on Nicotiana glauca extract which led to the isolation of scopoletin. Further, anti-angiogenic activity of scopoletin was characterized using ex vivo, in vivo and in silico angiogenesis models. Finally, the antitumorigenic efficacy of scopoletin was studied in human colorectal tumor xenograft model using athymic nude mice. For the first time, an in vivo anticancer activity of scopoletin was reported and characterized using xenograft models. Scopoletin caused significant suppression of sprouting of microvessels in rat aortic explants with IC50 (median inhibitory concentration) 0.06\u03bcM. Scopoletin (100 and 200mg/kg) strongly inhibited (59.72 and 89.4%, respectively) vascularization in matrigel plugs implanted in nude mice. In the tumor xenograft model, scopoletin showed remarkable inhibition on tumor growth (34.2 and 94.7% at 100 and 200mg/kg, respectively). Tumor histology revealed drastic reduction of the extent of vascularization. Further, immunostaining of CD31 and NG2 receptors in the histological sections confirmed the antivascular effect of scopoletin in tumor vasculature. In computer modeling, scopoletin showed strong ligand affinity and binding energies toward the following angiogenic factors: protein kinase (ERK1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2).

{"title": "Mechanical Stretching Promotes Skin Tissue Regeneration via Enhancing Mesenchymal Stem Cell Homing and Transdifferentiation.", "abstract": "Skin tissue expansion is a clinical procedure for skin regeneration to reconstruct cutaneous defects that can be accompanied by severe complications. The transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been proven effective in promoting skin expansion and helping to ameliorate complications; however, systematic understanding of its mechanism remains unclear. MSCs from luciferase-Tg Lewis rats were intravenously transplanted into a rat tissue expansion model to identify homing and transdifferentiation. To clarify underlying mechanisms, a systematic approach was used to identify the differentially expressed genes between mechanically stretched human MSCs and controls. The biological significance of these changes was analyzed through bioinformatic methods. We further investigated genes and pathways of interest to disclose their potential role in mechanical stretching-induced skin regeneration. Cross sections of skin samples from the expanded group showed significantly more luciferase(+) and stromal cell-derived factor 1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1)(+), luciferase(+)keratin 14(+), and luciferase(+)CD31(+) cells than the control group, indicating MSC transdifferentiation into epidermal basal cells and endothelial cells after SDF-1\u03b1-mediated homing. Microarray analysis suggested upregulation of genes related to hypoxia, vascularization, and cell proliferation in the stretched human MSCs. Further investigation showed that the homing of MSCs was blocked by short interfering RNA targeted against matrix metalloproteinase 2, and that mechanical stretching-induced vascular endothelial growth factor A upregulation was related to the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) and Wnt signaling pathways. This study determines that mechanical stretching might promote skin regeneration by upregulating MSC expression of genes related to hypoxia, vascularization, and cell proliferation; enhancing transplanted MSC homing to the expanded skin; and transdifferentiation into epidermal basal cells and endothelial cells.\nSkin tissue expansion is a clinical procedure for skin regeneration to cover cutaneous defects that can be accompanied by severe complications.

Although symptomatic management has improved, there is currently no curative treatment, and only childbirth and delivery of the placenta, usually prematurely, alleviate the mother's symptoms. Placental insufficiency plays a central role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Abnormal placentation during the first trimester leads to defective remodeling of the uterine vascularization. This results progressively in placental hypoperfusion, which induces trophoblast dysfunction and the release in maternal circulation of trophoblastic factors leading to an excessive inflammatory response, endothelial dysfunction and glomerular damage. Among these factors, the most important is sFlt-1, which is a soluble form of the VEGF and PlGF receptor. sFlt-1 binds to free VEGF and PlGF in the maternal circulation, thus reducing their bioavailability for their membrane receptor. The result is inhibition of the effects of VEGF and PlGF on maternal endothelial cells and podocytes.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of negative pressure treatment by External Tissue Expansion Device (ETED) on fat grating recipient sites in a porcine model. The ETED was designed to provide negative pressure on the dorsum of swine. Pressure treatment (-70 mmHg) was applied for 1 or 3 hours every other day for 10 and 20 treatments. The treated areas (3.5 cm in diameter) were harvested and examined for histological changes, vessel density, cell proliferation (Ki67) and growth factor expression (FGF-1, VEGF and PDGB-bb). The application of the ETED increased epidermis thickness even after 1-hour treatments repeated 10 times. The results of Ki67 analysis suggested that the increasing thickness was due to cell proliferation in the epidermis. There was a more than two-fold increase in the vessel density, indicating that the ETED promotes vascularization. Unexpectedly, the treatment also increased the number of hair follicles. Negative pressure provided by the ETED increases the thickness of epidermis section of tissue, cell proliferation and vessel density.

The disease presents with intermittent claudication, which can progress to critical limb ischemia requiring amputation. Research has emphasized that the quality or existence of the pedal arch have a direct effect on wound healing and, therefore, on limb salvage, through the mechanism of collateral vascularization to the ischemic regions.\nThis study aimed to determine the existence and, if present, grade of retrograde blood flow from plantar arch to dorsal foot artery (dorsalis pedis artery, DPA).

After physical examination and lower extremity Doppler examination, spectral morphology of DPA flow was recorded, before and during manual compression of posterior tibial artery (PTA), for a period of 5 seconds. At the end, findings of Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography and, physical examination finding and symptomatology were gathered and analyzed.\nIn the patient group, 31 lower limb arteries, of total of 17 cases, were included. After compression maneuver, DPA in 11 cases (six right, five left) showed retrograde filling from plantar arch. This retrograde flow support was triphasic in three cases, biphasic in five cases, and monophasic in three cases. In other DPAs of these 20 limbs, PTA based retrograde collateral flow was not determined. In nine of these 20 limbs, with no or diminished retrograde filling, symptoms were worse than in other cases. Contrarily, only two of 11 limbs, with retrograde collaterals, have claudication during walking.\nIn cases with critical atherosclerotic disease of anterior tibial artery, PTA-based biphasic or triphasic retrograde collateral flow prevents ischemia, whereas monophasic support or no retrograde flow remains incapable.", "journal": "Iranian journal of radiology : a quarterly journal published by the Iranian Radiological Society", "date": "2016-04-30", "authors": ["OnurTutar", "DuzgunYildirim", "CesurSamanci", "BabakRafiee", "KaanInan", "SuleymanDikici", "Fethi EmreUstabasioglu", "GokhanKuyumcu"], "doi": "10.5812/iranjradiol.21819\n10.1016/j.ejvs.2008.04.012\n10.1583/1545-1550(2007)14[743:TISFOR]2.0.CO;2\n10.1016/s0140-6736(05)67704-5\n10.1016/j.ejvs.2008.12.001\n10.1016/j.jvs.2008.01.005\n10.1016/j.jvs.2013.08.003\n10.1016/j.jvs.2012.10.129\n10.1258/vasc.2011.cr0323\n10.1159/000200439\n10.1097/01.prs.0000222582.84385.54\n10.1016/0007-1226(87)90185-8"}

Recent studies in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) reveal adaptive enhancement of thermogenesis in high- compared to low-altitude populations under hypoxic cold stress, an enhancement that is attributable to modifications in the aerobic metabolism of muscles used in shivering. However, because small mammals rely heavily on nonshivering mechanisms for cold acclimatization, we tested for evidence of adaptive divergence in nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) under hypoxia. To do so, we measured NST and characterized transcriptional profiles of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in high- and low-altitude deer mice that were (i) wild-caught and acclimatized to their native altitude, and (ii) born and reared under common garden conditions at low elevation. We found that NST performance under hypoxia is enhanced in wild-caught, high-altitude deer mice, a difference that is associated with increased expression of coregulated genes that influence several physiological traits. These traits include vascularization and O2 supply to BAT, brown adipocyte proliferation and the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis in the generation of heat. Our results suggest that acclimatization to hypoxic cold stress is facilitated by enhancement of nonshivering heat production, which is driven by regulatory plasticity in a suite of genes that influence intersecting physiological pathways.", "journal": "Molecular ecology", "date": "2016-04-30", "authors": ["Jonathan PVelotta", "JenniferJones", "Cole JWolf", "Zachary ACheviron"], "doi": "10.1111/mec.13661"}

Components of the vascularized composite allograft included the eyelids, nose, lips, facial muscles, oral mucosa, total scalp, and ears; and skeletal subunits of the zygoma, nasal bone, and genial segment. Virtual surgical planning was used for osteotomy selection, and to evaluate postoperative precision of hard- and soft-tissue elements.\nEach transplant experience decreased each subsequent transplant surgical time. Prefabricated cutting guides facilitated a faster dissection of both donor and recipient tissue, requiring minimal alteration to the allograft for proper fixation of bony segments during inset. Regardless of donor-to-recipient size discrepancy, ample soft tissue was available to achieve tension-free allograft inset. Differences between virtual transplant simulation and posttransplant measurements were minimal or insignificant, supporting replicable and precise outcomes.\nThis facial transplant model was designed to optimize reconstruction of extensive soft-tissue defects of the craniofacial region representative of electrical, thermal, and chemical burns, by incorporating skeletal subunits within the allograft.

Although vascularized bone grafts promote osteogenesis, the required tissue harvesting causes problematic donor-site morbidity. Artificial bone substitutes are promising alternatives for regenerative medicine applications, but the incorporation of suitable cells and/or growth factors is necessary for their successful clinical application. The inclusion of vascular bundles can further enhance the bone-forming capability of bone substitutes by promoting tissue neovascularization. Little is known about how neovascularization occurs and how new bone extends within vascularized tissue-engineered bone, because no previous studies have used tissue-engineered bone to treat large, poorly vascularized defects.\nIn this study, the authors developed a novel vascularized tissue-engineered bone scaffold composed of osteogenic matrix cell sheets wrapped around vascular bundles within \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate ceramics.\nFour weeks after subcutaneous transplantation in rats, making use of the femoral vascular bundle, vascularized tissue-engineered bone demonstrated more angiogenesis and higher osteogenic potential than the controls.

{"title": "The Topical Application of Rosuvastatin in Preventing Knee Intra-Articular Adhesion in Rats.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Intra-articular adhesion is one of the common complications of post knee surgery and injury. The formation of joint adhesion can lead to serious dysfunction. Rosuvastatin (ROS) is a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, with multiple biological effects. In our study, the object was to evaluate the effectiveness of ROS in the prevention of post-operative knee adhesion in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Femoral condyle exposing surgery was performed on 45 healthy Sprague Dawley rats. Gelatin sponges soaked with 20 mg/kg of ROS, 10 mg/kg of ROS, or saline were used to cover the surgical site. The post-operative knee joints were fixed in a flexed position with micro Kirschner wires for four weeks. ROS effectiveness for treating intra-articular adhesion was determined with visual score evaluation, hydroxyproline content, histological analyses, immunohistochemistry, and inflammatory and vascular endothelial growth factors expression. RESULTS The animals' recovery was stable after surgery. The hydroxyproline content, visual score, and inflammatory vascular growth factors expression levels suggested that, compared with the control group, the ROS treatment groups showed better outcomes. ROS prevented joint adhesion formation, collagen deposition, and vascularization at the surgical site, and also inhibited inflammatory activity post-operatively. Compared with the 10 mg/kg ROS group, the 20 mg/kg ROS group showed significantly better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The local application of ROS reduced intra-articular adhesion formation, collagen deposition, and vascularization at the surgical site, and inhibited inflammatory activity post-operatively. These results suggested optimal concentration of ROS to be 20 mg/kg.", "journal": "Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research", "date": "2016-04-27", "authors": ["HaixiaoWu", "Alexey VGermanov", "Galina LGoryaeva", "Alexander NYachmenev", "Dmitriy IGordienko", "Victor VKuzin", "Alexander VSkoroglyadov"], "doi": "10.12659/msm.898237"}

ONJ can be caused by two pharmacological agents: Antiresorptive (including bisphosphonates (BPs) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors) and antiangiogenic. MRONJ pathophysiology is not completely elucidated. There are several suggested hypothesis that could explain its unique localization to the jaws: Inflammation or infection, microtrauma, altered bone remodeling or over suppression of bone resorption, angiogenesis inhibition, soft tissue BPs toxicity, peculiar biofilm of the oral cavity, terminal vascularization of the mandible, suppression of immunity, or Vitamin D deficiency. Dental screening and adequate treatment are fundamental to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis in patients under antiresorptive or antiangiogenic therapy, or before initiating the administration. The treatment of MRONJ is generally difficult and the optimal therapy strategy is still to be established. For this reason, prevention is even more important. It is suggested that a multidisciplinary team approach including a dentist, an oncologist, and a maxillofacial surgeon to evaluate and decide the best therapy for the patient. The choice between a conservative treatment and surgery is not easy, and it should be made on a case by case basis. However, the initial approach should be as conservative as possible.

{"title": "Evaluation of adipose-derived stem cells for tissue-engineered muscle repair construct-mediated repair of a murine model of volumetric muscle loss injury.", "abstract": "Volumetric muscle loss (VML) can occur from congenital defects, muscle wasting diseases, civilian or military injuries, and as a result of surgical removal of muscle tissue (eg, cancer), all of which can lead to irrevocable functional and cosmetic defects. Current tissue engineering strategies to repair VML often employ muscle-derived progenitor cells (MDCs) as one component. However, there are some inherent limitations in their in vitro culture expansion. Thus, this study explores the potential of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) as an alternative cell source to MDCs for tissue engineering of skeletal muscle. A reproducible VML injury model in murine latissimus dorsi muscle was used to evaluate tissue-engineered muscle repair (TEMR) constructs incorporating MDCs or ADSCs. Importantly, histological analysis revealed that ADSC-seeded constructs displayed regeneration potential that was comparable to those seeded with MDCs 2 months postrepair. Furthermore, morphological analysis of retrieved constructs demonstrated signs of neotissue formation, including cell fusion, fiber formation, and scaffold remodeling. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated positive staining for both structural and functional proteins. Positive staining for vascular structures indicated the potential for long-term neotissue survival and integration with existing musculature. Qualitative observation of lentivirus-Cherry-labeled donor cells by immunohistochemistry indicates that participation of ADSCs in new hybrid myofiber formation incorporating donor cells was relatively low, compared to donor MDCs. However, ADSCs appear to participate in vascularization. In summary, I have demonstrated that TEMR constructs generated with ADSCs displayed skeletal muscle regeneration potential comparable to TEMR-MDC constructs as previously reported.", "journal": "International journal of nanomedicine", "date": "2016-04-27", "authors": ["VenuKesireddy"], "doi": "10.2147/IJN.S101955"}

In this paper, the formulation and implementation of a model for Intramembranous Ossification is presented aiming to describe the complex process of bone tissue formation in tooth extraction sites.

Special attention is given to angiogenesis, oxygen-dependent effects and growth factor-induced apoptosis of fibroblasts. Furthermore, considering the depth-dependent vascularization of mandibular bone and its influence on bone healing, a functional description of the cell distribution on the severed periodontal ligament (PDL) is proposed.

The construct consists of a 3D ring-shaped polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold with heparinized surface to electrostatically bind vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), surrounding a hydrogel core for islets encapsulation. Heparin immobilization improves the amount of VEGF retained by the construct, up to 3.6 fold, compared to untreated PCL scaffolds. In a chicken chorioallanthoic membrane model, VEGF immobilized on the construct enhances angiogenesis in close proximity and on the surface of the scaffolds.

In each case, the ACL periligamentous envelope was documented as follows: (1) vascular, where the ACL was covered with blood vessels along its entire length; (2) centrally avascular, where the central third of the ACL was not covered but peripheral vascularized coverage was present; and (3) avascular, where there was no blood vessel coverage of the ACL. Inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: (1) age older than 18 years and (2) normal knee ligament laxity. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression were used to test the association between chondral lesions and each of the variables: sex, age, meniscus tear, decreased ACL vascularity, and concomitant chondral lesion in another knee compartment. The cohort included 516 knees. In the univariate analysis, all variables were associated with a chondral lesion, but only older age and decreased ACL vascularity were associated with chondral lesions in each knee compartment. In the regression model, only decreased ACL vascularity was associated with chondral lesions in each knee compartment. For avascular knees, the odds ratio was 2.84 for medial femoral condyle lesions (95% confidence interval, 1.73-4.68; P=.000), 2.44 for lateral femoral condyle lesions (95% confidence interval, 1.19-5.03; P=.015), and 2.48 for patellofemoral lesions (95% confidence interval, 1.55-3.97; P=.000).

Furthermore, the number of CD31-positive cells layered on the islet surface showed a direct proportion with engraftment capacities and less TUNEL-positive cells on days 3 and 7 after transplantation.\nWe observed that vascular endothelial cells could be functional integrated into isolated islets. We also found that islets that are coated with vascular endothelial cells increased their capacity to engraft. These findings indicate that islets coated with endothelial cells have a greater capacity of engraftment and thus establish a definitely vascular network to support the metabolic requirements.", "journal": "Transplantation proceedings", "date": "2016-04-26", "authors": ["D AlonsoBarba-Gutierrez", "ADaneri-Navarro", "J Jesus AlejandroVillagomez-Mendez", "JKanamune", "A KarinaRobles-Murillo", "SSanchez-Enriquez", "J RafaelVillafan-Bernal", "J DRivas-Carrillo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.transproceed.2016.02.036"}

{"title": "Fabrication and characterization of a novel crosslinked human keratin-alginate sponge.", "abstract": "Human hair keratins have been explored for biomedical applications because of their abundance, bioactivity and processability. However, pure keratin templates have poor mechanical properties, which limit their practical relevance. Herein, we described a novel composite sponge, consisting of human hair keratins chemically crosslinked with alginate using 1-ethyl-3-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride, with improved mechanical properties. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and free amine group quantification using ninhydrin revealed a maximum crosslinking index of 82.1 \u00b1 1.3%. With increasing alginate proportions, the sponges exhibited increased tensile strength, tensile modulus and compression modulus at maximum values of 10.3 \u00b1 1.92 kPa, 219.07 \u00b1 52.39 kPa and 191.48 \u00b1 32.89 kPa, respectively. The crosslinked sponges also demonstrated water vapour transmission rates comparable to commercial wound dressings. Meanwhile, sponges with higher proportions of keratin showed lower water uptake capacities and higher degradation rates by proteinase K, in comparison with sponges with higher proportions of alginate. Higher proportions of keratin on coated two-dimensional surfaces and in three-dimensional sponges resulted in more attachment and improved proliferation of L929 fibroblasts, verifying the bioactive role of keratin in the composites. In addition, subcutaneous implantation of the keratin-alginate sponges into C57BL/6NTac mice over 4 weeks showed no significant immunological reaction and minimal formation of fibrotic capsules. Furthermore, the sponges supported cellular infiltration, neo-tissue formation and vascularization in vivo. These findings demonstrated the feasibility of producing crosslinked human hair keratin-alginate sponges, with tuneable physical and mechanical properties, which are cell compliant in vitro and biocompatible in vivo, suggesting their potential for clinically relevant exploitations.

Unfortunately, only modest and limited efficacies are observed. Emerging evidence have attributed to the limited efficacy to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the tumor. CSCs predominantly drives angiogenesis via releasing proangiogenic factors and exosomes. They have the ability to resistant intratumoral hypoxia via autophagy or by directly forming the tubular structure to obtain blood. On the other hand, the vascular niche in tumor microenvironment also releases growth factors via juxtacrine and paracrine mechanisms to support the growth of CSCs and maintain its stemness features. This positive feedback loop between angiogenesis and CSCs exists in liver tumor microenvironment that is responsible for the development and poor prognosis of HCC. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the crosstalks between angiogenesis and CSCs, and their interactions in liver tumor microenvironment and their purpose that an effective anti-angiogenic therapy should also target CSCs for HCC treatment.", "journal": "Cancer letters", "date": "2016-04-25", "authors": ["HongYao", "NianliLiu", "Marie CLin", "JunnianZheng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.canlet.2016.03.014"}

In conclusion, scientific literature including our experience about this rare complex lesion of the wrist is too weak to support an effective strategy of management but we think that the careful analysis of the single problems can be the key to solve the complexity. Goal of the treatment should be complete revascularization and healing of the scaphoid, avoiding non union and avascular necrosis; simultaneously a proper ligament reconstruction is fundamental to re-establish carpal stability.

The authors investigated the possibility of using the second metatarsal bone to replace the distal ulna in an anatomical study. Methods\u2003The morphology of the distal ulna and the head of the second metatarsal (MT2) were studied using three-dimensional computerized tomographic (CT) scans of the wrist and foot in 52 patients without pathology related to these two areas, and 11 cadaveric specimens. The radius and height of the best-fit cylinder for both epiphyses were measured in the CT scans and compared. In the cadaveric specimens an osteotomy of the metatarsal neck was performed to rotate 90 degrees the head of the MT2 to match the shape of the distal ulna. Results\u2003The osseous morphology of the distal ulna and the head of the MT2 are roughly cylindrical, but differently oriented relative to the diaphyseal axes. In the osteotomized cadaveric MT2specimens, the overall morphology was relatively similar that of the distal ulna. The mean length of the MT2 after the osteotomy was 65 mm. Conclusion\u2003The head of the MT2 was found to have a similar cylindrical morphology to that of the ulnar head, with a different orientation. The radius of the cylinder was similar, although the height was bigger for the MT2. After a rotation osteotomy of the neck of the MT2 the overall shape and orientation of the epiphysis was more similar to the distal ulna. A vascularized transfer of an osteotomized MT2 would be an option for autologous reconstruction of the distal ulna in selected patients, but further study is needed in terms of the vascular supply, ligamentous reconstruction, and reconstruction of the sigmoid notch.

{"title": "Capillary hemangioma of the testis. A case report of a rare benign tumor.", "abstract": "This paper presents the case of a very rare capillary hemangioma of the testis in a 23-year-old patient. Physical examination revealed a tumor located in the upper pole of the left testis, which was suspected of being malignant due to its significantly increased density and irregular contours. Blood levels of the following tumor markers were determined: alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin and lactate dehydrogenase. No abnormalities were found in any of these tests. A gray-scale ultrasound scan of the scrotum revealed a lesion located in the upper pole of the left testis, 24 mm in diameter with slightly decreased echogenicity and irregular contours, which suggested infiltration of the tunica albuginea of the testis. Color and power Doppler scans demonstrated a dense network of blood vessels and increased blood flow in the lesion described. In addition, 3D ultrasound scan images were obtained, which allowed for a thorough determination of the topography of the lesion. No abnormalities were found in the patient's medical history, physical examination or ultrasound scan of the right testis. Taking into account the suspected malignancy with signs of infiltration of the tunica albuginea of the upper pole of the testis a decision was made to remove the left testis together with the spermatic cord using the inguinal approach. A histopathological examination of the whole specimen revealed a multifocal capillary hemangioma of the testis, signs of testicular fibrosis and significant atrophy of the spermatogenic epithelium of the seminiferous tubules.

{"title": "Sostdc1 deficiency accelerates fracture healing by promoting the expansion of periosteal mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "Loss of Sostdc1, a growth factor paralogous to Sost, causes the formation of ectopic incisors, fused molars, abnormal hair follicles, and resistance to kidney disease. Sostdc1 is expressed in the periosteum, a source of osteoblasts, fibroblasts and mesenchymal progenitor cells, which are critically important for fracture repair. Here, we investigated the role of Sostdc1 in bone metabolism and fracture repair. Mice lacking Sostdc1 (Sostdc1(-/-)) had a low bone mass phenotype associated with loss of trabecular bone in both lumbar vertebrae and in the appendicular skeleton. In contrast, Sostdc1(-/-) cortical bone measurements revealed larger bones with higher BMD, suggesting that Sostdc1 exerts differential effects on cortical and trabecular bone. Mid-diaphyseal femoral fractures induced in Sostdc1(-/-) mice showed that the periosteal population normally positive for Sostdc1 rapidly expands during periosteal thickening and these cells migrate into the fracture callus at 3days post fracture. Quantitative analysis of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and osteoblast populations determined that MSCs express Sostdc1, and that Sostdc1(-/-) 5day calluses harbor >2-fold more MSCs than fractured wildtype controls. Histologically a fraction of Sostdc1-positive cells also expressed nestin and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, suggesting that Sostdc1 marks a population of osteochondral progenitor cells that actively participate in callus formation and bone repair. Elevated numbers of MSCs in D5 calluses resulted in a larger, more vascularized cartilage callus at day 7, and a more rapid turnover of cartilage with significantly more remodeled bone and a thicker cortical shell at 21days post fracture. These data support accelerated or enhanced bone formation/remodeling of the callus in Sostdc1(-/-) mice, suggesting that Sostdc1 may promote and maintain mesenchymal stem cell quiescence in the periosteum.", "journal": "Bone", "date": "2016-04-23", "authors": ["Nicole MCollette", "Cristal SYee", "Nicholas RHum", "Deepa KMurugesh", "Blaine AChristiansen", "LiQinXie", "Aris NEconomides", "Jennifer OManilay", "Alexander GRobling", "Gabriela GLoots"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2016.04.005"}
{"title": "Enhanced uptake and transport of PLGA-modified nanoparticles in cervical cancer.", "abstract": "Uncoordinated cellular proliferation and dysregulated angiogenesis in solid tumors are coupled with inadequate tissue, blood, and lymphatic vascularization. Consequently, tumors are often characterized by hypoxic regions with limited access to vascular-borne substances. In particular, systemically administered nanoparticles (NPs) targeting tumor cells and relying on vascular access to reach tumor tissue can suffer from limited therapeutic efficacy due to inhomogeneous intra-tumor distribution and insufficient cellular internalization of NPs. To circumvent these challenges, NP surfaces can be modified to facilitate tumor interstitial transport and cellular uptake.\nWe create poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid NPs modified with MPG, polyethylene glycol (PEG), MPG/PEG, and Vimentin (VIM), and evaluate their cellular uptake in 2D (monolayer) cell culture of human cervical carcinoma (HeLa). We compare NP performance by evaluating uptake by non-cancerous vaginal (VK2) cells. We further assess NP interstitial transport in hypo-vascularized lesions by evaluating the effect of the various modifications on NP penetration in 3D cell culture of the HeLa cells. Results show that after 24\u00a0h incubation with HeLa cells in monolayer, MPG, MPG/PEG, PEG, and VIM\u00a0NPs were internalized at 66\u00d7, 24\u00d7, 30\u00d7, and 15\u00d7\u00a0that of unmodified NPs, respectively. In contrast, incubation with VK2 cells in monolayer showed that MPG\u00a0, MPG/PEG\u00a0, PEG\u00a0, and VIM\u00a0NPs internalized at 6.3\u00d7, 4.3\u00d7, 12.4\u00d7, and 3.0\u00d7 that of unmodified NPs, respectively. Uptake was significantly enhanced in tumorigenic vs. normal cells, with internalization of MPG\u00a0NPs by HeLa cells being twice that of PEG\u00a0NPs by VK2 cells. After 24\u00a0h incubation in HeLa 3D cell culture, MPG and MPG/PEGNPs were internalized 2\u00d7 and 3\u00d7 compared to PEG and VIM\u00a0NPs, respectively. Whereas MPG\u00a0NPs were internalized mostly in the cell culture periphery (1.2\u00d7, 1.4\u00d7, and 2.7\u00d7 that of PEG, MPG/PEG, and VIM\u00a0NPs, respectively), PEG\u00a0NPs at 250\u00a0\u03bcm penetrated 2\u00d7 farther into the tissue culture than MPG\u00a0NPs. For all NP types, cellular internalization was severely hindered in 3D compared to monolayer.\nAlthough MPG surface modification enhances internalization and uptake in hypo-vascularized cervical tissue culture, coating with PEG reduces this internalization while enhancing penetration. A delivery strategy combining NPs with either modification may balance cellular internalization vs. tissue penetration in hypo-vascularized cervical cancer lesions.", "journal": "Journal of nanobiotechnology", "date": "2016-04-23", "authors": ["Lee BSims", "Louis TCurtis", "Hermann BFrieboes", "Jill MSteinbach-Rankins"], "doi": "10.1186/s12951-016-0185-x\n10.3322/caac.20121\n10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.04.108\n10.1001/jama.298.7.743\n10.1002/rmv.1825\n10.1002/cncr.11877\n10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68181-6\n10.1002/adhm.201300519\n10.1016/j.addr.2013.11.009\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.01.043\n10.1016/S0168-3659(00)00339-4\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.05.036\n10.1155/2013/374252\n10.1002/wnan.1157\n10.1016/B978-0-12-407173-5.00002-9\n10.3390/ph5111177\n10.1016/j.molmed.2012.04.012\n10.1517/17425247.2012.689285\n10.1038/mt.2011.284\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.03.004\n10.1016/j.addr.2007.10.004\n10.1042/BC20070116\n10.1002/jcb.23313\n10.1042/BJ20061100\n10.1016/j.molmed.2015.06.005\n10.1016/j.addr.2004.10.007\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.01.096\n10.1093/nar/gkg385\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.11.029\n10.1038/nrc1893\n10.2217/nnm.15.195\n10.1371/journal.pone.0144888\n10.1021/nn301282m\n10.1166/jbn.2015.2067\n10.1371/journal.pone.0056876\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.04.012\n10.1208/s12248-013-9478-2\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.10.014\n10.1016/S0065-2660(10)69009-8\n10.2147/IJN.S20283\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.05.024\n10.1007/s11095-008-9697-x\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/49/495101\n10.1371/journal.pone.0144888\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.04.067\n10.1007/s00018-012-1115-1\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.006\n10.1038/nrm1858\n10.1007/s12079-011-0132-4\n10.1016/S1040-8428(00)00078-0\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1664\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3836\n10.2217/cns.13.37\n10.1371/journal.pone.0129172\n10.1016/j.ejpb.2015.02.017\n10.1007/s13346-013-0162-y\n10.1088/1367-2630/15/5/055004\n10.1063/1.3699060\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.02.025\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0502\n10.1038/nmat2444\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.06.036\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.03.031\n10.1023/A:1012126301290"}

Angiopoietin antagonists have been tested in clinical cancer trials in combination with VEGF-based anti-angiogenic therapy, including sunitinib, which is widely used as a first-line therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). However, little is known about Ang2 protein expression in human tumours and the correlation of tumour Ang2 expression with tumour vascularization, tumour cell proliferation and response to anti-angiogenic therapies. Here, we evaluated, using immunohistochemistry, the expression of Ang2, CD31 and the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 in the primary kidney cancer from 136 mRCC patients, who received first-line sunitinib after nephrectomy. Ang2 protein expression was restrained to RCC tumour vessels, and correlated with tumour vascularization and response to sunitinib. High pre-therapeutic Ang2 expression, and more strongly, combined high expression of both Ang2 and CD31, were associated with a high clinical benefit rate (CBR). Low cancer Ki-67 expression, but not Ang2 or CD31 expression, was associated with favourable progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as compared to patients with high Ki-67 expression (PFS 6.5 vs. 10.6 months, P = 0.009; OS, 15.7 vs. 28.5 months, P = 0.015).

Methods\u2003Ten patients underwent anterior cervical reconstruction using an FVFG after cervical corpectomy augmented with internal instrumentation. All patients were evaluated neurologically according to the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and modified JOA scoring systems and the Nurick grading system. The neurologic recovery rate was determined, and the clinical outcome was assessed based on three factors: neck pain, dependence on pain medication, and ability to return to work. The fusion status and maintenance of lordotic correction by the strut graft were determined by measuring the lordosis angle and fused segment height (FSH).

{"title": "Limbal stem cell transplantation: current perspectives.", "abstract": "Regeneration of the corneal surface after an epithelial insult involves division, migration, and maturation of a specialized group of stem cells located in the limbus. Several insults, both intrinsic and extrinsic, can precipitate destruction of the delicate microenvironment of these cells, resulting in limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). In such cases, reepithelialization fails and conjunctival epithelium extends across the limbus, leading to vascularization, persistent epithelial defects, and chronic inflammation. In partial LSCD, conjunctival epitheliectomy, coupled with amniotic membrane transplantation, could be sufficient to restore a healthy surface. In more severe cases and in total LSCD, stem cell transplantation is currently the best curative option. Before any attempts are considered to perform a limbal stem cell transplantation procedure, the ocular surface must be optimized by controlling causative factors and comorbid conditions. These factors include adequate eyelid function or exposure, control of the ocular surface inflammatory status, and a well-lubricated ocular surface. In cases of unilateral LSCD, stem cells can be obtained from the contralateral eye. Newer techniques aim at expanding cells in vitro or in vivo in order to decrease the need for large limbal resection that may jeopardize the \"healthy\" eye. Patients with bilateral disease can be treated using allogeneic tissue in combination with systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Another emerging option for this subset of patients is the use of noncorneal cells such as mucosal grafts. Finally, the use of keratoprosthesis is reserved for patients who are not candidates for any of the aforementioned options, wherein the choice of the type of keratoprosthesis depends on the severity of the disease. In summary, limbal stem cell transplantation improves both vision and quality-of-life in patients with ocular surface disorders associated with LSCD, and overall, the use of autologous tissue offers the best results.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that micro-patterned scaffolds, with precisely-designed, open micro-channels, might help endothelial cells to produce intra-scaffold vascular networks. Three series of micro-patterned scaffolds were produced via electrochemical replica-deposition of chitosan and cross-linking. All had regularly-oriented micro-channels (\u03d5 500 \u03bcm), which differed for the inter-channel spacing, at 600, 700, or 900 \u03bcm, respectively. Random-pore scaffolds, using the same technique, were taken as controls. Physical-mechanical characterization revealed high water uptake and favorable elastic mechanical behavior for all scaffolds, slightly reduced in the presence of cross-linking and enhanced with the 700 \u03bcm-spaced micro-pattern. At MTT assay, mouse endothelial cell viability was >90% at day 1, 3 and 7, confirmed by visual examination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Intra-scaffold cell density, at fluorescence analysis, was higher for the 600 \u03bcm-spaced and the 700 \u03bcm-spaced micro-patterns over the others. The 700 \u03bcm-spaced scaffold was selected for the in vivo testing, to be compared to the random-pore one. Neither type produced an inflammatory reaction; both showed excellent tissue ingrowth.

We previously demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) is one of the most potent factors in inducing osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Here, we investigated the potential use of a biodegradable citrate-based thermosensitive macromolecule, poly(polyethyleneglycol citrate-co-N-isopropylacrylamide) (PPCN) mixed with gelatin (PPCNG) as a scaffold for the delivery of BMP9-stimulated MSCs to promote localized bone formation. The addition of gelatin to PPCN effectively enhanced the cell adhesion and survival properties of MSCs entrapped within the gel in 3D culture. Using the BMP9-transduced MSC line immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs), we found that PPCNG facilitated BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of iMEFs in vivo and promoted the formation of well-ossified and vascularized trabecular bone-like structures in a mouse model of ectopic bone formation. Histologic evaluation revealed that vascularization of the bony masses retrieved from the iMEFs\u2009\u2009+\u2009\u2009PPCNG group was significantly more pronounced than that of the direct cell injection group. Accordingly, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was shown to be significantly higher in the bony masses recovered from the iMEFs\u2009\u2009+\u2009\u2009PPCNG group.

The expression profiles of CPEB4 mRNA and protein in nine normal brain tissues and 63 gliomas were detected using immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, and western blotting. CPEB4-positive expression was significantly correlated with the pathological grade of glioma; abundant expression was observed in high-grade gliomas, whereas little or no expression was observed in normal astrocytes. Immunohistochemistry staining indicated that CPEB4 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm. In addition, CPEB4 was more highly expressed in U87 glioma cells than in U251 cells.

The patients were evaluated preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The active range of motion, pain (visual analog scale [VAS]), and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale, and lower extremity functional scale were used. Osteonecrosis dissecans stage II was seen in patient 1 (aged 27\u00a0years) and stage III in patients 2 (aged 18\u00a0years) and 3 (aged 41\u00a0years). Preoperative pain of the ankle was recorded as VAS score of 3 by patients 1 and 2 and VAS score of 6 by patient 3. At 12\u00a0months postoperatively, patients 1 and 2 recorded a VAS score of 2 and patient 3, a VAS score of 0. All patients showed improvement in the lower extremity functional scale and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scale scores. After 6 and 12\u00a0months, magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-vascularized femoral condyle incorporated into the talus in all the patients. Autotransplantation of vascularized bone grafts from the medial femoral condyle is a promising technique for surgical revascularization of talar osteonecrosis dissecans stage II and III.", "journal": "The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons", "date": "2016-04-20", "authors": ["Victoria FStruckmann", "LeilaHarhaus", "RainerSimon", "ChristophWoelfl", "Janvon Recum", "J\u00f6rnThiele", "UlrichKneser", "ThomasKremer"], "doi": "10.1053/j.jfas.2016.02.012"}

During the development inside the skeletal muscles, T. spiralis larvae infect muscle cells accompanying with the infiltration of host inflammatory cells, eventually create a new type of cell known as nurse cell developing a surrounding vascular network to support the larvae development. Controlling of host inflammatory responses and angiogenesis influences both the nurse cell differentiation and the parasite larvae development. CXCL8 is a chemokine that acts on G-protein coupled receptors, of which activation contributes to fibrosis and angiogenesis. CXCL8(3-73)K11R/G31P (G31P) has been reported as a CXCL8 analogue. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of G31P in inflammatory responses and the development of T. spiralis larvae in muscle tissues of mice infected with T. spiralis. The level of inflammatory factors and the morphology of T. spiralis larvae in infected tissues were investigated through ELISA and electron-microscopy analysis.

A free flap is one of the surgical options used for large defects. However, a flap containing the fat layer is bulky. Several debulking surgeries are often needed for aesthetic and functional purposes. To overcome this disadvantage, we herein report our experience of six cases of hand and finger reconstruction using a pure skin perforator (PSP) flap concept. A PSP flap is a thin skin flap that is vascularized by a perforator branch penetrating the dermis. The thickness of the PSP flap could be approximately \u22642\u00a0mm as needed. The superficial circumflex iliac artery and superficial inferior epigastric artery were used as a flap pedicle. Secondary defatting operations were not required. For the success of PSP flap elevation, we applied three techniques: the microdissection technique for vessel separation, thin flap elevation at the superficial fascial layer, and the temporary clamping method. Temporary clamping was applied for the main trunk of pedicle vessels during debulking to prevent unwanted bleeding, which allowed us to freely perform three-dimensional defatting. Using these three techniques, the PSP flap can be elevated and adjusted for complex contouring of the hand and finger. Although the use of the PSP flap requires further study, the PSP flap is an effective, superthin flap with the advantages of both skin graft and perforator flaps.", "journal": "Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS", "date": "2016-04-18", "authors": ["MitsunagaNarushima", "TakuyaIida", "NobuyukiKaji", "TakumiYamamoto", "HidehikoYoshimatsu", "HisakoHara", "KazukiKikuchi", "JunAraki", "ShujiYamashita", "IsaoKoshima"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bjps.2016.03.005"}

A 2-stage procedure was performed in 30 children. In the first stage, the release of chordee was performed, and a well-vascularized preputial island flap was created. The vascularized island flap was brought anteriorly and sutured over the ventral surface of the glans and degloved penile shaft. The second stage was performed 6-8 months later. A neourethra was reconstructed by the tubularization of the preputial-urethral plate utilizing the principles of Duplay technique. All surgical procedures were performed between 2005 and 2011.\nThe mean age of the patients was 4.4 years (1-17 years). The mean duration of urethral catheterization was 6 days after the first stage and 10 days following the second stage. The flaps were viable in all of the children. There was no residual chordee. Following the second stage (n = 30), complications developed in 11 children (36%), namely, a fistula in 7, a pinpoint fistula in 3, and a diverticulum formation in 1. The cosmetic outcome was satisfactory. Uroflowmetry measurements were evaluated, and only one patient had a diverticulum formation at the late follow-up.\nVascularized preputial island flap is an alternative to free grafts for the reconstruction of the urethra. The main advantage of this flap technique is the creation of a thick, healthy and well-vascularized urethral plate. The advantages of this technique include better aesthetic appearance, an acceptable complication rate, and a very low rate of diverticula formation.", "journal": "Urology journal", "date": "2016-04-18", "authors": ["RahsanOzcan", "SenolEmre", "PinarKendigelen", "MehmetElicevik", "HalukEmir", "YunusSoylet", "S N CenkBuyukunal"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Cell migration during heart regeneration in zebrafish.", "abstract": "Zebrafish possess the remarkable ability to regenerate injured hearts as adults, which contrasts the very limited ability in mammals. Although very limited, mammalian hearts do in fact have measurable levels of cardiomyocyte regeneration. Therefore, elucidating mechanisms of zebrafish heart regeneration would provide information of naturally occurring regeneration to potentially apply to mammalian studies, in addition to addressing this biologically interesting phenomenon in itself. Studies over the past 13 years have identified processes and mechanisms of heart regeneration in zebrafish. After heart injury, pre-existing cardiomyocytes dedifferentiate, enter the cell cycle, and repair the injured myocardium. This process requires interaction with epicardial cells, endocardial cells, and vascular endothelial cells. Epicardial cells envelope the heart, while endocardial cells make up the inner lining of the heart. They provide paracrine signals to cardiomyocytes to regenerate the injured myocardium, which is vascularized during heart regeneration. In addition, accumulating results suggest that local migration of these major cardiac cell types have roles in heart regeneration. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of various heart injury methods used in the research community and regeneration of the major cardiac cell types. Then, we discuss local migration of these cardiac cell types and immune cells during heart regeneration.

Third generation scaffolds are more of composite types to maximize biological-mechanical-chemical properties. In the present review, our focus is on the performance of micro-organism-derived polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)-polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV)-composite scaffolds with ceramics and natural polymers for tissue engineering applications with emphasis on bone tissue. We particularly emphasize on how material properties of the composites affect scaffold performance. PHA-based composites have demonstrated their biocompatibility with a range of tissues and their capacity to induce osteogenesis due to their piezoelectric properties. Electrospun PHB/PHBV fiber mesh in combination with human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASCs) were shown to improve vascularization in engineered bone tissues. For nerve and skin tissue engineering applications, natural polymers such as collagen and chitosan remain the gold standard but there is scope for development of scaffolds combining PHAs with other natural polymers which can address some of the limitations such as brittleness, lack of bioactivity and slow degradation rate presented by the latter. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Effects of Rho Kinase Inhibitors on Grafts of Dopaminergic Cell Precursors in a Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease.", "abstract": "In models of Parkinson's disease (PD), Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitors have antiapoptotic and axon-stabilizing effects on damaged neurons, decrease the neuroinflammatory response, and protect against dopaminergic neuron death and axonal retraction. ROCK inhibitors have also shown protective effects against apoptosis induced by handling and dissociation of several types of stem cells. However, the effect of ROCK inhibitors on dopaminergic cell grafts has not been investigated. In the present study, treatment of dopaminergic cell suspension with ROCK inhibitors yielded significant decreases in the number of surviving dopaminergic neurons, in the density of graft-derived dopaminergic fibers, and in graft vascularization. Dopaminergic neuron death also markedly increased in primary mesencephalic cultures when the cell suspension was treated with ROCK inhibitors before plating, which suggests that decreased angiogenesis is not the only factor leading to cell death in grafts. Interestingly, treatment of the host 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats with ROCK inhibitors induced a slight, nonsignificant increase in the number of surviving neurons, as well as marked increases in the density of graft-derived dopaminergic fibers and the size of the striatal reinnervated area. The study findings discourage treatment of cell suspensions before grafting. However, treatment of the host induces a marked increase in graft-derived striatal reinnervation. Because ROCK inhibitors have also exerted neuroprotective effects in several models of PD, treatment of the host with ROCK inhibitors, currently used against vascular diseases in clinical practice, before and after grafting may be a useful adjuvant to cell therapy in PD.\nCell-replacement therapy is one promising therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, many questions must be addressed before widespread application. Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitors have been used in a variety of applications associated with stem cell research and may be an excellent strategy for improving survival of grafted neurons and graft-derived dopaminergic innervation.

{"title": "Vertebral Development in Paleozoic and Mesozoic Tetrapods Revealed by Paleohistological Data.", "abstract": "Basal tetrapods display a wide spectrum of vertebral centrum morphologies that can be used to distinguish different tetrapod groups. The vertebral types range from multipartite centra in stem-tetrapods, temnospondyls, and seymouriamorphs up to monospondylous centra in lepospondyls and have been drawn upon for reconstructing major evolutionary trends in tetrapods that are now considered textbook knowledge. Two modes of vertebral formation have been postulated: the multipartite vertebrae formed first as cartilaginous elements with subsequent ossification. The monospondylous centrum, in contrast, was formed by direct ossification without a cartilaginous precursor. This study describes centrum morphogenesis in basal tetrapods for the first time, based on bone histology. Our results show that the intercentra of the investigated stem-tetrapods consist of a small band of periosteal bone and a dense network of endochondral bone. In stereospondyl temnospondyls, high amounts of calcified cartilage are preserved in the endochondral trabeculae. Notably, the periosteal region is thickened and highly vascularized in the plagiosaurid stereospondyls. Among \"microsaur\" lepospondyls, the thickened periosteal region is composed of compact bone and the notochordal canal is surrounded by large cell lacunae. In nectridean lepospondyls, the periosteal region has a spongy structure with large intertrabecular spaces, whereas the endochondral region has a highly cancellous structure. Our observations indicate that regardless of whether multipartite or monospondylous, the centra of basal tetrapods display first endochondral and subsequently periosteal ossification. A high interspecific variability is observed in growth rate, organization, and initiation of periosteal ossification. Moreover, vertebral development and structure reflect different lifestyles. The bottom-dwelling Plagiosauridae increase their skeletal mass by hyperplasy of the periosteal region. In nectrideans, the skeletal mass decreases, as the microstructure is spongy and lightly built. Additionally, we observed that vertebral structure is influenced by miniaturization in some groups.

Between January, 2007 and January, 2013, two pediatric patients were admitted to our hospital with pathological fractures. One of the patients was a girl, aged 11 years, with confirmed osteosarcoma of the right distal femur; the other patient was a boy, aged 9 years, with osteosarcoma of the left distal femur. After receiving two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy following tumor biopsy, the patients received limb salvage surgery with epiphyseal preservation, with wide resection of the tumor and biological reconstruction by allogeneic bone and fibular autograft, followed by 10 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. With a mean follow-up of 64 months, there were no postoperative complications, local recurrence or metastasis. The limb function recovered well, although limb shortening was observed.

{"title": "Ruptured human Achilles tendon has elevated metabolic activity up to 1\u00a0year after repair.", "abstract": "Following Achilles tendon rupture, running is often allowed after 6\u00a0months. However, tendon healing is slow and the metabolic status of the tendon at this point is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate tendon metabolism (glucose uptake) and vascularization at 3, 6 and 12\u00a0months after Achilles tendon rupture as measured using PET and power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS).\nThe study group comprised 23 patients with surgically repaired Achilles tendon rupture who were investigated at 3\u00a0months (n\u2009=\u20097), 6\u00a0months (n\u2009=\u20097) and 12\u00a0months (n\u2009=\u20099) after surgery. The triceps surae complex was loaded over 20\u00a0min of slow treadmill walking while a radioactive tracer ((18)F-FDG) was administered prior to PET. Vascularization was measured in terms of PDUS flow activity, and patient-reported outcomes were scored using the Achilles tendon rupture score (ATRS) and sports assessment (VISA-A) questionnaire.\nRelative glucose uptake ((18)F-FDG) was higher in repaired tendons than in intact tendons at all time-points (6, 3 and 1.6 times higher at 3, 6 and 12\u00a0months, respectively; P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001), and was also higher in the tendon core than in the periphery at 3 and 6\u00a0months (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.02), but lower at 12\u00a0months (P\u2009=\u20090.06). Relative glucose uptake was negatively related to ATRS at 6\u00a0months after repair (r\u2009=\u2009-0.89, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01). PDUS flow activity was higher in repaired tendons than in intact tendons at 3 and 6\u00a0months (P\u2009<\u20090.05 for both), but had normalized by 12\u00a0months.\nThese data demonstrate that the healing process as determined by metabolic activity and vascularization continues for 6\u00a0months after injury when large loads are typically allowed on the tendon. Indeed, metabolic activity remained elevated for more than 1\u00a0year after injury despite normalized vascularization. The robust negative correlation between tendon metabolism and patient-reported outcome suggests that a high metabolic activity 6\u00a0months after the injury may be related to a poor clinical healing outcome.", "journal": "European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging", "date": "2016-04-14", "authors": ["PernillaEliasson", "ChristianCoupp\u00e9", "MarkusLonsdale", "Ren\u00e9 BSvensson", "ChristianNeergaard", "MichaelKj\u00e6r", "LarsFriberg", "S PeterMagnusson"], "doi": "10.1007/s00259-016-3379-4"}

Growth hormones and physical activity are thought to influence the vault thickness. Considering that both systemic factors and energy supply influence the vascular system, and taking into account the structural and biomechanical interaction between endocranial vessels and vault bones, in this study we evaluate the correlation between vascular and bone diameters. In particular, we tested the relationship between the thickness of the parietal bone (which is characterized, in modern humans, by a complex vascular network) and the lumen size of the middle meningeal and diploic vessels, in adult modern humans. Our results show no patent correlation between the thickness of parietal bone and the size of the main vascular channels. Values and distributions of the branching patterns, as well as anatomical relationships between vessels and bones, are also described in order to provide information concerning the arrangement of the endocranial vascular morphology.

Clinical data, scrotal colour Doppler, B-mode ultrasound and videos images were reviewed for each patient. The volume, echotexture of the testis, size, shape, echogenicity and the vascularization pattern of the lesion were evaluated. The tumour margins were categorized as either smooth or lobulated. The vascularization was classified as intense, moderate or without any hypervascularization. We defined the vascularization pattern groups as central, peripheral and mixed (the latter meaning both central and peripheral).\n26 patients were referred for infertility [5 patients were subsequently diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) and 5 patients with cryptorchidism]. 28 patients underwent testis-sparing surgery, while 8 patients underwent a radical orchiectomy. The LCTs were mostly infracentimetric (68.4%), with a median size of 7.0\u2009mm (ranging from 4.0 to 11\u2009mm). 50% of the lesions had lobulated margins, and these were significantly larger than the smooth lesions (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The content of the lesions was markedly homogeneous and hypoechoic. All lesions had sharp demarcations from the adjacent pulp. 36/38 lesions exhibited moderate-to-intense hypervascularization, with a mixed intrinsic and peripheral rim pattern. Larger lesions were more hypervascularized (p\u2009<\u20090.05). LCTs in patients with KS had atypical features.\nTypical sporadic LCTs appeared as isolated hypoechoic, infracentimetric masses, with a clear demarcation from the adjacent pulp. They presented intrinsic and peripheral rim hypervascularization.\nBy undertaking the largest imaging series of LCT to date (to our knowledge), we reassessed the typical sonographical aspects of LCTs, so as to provide guidance in regard to opting for testis-sparing surgery and for follow-up.

However, recent evidence suggests the problems with DC vaccines lies, at least in part, with the cancers ability to induce an immunosupressive response that suppresses any vaccine-mediated active immunity.

Furthermore, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) play an important role in immunoevasion.\nTo identify the effects of DC vaccination on antiangiogenesis induced by endostatin in rat glioma.\nRat basal ganglia glioma model was constructed and authenticated. The concentration of immunoglobulin G (IgG) was detected using rat IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. CD8+ T cell infiltration was measured by immunofluorescence.

In this work, two open-porous magnesium scaffolds with different pore size but in the nearly same porosity are successfully fabricated with high-purity Mg ingots through the titanium wire space holder (TWSH) method. The porosity and pore size can be easily, precisely and individually controlled, as well as the mechanical properties also can be regulated to be within the range of human cancellous bone by changing the orientation of pores without sacrifice the requisite porous structures. In vitro cell tests indicate that the scaffolds have good cytocompatibility and osteoblastic differentiation properties. In vivo findings demonstrate that both scaffolds exhibit acceptable inflammatory responses and can be almost fully degraded and replaced by newly formed bone. More importantly, under the same porosity, the scaffolds with larger pore size can promote early vascularization and up-regulate collagen type 1 and OPN expression, leading to higher bone mass and more mature bone formation. In conclusion, a new method is introduced to develop an open-porous magnesium scaffold with controllable microstructures and mechanical properties, which has great potential clinical application for bone reconstruction in the future.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-04-14", "authors": ["Meng-qiCheng", "TuerhongjiangWahafu", "Guo-fengJiang", "WeiLiu", "Yu-qinQiao", "Xiao-chunPeng", "TaoCheng", "Xian-longZhang", "GuoHe", "Xuan-yongLiu"], "doi": "10.1038/srep24134"}

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of FGF2 signaling on growth and vascularization of chick embryonic ventricular wall and its involvement in transmission of mechanical stretch-induced signaling to myocyte growth in vivo. Myocyte proliferation was significantly higher at the 48 h sampling interval in pressure-overloaded hearts. Neither Western blotting, nor immunohistochemistry performed on serial paraffin sections revealed any changes in the amount of myocardial FGF2 at that time point. ELISA showed a significant increase of FGF2 in the serum. Increased amount of FGF2 mRNA in the heart was confirmed by real time PCR. Blocking of FGF signaling by SU5402 led to decreased myocyte proliferation, hemorrhages in the areas of developing vasculature in epicardium and digit tips. FGF2 synthesis is increased in embryonic ventricular cardiomyocytes in response to increased stretch due to pressure overload.

This study aimed to disclose whether tongxinluo promotes neurological functional recovery and neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the infarcted area and SVZ after cerebral ischemic infarction in hypertensive rats. Methods. The ischemic model was prepared by distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in hypertensive rats. Tongxinluo was administrated 24\u2009h after MCAO and lasted for 3, 7, or 14 days. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate the protection of tongxinluo. Immunochemical staining was applied on brain tissue to evaluate the effects of tongxinluo on neurogenesis and vascularization in the MCAO model rats. Results. Postinjury administration of tongxinluo ameliorated the neuronal function deficit in the MCAO model rats. As evidenced by the immunochemical staining, BrdU(+)/DCX(+), BrdU(+)/nestin(+), and BrdU(+) vascular endothelial cells were promoted to proliferate in SVZ after tongxinluo administration. The matured neurons stained by NeuN and vascularization by laminin staining were observed after tongxinluo administration in the peri-infarct area. Conclusion.

Despite its high response rate, there are still 20% of cases in which the patients are not responding. This could be ascribed to the fact that bleomycin, when administered systemically, is not reaching the whole tumor mass properly because of the characteristics of tumor vascularization, in which case local administration could cover areas that are unreachable by systemic administration.\nWe propose combined bleomycin administration, both systemic and local, using companion animals as models. We selected 22 canine patients which failed to achieve a complete response after an ECT treatment session. Eleven underwent another standard ECT session (control group), while 11 received a combined local and systemic administration of bleomycin in the second treatment session.\nAccording to the WHO criteria, the response rates in the combined administration group were: complete response (CR) 54% (6), partial response (PR) 36% (4), stable disease (SD) 10% (1).

{"title": "Homing to solid cancers: a vascular checkpoint in adoptive cell therapy using CAR T-cells.", "abstract": "The success of adoptive T-cell therapies for the treatment of cancer patients depends on transferred T-lymphocytes finding and infiltrating cancerous tissues. For intravenously transferred T-cells, this means leaving the bloodstream (extravasation) from tumour blood vessels. In inflamed tissues, a key event in extravasation is the capture, rolling and arrest of T-cells inside blood vessels which precedes transmigration across the vessel wall and entry into tissues. This depends on co-ordinated signalling of selectins, integrins and chemokine receptors on T-cells by their respective ligands which are up-regulated on inflamed blood vessels. Clinical data and experimental studies in mice suggest that tumour blood vessels are anergic to inflammatory stimuli and the recruitment of cytotoxic CD8(+)T-lymphocytes is not very efficient. Interestingly, and somewhat counter-intuitively, anti-angiogenic therapy can promote CD8(+)T-cell infiltration of tumours and increase the efficacy of adoptive CD8(+)T-cell therapy. Rather than inhibit tumour angiogenesis, anti-angiogenic therapy 'normalizes' (matures) tumour blood vessels by promoting pericyte recruitment, increasing tumour blood vessel perfusion and sensitizing tumour blood vessels to inflammatory stimuli. A number of different approaches are currently being explored to increase recruitment by manipulating the expression of homing-associated molecules on T-cells and tumour blood vessels. Future studies should address whether these approaches improve the efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapies for solid, vascularized cancers in patients.", "journal": "Biochemical Society transactions", "date": "2016-04-14", "authors": ["AnnAger", "H AngharadWatson", "Sophie CWehenkel", "Rebar NMohammed"], "doi": "10.1042/BST20150254\n10.1126/science.1129139\n10.1038/nrc3245\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0431\n10.4161/onci.20492\n10.1126/science.1076514\n10.1126/science.1129003\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3002842\n10.1182/blood-2011-04-348540\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3005930\n10.1038/ni1275\n10.1038/nri3442\n10.1038/35065111\n10.1074/jbc.M608266200\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.12.007\n10.1126/science.1058867\n10.4049/jimmunol.172.8.4875\n10.1007/s00262-012-1378-2\n10.1182/blood-2011-07-367409\n10.1080/2162402X.2015.1008791\n10.1172/JCI66722\n10.1182/blood-2003-08-2717\n10.1172/JCI44952\n10.4049/jimmunol.1300967\n10.1038/ncomms8458\n10.1038/ncomms8114\n10.1097/CJI.0b013e3181ee6675\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0351\n10.1053/gast.2002.32369\n10.1126/science.aaa6204\n10.1038/nm1699\n10.1038/nm.3541\n10.1096/fj.05-4493com\n10.1084/jem.20060710\n10.1084/jem.20061890\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0709\n10.1172/JCI24480\n10.1002/1097-0142(19940315)73:6<1731::AID-CNCR2820730630>3.0.CO;2-H\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1183\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1190\n10.4049/jimmunol.173.12.7209\n10.1200/JCO.2008.16.5449\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0458\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1187\n10.1093/jnci/87.7.524\n10.1056/NEJM197108122850711\n10.1038/nature10169\n10.1073/pnas.1215397109\n10.1038/nature06868\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0153\n10.1002/eji.201041093\n10.1073/pnas.1118296109\n10.4049/jimmunol.1101877\n10.1038/ni.3159\n10.4049/jimmunol.172.10.5861\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1912\n10.1038/ni1029\n10.1084/jem.20121462"}
{"title": "Angioleiomyoma in a conger (Conger conger).", "abstract": "A wild adult male conger Conger conger, captured by a SCUBA diver in the waters of coastal Italy, was sent for laboratory analysis due to the presence of multiple productive ulcerous skin lesions localized in the dorso-lateral body area, caudally to the gill operculum under the dorsal fin. The main mass was sessile, ulcerated and hemorrhaging in appearance and was surrounded by several smaller masses, which originated peripherally from the same mass or were isolated, always with a tendency to ulceration. Histology confirmed that the newly formed tissue originated from derma invading the closer tissues. The tumour consisted of spindle cells, each with an ovoidal nucleus and rarely with evident nucleoli, which were arranged in parallel or storiform patterns and were often surrounding blood-filled spaces discontinuously lined by endothelial cells. Tumour tissue was richly vascularized and no mitoses were seen. The overlying epidermis was ulcerated. Masson's trichrome technique indicated the presence of a small amount of perivascular connective tissue. No excessive glycogen storage, bacteria, virus or fungi were detected by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-reaction. Immunohistochemistry showed dot-like or diffuse cytoplasmic positivity against smooth muscle actin and the monoclonal antibody D2-40. CD34 exhibited relevant immunoreactivity at plasma membranes. Growth fraction evaluated using MIB-1 was <1%. Immunoreactions for wide spectrum CK, CK5/6, CK8, CK18, EMA, desmin, myoglobin, S-100, CD20, CD68, GFAP, and NSE were negative. Histopathological and immunohistochemical results supported a diagnosis of angioleiomyoma, a benign tumour of the muscular cellular component of the blood vessels.

However, therapeutic effects are limited by low cell engraftment rates. We recently introduced a technique creating human hepatocyte spheroids for potential therapeutic application. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether these spheroids are suitable for engraftment in diseased liver tissues. Intrasplenic spheroid transplantation into immunodeficient uPA/SCID/beige mice was performed. Hepatocyte transduction ability prior to transplantation was tested by lentiviral labeling using red-green-blue (RGB) marking. Eight weeks after transplantation, animals were sacrificed and livers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. To investigate human hepatocyte-specific gene expression profiles in mice, quantitative real-time-PCR was applied. Human albumin and alpha-1-antitrypsin concentrations in mouse serum were quantified to assess the levels of human chimerism. Precultured human hepatocytes reestablished their physiological liver tissue architecture and function upon transplantation in mice. Positive immunohistochemical labeling of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen revealed that human hepatocytes retained their in vivo proliferation capacity. Expression profiles of human genes analyzed in chimeric mouse livers resembled levels determined in native human tissue. Extensive vascularization of human cell clusters was detected by demonstration of von Willebrand factor activity. To model gene therapy approaches, lentiviral transduction was performed ex vivo and fluorescent microscopic imaging revealed maintenance of RGB marking in vivo. Altogether, this is the first report demonstrating that cultured and retroviral transduced human hepatocyte spheroids are able to engraft and maintain their regenerative potential in vivo.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

In 42 cases tumor resection was performed with the assistance of hand-held flexible laser (L-group): in 8 cases CO2-fiber and in 34 2\u03bc-Thulium-fiber. Fortytwo patients, operated on without laser-assistance, were used as comparison group (C-group) (matched-pair-technique). Facial nerve function was assessed with the House-Brackmann (HB) scale preoperatively, 1 week postoperatively, and 6-month or more after surgery.\nOverall time from incision to skin suture changed in relation to size of tumor (165-575min) and was not affected by the use of laser. In 2 cases preoperative facial nerve palsy was observed. In the remaining 82 cases, at 6-month follow-up facial nerve preservation rate (HB I) was 90.2%.

The vascularized corticoperiosteal flap is harvested from the medial femoral condyle and it is nourished by the articular branch of the descending genicular artery and the superomedial genicular artery.

A 50-year-old Caucasian man referred to our department for hypertrophic nonunion of the distal femur, refractory to the conservative treatments. The first surgical choice was the revision of the nail and the bone reconstruction with a corticoperiosteal pedicled flap from the medial femoral condyle. We considered union to have occurred 3.5 months after surgery when radiographs showed bridging of at least three of the four bony cortices and clinically the patient was able to walk with full weight bearing without any pain. At the last follow-up (25 months), the patient was completely satisfied with the procedure. Discussion. The corticoperiosteal flap allows a faster healing of fractures with a minimal morbidity at the donor site.

Diagnosis, preoperative status, age at the time of surgery, surgical technique, complications and follow-up time were registered. Main outcome measures were visual acuity and graft survival as assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The independent role of risk factors on outcomes was evaluated by Cox multivariate regression analysis.\nForty-eight keratoplasties, 42 penetrating and six lamellar, were performed in 44 eyes of 39 children at the age of 4.5\u00a0months to 16\u00a0years (median, 12\u00a0years).

{"title": "Differential Expression between Human Dermal Papilla Cells from Balding and Non-Balding Scalps Reveals New Candidate Genes for Androgenetic Alopecia.", "abstract": "Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a common heritable and androgen-dependent hair loss condition in men. Twelve genetic risk loci are known to date, but it is unclear which genes at these loci are relevant for AGA. Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) located in the hair bulb are the main site of androgen activity in the hair follicle. Widely used monolayer-cultured primary DPCs in hair-related studies often lack dermal papilla characteristics. In contrast, immortalized DPCs have high resemblance to intact dermal papilla. We derived immortalized human DPC lines from balding (BAB) and non-balding (BAN) scalp. Both BAB and BAN retained high proportions of dermal papilla signature gene and versican protein expression. We performed expression analysis of BAB and BAN and annotated AGA risk loci with differentially expressed genes.

However, there are unique challenges associated with protein imaging experiments including the need for higher spatial resolution capabilities, improved image acquisition rates, and better molecular specificity. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of ultra-high speed MALDI-TOF and high mass resolution MALDI FTICR IMS platforms as they relate to these challenges. High spatial resolution MALDI-TOF protein images of rat brain tissue and cystic fibrosis lung tissue were acquired at image acquisition rates >25 pixels/s. Structures as small as 50 \u03bcm were spatially resolved and proteins associated with host immune response were observed in cystic fibrosis lung tissue. Ultra-high speed MALDI-TOF enables unique applications including megapixel molecular imaging as demonstrated for lipid analysis of cystic fibrosis lung tissue. Additionally, imaging experiments using MALDI FTICR IMS were shown to produce data with high mass accuracy (<5 ppm) and resolving power (\u223c75\u2009000 at m/z 5000) for proteins up to \u223c20 kDa.

The aim of this study was to biomechanically compare three commonly utilized plating techniques for rigid fixation of fibula bone flaps in reconstructing lateral segmental mandibular defects.\nPolyurethane mandibles with 3-cm segmental defects were reconstructed using polyurethane fibula models. Three fixation techniques were compared (n\u2009=\u20095 models per group): Group 1 used two 2.0-mm miniplates at each osteotomy site, Group 2 used a single 2.3-mm plate, and Group 3 used a single 2.7-mm plate. Biomechanical testing of maximum force and displacement at failure for each plating technique was assessed and statistical comparison performed.\nThe average displacement for Group 1 was 14.08\u2009\u00b1\u20091.42 mm, Group 2 was 5.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.89 mm, and Group 3 was 6.03\u2009\u00b1\u20091.59 mm.

In this study, we observed that the scaffold promoted the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) that adhered to the DC scaffold in vitro. We next examined the pathological changes of the implanted DC graft in vivo, and found a decreased volume of the scaffold and a dramatic angiogenesis within the scaffold. The average microvessel density (aMVD) increased at the early stage, while decreased at the later stage post transplantation. Expression level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) showed similar dynamic changes. In addition, many endothelial cells (ECs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were distributed in the region which contained active angiogenesis in the scaffold.

Since CLI is characterized by insufficient tissue vascularization, efforts have focused on the discovery of novel angiogenic factors. Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is an immunophilin that has been shown to promote angiogenesis in vitro and to enhance bone marrow (BM) cell mobilization in vivo. However, its potential as an angiogenic factor in CLI is still unknown. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate whether CyPA might induce neo-angiogenesis in ischemic tissues.\nWild-type C57Bl/6j mice underwent acute hind-limb ischemia (HLI) and received a single intramuscular administration of recombinant CyPA or saline. Limb perfusion, capillary density and arteriole number in adductor muscles were significantly increased after CyPA treatment. Interestingly, BM-derived CD117(+) cell recruitment was significantly higher in ischemic adductor tissue of mice treated with CyPA versus saline. Therefore, the effect of CyPA on isolated BM-derived CD117(+) cells in vitro was evaluated. Low concentrations of CyPA stimulated CD117(+) cell proliferation while high concentrations promoted cell death. Moreover, CyPA enhanced CD117(+) cell adhesion and migration in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies revealed that CyPA up-regulated CXCR4 in CD117(+) cells and in adductor muscles after ischemia. Additionally, SDF-1/CXCR4 axis inhibition by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 decreased CyPA-mediated CD117(+) cell recruitment in the ischemic limb.\nCyPA induces neo-angiogenesis by recruiting BM-derived CD117(+) cell into ischemic tissues, at least in part, through SDF-1/CXCR4 axis.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2016-04-09", "authors": ["Gianluca LPerrucci", "StefaniaStraino", "MariaCorlian\u00f2", "AlessandroScopece", "MonicaNapolitano", "Bradford CBerk", "FedericoLombardi", "GiulioPompilio", "Maurizio CCapogrossi", "PatriziaNigro"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.03.082"}

{"title": "Increased Survival and Function of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Spheroids Entrapped in Instructive Alginate Hydrogels.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies are under broad investigation for applications in tissue repair but suffer from poor cell persistence and engraftment upon transplantation. MSC spheroids exhibit improved survival, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic potential in vitro, while also promoting vascularization when implanted in vivo. However, these benefits are lost once cells engage the tissue extracellular matrix and migrate from the aggregate. The efficacy of cell therapy is consistently improved when using engineered materials, motivating the need to investigate the role of biomaterials to instruct spheroid function. In order to assess the contribution of adhesivity on spheroid activity in engineered materials and promote the bone-forming potential of MSCs, we compared the function of MSC spheroids when entrapped in Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-modified alginate hydrogels to nonfouling unmodified alginate. Regardless of material, MSC spheroids exhibited reduced caspase activity and greater vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion compared with equal numbers of dissociated cells. MSC spheroids in RGD-modified hydrogels demonstrated significantly greater cell survival than spheroids in unmodified alginate. After 5 days in culture, spheroids in RGD-modified gels had similar levels of apoptosis, but more than a twofold increase in VEGF secretion compared with spheroids in unmodified gels. All gels contained mineralized tissue 8 weeks after subcutaneous implantation, and cells entrapped in RGD-modified alginate exhibited greater mineralization versus cells in unmodified gels. Immunohistochemistry confirmed more diffuse osteocalcin staining in gels containing spheroids compared with dissociated controls. This study demonstrates the promise of cell-instructive biomaterials to direct survival and function of MSC spheroids for bone tissue engineering applications.\nMesenchymal stem cell (MSC) spheroids exhibit improved therapeutic potential in vitro compared with dissociated MSCs, yet spheroids are directly injected into tissues, ceding control of cell function to the extracellular matrix and potentially limiting the duration of improvement. Cell delivery using adhesive biomaterials promotes cell retention and function. These studies explored the role of adhesion to the surrounding matrix on spheroid function. When entrapped in an adhesive biomaterial, MSC spheroids exhibited improved survival and proangiogenic growth factor secretion in vitro and bone formation in vivo compared with cells in nonadhesive hydrogels.

{"title": "The Use of a Custom-made Prosthesis in the Treatment of Chondrosarcoma of Distal Radius.", "abstract": "The most common neoplasms of the distal radius are primary tumors, of which aneurysmal bone cysts and giant cell tumors are seen almost exclusively. Chondrosarcomas are most commonly located in the pelvis, ribs and proximal segments of the extremities; they rarely occur in forearm bones. Bone defects after distal radial resection can be replaced with bone grafts, both autogenous and allogenic. There is always a risk of failure of the bones to mend or slower synostosis, which necessitates the search for new treatments. Recently, custom-made prostheses have been used with increasing frequency. In early 2015, a 25-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Orthopedic Oncology in Brzoz\u00f3w on account of a tumor involving the epiphysis and metaphysis of the right distal radius. Imaging studies confirmed that the lesion was a neoplasm and a biopsy revealed a chondrosarcoma. Radical resection of the tumor was attempted and a custom-made prosthesis was inserted in the place of the bone defect. The prosthesis was designed and manufactured over 4 weeks. No complications occurred during the surgery or in the postoperative period. After the surgery, the forearm and wrist were in a plaster splint for 6 weeks and then rehabilitation was started. The treatment outcome was good. Now, three months after the surgery, the patient has good wrist mobility and efficient grip. Surgical treatment of malignant tumors of the distal radius with extensive bone resection poses the challenge of bone replacement and recovery of fair hand function. Commonly known and practised, reconstructions with autogenous or allogenic bone grafts enable partial restoration of the radiocarpal joint surface and DRUJ. The use of large bone grafts is associated with a risk of non-union and limited hand function even if the grafts are vascularized. Arthrodesis of the radiocarpal joint is currently performed less and less frequently. Custom-made prostheses appear to be a good solution. This method makes it possible to restore the anatomy of bones and joint surfaces and to achieve good limb function and mobility and the incidence of complications, as described in the literature, is low.

The treatment of HUVECs with CML Curcu-exosomes reduced RhoB expression and negatively modulated endothelial cells motility. We showed that the addition of CML control exosomes to HUVECs caused an increase in IL8 and VCAM1 levels, but Curcu-exosomes reversed these effects thus attenuating their angiogenic properties. This antiangiogenic effect was confirmed with in vitro and in vivo vascular network formation assays. SWATH analysis of the proteomic profile of Curcu-exosomes revealed that Curcumin treatment deeply changes their molecular properties, in particular, Curcumin induces a release of exosomes depleted in pro-angiogenic proteins and enriched in proteins endowed with anti-angiogenic activity.

Methods\u2003The authors included 20 patients with a minimum follow-up of 24 months in this study, and retrospectively reviewed patients' hospital records and used a preinformation form, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), and the 15D health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument to perform a cross-sectional assessment. Results\u2003A total of 9 adults and 11 children underwent vascularized fibular transfer for radical tumor resection (n\u2009=\u200913), infection (n\u2009=\u20091), injury (n\u2009=\u20093), or secondary pseudoarthrosis (n\u2009=\u20093) in various locations of the upper extremity. The median follow-up period was 6 years. Six reoperations proved necessary: one early reanastomosis and five revisions with cancellous bone grafting to enhance union. Altogether, 19 of the 20 grafts survived: one graft failed due to infection. One arm was amputated due to tumor recurrence. The median duration of bone union was 12 months. One graft never achieved distal union, whereas another developed nonunion after a stress fracture. Ten patients completed the questionnaires, with a median of 15.3 years postoperatively.

{"title": "Improved ROS defense in the swimbladder of a facultative air-breathing erythrinid fish, jeju, compared to a non-air-breathing close relative, traira.", "abstract": "The jeju Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus and the traira Hoplias malabaricus are two closely related erythrinid fish, both possessing a two-chambered physostomous swimbladder. In the jeju the anterior section of the posterior bladder is highly vascularized and the swimbladder is used for aerial respiration; the traira, in turn, is a water-breather that uses the swimbladder as a buoyancy organ and not for aerial oxygen uptake. Observation of the breathing behavior under different levels of water oxygenation revealed that the traira started aquatic surface respiration only under severe hypoxic conditions and did not breathe air. In the jeju air-breathing behavior was observed under normoxic conditions, and the frequency of air-breathing was significantly increased under hypoxic conditions. Unexpectedly, even under hyperoxic conditions (30\u00a0mg\u00a0O2\u00a0L(-1)) the jeju continued to take air breaths, and compared with normoxic conditions the frequency was not reduced. Because the frequently air-exposed swimbladder tissue faces higher oxygen partial pressures than normally experienced by other fish tissues, it was hypothesized that in the facultative air-breathing jeju, swimbladder tissue would have a higher antioxidative capacity than the swimbladder tissue of the water breathing traira. Measurement of total glutathione (GSSG/GSH) concentration in anterior and posterior swimbladder tissue revealed a higher concentration of this antioxidant in swimbladder tissue as compared to muscle tissue in the jeju. Furthermore, the GSSG/GSH concentration in jeju tissues was significantly higher than in traira tissues. Similarly, activities of enzymes involved in the breakdown of reactive oxygen species were significantly higher in the jeju swimbladder as compared to the traira swimbladder. The results show that the jeju, using the swimbladder as an additional breathing organ, has an enhanced antioxidative capacity in the swimbladder as compared to the traira, using the swimbladder only as a buoyancy organ.", "journal": "Journal of comparative physiology.

{"title": "A pore way to heal and regenerate: 21st century thinking on biocompatibility.", "abstract": "This article raises central questions about the definition of biocompatibility, and also about how we assess biocompatibility. We start with the observation that a porous polymer where every pore is spherical, \u223c40 microns in diameter and interconnected, can heal into vascularized tissues with little or no fibrosis and good restoration of vascularity (i.e., little or no foreign body reaction). The same polymer in solid form will trigger the classic foreign body reaction characterized by a dense, collagenous foreign body capsule and low vascularity. A widely used definition of biocompatibility is 'the ability of a material to perform with an appropriate host response in a specific application'. With precision-porous polymers, in direct comparison with the same polymer in solid form, we have the same material, in the same application, with two entirely different biological reactions. Can both reactions be 'biocompatible?'

{"title": "Segmenting Retinal Blood Vessels With Deep Neural Networks.", "abstract": "The condition of the vascular network of human eye is an important diagnostic factor in ophthalmology. Its segmentation in fundus imaging is a nontrivial task due to variable size of vessels, relatively low contrast, and potential presence of pathologies like microaneurysms and hemorrhages. Many algorithms, both unsupervised and supervised, have been proposed for this purpose in the past. We propose a supervised segmentation technique that uses a deep neural network trained on a large (up to 400[Formula: see text]000) sample of examples preprocessed with global contrast normalization, zero-phase whitening, and augmented using geometric transformations and gamma corrections. Several variants of the method are considered, including structured prediction, where a network classifies multiple pixels simultaneously. When applied to standard benchmarks of fundus imaging, the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE databases, the networks significantly outperform the previous algorithms on the area under ROC curve measure (up to > 0.99) and accuracy of classification (up to > 0.97 ). The method is also resistant to the phenomenon of central vessel reflex, sensitive in detection of fine vessels ( sensitivity > 0.87 ), and fares well on pathological cases.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "date": "2016-04-06", "authors": ["PawelLiskowski", "KrzysztofKrawiec"], "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2016.2546227"}

Mutations in hemojuvelin (HJV), an iron-regulatory protein and a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor, underlie most of the juvenile type. Hjv(-/-) mice accumulate excess iron in retina and exhibit aberrant vascularization and angiomas. A succinate receptor, GPR91, is pro-angiogenic in retina. We hypothesized that Hjv(-/-) retinas have increased BMP signaling and increased GPR91 expression as the basis of angiomas.\nExpression of GPR91 was examined by qPCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot in wild-type and Hjv(-/-) mouse retinas and pRPE cells. Influence of excess iron and BMP6 on GPR91 expression was investigated in ARPE-19 cells, and wild-type and Hjv(-/-) pRPE cells. Succinate was used to activate GPR91 and determine the effects of GPR91 signaling on VEGF expression. Signaling of BMP6 was studied by the expression of Smad1/5/8 and pSmad4, and the BMP-target gene Id1. The interaction of pSmad4 with GPR91 promoter was studied by ChIP.\nExpression of GPR91 was higher in Hjv(-/-) retinas and RPE than in wild-type counterparts. Unexpectedly, BMP signaling was increased, not decreased, in Hjv(-/-) retinas and RPE. Bone morphogenetic protein 6 induced GPR91 in RPE, suggesting that increased BMP signaling in Hjv(-/-) retinas was likely responsible for GPR91 upregulation. Exposure of RPE to excess iron and succinate as well as BMP6 and succinate increased VEGF expression. Bone morphogenetic protein 6 promoted the interaction of pSmad4 with GPR91 promoter in RPE.\nG-protein-coupled receptor 91 is a BMP6 target and Hjv deletion enhances BMP signaling in retina, thus underscoring a role for excess iron and hemochromatosis in abnormal retinal vascularization.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2016-04-06", "authors": ["PachiappanArjunan", "Jaya PGnanaprakasam", "SudhaAnanth", "Michelle ARomej", "Veeranan-KarmegamRajalakshmi", "Puttur DPrasad", "Pamela MMartin", "MariappanGurusamy", "MuthusamyThangaraju", "Yangzom DBhutia", "VadivelGanapathy"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.15-17437"}

RCC is frequently infiltrated with immune cells, with macrophages being the most abundant cell type. Alternatively activated M2 macrophages are known to contribute to tumor progression. Endostatin (ES) is a fragment of collagen XVIII that possesses antiangiogenic activity. In this study, we investigated the impact of ES gene therapy on the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in lung metastases from tumor-bearing mice.\nBALB/c mice divided into three groups: Normal, Control and ES-treated. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with ES-transduced cells or control cells over ten days. At the end of the study, plasma was collected, and pulmonary macrophages were isolated and used for FACS or RT-PCR. ELISA tests were used to analyze plasma and cell culture supernatant cytokines.\nES treatment significantly reduced the levels of anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic cytokines, including IL4, IL-10, IL-13 and VEGF. Gene expression of M2 markers, such as IL-10, Arg-1, VEGF and YM-1, declined significantly. Flow cytometry showed a reduction in the number of M2 F4/80+CD36+CD206+CD209+ macrophages and in IL-10 secretion by these cells. Reduced levels of IL-10 were also found in the culture supernatants of the ES-treated group.\nOur research corroborates previous observations that ES has an important anti-tumoral role.

Here, we have shown that endothelial cell (EC) plasticity drives aberrant vascularization and chemoresistance in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By utilizing human patient specimens, as well as allograft and genetic murine GBM models, we revealed that a robust endothelial plasticity in GBM allows acquisition of fibroblast transformation (also known as endothelial mesenchymal transition [Endo-MT]), which is characterized by EC expression of fibroblast markers, and determined that a prominent population of GBM-associated fibroblast-like cells have EC origin. Tumor ECs acquired the mesenchymal gene signature without the loss of EC functions, leading to enhanced cell proliferation and migration, as well as vessel permeability. Furthermore, we identified a c-Met/ETS-1/matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14) axis that controls VE-cadherin degradation, Endo-MT, and vascular abnormality. Pharmacological c-Met inhibition induced vessel normalization in patient tumor-derived ECs. Finally, EC-specific KO of Met inhibited vascular transformation, normalized blood vessels, and reduced intratumoral hypoxia, culminating in suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in GBM-bearing mice after temozolomide treatment. Together, these findings illustrate a mechanism that controls aberrant tumor vascularization and suggest that targeting Endo-MT may offer selective and efficient strategies for antivascular and vessel normalization therapies in GBM, and possibly other malignant tumors.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2016-04-05", "authors": ["MengguiHuang", "TianrunLiu", "PeihongMa", "R AlanMitteer", "ZhentingZhang", "Hyun JunKim", "EujinYeo", "DuoZhang", "PeiqiangCai", "ChunshengLi", "LinZhang", "BotaoZhao", "LauraRoccograndi", "Donald MO'Rourke", "NadiaDahmane", "YanqingGong", "ConstantinosKoumenis", "YiFan"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI84876\n10.1038/nrd3455\n10.1038/nm.2537\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1056/NEJMoa043330\n10.1038/nrc2818\n10.1056/NEJMoa1308573\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.11.021\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.040352\n10.1038/nature07760\n10.1038/nature08764\n10.1038/nature08761\n10.1038/nature08738\n10.1038/nature07679\n10.1038/nm1613\n10.2353/ajpath.2009.090096\n10.1681/ASN.2008050513\n10.1038/nm.2252\n10.1016/j.celrep.2012.10.021\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3006927\n10.1038/nature12207\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-3127\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3067\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.01.001\n10.1038/ncb2954\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.06.030\n10.1073/pnas.1016030108\n10.1073/pnas.1017547108\n10.1016/j.ccr.2005.08.002\n10.1016/0092-8674(87)90294-7\n10.1038/nrm3758\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000055331.41937.AA\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.2852\n10.1128/MCB.22.4.1060-1072.2002\n10.1083/jcb.119.3.629\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0489\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2527\n10.1126/science.289.5482.1197\n10.1056/NEJMoa033153\n10.1016/j.ccr.2007.04.017\n10.1038/nature09557\n10.1038/nature09624\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604662\n10.1172/JCI39104\n10.1038/nrc822\n10.1016/j.ccr.2012.05.037\n10.1038/nature09002\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601886\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1031"}

Tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and its receptor, fibroblast growth factor-inducible molecule (Fn14), are involved in preventing local cytotoxicity and counterbalancing the cytotoxic function of uNK cells. Here, we studied the regulation of TWEAK/Fn14-mediated innate immunity in the uterus using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model of abortion in pregnant mice. Specifically, we detected the expression of TWEAK and Fn14 in the uterus and in uNK cells following LPS treatment. Our results revealed that TWEAK and Fn14 are expressed by uNK cells in pregnant mice; in particular, it appears that the cytokine TWEAK is primarily derived from uNK cells. Interestingly, the down-regulation of TWEAK in uNK cells and the up-regulation of the Fn14 receptor in the uterus in LPS-treated mice may contribute to the disruption of decidual homeostasis by altering uNK cell cytotoxicity - ultimately leading to fetal rejection.

{"title": "A generative modeling approach to connectivity-Electrical conduction in vascular networks.", "abstract": "The physiology of biological structures is inherently dynamic and emerges from the interaction and assembly of large collections of small entities. The extent of coupled entities complicates modeling and increases computational load. Here, microvascular networks are used to present a novel generative approach to connectivity based on the observation that biological organization is hierarchical and composed of a limited set of building blocks, i.e. a vascular network consists of blood vessels which in turn are composed by one or more cell types. Fast electrical communication is crucial to synchronize vessel tone across the vast distances within a network. We hypothesize that electrical conduction capacity is delimited by the size of vascular structures and connectivity of the network. Generation and simulation of series of dynamical models of electrical spread within vascular networks of different size and composition showed that (1) Conduction is enhanced in models harboring long and thin endothelial cells that couple preferentially along the longitudinal axis. (2) Conduction across a branch point depends on endothelial connectivity between branches. (3) Low connectivity sub-networks are more sensitive to electrical perturbations. In summary, the capacity for electrical signaling in microvascular networks is strongly shaped by the morphology and connectivity of vascular (particularly endothelial) cells. While the presented software can be used by itself or as a starting point for more sophisticated models of vascular dynamics, the generative approach can be applied to other biological systems, e.g. nervous tissue, the lymphatics, or the biliary system.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2016-04-04", "authors": ["Bj\u00f8rn OlavHald"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.03.032"}

However, curve-skeletons are typically sensitive to small scale surface features which may arise from noise in the imaging data. In this paper, new post-processing techniques for curve-skeletons are presented which ensure that measurements of lengths and thicknesses are less sensitive to these small scale surface features. The techniques achieve sub-voxel accuracy and are based on a minimal sphere-network representation in which the object is modelled as a string of minimally overlapping spheres, and as such samples the object on a scale related to the local thickness. A new measure of cross-sectional dimension termed the modal radius is defined and shown to be more robust in comparison with the standard measure (the internal radius), while retaining the desirable feature of capturing the size of structures in terms of a single measure. The techniques are demonstrated by application to trabecular bone and tumour vascular network case studies where the volumetric data was obtained by high resolution computed tomography.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2016-04-02", "authors": ["Robert SBradley", "Philip JWithers"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.03.008"}
{"title": "Neuropilin-1-Expressing Microglia Are Associated With Nascent Retinal Vasculature Yet Dispensable for Developmental Angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a transmembrane receptor that is critical for vascular development within the central nervous system (CNS). It binds and influences signaling of several key angiogenic factors, such as VEGF-165, semaphorin 3A, platelet derived growth factor, and more. Neuropilin-1 is expressed by neurons and endothelial cells as well as a subpopulation of proangiogenic macrophages/microglia that are thought to interact with endothelial tip cells to promote vascular anastomosis during brain vascularization. We previously demonstrated a significant role for NRP-1 in macrophage chemotaxis and showed that NRP-1-expressing microglia are major contributors to pathologic retinal angiogenesis. Given this influence on CNS angiogenesis, we now investigated the involvement of microglia-resident NRP-1 in developmental retinal vascularization.\nWe followed NRP-1 expressing microglia during retinal development. We used LysM-cre myeloid lineage-driver cre mice to reduce expression of NRP-1 in retinal myeloid-derived cells and performed a comprehensive morphometric analysis of retinal vasculature during development.\nWe provide evidence that NRP-1+ microglia are present throughout the retina during vascular development with a preference for the non-vascularized retina. Using LysM-Cre/Nrp1(fl/fl) mice, we reduced NRP-1 expression by ~65% in retinal microglia and demonstrate that deficiency in NRP-1 in these microglia does not impair retinal angiogenesis.\nOur data draw a dichotomous role for NRP-1 in cells of myeloid lineage where it is dispensable for adequate retinal developmental vascularization yet obligate for pathologic retinal angiogenesis.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2016-04-02", "authors": ["AgnieszkaDejda", "GaelleMawambo", "Jean-FrancoisDaudelin", "KhalilMiloudi", "NaoufalAkla", "ChintanPatel", "Elisabeth M M AAndriessen", "NathalieLabrecque", "FlorianSennlaub", "PrzemyslawSapieha"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.15-18598"}

Three-dimensional power Doppler (3DPD) angiography has been used for the evaluation of utero-placental vascularisation and three vascular indices have been calculated: the vascularisation index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularisation-FI (VFI). However, several technical endpoints hinder the clinical use of 3DPD as physical characteristics and machine settings may affect 3DPD indices, and so its clinical significance is not yet clear.\nThe primary objective is to better understand the clinical significance of 3DPD indices by evaluating the relationship between these indices and placental morphometry. Secondary objectives are (i) to determine the impact of machine settings and physical characteristics on 3DPD indices, and (ii) to evaluate physio-pathological placental vascularisation patterns.\nThis is a prospective controlled study. We expect to include 112 women: 84 with normal pregnancies and 28 with PE and/or IUGR (based on our former cohort study on 3DPD indices for PE and/or IUGR prediction (unpublished data)). Within 72 h before planned or semi-urgent caesarean section, utero-placental 3DPD images with five different machine settings will be acquired. Placentas will be collected and examined after surgery and stereological indices (volume density, surface density, length density) calculated.

We have previously shown that the differential capacity of these two VEGF isoforms to bind Neuropilin-1 accounts for their diverse ability to recruit Nrp1-expressing monocytes (NEMs), resulting in a different arteriogenic potential. Here we measure the expression of VEGF165 and VEGF121 in human cancer and their influence on tumor growth and vascularization. We measured the expression levels of VEGF165 and VEGF121 in human colorectal cancer and found that VEGF121 was more expressed than VEGF165, particularly in patients with extensive lymph node infiltration. Overexpressing either VEGF165 or VEGF121 in a cancer mouse model, we observed that the former decreased, whereas the latter increased tumor growth. In both clinical and experimental tumors, VEGF165 expression resulted in the recruitment of NEMs, paralleled by maturation of the tumor vascular network. Finally, hypoxia induced a shift toward the VEGF165 isoform in the central core of human cancers, as well as in various types of cultured cells. These results demonstrate that the two VEGF splicing isoforms are differentially expressed in colorectal cancers, exerting opposite effects on tumor growth and vessel maturation.", "journal": "Cancer gene therapy", "date": "2016-04-02", "authors": ["MKazemi", "ACarrer", "SMoimas", "LZandon\u00e0", "RBussani", "BCasagranda", "SPalmisano", "PPrelazzi", "MGiacca", "LZentilin", "NDe Manzini", "MGiacca", "SZacchigna"], "doi": "10.1038/cgt.2016.12"}

In vivo studies identified that the endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs), a subtype of endothelial progenitor cells that can be isolated from umbilical cord or peripheral blood, represent a promising cell source for therapeutic neovascularization. ECFCs not only are able to initiate and facilitate neovascularization in diseased tissue but also can, by acting in a paracrine manner, contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for efficient and appropriate differentiation of tissue-resident stem or progenitor cells. This review outlines the progress in the field of in vivo regenerative and tissue engineering studies and surveys why, when, and how ECFCs can be used for tissue regeneration.\nReviewed literature that regard human-derived ECFCs in xenogeneic animal models implicates that ECFCs should be considered as an endothelial cell source of preference for induction of neovascularization. Their neovascularization and regenerative potential is augmented in combination with other types of stem or progenitor cells. Biocompatible scaffolds prevascularized with ECFCs interconnect faster and better with the host vasculature. The physical incorporation of ECFCs in newly formed blood vessels grants prolonged release of trophic factors of interest, which also makes ECFCs an interesting cell source candidate for gene therapy and delivery of bioactive compounds in targeted area.\nECFCs possess all biological features to be considered as a cell source of preference for tissue engineering and repair of blood supply.

Loss-of-function mutations in the Wnt-binding co-receptor LRP5 leads to aberrant ocular vascularization and loss of vision in genetic disorders such as osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome. The canonical Wnt-\u03b2-catenin pathway is known to regulate retinal vascular development. However, it is unclear what precise role LPR5 plays in this process. Here, we show that loss of LRP5 function in mice causes retinal hypovascularization during development as well as retinal neovascularization in adulthood with disorganized and leaky vessels. Using a highly specific Flk1-CreBreier line for vascular endothelial cells, together with several genetic models, we demonstrate that loss of endothelium-derived LRP5 recapitulates the retinal vascular defects in Lrp5-/- mice. In addition, restoring LRP5 function only in endothelial cells in Lrp5-/- mice rescues their retinal vascular abnormalities. Furthermore, we show that retinal vascularization is regulated by LRP5 in a dosage dependent manner and does not depend on LRP6.

When compared to traditional adherent cell lines, suspension cell lines recapitulate the genetic profiles and histologic features of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with higher fidelity. Using a modified neural stem cell culture technique, here we report the characterization of GBM cell lines including GBM variants.\nTumor tissue samples were obtained intra-operatively and cultured in neural stem cell conditions containing growth factors. Tumor lines were characterized in vitro using differentiation assays followed by immunostaining for lineage-specific markers. In vivo tumor formation was assayed by orthotopic injection in nude mice. Genetic uniqueness was confirmed via short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profiling.\nThirteen oncosphere lines derived from GBM and GBM variants, including a GBM with PNET features and a GBM with oligodendroglioma component, were established. All unique lines showed distinct genetic profiles by STR profiling. The lines assayed demonstrated a range of in vitro growth rates. Multipotency was confirmed using in vitro differentiation.

Based on this and on our previous knowledge about vascular effects of CDK5, we investigated the role of CDK5 in angiogenesis in HCC, one of the most vascularized tumors. We put a special focus on the transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1, a master regulator of tumor angiogenesis.The interaction of CDK5 with HIF-1\u03b1 was tested by Western blot, PCR, reporter gene assay, immunohistochemistry, kinase assay, co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and mutation studies. In vivo, different murine HCC models, were either induced by diethylnitrosamine or subcutaneous injection of HUH7 or HepG2 cells. The correlation of vascular density and CDK5 was assessed by immunostaining of a microarray of liver tissues from HCC patients.Inhibition of CDK5 in endothelial or HCC cells reduced HIF-1\u03b1 levels in vitro and in vivo, and transcription of HIF-1\u03b1 target genes (VEGFA, VEGFR1, EphrinA1). Mass spectrometry and site directed mutagenesis revealed a stabilizing phosphorylation of HIF-1\u03b1 at Ser687 by CDK5.

These results are absolutely fundamental for the evaluation of retinal and choroidal vascular diseases and allow the clinician to define and diagnose several pathological conditions. Fluorescein angiography has become the 'gold standard' in retinal imaging due to its capacity to allow visualization of the retinal capillary bed and its changes, particularly in the macular area. Although the fluorescence of the injected dye enables improved visualization of retinal capillaries, not all of the different layers of the retinal capillary network can be visualized using this bi-dimensional examination technique, possibly because of a light scattering phenomenon. Optical coherence tomography angiography allows depth-resolved visualization of the retinal and choroidal microvasculature by calculating the difference between static and nonstatic tissue. Given that the main moving elements in the eye fundus are contained within vessels, determining a vascular decorrelation signal enables three-dimensional visualization of the retinal and choroidal vascular network without the administration of intravenous dye and therefore reduces the risk of potential adverse events.", "journal": "Developments in ophthalmology", "date": "2016-03-31", "authors": ["GabrielCoscas", "MarcoLupidi", "FlorenceCoscas"], "doi": "10.1159/000442775"}

We performed virtual mandibulectomy and superimposed the 3-dimensional iliac image on the mandibular defect. The surgeon shaped the iliac flap according to virtual parameters and the stereomodel. Surgical navigation was used to check and correct the shaped segments. The position of the osteotomy lines and relevant parameters regarding the shape of the iliac flap also were provided to the surgeon. After computer simulation, a reconstructed mandibular stereomodel was manufactured. A reconstruction plate was prebent and fixed on this model using titanium screws. The model was scanned, data were imported into ProPlan CMF, the mandible was segmented, and data were imported into the intraoperative navigation system. Then, the model was registered with the original CT data, and the reconstruction plate was eliminated. Navigation data were exported into a universal serial bus drive, which was connected to the terminal working station during surgery. Intraoperative navigation was used to implement the virtual plan for patients. The sagittal, coronal, axial, and 3-dimensional reconstruction images displayed by the navigation system were used to accurately determine the osteotomy sites and osteotomy trajectory during surgery. Surgical probe guidance was used to mark the osteotomy line and transfer the virtual procedure to real-time surgery.\nUsing our method, we precisely recovered the original configuration of the mandible.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) through its receptor CD44 has been described to be involved in the process of angiogenesis.\nTo study the effect of HA synthesis inhibition using non-toxic doses of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) on endometriosis-related angiogenesis.\nThe cytotoxicity of different in vitro doses of 4-MU on endothelial cells was firstly tested by means of a lactate dehydrogenase assay. The anti-angiogenic action of non-cytotoxic doses of 4-MU was then assessed by a rat aortic ring assay. In addition, endometriotic lesions were induced in dorsal skinfold chambers of female BALB/c mice, which were daily treated with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.9% NaCl (vehicle group; n = 6), 20 mg/kg 4-MU (n = 8) or 80 mg/kg 4-MU (n = 7) throughout an observation period of 14 days. The effect of 4-MU on their vascularization, survival and growth were studied by intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry.\nNon-cytotoxic doses of 4-MU effectively inhibited vascular sprout formation in the rat aortic ring assay. Endometriotic lesions in dorsal skinfold chambers of 4-MU-treated mice dose-dependently exhibited a significantly smaller vascularized area and lower functional microvessel density when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Histological analyses revealed a downregulation of HA expression in 4-MU-treated lesions. This was associated with a reduced density of CD31-positive microvessels within the lesions. In contrast, numbers of PCNA-positive proliferating and cleaved caspase-3-positive apoptotic cells did not differ between 4-MU-treated and control lesions.\nThe present study demonstrates for the first time that targeting the synthesis of HA suppresses angiogenesis in developing endometriotic lesions.

Ultrasound guided percutaneous thrombin injection was successfully performed.\nThrombin injection might be a safe alternative option in the treatment of pseudoaneurysm of the deep palmar arch.", "journal": "EJVES short reports", "date": "2016-03-26", "authors": ["ABosman", "H T CVeger", "FDoornink", "P P AHedeman Joosten"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejvssr.2016.03.002"}
{"title": "Ultrasound diagnosis of uterine myomas.", "abstract": "Myomas represent a large part of benign gynecological pathology, widely spread in fertile female population. First step to diagnose fibroids is ultrasound (US) that can be 2-dimensional (2D), 3-dimensional (3D), Color Doppler (CD) and sonohysterography (SHG). This review develops according to MUSA's sonographic features (Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment). One of the main topic of interest for ultrasonographer today is endo/myometrial junctional zone (JZ), because it may be useful to discern a diagnosis of myoma and adenomyosis. Another important aspect of ultrasound is the analysis of vascularization in front of a uterine lesion. Indeed, vascular pattern can be used to make differential diagnosis between myoma-adenomyosis and leiomyosarcomas. Myomas should be described accurately according to sonographic guidelines. Sonographic features correlated with symptoms should guide an appropriate surgical or medical treatment.", "journal": "Minerva ginecologica", "date": "2016-03-26", "authors": ["Fabiana DFascilla", "PaolaCramarossa", "RossellaCannone", "ClaudianaOlivieri", "AntonellaVimercati", "CaterinaExacoustos"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Vascularized Thoracodorsal to Suprascapular Nerve Transfer, a Novel Technique to Restore Shoulder Function in Partial Brachial Plexopathy.", "abstract": "We describe the clinical outcome of a novel nerve transfer to restore active shoulder motion in upper brachial plexus injury. The thoracodorsal nerve (TDN) was successfully used as a vascularized donor nerve to neurotize to the suprascapular nerve (SSN) in a patient with limited donor nerve availability. At 4\u2009years follow-up, he had regained useful external rotation of the injured limb, with no significant donor site morbidity. Shoulder abduction return was less impressive, however, and reasons for this are discussed. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic and a subsequent discussion on the details of this novel technique. This is the first reported case of TDN to SSN transfer, and also the first reported case of a vascularized TDN transfer in the English language literature. We advocate direct thoracodorsal to SSN transfer as a valid surgical option for the restoration of shoulder function in patients with partial brachial plexus avulsion, when conventional nerve donors are unavailable.", "journal": "Frontiers in surgery", "date": "2016-03-26", "authors": ["Shirley MPotter", "Scott IFerris"], "doi": "10.3389/fsurg.2016.00017\n10.1016/0303-8467(93)90042-F\n10.1016/j.injury.2008.06.008\n10.1097/00006534-200011000-00020\n10.1016/S0020-1383(02)00036-0\n10.1016/0363-5023(93)90328-Z\n10.1016/j.hcl.2008.07.001\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2013.12.016\n10.1097/01.prs.0000203410.35395.fa\n10.1097/00006534-199507000-00019\n10.1016/j.bjps.2011.02.002\n10.3171/jns.1992.76.2.0191\n10.1002/micr.20838\n10.1177/1753193413475963\n10.1002/micr.1920100407\n10.3171/2015.4.SPINE15108\n10.1002/ca.20484\n10.1002/ca.20656\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2008.08.005\n10.1155/2014/314137\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2010.11.024\n10.1016/j.bjps.2003.12.027\n10.1054/bjps.2002.3859\n10.1097/00005373-199705000-00007\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2003.10.013\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2007.05.016\n10.1002/micr.22386\n10.1016/S0268-0033(98)00102-8\n10.4103/2152-7806.84392"}
{"title": "Optimizing Reconstruction with Periorbital Transplantation: Clinical Indications and Anatomic Considerations.", "abstract": "Complex periorbital subunit reconstruction is challenging because the goals of effective reconstruction vary from one individual to another. The purpose of this article is to explore the indications and anatomic feasibility of periorbital transplantation by reviewing our institutional repository of facial injury.\nInstitutional review board approval was obtained at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center for a retrospective chart review conducted on patients with periorbital defects. Patient history, facial defects, visual acuity, and periorbital function were critically reviewed to identify indications for periorbital or total face (incorporating the periorbital subunit) vascularized composite allotransplantation. Cadaveric allograft harvest was then designed and performed for specific patient defects to determine anatomic feasibility. Disease conditions not captured by our patient population warranting consideration were reviewed.\nA total of 7 facial or periorbital transplant candidates representing 6 different etiologies were selected as suitable indications for periorbital transplantation. Etiologies included trauma, burn, animal attack, and tumor, whereas proposed transplants included isolated periorbital and total face transplants. Allograft recovery was successfully completed in 4 periorbital subunits and 1 full face. Dual vascular supply was achieved in 5 of 6 periorbital subunits (superficial temporal and facial vessels).\nTransplantation of isolated periorbital structures or full face transplantation including periorbital structures is technically feasible. The goal of periorbital transplantation is to re-establish protective mechanisms of the eye, to prevent deterioration of visual acuity, and to optimize aesthetic outcomes. Criteria necessary for candidate selection and allograft design are identified by periorbital defect, periorbital function, ophthalmologic evaluation, and defect etiology.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

{"title": "Pulp Regeneration: Current Approaches and Future Challenges.", "abstract": "Regenerative endodontics aims to replace inflamed/necrotic pulp tissues with regenerated pulp-like tissues to revitalize teeth and improve life quality. Pulp revascularization case reports, which showed successful clinical and radiographic outcomes, indicated the possible clinical application of pulp regeneration via cell homing strategy. From a clinical point of view, functional pulp-like tissues should be regenerated with the characterization of vascularization, re-innervation, and dentin deposition with a regulated rate similar to that of normal pulp. Efficient root canal disinfection and proper size of the apical foramen are the two requisite preconditions for pulp regeneration. Progress has been made on pulp regeneration via cell homing strategies. This review focused on the requisite preconditions and cell homing strategies for pulp regeneration. In addition to the traditionally used mechanical preparation and irrigation, antibiotics, irrigation assisted with EndoVac apical negative-pressure system, and ultrasonic and laser irradiation are now being used in root canal disinfection. In addition, pulp-like tissues could be formed with the apical foramen less than 1 mm, although more studies are needed to determine the appropriate size. Moreover, signaling molecules including stromal cell derived factor (SDF-1\u03b1), basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), stem cell factor (SCF), and Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) were used to achieve pulp-like tissue formation via a cell homing strategy. Studies on the cell sources of pulp regeneration might give some indications on the signaling molecular selection. The active recruitment of endogenous cells into root canals to regenerate pulp-like tissues is a novel concept that may offer an unprecedented opportunity for the near-term clinical translation of current biology-based therapies for dental pulp regeneration.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2016-03-26", "authors": ["JingwenYang", "GuohuaYuan", "ZhiChen"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2016.00058\n10.1016/j.joen.2014.12.025\n10.2217/rme.10.30\n10.1111/j.1600-9657.1995.tb00464.x\n10.1016/j.joen.2013.07.017\n10.1177/0022034513505770\n10.1016/j.joen.2011.12.032\n10.1177/0022034510363765\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2009.12.046\n10.1016/j.joen.2009.03.050\n10.1089/ten.teb.2014.0675\n10.1177/0022034511405388\n10.1016/j.pdpdt.2014.07.004\n10.1177/0022034514537829\n10.1089/ten.tea.2009.0518\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.10.045\n10.4103/0972-0707.139850\n10.1111/iej.12414\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0181\n10.1177/0022034510370803\n10.1111/etp.12037\n10.1111/j.1600-9657.1986.tb00132.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0086011\n10.1016/j.joen.2013.02.004\n10.1016/j.joen.2015.01.027\n10.1111/j.1365-2591.2012.02053.x\n10.1016/j.joen.2015.04.006\n10.1177/08959374010150011201\n10.1177/0022034511405386\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00099\n10.3727/096368914X683502\n10.1002/term.1686\n10.1177/0022034511405323\n10.1111/iej.12354\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00326\n10.1007/s12015-013-9442-7\n10.1016/j.jdent.2014.06.012\n10.1007/s00784-015-1423-6\n10.1089/pho.2012.3445\n10.4252/wjsc.v7.i2.399\n10.1111/j.1601-6343.2005.00331.x\n10.4103/0972-0707.101926\n10.1016/j.joen.2007.11.021\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.08.003\n10.1177/0022034511408426\n10.1111/odi.12227\n10.4103/0975-7406.100214\n10.1016/j.joen.2009.09.039\n10.1016/j.joen.2012.11.014\n10.1097/01.don.0000148143.80283.ea\n10.2147/sccaa.s51009\n10.1177/0885328215577296\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.006\n10.4103/1305-7456.143636\n10.1002/jcp.22538"}

Moreover, enhanced therapeutic angiogenesis is a major goal in the field of regenerative medicine and efficient vascularization of artificial tissues and organs is one of the main hindrances in the implementation of tissue engineering approaches, while, on the other hand, inhibition of angiogenesis is a key therapeutic target to inhibit for instance tumor growth. During the last decades, the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this process has been matter of intense research. In this regard, several in vitro and in vivo models have been established to visualize and study migration of endothelial progenitor cells, formation of endothelial tubules and the generation of new vascular networks, while assessing the conditions and treatments that either promote or inhibit such processes. In this review, we address and compare the most commonly used experimental models to study angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.

Recently, subcutaneous models of patient tumors, termed patient-derived xenographs (PDX) have become highly popular and have acquired such names as \"Avatar\" and \"Xenopatients.\" However, such s.c. models rarely metastasize and are therefore not patient-like. In contrast, orthotopic models have the capability to metastasize. If intact fragments of tumor tissue are implanted by surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI), the metastatic potential can match that of the donor patient. The present study images in real time, using green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, the very different tumor behavior at the orthotopic and subcutaneous sites of human prostate cancer PC-3 in athymic nude mice. By day-2 after tumor implantation, the orthotopic tumor is already highly vascularized and the cancer cells have begun to migrate out of the tumor. In contrast, the subcutaneous tumor only begins to be vascularized by day-3 and cells do not migrate from the tumor. Angiogenesis is much more extensive in the orthotopic tumor throughout the 2-week observation period. The orthotopic PC-3-GFP tumor progresses very rapidly and distinct metastasis have appeared in lymph nodes by day-3 which rapidly appear in many areas of the abdominal cavity including portal lymph nodes by day-7. At day-14, no invasion or metastasis was observed with the s.c. tumor even when the animal was extensively explored. These results explain why orthotopic tumors mimimc clinical metastatic tumors in nude mice and why subcutaneous tumors do not. J. Cell.

{"title": "Key psychosocial challenges in vascularized composite allotransplantation.", "abstract": "Psychosocial factors are important elements in the assessment and follow-up care for vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) and require multidisciplinary evaluation protocols. This review will highlight differences between VCA with solid organ transplantation (SOT), provide information on the psychosocial selection of VCA candidates, ethical issues, psychological outcomes, and on the need for multicenter research. VCA is primarily a life-enhancing procedure to improve recipients' quality of life and psychological well-being and it represents a potential option to provide reproduction in case of penile or uterine transplantation. The risk benefit ratio is distinctly different than SOT with candidates desiring life enhancing outcomes including improved body image, return to occupations, restored touch, and for uterine transplant, pregnancy. The Chauvet Workgroup has been convened with membership from a number of transplant centers to address these issues and to call for multicenter research. A multicenter research network would share similar evaluation approaches so that meaningful research on psychosocial variables could inform the transplant community and patients about factors that increase risk of non-adherence and other adverse psychosocial and medical outcomes.", "journal": "World journal of transplantation", "date": "2016-03-25", "authors": ["MartinKumnig", "Sheila GJowsey-Gregoire"], "doi": "10.5500/wjt.v6.i1.91"}
{"title": "Survival of encapsulated islets: More than a membrane story.", "abstract": "At present, proven clinical treatments but no cures are available for diabetes, a global epidemic with a huge economic burden. Transplantation of islets of Langerhans by their infusion into vascularized organs is an experimental clinical protocol, the first approach to attain cure. However, it is associated with lifelong use of immunosuppressants. To overcome the need for immunosuppression, islets are encapsulated and separated from the host immune system by a permselective membrane. The lead material for this application is alginate which was tested in many animal models and a few clinical trials. This review discusses all aspects related to the function of transplanted encapsulated islets such as the basic requirements from a permselective membrane (e.g., allowable hydrodynamic radii, implications of the thickness of the membrane and relative electrical charge). Another aspect involves adequate oxygen supply, which is essential for survival/performance of transplanted islets, especially when using large retrievable macro-capsules implanted in poorly oxygenated sites like the subcutis. Notably, islets can survive under low oxygen tension and are physiologically active at > 40 Torr. Surprisingly, when densely crowded, islets are fully functional under hyperoxic pressure of up to 500 Torr (> 300% of atmospheric oxygen tension). The review also addresses an additional category of requirements for optimal performance of transplanted islets, named auxiliary technologies. These include control of inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and the intra-capsular environment. The review highlights that curing diabetes with a functional bio-artificial pancreas requires optimizing all of these aspects, and that significant advances have already been made in many of them.", "journal": "World journal of transplantation", "date": "2016-03-25", "authors": ["UrielBarkai", "AviRotem", "Paulde Vos"], "doi": "10.5500/wjt.v6.i1.69"}

Tissue injury induces robust new vessel formation and subsequent vessel maturation, which involves vessel regression and remodeling. Although formation of functional vasculature is essential for healing, alterations in vascular structure over the time course of skin wound healing are not well understood. Here, using high-resolution ex vivo X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT), we describe the vascular network during healing of skin excisional wounds with highly detailed three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed images and associated quantitative analysis. We found that relative vessel volume, surface area and branching number are significantly decreased in wounds from day 7 to days 14 and 21. Segmentation and skeletonization analysis of selected branches from high-resolution images as small as 2.5\u03bcm voxel size show that branching orders are decreased in the wound vessels during healing. In histological analysis, we found that the contrast agent fills mainly arterioles, but not small capillaries nor large veins. In summary, high-resolution microCT revealed dynamic alterations of vessel structures during wound healing.

{"title": "Peritoneal dialysis: from bench to bedside and bedside to bench.", "abstract": "For patients with end-stage kidney disease unable to receive a kidney transplant, replacement of kidney function with dialysis is necessary to extend life. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) are the two major forms of dialysis therapy. HD involves the passage of blood via an extracorporeal circuit whereby removal of small solutes, toxins, and water is achieved across a synthetic, semipermeable dialysis membrane. In contrast, in PD, the dialysis membrane is the highly vascularized internal lining of the peritoneal cavity. Intraperitoneal installation of hypertonic high glucose PD solution creates a transmembrane osmotic and diffusive gradient that facilitates water removal [ultrafiltration (UF)], convection, and diffusion of uremic toxins. Insight into the physiology of solute and water transport across the peritoneal membrane has been enhanced by the proposal of the ''three-pore model'' of peritoneal membrane transport. Transport characteristics and UF capacity of the peritoneal membrane vary among individuals, and deleterious changes in the membrane may ensue over time. The degree to which these changes are a direct consequence of the type and composition of currently available PD solutions, recurrent infectious episodes, genetic differences among individuals, or a combination thereof is the subject of intense study. Adverse consequences resulting from the systemic and local metabolic effects of intraperitoneal glucose exposure, infection of the PD fluid, PD catheter dysfunction, and patient burnout from self-care often limit the long-term success of the therapy. Research aimed at addressing these challenges will examine the use of more biocompatible PD solutions and strategies aimed at attenuating progressive peritoneal membrane injury.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

At B-mode ultrasound, 9 lesions involved the right adrenal gland, 14 the left, and 1 was bilateral. Each dog received a bolus of the contrast agent into the cephalic vein, immediately followed by a 5-mL saline flush. The first contrast enhancement of each adrenal lesion was evaluated qualitatively to assess the degree of enhancement and its distribution during the wash-in and wash-out phases, as well as the presence of non-vascularized areas and specific vascular patterns. Pathological diagnoses were determined in all dogs by histopathology or by cytology. Combining enhancement degree and vascularity resulted in the best predictive model, allowing CEUS to differentiate adrenocortical adenoma (n=10), adenocarcinoma (n=7), and pheochromocytoma (n=7) with an accuracy of 91.7% (P < 0.001). Combining enhancement degree and vascularity, CEUS can discriminate malignant versus benign adrenal lesions with a sensitivity of 100.0%, a specificity of 80.0%, and an accuracy of 91.7% (P < 0.001).

Chromosomal translocations in this cancer produce fusion oncogenes as characteristic molecular signatures of the disease. The most common case is the translocation t (11; 22) (q24;q12) which yields the EWS-Fli1 chimeric transcription factor. Finding a way to directly target EWS-Fli1 remains a central therapeutic approach to eradicate this aggressive cancer. Here we demonstrate that treating Ewing Sarcoma cells with JQ1(+), a BET bromodomain inhibitor, represses directly EWS-Fli1 transcription as well as its transcriptional program. Moreover, the Chromatin Immuno Precipitation experiments demonstrate for the first time that these results are a consequence of the depletion of BRD4, one of the BET bromodomains protein from the EWS-Fli1 promoter. In vitro, JQ1(+) treatment reduces the cell viability, impairs the cell clonogenic and the migratory abilities, and induces a G1-phase blockage as well as a time- and a dose-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, in our in vivo model, we observed a tumor burden delay, an inhibition of the global vascularization and an increase of the mice overall survival.

The aggressive behavior of glioblastomas, including resistance to current treatments and tumor recurrence, has been attributed to glioma stemlike/progenitor cells. The transcription factor EGR1 (early growth response 1), a member of a zinc finger transcription factor family, has been described as tumor suppressor in gliomas when ectopically overexpressed. Although EGR1 expression in human glioblastomas has been associated with patient survival, its precise location in tumor territories as well as its contribution to glioblastoma progression remain elusive. In the present study, we show that EGR1-expressing cells are more frequent in high grade gliomas where the nuclear expression of EGR1 is restricted to proliferating/progenitor cells. We show in primary cultures of glioma stemlike cells that EGR1 contributes to stemness marker expression and proliferation by orchestrating a PDGFA-dependent growth-stimulatory loop.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the CL coverage in RE and determine the detection rate of the CL arteries on CT angiography during work-up.\nIn all consecutive patients who underwent RE treatment between May 2012-January 2015, (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT/CT and posttreatment scans ((90)Y-bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT, (90)Y-PET/CT, or (166)Ho-SPECT/CT) were reviewed for activity in the CL. Pretreatment CT angiographies were reviewed for the visibility of the CL arteries.\nEighty-two patients were treated. In 32/82 (39\u00a0%) the CL was involved. In 6/32 (19\u00a0%) patients, no activity was seen on the posttreatment scan in the CL, whereas in 40/50 (80\u00a0%) patients without CL tumor involvement, the CL was treated. (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT/CT and final posttreatment scans were discordant in 16/78 (21\u00a0%). (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT/CT had a positive and negative predictive value of 94\u00a0% and 46\u00a0%, respectively, for activity in the CL after RE. In untreated CLs, significant hypertrophy was observed with a median volume increase of 33\u00a0% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). CL arteries were seldom visible on the pretreatment CT; the identification rate was 12-17\u00a0%.\nCurrently in RE treatments, targeting or sparing of the CL is highly erratic and independent of tumor involvement. Intentional treatment or bypassing of the CL seems worthwhile to either improve tumor coverage or enhance\u00a0the functional liver remnant.", "journal": "Cardiovascular and interventional radiology", "date": "2016-03-24", "authors": ["Manon N G J ABraat", "Andor Fvan den Hoven", "Pieter Jvan Doormaal", "Rutger CBruijnen", "Marnix G E HLam", "Maurice A A Jvan den Bosch"], "doi": "10.1007/s00270-016-1321-6"}
{"title": "Stimulatory effect of cobalt ions incorporated into calcium phosphate coatings on neovascularization in an in vivo intramuscular model in goats.", "abstract": "Rapid vascularization of bone graft substitutes upon implantation is one of the most important challenges to overcome in order to achieve successful regeneration of large, critical-size bone defects. One strategy for stimulating vascularization during the regeneration process is to create a hypoxic microenvironment by either directly lowering the local oxygen tension, or by applying hypoxia-mimicking factors. Cells compensate for the hypoxic condition by releasing angiogenic factors leading to new blood vessel formation. In the present study, we explored the potential of cobalt ions (Co(2+)), known chemical mimickers of hypoxia, to stimulate vascularization within a bone graft substitute in vivo. To this end, Co(2+) ions were incorporated into calcium phosphate (CaPs) coatings deposited on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) particles with their effect on the formation of new blood vessels studied upon intramuscular implantation in goats. PLA particles and CaP-coated particles without Co(2+) ions served as controls. Pathological scoring of the inflammatory response following a 12-week implantation period showed no significant differences between the four types of materials. Based on histological and immunohistochemical analyses, both blood vessel area and number of blood vessels in CaP-coated PLA particles containing Co(2+) were higher than in the uncoated PLA particles and CaP-coated PLA particles without Co(2+). Analysis of blood vessel size distribution indicated abundant formation of small blood vessels in all the samples, while large blood vessels were predominantly found in PLA particles coated with CaP containing Co(2+) ions. The results of this study support the use of CaPs containing Co(2+) ions to enhance vascularization in vivo.\nIn this work, we have investigated the potential of cobalt ions, incorporated into thin calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings that were deposited on particles of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), to induce neovascularization in vivo. Qualitative and quantitative histological and immunohistochemical analyses showed that both the number of blood vessels and the total blood vessel area were higher in CaP-coated PLA particles containing cobalt ions as compared to the uncoated PLA particles and CaP-coated PLA particles without the metallic additive. Furthermore, a wider distribution of blood vessel sizes, varying from very small to large vessels was specifically observed in samples containing cobalt ions. This in vivo study will significantly contribute to the existing knowledge on the use of bioinorganics, which are simple and inexpensive inorganic factors that can be used to control relevant biological process during tissue regeneration, such as vascularization.

To detect changes in optic nerve head (ONH) vascularization in glaucoma patients using spectral-domain OCT angiography (OCT-A). Material and Method. Fifty glaucoma patients and 30 normal subjects were evaluated with OCT-A (AngioVue\u00ae, Optovue). The total ONH vessel density and temporal disc vessel density were measured. Clinical data, visual field (VF) parameters, and spectral-domain OCT evaluation (RNFL: retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, GCC: ganglion cell complex thickness, and rim area) were recorded for glaucoma patients. Correlations among total and temporal ONH vessel density and structural and VF parameters were analyzed. Results. In the glaucoma group, total and temporal ONH vessel density were reduced by 24.7% (0.412 versus 0.547; p < 0.0001) and 22.88% (0.364 versus 0.472; p = 0.001), respectively, as compared with the control group. Univariate analysis showed significant correlation between rim area (mm(2)) and temporal ONH vessel density (r = 0.623; p < 0.0001) and total ONH vessel density (r = 0.609; p < 0.0001). Significant correlations were found between temporal and total ONH vessel density and RNFL, GCC, VF mean deviation, and visual field index. Conclusion. In glaucoma patients OCT-A might detect reduced ONH blood vessel density that is associated with structural and functional glaucomatous damage.

This technique was initially proposed in 1986 and consists of two stages. At the first stage, radical debridement is required and subsequently, a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement spacer is implanted at the site of the bone defects. At the second stage, when the PMMA-induced membrane is formed 6-8 weeks later, the cement spacer is carefully removed in order to not disturb the induced membrane and the bone graft is performed to fill the bone defects. Although this technique has resulted in satisfactory outcomes in the reconstruction of bone defects, the PMMA spacer used to induce membrane is not degradable and requires surgical removal. In recent years, calcium sulfate has been used as a localized antibiotic delivery vehicle and bone substitute due to its superiorities over PMMA, particularly its completely degradable nature. The present study identified that calcium sulfate can also induce the formation of a membrane. In addition, we hypothesized that the degradability of calcium sulfate may allow one-stage reconstruction of bone defects.

Oscar (Astronotus ocellatus) is among the most hypoxia-tolerant fish in Amazon, considering its intriguing anaerobic capacity and ability to depress oxidative metabolism. Previous studies in hypoxia-tolerant and non-tolerant fish have shown that hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) gene expression is positively regulated during low oxygen exposure, affecting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription and fish development or tolerance in different manners. However, whether similar isoforms exists in tolerant Amazon fish and whether they are affected similarly to others physiological responses to improve hypoxia tolerance remain unknown. Here we evaluate the hepatic HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF mRNA levels after 3\u00a0h of acute hypoxia exposure (0.5\u00a0mgO2/l) and 3\u00a0h of post-hypoxia recovery. Additionally, hematological parameters and oxidative enzyme activities of citrate synthase (CS) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were analyzed in muscle and liver tissues. Overall, three sets of responses were detected: (1) as expected, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, red blood cells, and blood glucose increased, improving oxygen carrying capacity and glycolysis potential; (2) oxidative enzymes from liver decreased, corroborating the tendency to a widespread metabolic suppression; and (3) HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF increased mRNA levels in liver, revealing their role in the oxygen homeostasis through, respectively, activation of target genes and vascularization. This is the first study to investigate a hypoxia-related transcription factor in a representative Amazon hypoxia-tolerant fish and suggests that HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF mRNA regulation have an important role in enhancing hypoxia tolerance in extreme tolerant species.", "journal": "Fish physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2016-03-21", "authors": ["R BBaptista", "NSouza-Castro", "V M FAlmeida-Val"], "doi": "10.1007/s10695-016-0219-1"}

However, recent evidence indicates that some AARSs possess additional biological functions (noncanonical functions) related to immune responses and vascular development. Here, we identified a zebrafish cq16 mutant presenting the disorganized vessels with abnormal branching of the established intersegmental vessels (ISVs) as well as aberrant patterning of the brain vascular network after 50 h post fertilization. The cq16 mutant gene is responsible for encoding threonyl-tRNA synthetase (tars) with a missense mutation. The abnormal branching of ISVs was caused by the increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (vegfa) in tars(cq16) mutant. Inhibition of Vegf signaling suppresses the abnormal vascular branching observed in tars(cq16) mutant. Furthermore, injection of human TARS mRNA potently reduced the vascular aberrant branching in tars(cq16) mutant, indicating a conserved function of tars in regulating angiogenesis between zebrafish and human. Therefore, we conclude that noncanonical function of tars regulates vascular development presumably by modulating the expression of vegfa.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2016-03-20", "authors": ["ZigangCao", "HongchengWang", "XiaoyuMao", "LingfeiLuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.051"}

Accelerated extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation is prerequisite for VM formation induced by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Previous reports demonstrate uPA has ability to degrade ECM thereby promoting tumor angiogenesis. Also, exogenous cRGD sequence enables to modulate uPA expression, attenuate EMT and suppress endothelial-lined channels. Till now, the correlation of uPA and VM formation and the effect of exogenous cRGD on VM formation remain unknown. Herein, we validate uPA expression is positively correlated with VM formation in ovarian cancer tissues (90 cases) and ovarian cancer cells (SKOV-3, OVCAR-3 and A2780 cells). In particular, silencing uPA experiments show that down-regulated uPA causes notable decrease for the complete channels formed by SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells. Mechanism study discloses uPA promotes VM formation by regulating AKT/mTOR/MMP-2/Laminin5\u03b32 signal pathway. The result demonstrates uPA may serve as therapeutic target of VM for ovarian cancer. Also, it is found exogenous cRGD enables to inhibit VM formation in ovarian cancer via not only down-regulating uPA expression but also reducing EMT.

Quality assessment was done with a Downs and Blacks score. From 1,150 articles, 29 were ultimately used for data abstraction. The odds ratios (ORs) for clear graft survival in cyclosporine and controls were 2.43 (95% CI: 1.00 - 5.88) and 3.64 (95% CI: 1.48 - 8.91) for rejection free episodes. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) significantly improved the rejection free graft survival rates at 1 year (OR: 4.05, 95% CI: 1.83 - 8.96). The overall results suggested that both systemic cyclosporine and MMF improved 1-year rejection free graft survival in high-risk keratoplasty. Cyclosporine also significantly improved clear graft survival rates at 1 year; however, there were insufficient data to analyze the same in the MMF group. Higher quality studies are needed to understand this issue better.", "journal": "Journal of clinical medicine research", "date": "2016-03-18", "authors": ["ShvetaBali", "RichardFilek", "FrancieSi", "WilliamHodge"], "doi": "10.14740/jocmr2326w\n10.1016/S0161-6420(03)00463-9\n10.1097/00003226-200308000-00013\n10.1016/S0161-6420(94)31376-5\n10.4103/0301-4738.91337\n10.1016/S0161-6420(00)00544-3\n10.1016/j.ajo.2005.07.024\n10.3109/09273948.2010.486100\n10.1007/s10792-007-9099-9\n10.1001/archopht.1992.01080220054021\n10.1136/bjo.86.9.945\n10.1007/s003470050146\n10.1097/00003226-199511000-00015\n10.1016/S0161-6420(87)33356-1\n10.1097/ICO.0b013e31821e65b3\n10.1016/S0021-5155(97)80001-9\n10.1016/S0161-6420(13)31253-6\n10.1038/eye.2008.402\n10.1136/bjo.2006.097428\n10.1136/jech.52.6.377\n10.3310/hta7410\n10.1186/1471-2458-12-955\n10.1007/BF00168265\n10.1016/0002-9394(89)90494-7\n10.1016/S0021-5155(01)00339-2\n10.1097/00007890-198803000-00030\n10.1136/bjo.85.12.1464\n10.1007/BF02343059\n10.1136/bjo.86.9.988\n10.3109/09273949609069123\n10.1007/s00417-003-0724-7\n10.1111/j.1432-2277.2005.00126.x\n10.1097/01.TP.0000158022.62059.F2\n10.1007/s004170100285\n10.1136/bjo.83.11.1268\n10.1097/01.tp.0000191291.71003.1b\n10.1016/j.ajo.2010.03.010\n10.1016/S0161-6420(01)00759-X"}
{"title": "Arterial Anatomy of the Posterior Tibial Nerve in the Tarsal Tunnel.", "abstract": "Both vascular and compression etiologies have been proposed as the source of neurologic symptoms in tarsal tunnel syndrome. Advancing the understanding of the arterial anatomy supplying the posterior tibial nerve (PTN) and its branches may provide insight into the cause of tarsal tunnel symptoms. The purpose of this study was to describe the arterial anatomy of the PTN and its branches.\nSixty adult cadaveric lower extremities (thirty previously frozen and thirty fresh specimens) were amputated distal to the knee. The vascular supply to the PTN and its branches was identified, measured, and described macroscopically (the thirty previously frozen specimens, prepared using a formerly described debridement technique) and microscopically (the thirty fresh specimens, processed using the Sp\u00e4lteholz technique).\nOn both macroscopic and microscopic evaluation, the PTN and the medial and lateral plantar nerves were observed to have multiple entering vessels within the tarsal tunnel. On microscopic evaluation, a vessel was observed to enter the nerve at the bifurcation of the PTN into the medial and lateral plantar nerves in twenty-two (73%) of the thirty specimens. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in vascular density between the PTN and each of its branches.\nThe abundant blood supply to the PTN and its branches identified in this study is consistent with observations of other peripheral nerves. This rich vascular network may render the PTN and its branches susceptible to nerve compression related to vascular congestion. The combination of vascular and structural compression may also elicit neurologic symptoms.\nAdvancing the understanding of the arterial anatomy supplying the PTN and its branches may provide insight into the cause and treatment of tarsal tunnel syndrome.", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

{"title": "Vessel-based registration of an optical shape sensing catheter for MR navigation.", "abstract": "Magnetic resonance navigation (MRN), achieved with an upgraded MRI scanner, aims to guide therapeutic nanoparticles from their release in the hepatic vascular network to embolize highly vascularized liver tumors. Visualizing the catheter in real-time within the arterial network is important for selective embolization within the MR gantry. To achieve this, a new MR-compatible catheter tracking technology based on optical shape sensing is used.\nThis paper proposes a vessel-based registration pipeline to co-align this novel catheter tracking technology to the patient's diagnostic MR angiography (MRA) with 3D roadmapping. The method first extracts the 3D hepatic arteries from a diagnostic MRA based on concurrent deformable models, creating a detailed representation of the patient's internal anatomy. Once the optical shape sensing fibers, inserted in a double-lumen catheter, is guided into the hepatic arteries, the 3D centerline of the catheter is inferred and updated in real-time using strain measurements derived from fiber Bragg gratings sensors. Using both centerlines, a diffeomorphic registration based on a spectral representation of the high-level geometrical primitives is applied.\nResults show promise in registration accuracy in five phantom models created from stereolithography of patient-specific vascular anatomies, with maximum target registration errors below 2\u00a0mm. Furthermore, registration accuracy with the shape sensing tracking technology remains insensitive to the magnetic field of the MR magnet.\nThis study demonstrates that an accurate registration procedure of a shape sensing catheter with diagnostic imaging is feasible.", "journal": "International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery", "date": "2016-03-18", "authors": ["KoushikMandal", "FrancoisParent", "SylvainMartel", "RamanKashyap", "SamuelKadoury"], "doi": "10.1007/s11548-016-1366-7"}

This study aimed to identify factors associated with the adequacy rate of thyroid US-FNA.\nConsecutive thyroid US-FNAs (2006-2013) were retrospectively included. Attending radiologists, radiology fellows and radiology residents performed US-FNA, usually involving 2-3 needle passes. In more recent years, rapid on-site adequacy assessment (ROSAA) was performed to ensure specimen adequacy. US characteristics, procedural variations and cytology results were extracted from US and pathology reports and statistically evaluated.\nDiagnostic cytology was obtained in 64.6% of 1,381 thyroid US-FNAs. Factors associated with nondiagnostic cytology were ROSAA (74.6% diagnostic cytology, OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42-0.71), \u22653 clinic visits for US-FNA of the same thyroid nodule (54.7%, OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.10) and increased intranodular vascularization (51.8%, OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.17-2.57). With ROSAA, an increasing number of needle passes demonstrated improving adequacy rates. The adequacy rate was not operator-dependent.\nThis study demonstrates that ROSAA improves the adequacy rate of thyroid US-FNA. Without ROSAA, we recommend performing at least 3 needle passes.

{"title": "Indocyanine Green Videoangiography Transoptic Visualization and Clipping Confirmation of an Optic Splitting Ophthalmic Artery Aneurysm.", "abstract": "Ophthalmic artery aneurysms with medial and superior projection in exceptionally rare cases can split the optic nerve. Treatment of these aneurysms is challenging, because the aneurysm dome is hidden from the optic nerve, rendering its visualization and clipping confirmation difficult. In addition, optic nerve function should be preserved during surgical maneuvers. Preoperative detection of this growing feature is usually missing.\nWe illustrate the first case of indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) application in an optic penetrating ophthalmic artery aneurysm treatment. A 57-year-old woman presented with temporal hemianopsia, slight right visual acuity deficit, and new onset of headache. The cerebral angiography detected a right ophthalmic artery aneurysm medially and superiorly projecting. The A1 tract of the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery was elevated and curved, being suspicious for an under optic aneurysm growth. Surgery was performed. Initially the aneurysm was not visible. ICG-VA permitted the transoptic aneurysm visualization. After optic canal opening, the aneurysm was clipped and transoptic ICG-VA confirmed the aneurysm occlusion. ICG-VA showed also the slight improvement of the optic nerve pial vascularization. Postoperatively, the visual acuity was 10/10 and the hemianopsia did not worsen.\nThe elevation and curve of the A1 tract in medially and superiorly projecting ophthalmic aneurysms may be an indirect sign of under optic growth, or optic splitting aneurysms. ICG-VA transoptic aneurysm detection and occlusion confirmation reduces the surgical maneuvers on the optic nerve, contributing to function preservation.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2016-03-17", "authors": ["OrielaRustemi", "GiacomoCester", "FrancescoCausin", "RenatoScienza", "AlessandroDella Puppa"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2016.03.010"}

A control group comprised placentae from 28 patients with physiological pregnancy and no extragenital diseases. The authors made a comparative histological study of placental tissue and a morphometric analysis of the terminal villi using the sections immunohistochemically stained for CD31.\nIt was determined that there was a preponderance of branching angiogenesis in the preeclamptic chorionic villi and an increase in the number of syncytial nodules and microcysts in the septae in late-onset preeclampsia. Morphometric analysis of immunohistochemical placental specimens established a reduction in the sizes and vascularization indicators of terminal villi that determine the development of placental

To achieve clinically relevant dimensions, vascularization of soft tissue constructs becomes inevitable but still poses a challenge. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) represent a promising cell source for the setup of vascularized fatty tissue constructs as they can be differentiated into adipocytes and endothelial cells in vitro and are thereby available in sufficiently high cell numbers. This review summarizes the currently known characteristics of ASCs and achievements in adipogenic and endothelial differentiation in vitro. Further, the interdependency of adipogenesis and angiogenesis based on the crosstalk of endothelial cells, stem cells and adipocytes is addressed at the molecular level.

The enhancement of mechanical strength (doubled pick load), higher water uptake and thermal properties in chitosan-gelatine-agarose hydrogels doped with halloysite was demonstrated. SEM and AFM imaging has shown the even distribution of nanotubes within the scaffolds. We used enhanced dark-field microscopy to visualise the distribution of halloysite nanotubes in the implantation area. In vitro cell adhesion and proliferation on the nanocomposites occur without changes in viability and cytoskeleton formation. In vivo biocompatibility and biodegradability evaluation in rats has confirmed that the scaffolds promote the formation of novel blood vessels around the implantation sites. The scaffolds show excellent resorption within six weeks after implantation in rats. Neo-vascularization observed in newly formed connective tissue placed near the scaffold allows for the complete restoration of blood flow. These phenomena indicate that the halloysite-doped scaffolds are biocompatible as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo.

{"title": "Temporal profile of magnetic resonance angiography and decreased ratio of regulatory T cells after immunological adjuvant administration to mice lacking RNF213, a susceptibility gene for moyamoya disease.", "abstract": "Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic, occlusive cerebrovascular disease with an unknown etiology and is characterized by an abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain. Recent studies identified the RNF213 gene (RNF213) as an important susceptibility gene for MMD; however, the mechanisms underlying the RNF213 abnormality related to MMD have not yet been elucidated. We previously reported that Rnf213-deficient mice and Rnf213 p. R4828K knock-in mice did not spontaneously develop MMD, indicating the importance of secondary insults in addition to genetic factors in the pathogenesis of MMD. The most influential secondary insult is considered to be an immunological reaction because RNF213 is predominantly expressed in immunological tissues. Therefore, we herein attempted to evaluate the role of an immunological stimulation as a supplementary insult to the target disruption of RNF213 in the pathophysiology of MMD. Rnf213-deficient mice were treated with strong immunological adjuvants including muramyl dipeptide (MDP)-Lys (L18), and then underwent time-sequential magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) up to 40 weeks of age. The results obtained did not reveal any characteristic finding of MMD, and no significant difference was observed in MRA findings or the anatomy of the circle of Willis between Rnf213-deficient mice and wild-type mice after the administration of MDP-Lys (L18). The ratio of regulatory T cells after the administration of MDP-Lys (L18) was significantly decreased in Rnf213-deficient mice (p<0.01), suggesting the potential role of the RNF213 abnormality in the differentiation of regulatory T cells. Although the mechanisms underlying the development of MMD currently remain unclear, the RNF213 abnormality may compromise immunological self-tolerance, thereby contributing to the development of MMD.", "journal": "Brain research", "date": "2016-03-15", "authors": ["AtsushiKanoke", "MikiFujimura", "KuniyasuNiizuma", "TakuFujimura", "AyaKakizaki", "AkiraIto", "HiroyukiSakata", "MikaSato-Maeda", "ShigeoKure", "TeijiTominaga"], "doi": "10.1016/j.brainres.2016.03.009"}

Two of the most common approaches for reconstruction of acquired mandibular defects in adolescents are vascularized and nonvascularized osseous flaps or grafts. A third, less commonly used treatment option often used in developing parts of the world that some Western centers are considering as part of their treatment algorithm is spontaneous bone regeneration. This study reports on the authors' experiences with spontaneous bone formation of the resected young mandible. It also attempts to quantify any relation between spontaneous bone regeneration and an aging osteocompetent periosteum.\nThis was a retrospective study based on consecutive data collated from records of the oral and maxillofacial surgery departments from 2 tertiary institutions. Eligible patients were no older than 18\u00a0years and had benign mandibular neoplasms. The surgical procedure was mandibulectomy with subperiosteal dissection and intermaxillary fixation. Regenerated bone evaluation was by clinical examination and periodic panoramic radiographs.\nSixteen consecutive cases with mandibular lesions were seen at the 2 institutions, 8 of which met the inclusion criteria. The average age was 10.75\u00a0years. The predominant pathology was unicystic ameloblastoma. All cases exhibited spontaneous bone regeneration, with 2 cases exhibiting \"incomplete\" bone regeneration.\nImmediate reconstruction can be delayed to allow for spontaneous bone regeneration of defects in young patients. In the absence of regeneration, secondary reconstruction can be considered.

Our aim is to review the role of abdominal wall transplantation in achieving tension-free closure of the abdomen.\nIn total, 38 full-thickness vascularized abdominal wall transplants, six partial-thickness vascularized and 17 partial-thickness nonvascularized rectus facia grafts have been reported worldwide. Different techniques have been described. The most popular choice seems to be the full-thickness vascularized abdominal wall allograft, where the anastomosis is performed either in a micro- or macrovascular fashion. Temporary 'remote' revascularisation of the allograft has been performed in some cases onto the recipient's forearm vessels when there is a long anticipated cold ischaemia time (>5\u200ah). Preliminary data suggest that the abdominal wall skin rejection might be an early predictor of intestinal rejection. Vascularized and nonvascularized rectus fascia may be effective when there is inadequate healthy muscle/fascia but sufficient skin cover.\nSeveral centres have already proved the technical and immunologic feasibility of partial or full-thickness abdominal wall transplantation.

Of the 25 intermetatarsal neuromas, 1 (4%) was not detected by ultrasonography (incidence of detection of\u00a096%). The mean neuroma width was 6.35 (range 3.7 to 13) mm in the coronal plane, and the mean elasticity and strain ratio values were 3.44 (range 1.1 to 5.1) and 9.47 (range 2.3 to 19.3), respectively. The elasticity and strain ratio values were significantly greater in the presence of an interdigital neuroma than in the adjacent healthy intermetatarsal spaces (Z\u00a0=\u00a0-3.964, p\u00a0=\u00a0.0001 and Z\u00a0=\u00a0-3.927, p\u00a0=\u00a0.0001, respectively). The diagnostic cutoff values were calculated as 2.52 for elasticity and 6.1 for the strain ratio. Four neuromas (16%) were not demarcated, and the elasticity and strain ratio values for these were lower than those for neuromas with demarcated contours but were greater than those for healthy intermetatarsal spaces (p\u00a0<\u00a0.006 and p\u00a0<\u00a0.005, respectively). Patients with clinically suspected intermetatarsal neuromas that do not show demarcation and with smaller lesions might benefit from the use of ultrasound elastography for diagnosis.", "journal": "The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons", "date": "2016-03-12", "authors": ["TugrulOrmeci", "OlcayG\u00fcler", "MelihMalkoc", "MertKeskinbora", "Fatma ZeynepG\u00fcng\u00f6ren", "MahirMahirogullar\u0131"], "doi": "10.1053/j.jfas.2016.01.025"}
{"title": "Specific Activation of A3, A2A and A1 Adenosine Receptors in CD73-Knockout Mice Affects B16F10 Melanoma Growth, Neovascularization, Angiogenesis and Macrophage Infiltration.", "abstract": "CD73 (ecto-5'-nucleotidase), a cell surface enzyme hydrolyzing AMP to adenosine, was lately demonstrated to play a direct role in tumor progression including regulation of tumor vascularization. It was also shown to stimulate tumor macrophage infiltration. Interstitial adenosine, accumulating in solid tumors due to CD73 enzymatic activity, is recognized as a main mediator regulating the production of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, but the engagement of specific adenosine receptors in tumor progression in vivo is still poorly researched. We have analyzed the role of high affinity adenosine receptors A1, A2A, and A3 in B16F10 melanoma progression using specific agonists (CCPA, CGS-21680 and IB-MECA, respectively). We limited endogenous extracellular adenosine background using CD73 knockout mice treated with CD73 chemical inhibitor, AOPCP (adenosine \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene 5'-diphosphate). Activation of any adenosine receptor significantly inhibited B16F10 melanoma growth but only at its early stage. At 14th day of growth, the decrease in tumor neovascularization and MAPK pathway activation induced by CD73 depletion was reversed by all agonists. Activation of A1AR primarily increased angiogenic activation measured by expression of VEGF-R2 on tumor blood vessels. However, mainly A3AR activation increased both the microvessel density and expression of pro-angiogenic factors. All agonists induced significant increase in macrophage tumor infiltration, with IB-MECA being most effective. This effect was accompanied by substantial changes in cytokines regulating macrophage polarization between pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic phenotype. Our results demonstrate an evidence that each of the analyzed receptors has a specific role in the stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and confirm significantly more multifaceted role of adenosine in its regulation than was already observed. They also reveal previously unexplored consequences to extracellular adenosine signaling depletion in recently proposed anti-CD73 cancer therapy.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-03-11", "authors": ["PatrycjaKosza\u0142ka", "MonikaGo\u0142u\u0144ska", "AleksandraUrban", "GrzegorzStasi\u0142oj\u0107", "MarcinStanis\u0142awowski", "MarceliMajewski", "Andrzej CSk\u0142adanowski", "JacekBigda"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0151420\n10.1002/ijc.28456\n10.1007/s11302-012-9309-4\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4246\n10.1016/j.biocel.2015.10.003\n10.1002/eji.201041292\n10.1007/s10585-013-9571-z\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2013.10.001\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.06.002\n10.3892/or.2013.2883\n10.1093/jb/mvs136\n10.1152/ajpcell.00154.2010\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00114\n10.12703/P6-13\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2010.09.020\n10.1007/978-3-540-89615-9_14\n10.1073/pnas.1201917110\n10.1007/s12272-009-2118-9\n10.1007/s12185-008-0037-z\n10.1186/1471-2407-14-898\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0280\n10.3892/ijmm.2011.719\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604998\n10.4048/jbc.2014.17.1.25\n10.1100/2011/213962\n10.1096/fj.11-190934\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.226852"}
{"title": "FIRST STEPS TOWARDS ORGAN BANKS: VITRIFICATION OF RENAL PRIMORDIAL.", "abstract": "Kidney transplantation from deceased or living human donors has been limited by donor availability as opposed to the increasing demand, by the risks of allograft loss rejection and immunosuppressive therapy toxicity and by limitations of organ preservation protocols, which is essential to organise staff and facilities, transport organs, and perform necessary laboratory tests. However, the cryopreservation of composite tissues poses technical challenges beyond those seen in the preservation of single tissue types or organs.\nThe purpose of our study was to establish a protocol for long-term storing of renal primordia, that generates new adult kidneys after transplant into a syngeneic non-immunosuppressed host.\nMetanephroi from 16-days-old embryos were microdissected and vitrified following the minimum essential volume method and using Cryotop as a device and VM3 as vitrification solution. After 3 months of storage in liquid nitrogen (-196 degree C), 20 metanephroi were warmed and transplanted using minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery into retroperitoneal fat of 5-month-old immune-competent New Zealand rabbits. In the same way, 22 fresh metanephroi were transplanted. Twenty-one days after transplantation, hosts were euthanized and developed kidneys were recovered and evaluated morphologically and histologically.\nSignificant growth and fully differentiated mature glomeruli and tubule were observed in all kidney graft explants recovered. In total, 5 metanephroi (25.0%) were successfully grown after vitrification. In the same way, 12 metanephroi (54.5%) were successfully grown in the fresh group.\nThese encouraging results reported that metanephroi not only survive vitrification, but they vascularized and developed morphologically normal glomeruli after their allotransplantation. These results suggest that it's possible to create a long-term biobank of kidney precursors as an unlimited source of organs for transplantation, and open new therapeutic possibilities for the patients with chronic renal failure.", "journal": "Cryo letters", "date": "2016-03-11", "authors": ["XGarcia-Dominguez", "C DVera-Donoso", "EJimenez-Trigos", "J SVicente", "FMarco-Jimenez"], "doi": null}

Perfusion decellularization is an attractive technique for extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold from intact mammalian organ or tissue which has been successfully used in tissue reconstruction. The perfusion-decellularization of skeletal muscle has been poorly assessed and characterized, but the bioactivity and functional capacity of the obtained perfusion skeletal muscle ECM (pM-ECM) to remodel in\u00a0vivo is unknown. In the present study, pM-ECM was prepared from porcine rectus abdominis (RA). Perfusion-decellularization of porcine RA effectively removed cellular and nuclear material while retaining the intricate three-dimensional microarchitecture and vasculature networks of the native RA, and many of the bioactive ECM components and mechanical properties. In\u00a0vivo, partial-thickness abdominal wall defects in rats repaired with pM-ECM showed improved neovascularization, myogenesis and functional recellularization compared to porcine-derived small intestinal submucosa (SIS).

{"title": "Efficient decellularization of whole porcine kidneys improves reseeded cell behavior.", "abstract": "Combining patient-specific cells with the appropriate scaffold to create functional kidneys is a promising technology to provide immunocompatible kidneys for the 100,000+ patients on the organ waiting list. For proper recellularization to occur, the scaffold must possess the critical microstructure and an intact vascular network. Detergent perfusion through the vasculature of a kidney is the preferred method of decellularization; however, harsh detergents could be damaging to the microstructure of the renal tissue and may undesirably solubilize the endogenous growth and signaling factors. In this study, automated decellularization of whole porcine kidneys was performed using an improved method that combined physical and chemical steps to efficiently remove cellular materials while producing minimal damage to the collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM). Freezing/thawing, incremental increases in flow rate under constant pressure, applying osmotic shock to the cellular membranes, and low concentrations of the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were factors used to decrease SDS exposure time during the decellularization process from 36 to 5 h, which preserved the microstructure while still removing 99% of the DNA. The well-preserved glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and collagen fibers enhanced cell-ECM interactions. Human renal cortical tubular epithelium (RCTE) cells grew more rapidly when cultured on the ECM obtained from the improved decellularization process and also demonstrated more in vivo-like gene expression patterns. The optimized, automated process that resulted from this work is now used routinely in our laboratory to rapidly decellularize porcine kidneys and could be adapted to other large organs (e.g. heart, liver, and lung).", "journal": "Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)", "date": "2016-03-11", "authors": ["NafisehPoornejad", "NimaMomtahan", "Amin S MSalehi", "Daniel RScott", "Cory AFronk", "Beverly LRoeder", "Paul RReynolds", "Bradley CBundy", "Alonzo DCook"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-6041/11/2/025003"}

However, limited data are available concerning the influence of previous radiotherapy/chemoradiation therapy (CRT) on free flap survival and surgical complications. Molecular studies show that the effects of radiotherapy/CRT may be essentially reduced to three components: inflammation, a prothrombotic state and fibrosis. From a clinical point of view, this is reflected in a moderate increase in free flaps failure and surgical complications. Nevertheless, free flaps continue to offer clear advantages even in such an unfavorable condition.\nRadiotherapy/CRT induce a less favorable tissue environment, potentially leading to a higher risk of complications. In this scenario, however, free tissue transfer still plays the role of favoring wound healing bringing well vascularized tissue to less vascularized microenvironments.", "journal": "Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery", "date": "2016-03-11", "authors": ["AlbertoPaderno", "CesarePiazza", "LorenzoBresciani", "RaimondoVella", "PieroNicolai"], "doi": "10.1097/MOO.0000000000000243"}
{"title": "Wnt5a Regulates the Assembly of Human Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction-Derived Microvasculatures.", "abstract": "Human adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (hSVF) cells are an easily accessible, heterogeneous cell system that can spontaneously self-assemble into functional microvasculatures in vivo. However, the mechanisms underlying vascular self-assembly and maturation are poorly understood, therefore we utilized an in vitro model to identify potential in vivo regulatory mechanisms. We utilized passage one (P1) hSVF because of the rapid UEA1+ endothelium (EC) loss at even P2 culture. We exposed hSVF cells to a battery of angiogenesis inhibitors and found that the pan-Wnt inhibitor IWP2 produced the most significant hSVF-EC networking decrease (~25%). To determine which Wnt isoform(s) and receptor(s) may be involved, hSVF was screened by PCR for isoforms associated with angiogenesis, with only WNT5A and its receptor, FZD4, being expressed for all time points observed. Immunocytochemistry confirmed Wnt5a protein expression by hSVF. To see if Wnt5a alone could restore IWP2-induced EC network inhibition, recombinant human Wnt5a (0-150 ng/ml) was added to IWP2-treated cultures. The addition of rhWnt5a significantly increased EC network area and significantly decreased the ratio of total EC network length to EC network area compared to untreated controls. To determine if Wnt5a mediates in vivo microvascular self-assembly, 3D hSVF constructs containing an IgG isotype control, anti-Wnt5a neutralizing antibody or rhWnt5a were implanted subcutaneously for 2w in immune compromised mice. Compared to IgG controls, anti-Wnt5a treatment significantly reduced vessel length density by ~41%, while rhWnt5a significantly increased vessel length density by ~62%. However, anti-Wnt5a or rhWnt5a did not significantly affect the density of segments and nodes, both of which measure vascular complexity. Taken together, this data demonstrates that endogenous Wnt5a produced by hSVF plays a regulatory role in microvascular self-assembly in vivo.

{"title": "Arterial Spin Labeling Imaging for the Parotid Glands of Patients with Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome.", "abstract": "Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS) is characterized by hypofunction of the salivary and lacrimal glands. The salivary function is largely dependent upon the blood supply in the glands. However, the diseased states of the gland perfusion are not well understood. The arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique allows noninvasive quantitative assessment of tissue perfusion without the need for contrast agent. Here, we prospectively compared the perfusion properties of the parotid glands between patients with SS and those with healthy glands using ASL MR imaging. We analyzed salivary blood flow (SBF) kinetics of 22 healthy parotid glands from 11 volunteers and 28 parotid glands from 14 SS patients using 3T pseudo-continuous ASL imaging. SBF was determined in resting state (base SBF) and at 3 sequential segments after gustatory stimulation. SBF kinetic profiles were characterized by base SBF level, increment ratio at the SBF peak, and the differences in segments where the peak appeared (SBF types). Base SBFs of the SS glands were significantly higher than those of healthy glands (59.2 \u00b1 22.8 vs. 46.3 \u00b1 9.0 mL/min/100 g, p = 0.01). SBF kinetic profiles of the SS glands also exhibited significantly later SBF peaks (p < 0.001) and higher SBF increment ratios (74 \u00b1 49% vs. 47 \u00b1 39%, p = 0.04) than the healthy glands.

{"title": "Stromal Cells in Dense Collagen Promote Cardiomyocyte and Microvascular Patterning in Engineered Human Heart Tissue.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering is a strategy to replace damaged contractile tissue and model cardiac diseases to discover therapies. Current cardiac and vascular engineering approaches independently create aligned contractile tissue or perfusable vasculature, but a combined vascularized cardiac tissue remains to be achieved. Here, we sought to incorporate a patterned microvasculature into engineered heart tissue, which balances the competing demands from cardiomyocytes to contract the matrix versus the vascular lumens that need structural support. Low-density collagen hydrogels (1.25\u2009mg/mL) permit human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) to form a dense contractile tissue but cannot support a patterned microvasculature. Conversely, high collagen concentrations (density \u22656\u2009mg/mL) support a patterned microvasculature, but the hESC-CMs lack cell-cell contact, limiting their electrical communication, structural maturation, and tissue-level contractile function. When cocultured with matrix remodeling stromal cells, however, hESC-CMs structurally mature and form anisotropic constructs in high-density collagen. Remodeling requires the stromal cells to be in proximity with hESC-CMs. In addition, cocultured cardiac constructs in dense collagen generate measurable active contractions (on the order of 0.1\u2009mN/mm(2)) and can be paced up to 2\u2009Hz. Patterned microvascular networks in these high-density cocultured cardiac constructs remain patent through 2 weeks of culture, and hESC-CMs show electrical synchronization. The ability to maintain microstructural control within engineered heart tissue enables generation of more complex features, such as cellular alignment and a vasculature. Successful incorporation of these features paves the way for the use of large scale engineered tissues for myocardial regeneration and cardiac disease modeling.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Vascular Dynamics Aid a Coupled Neurovascular Network Learn Sparse Independent Features: A Computational Model.", "abstract": "Cerebral vascular dynamics are generally thought to be controlled by neural activity in a unidirectional fashion. However, both computational modeling and experimental evidence point to the feedback effects of vascular dynamics on neural activity. Vascular feedback in the form of glucose and oxygen controls neuronal ATP, either directly or via the agency of astrocytes, which in turn modulates neural firing. Recently, a detailed model of the neuron-astrocyte-vessel system has shown how vasomotion can modulate neural firing. Similarly, arguing from known cerebrovascular physiology, an approach known as \"hemoneural hypothesis\" postulates functional modulation of neural activity by vascular feedback. To instantiate this perspective, we present a computational model in which a network of \"vascular units\" supplies energy to a neural network. The complex dynamics of the vascular network, modeled by a network of oscillators, turns neurons ON and OFF randomly. The informational consequence of such dynamics is explored in the context of an auto-encoder network. In the proposed model, each vascular unit supplies energy to a subset of hidden neurons of an autoencoder network, which constitutes its \"projective field.\" Neurons that receive adequate energy in a given trial have reduced threshold, and thus are prone to fire. Dynamics of the vascular network are governed by changes in the reconstruction error of the auto-encoder network, interpreted as the neuronal demand. Vascular feedback causes random inactivation of a subset of hidden neurons in every trial. We observe that, under conditions of desynchronized vascular dynamics, the output reconstruction error is low and the feature vectors learnt are sparse and independent. Our earlier modeling study highlighted the link between desynchronized vascular dynamics and efficient energy delivery in skeletal muscle. We now show that desynchronized vascular dynamics leads to efficient training in an auto-encoder neural network.", "journal": "Frontiers in neural circuits", "date": "2016-03-10", "authors": ["Ryan TPhilips", "KarishmaChhabria", "V SrinivasaChakravarthy"], "doi": "10.3389/fncir.2016.00007\n10.1146/annurev.ne.08.030185.002203\n10.1016/j.artint.2014.02.004\n10.1016/j.artint.2014.02.004\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.12.061\n10.1371/journal.pone.0048802\n10.3389/fneur.2016.00024\n10.1097/00004647-199708000-00008\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.07.005\n10.1142/S0129065706000548\n10.3233/jad-142976\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2770-10.2010\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5656-08.2010\n10.1007/BF02331346\n10.1016/S0008-6363(95)00147-6\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.04.037\n10.1385/NI:2:2:251\n10.1038/1074\n10.1177/1358836X9000100202\n10.1038/jcbfm.2014.144\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.075\n10.1038/1099\n10.1016/0165-0173(90)90009-D\n10.1038/jcbfm.2013.181\n10.1038/nrn3061\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4048-05.2006\n10.1126/science.1962197\n10.1152/jn.01366.2006\n10.1124/mi.3.2.79\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3285-12.2013\n10.1016/j.tins.2006.08.004\n10.1109/72.572117\n10.1016/S0925-2312(97)00045-3\n10.1038/381607a0\n10.1186/2045-8118-8-7\n10.1016/S0008-6363(95)00123-9\n10.1111/j.1748-1716.2010.02198.x\n10.1016/j.mbs.2007.02.010\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.02.026\n10.1016/j.mvr.2007.02.004\n10.1016/j.neuron.2011.07.013\n10.1038/4580\n10.1113/jphysiol.1890.sp000321\n10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.473\n10.1038/nature07664\n10.1016/j.visres.2008.03.009\n10.1038/nn.3413\n10.1016/S0033-0620(96)80003-X\n10.1227/01.NEU.0000216118.31290.65\n10.1109/TIP.2003.819861\n10.1038/nrn3028\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003330\n10.1038/nn980"}

It is overexpressed in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), which is aggressive and usually triple-negative, making it unresponsive to current targeted therapies. Here, we evaluated the anti-angiogenic effects of a specific cPLA2\u03b1 inhibitor, AVX235, in a patient-derived triple-negative BLBC model.\nMice bearing orthotopic xenografts received i.p. injections of AVX235 or DMSO vehicle daily for 1 week and then every other day for up to 19 days. Six treated and six control mice were terminated after 2 days of treatment, and the tumors excised for high resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HR MAS MRS) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) analysis. A 1-week imaging study was performed on a separate cohort of mice. Longitudinal dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI was performed before, after 4 days, and after 1 week of treatment. The mice were then perfused with a radiopaque vascular casting agent, and the tumors excised for micro-CT angiography. Subsequently, tumors were sectioned and stained with lectin and for Ki67 or \u03b1-smooth muscle actin to quantify endothelial cell proliferation and vessel maturity, respectively. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was performed on the multivariate HR MAS MRS data, and non-parametric univariate analyses using Mann-Whitney U tests (\u03b1 = 0.05) were performed on all other data.\nGlycerophosphocholine and PGE2 levels, measured by HR MAS MRS and EIA, respectively, were lower in treated tumors after 2 days of treatment. These molecular changes are expected downstream effects of cPLA2\u03b1 inhibition and were followed by significant tumor growth inhibition after 8 days of treatment. DCE-MRI revealed that AVX235 treatment caused a decrease in tumor perfusion.

{"title": "Targeting prion-like protein doppel selectively suppresses tumor angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Controlled and site-specific regulation of growth factor signaling remains a major challenge for current antiangiogenic therapies, as these antiangiogenic agents target normal vasculature as well tumor vasculature. In this article, we identified the prion-like protein doppel as a potential therapeutic target for tumor angiogenesis. We investigated the interactions between doppel and VEGFR2 and evaluated whether blocking the doppel/VEGFR2 axis suppresses the process of angiogenesis. We discovered that tumor endothelial cells (TECs), but not normal ECs, express doppel; tumors from patients and mouse xenografts expressed doppel in their vasculatures. Induced doppel overexpression in ECs enhanced vascularization, whereas doppel constitutively colocalized and complexed with VEGFR2 in TECs. Doppel inhibition depleted VEGFR2 from the cell membrane, subsequently inducing the internalization and degradation of VEGFR2 and thereby attenuating VEGFR2 signaling. We also synthesized an orally active glycosaminoglycan (LHbisD4) that specifically binds with doppel. We determined that LHbisD4 concentrates over the tumor site and that genetic loss of doppel in TECs decreases LHbisD4 binding and targeting both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, LHbisD4 eliminated VEGFR2 from the cell membrane, prevented VEGF binding in TECs, and suppressed tumor growth.

{"title": "Noninvasive in vivo imaging of embryonic \u03b2-cell development in the anterior chamber of the eye.", "abstract": "The fetal environment plays a decisive role in modifying the risk for developing diabetes later in life. Developing novel methodology for noninvasive imaging of \u03b2-cell development in vivo under the controlled physiological conditions of the host can serve to understand how this environment affects \u03b2-cell growth and differentiation. A number of culture models have been designed for pancreatic rudiment but none match the complexity of the in utero or even normal physiological environment. Speier et al. recently developed a platform of noninvasive in vivo imaging of pancreatic islets using the anterior chamber of the eye where islets get vascularized, grow and respond to physiological changes. The same methodology was adapted for the study of pancreatic development. E13.0, still undifferentiated rudiments with fluorescent lineage tracing were implanted in the AC of the eye, allowing the longitudinal study of their growth and differentiation. Within 48 h the anlages get vascularized and grow but their mesenchyme displays a selective growth advantage. The resulting imbalance leads to alteration in the differentiation pattern of the progenitors. Reducing the mesenchyme to its bare minimum before implantation allows the restoration of a proper balance and a development that mimics the normal pancreatic development. These groundbreaking observations demonstrate that the anterior chamber of the eye provides a good system for noninvasive in vivo fluorescence imaging of the developing pancreas under the physiology of the host and can have important implications for designing strategies to prevent or reverse the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia on altering \u03b2-cell function later in life.", "journal": "Islets", "date": "2016-03-08", "authors": ["CorentinCras-M\u00e9neur", "LyndaElghazi", "PatriceFort", "ErnestoBernal-Mizrachi"], "doi": "10.1080/19382014.2016.1148236\n10.1007/s00018-013-1297-1\n10.1038/natu-re02520\n10.2337/db08-0504\n10.1038/ng.2383\n10.2337/diab.40.2.S89\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199709)183:1%3c109::AID-PATH1091%3e3.0.CO;2-B\n10.2337/diab.40.2.S115\n10.1079/PNS19950003\n10.1159/000014000\n10.1017/S0029665199000804\n10.1159/000243170\n10.1203/00006450-199511000-00020\n10.1111/j.1471-0528.1977.tb12486.x\n10.1007/s00125-007-0811-0\n10.1007/s001250050812\n10.1007/s00125005-1219\n10.1038/nature05537\n10.1172/JCI74237\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0177(199902)214:2%3c116::AID-AJA2%3e3.0.CO;2-M\n10.1210/en.2002-220382\n10.2337/diabetes.52.8.2035\n10.1038/nprot.2008.118\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(199808)251:4%3c448::AID-AR4%3e3.0.CO;2-O\n10.1076/ejom.39.5.0257\n10.1038/nm1701\n10.1038/nn.2467\n10.1101/gad.1800209\n10.1002/jemt.20092\n10.1038/nmeth.2089\n10.1038/385257a0\n10.1101/gad.13.12.1601\n10.1007/s00125005-1498\n10.1371/journal.po-ne.0021753\n10.2337/diabetes.55.03.06.db05-0839\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1001143\n10.1242/dev.01364\n10.1101/gad.381906\n10.2337/diabetes.50.7.1571\n10.1016/j.devcel.2007.06.001\n10.1117/1.JBO.19.9.096008\n10.1073/pnas.062321799\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.03.003\n10.1074/jbc.M610986200\n10.1073/pnas.1105002108"}

Due to predominantly ethical constraints, human research material is scarce. A bovine in vitro model is a valuable alternative. Therefore, the following objectives were defined: 1) to xeno-graft bovine ovarian cortex tissue in immune deficient mice as a study-model for female fertility preservation strategies; 2) to stereologically quantify vascularization in Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-treated and non-treated tissue; 3) to study preantral follicular survival in situ, after xenotransplantation. Bovine ovarian tissue strips were incubated with or without VEGF prior to grafting into female, neutered BALB/c-nu mice (n=16). Non-transplanted cortical tissue was used as a control. At time zero (control), two (2 weeks) and four (4 weeks) weeks after transplantation, grafts were retrieved and assessed by von Willebrand Factor and caspase-3 immunostaining. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model. In the VEGF+ grafts, 31% of the follicles were considered 'alive' 2 weeks after transplantation, compared to only 17% in the VEGF- grafts (P<0.05). However, no difference could be detected 4 weeks after transplantation (P=0.76) with less follicles being considered 'alive' after transplantation (22%), compared to the control (47.5%) (P<0.05). Finally, the vascular surface density was significantly less in the grafts, irrespective of the transplantation period or the use of VEGF. Although the transplantation process overall negatively influenced the number of viable follicles and vascular density, VEGF exposure prior to transplantation can favor follicle survival during a 2 weeks transplantation period.", "journal": "Animal reproduction science", "date": "2016-03-08", "authors": ["ALangbeen", "C VanGinneken", "EFransen", "EBosmans", "J L M RLeroy", "P E JBols"], "doi": "10.1016/j.anireprosci.2016.02.029"}
{"title": "The Initiator Methionine tRNA Drives Secretion of Type II Collagen from Stromal Fibroblasts to Promote Tumor Growth and Angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Expression of the initiator methionine tRNA (tRNAi(Met)) is deregulated in cancer. Despite this fact, it is not currently known how tRNAi(Met) expression levels influence tumor progression. We have found that tRNAi(Met) expression is increased in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, implicating deregulated expression of tRNAi(Met) in the tumor stroma as a possible contributor to tumor progression. To investigate how elevated stromal tRNAi(Met) contributes to tumor progression, we generated a mouse expressing additional copies of the tRNAi(Met) gene (2+tRNAi(Met) mouse). Growth and vascularization of subcutaneous tumor allografts was enhanced in 2+tRNAi(Met) mice compared with wild-type littermate controls. Extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by fibroblasts from 2+tRNAi(Met) mice supported enhanced endothelial cell and fibroblast migration. SILAC mass spectrometry indicated that elevated expression of tRNAi(Met) significantly increased synthesis and secretion of certain types of collagen, in particular type II collagen. Suppression of type II collagen opposed the ability of tRNAi(Met)-overexpressing fibroblasts to deposit pro-migratory ECM. We used the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) to determine whether collagen synthesis contributes to the tRNAi(Met)-driven pro-tumorigenic stroma in vivo. DHB had no effect on the growth of syngeneic allografts in wild-type mice but opposed the ability of 2+tRNAi(Met) mice to support increased angiogenesis and tumor growth. Finally, collagen II expression predicts poor prognosis in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Taken together, these data indicate that increased tRNAi(Met) levels contribute to tumor progression by enhancing the ability of stromal fibroblasts to synthesize and secrete a type II collagen-rich ECM that supports endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis.", "journal": "Current biology : CB", "date": "2016-03-08", "authors": ["Cassie JClarke", "Tracy JBerg", "JoannaBirch", "DarrenEnnis", "LouiseMitchell", "CatherineCloix", "AndrewCampbell", "DavidSumpton", "ColinNixon", "KirsteenCampbell", "Victoria LBridgeman", "Peter BVermeulen", "ShaneFoo", "EleftheriosKostaras", "J LouiseJones", "LindaHaywood", "ElliePulleine", "HuabingYin", "DouglasStrathdee", "OwenSansom", "KarenBlyth", "IainMcNeish", "SaraZanivan", "Andrew RReynolds", "Jim CNorman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cub.2016.01.045"}

However, their in vivo corrosion behaviour has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to clarify the influence of the physiological environment surrounding Mg alloys on their corrosion behaviour. A Mg-1.0Al alloy with a fine-grained structure was formed into plates using titanium (Ti) as a control. These plates were implanted into the subperiosteum in the head, subcutaneous tissue of the back, and in the muscle of the femur of rats for 1, 2 and 4 weeks. The volumes of the remaining Mg alloy and of the insoluble salt deposition and gas cavities around the Mg alloy were determined by microtomography, and the volume losses were calculated. Then, the tissue response around the plates in each implantation site was examined histopathologically, and its relation to the respective volume loss was analyzed. These analyses determined that the Mg alloy was corroded fastest in the head, at an intermediate level in the back, and slowest in the femur. The insoluble salt deposition at the Mg alloy surface had no influence on the volume loss. Gas cavities formed around the Mg alloy at all implantation sites and decreased after 4 weeks. Histopathological examination revealed that the Mg alloy exhibited good biocompatibility, as was seen with Ti. In addition, vascularized fibrous capsules formed around the plates and became mature with time. Notably, the volume loss in the different anatomical locations correlated with capsule thickness.

This study aimed to delineate the lymph node contents and pedicle characteristics of the supraclavicular (SC) and thoracodorsal (TD)-based axillary flaps as well as to compare lymph node quantification of surgeon vs pathologist.\nSC and TD flaps were dissected from fresh female cadavers. The surgeon assessed pedicle characteristics, lymph node content, and anatomy. A pathologist assessed all flaps for gross and microscopic lymph node contents. The \u03ba statistic was used to compare surgeon and pathologist.\nTen SC flaps and 10 TD flaps were harvested and quantified. In comparing the SC and TD flaps, there were no statistical differences between artery diameter (3.1 vs 3.2\u00a0mm; P\u00a0= .75) and vein diameter (2.8 vs 3.5\u00a0mm; P\u00a0= .24). The TD flap did have a significantly longer pedicle than the SC flap (4.2 vs 3.2\u00a0cm; P\u00a0= .03). The TD flap was found to be significantly heavier than the SC flap (17.0\u00a0\u00b1 4.8 vs 12.9\u00a0\u00b1 3.3\u00a0g; P\u00a0= .04). Gross lymph node quantity was similar in the SC and TD flaps (2.5\u00a0\u00b1 1.7 vs 1.8\u00a0\u00b1 1.2; P\u00a0= .33). There was good agreement between the surgeon and pathologist in detecting gross lymph nodes in the flaps (SC \u03ba\u00a0= 0.87, TD \u03ba\u00a0= 0.61).\nThe SC and TD flaps have similar lymph node quantity, but the SC flap has higher lymphatic density. A surgeon's estimation of lymph node quantity is reliable and has been verified in this study by comparison to a pathologist's examination.", "journal": "Journal of vascular surgery.

{"title": "Graphene Oxide-Copper Nanocomposite-Coated Porous CaP Scaffold for Vascularized Bone Regeneration via Activation of Hif-1\u03b1.", "abstract": "Graphene has been studied for its in vitro osteoinductive capacity. However, the in vivo bone repair effects of graphene-based scaffolds remain unknown. The aqueous soluble graphene oxide-copper nanocomposites (GO-Cu) are fabricated, which are used to coat porous calcium phosphate (CaP) scaffolds for vascularized bone regeneration. The GO-Cu nanocomposites, containing crystallized CuO/Cu2 O nanoparticles of \u224830 nm diameters, distribute uniformly on the surfaces of the porous scaffolds and maintain a long-term release of Cu ions. In vitro, the GO-Cu coating enhances the adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). It is also found that by activating the Erk1/2 signaling pathway, the GO-Cu nanocomposites upregulate the expression of Hif-1\u03b1 in BMSCs, resulting in the secretion of VEGF and BMP-2 proteins. When transplanted into rat with critical-sized calvarial defects, the GO-Cu-coated calcium phosphate cement (CPC) scaffolds (CPC/GO-Cu) significantly promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Moreover, it is observed via histological sections that the GO-Cu nanocomposites are phagocytosed by multinucleated giant cells. The results suggest that GO-Cu nanocomposite coatings can be utilized as an attractive strategy for vascularized bone regeneration.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2016-03-08", "authors": ["WenjieZhang", "QingChang", "LingXu", "GuanglongLi", "GuangzhengYang", "XunDing", "XiansongWang", "DaxiangCui", "XinquanJiang"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201500824"}
{"title": "Role of myeloid early endothelial progenitor cells in bone formation and osteoclast differentiation in tissue construct based on hydroxyapatite poly(ester-urethane) scaffolds.", "abstract": "Engineering of a vascularized bone construct is a highly challenging task which needs to take into account the impact of different components on the bone regeneration process. Bone repair influencing factors in such constructs range from the material properties and scaffold design, to the interaction of different cell types contributing to bone formation and remodeling or neovascularization, respectively. In this context, early endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), mononuclear cells isolated from the peripheral blood, express the endothelial marker CD31 but also a series of myeloid markers and have been shown to support the formation of vessel-like structures. These cells are also characterized by a highly adaptable phenotype influenced by other cells creating an instructive niche. The present study was designed to investigate the impact of EPC on bone formation or remodeling using a co-culture system of outgrowth endothelial cells, mature endothelial cells isolated from the peripheral blood cell cultures, and mesenchymal stem cells grown on hydroxyapatite poly(ester-urethane) scaffolds. The formation of vessel-like structures in these constructs was shown by CLSM and immunohistochemistry and further evaluated by real time RT-PCR. Osteogenic differentiation in these constructs was investigated by von Kossa, Alizarin Red, and real time PCR. Data indicated that osteogenic differentiation occurred within the constructs after 14 days of culture but without a direct influence by EPC in this process. Finally, although we observed a series of osteoclast related makers in the constructs when EPC were included, no indications for an increased osteoclast-like activity, which might lead to increased bone resorption, were observed. \u00a9 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

{"title": "Early Impact on Renal Parenchymal Vascularization of Chimney Grafts Versus Fenestrated Grafts.", "abstract": "The primary objective of this retrospective study was to analyze the early impact of chimney (CG) versus fenestrated grafts (FG) on renal parenchymal vascularization and function.\nAll consecutive patients with juxta-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm (JR-AAA) treated by endovascular repair from December 2013 to July 2014 at the vascular unit, Pellegrin University Hospital, Bordeaux, France, were included. Serum creatinine (SCr) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were reported at baseline and at J2 for acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence, and at J7 for AKI staging (KDIGO criteria); renal resistive indices (RRI) were reported for renal parenchymal repercussion at J-1, J0, and J1.\nTen patients were included in the CG group and 25 in the FG group, with 13 and 50 renal target vessels, respectively. Successful target vessel revascularization was achieved in 92.3% and 100.0% of patients. The incidence of AKI (10% and 32%), baseline SCr, and eGFR did not differ significantly. SCr was more elevated in the FG group at J1 (p\u00a0=\u00a0.025), J2 (p\u00a0=\u00a0.051), and J7 (p\u00a0=\u00a0.052), and eGFR was significantly lower from baseline to J1 (p\u00a0=\u00a0.015) and J2 (p\u00a0=\u00a0.014). RRI did not differ significantly between both groups. RRI augmentation was only noted in the FG group from J-1 to J0 (p\u00a0=\u00a0.039) and J-1 to J1 (p\u00a0=\u00a0.059). Patients with a KDIGO score <2 versus \u22652 showed significantly different RRI at J0 (p\u00a0=\u00a0.038) and J1 (p\u00a0=\u00a0.007). ROC curve analysis showed that RRI measures could be a predictive factor for AKI at J0 (cutoff\u00a0=\u00a00.72, sensitivity [Se]\u00a0=\u00a050%, specificity [Sp]\u00a0=\u00a086%) and J1 (cutoff\u00a0=\u00a00.71, Se\u00a0=\u00a070%, Sp\u00a0=\u00a084%).\nThis study showed no significant difference in terms of RRI, eGFR, and the incidence of AKI or CKD between CG and FG. However, post-operative SCr levels were higher with FG, which was corroborated by comparison between pre- and post-operative RRI. Results are limited by the small sample size, but early repeated measures of RRI could be helpful in alerting the clinician to post-operative renal degradation, allowing better-informed attempts to preserve renal function.", "journal": "European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery", "date": "2016-03-06", "authors": ["EDucasse", "CCaradu", "AElicagaray", "XB\u00e9rard", "DMidy", "LStecken"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejvs.2016.01.001"}

The frequent desmoplastic stroma and poor vascularization impeding drug delivery particularly in the diffuse form of gastric cancer is thought to provide a sound rationale for a regionalized treatment approach in this disease.

{"title": "Changing Paradigms in Cranio-Facial Regeneration: Current and New Strategies for the Activation of Endogenous Stem Cells.", "abstract": "Craniofacial area represent a unique district of human body characterized by a very high complexity of tissues, innervation and vascularization, and being deputed to many fundamental function such as eating, speech, expression of emotions, delivery of sensations such as taste, sight, and earing. For this reasons, tissue loss in this area following trauma or for example oncologic resection, have a tremendous impact on patients' quality of life. In the last 20 years regenerative medicine has emerged as one of the most promising approach to solve problem related to trauma, tissue loss, organ failure etc. One of the most powerful tools to be used for tissue regeneration is represented by stem cells, which have been successfully implanted in different tissue/organs with exciting results. Nevertheless, both autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation raise many practical and ethical concerns that make this approach very difficult to apply in clinical practice. For this reason different cell free approaches have been developed aiming to the mobilization, recruitment, and activation of endogenous stem cells into the injury site avoiding exogenous cells implant but instead stimulating patients' own stem cells to repair the lesion. To this aim many strategies have been used including functionalized bioscaffold, controlled release of stem cell chemoattractants, growth factors, BMPs, Platelet-Rich-Plasma, and other new strategies such as ultrasound wave and laser are just being proposed.

Human hearing relies on 15,000 hair cells that transduce mechanical vibrations to electrical signals in the auditory nerve. The process is powered by the endo-cochlear potential, which is produced by a vascularized epithelium that actively transports ions in conjunction with a gap junction (GJ) system. This \"battery\" is located \"off-site\" in the lateral wall of the cochlea. The GJ syncytium contains the GJ protein genes beta 2 (GJB2/connexin26 (Cx26)) and 6 (GJB6/connexin30 (Cx30)), which are commonly involved in hereditary deafness. Because the molecular arrangement of these proteins is obscure, we analyze GJ protein expression (Cx26/30) in human cochleae by using super-resolution structured illumination microscopy. At this resolution, the Cx26 and Cx30 proteins were visible as separate plaques, rather than being co-localized in heterotypic channels, as previously suggested. The Cx26 and Cx30 proteins thus seem not to be co-expressed but to form closely associated assemblies of GJ plaques. These results could assist in the development of strategies to treat genetic hearing loss in the future.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["WeiLiu", "FredrikEdin", "HansBlom", "PeetraMagnusson", "AnneliesSchrott-Fischer", "RudolfGlueckert", "Peter ASanti", "HaoLi", "G\u00f6ranLaurell", "HelgeRask-Andersen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-016-2359-0"}
{"title": "Reprogramming ageing and longevity genes restores paracrine angiogenic properties of early outgrowth cells.", "abstract": "Impaired tissue vascularization is a major determinant of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the elderly. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may interfere with vascular repair, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Early outgrowth cells (EOCs) play an important role in endothelial repair. We investigated whether key lifespan genes involved in ROS, i.e. the mitochondrial adaptor p66(Shc) and the AP-1 transcription factor JunD, contribute to age-related EOCs dysfunction in humans.\nEarly outgrowth cells were isolated and cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of young and old healthy volunteers. Early outgrowth cells isolated from aged individuals displayed p66(Shc) gene up-regulation and reduced JunD expression. Deregulation of p66(Shc) and JunD in aged EOCs led to up-regulation of NADPH oxidase, reduced expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and increased O2 (-) generation. This was associated with an impairment of EOCs-induced migration of mature endothelial cells. Secretome profiling revealed that angiogenic chemokines such as stromal-derived factor-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were deregulated in conditioned medium collected from aged EOCs. Interestingly, p66(Shc) silencing or JunD overexpression blunted age-related O2 (-) production via the NADPH/MnSOD axis, and restored paracrine angiogenic potential of aged EOCs.\nReprogramming ageing and longevity genes preserves EOCs functionality by affecting their paracrine properties.

We investigated the biochemical and physical diversity of ECM in pair-wised comparisons of healthy, perilesional and CRC specimens. Progressive linearization and degree of organization of fibrils was observed from healthy to perilesional and CRC ECM, and was associated with a steady increase of stiffness and collagen crosslinking. In the perilesional ECM these modifications coincided with increased vascularization, whereas in the neoplastic ECM they were associated with altered modulation of matrisome proteins, increased content of hydroxylated lysine and lysyl oxidase. This study identifies the increased stiffness and crosslinking of the perilesional ECM predisposing an environment suitable for CRC invasion as a phenomenon associated with vascularization.

Repression of E-cadherin also stimulated cell proliferation and migration in vitro, decreased cell amount essential for xenografts formation in nude mice, increased tumors vascularization and growth.

{"title": "Tumour angiogenesis-Origin of blood vessels.", "abstract": "The conventional view of tumour vascularization is that tumours acquire their blood supply from neighbouring normal stroma. Additional methods of tumour vascularization such as intussusceptive angiogenesis, vasculogenic mimicry, vessel co-option and vasculogenesis have been demonstrated to occur. However, the origin of the endothelial cells and pericytes in the tumour vasculature is not fully understood. Their origin from malignant cells has been shown indirectly in lymphoma and neuroblastoma by immuno-FISH experiments. It is now evident that tumours arise from a small population of cells called cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumour initiating cells. Recent data suggest that a proportion of tumour endothelial cells arise from cancer stem cells in glioblastoma. This was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The analysis of chromosomal abnormalities in endothelial cells showed identical genetic changes to those identified in tumour cells. However, another report contradicted these results from the earlier studies in glioblastoma and had shown that CSCs give rise to pericytes and not endothelial cells. The main thrust of this review is the critical analysis of the conflicting data from different studies and the remaining questions in this field of research. The mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs is also discussed in detail. The transdifferentiation of CSCs to endothelial cells/pericytes has many implications in the progression and metastasis of the tumours and hence it would be a novel target for antiangiogenic therapy.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["SKrishna Priya", "R PNagare", "V SSneha", "CSidhanth", "SBindhya", "PManasa", "T SGanesan"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.30067"}
{"title": "Cerebral collateral circulation in experimental ischemic stroke.", "abstract": "Cerebral collateral circulation is a subsidiary vascular network, which is dynamically recruited after arterial occlusion, and represents a powerful determinant of ischemic stroke outcome. Although several methods may be used for assessing cerebral collaterals in the acute phase of ischemic stroke in humans and rodents, they are generally underutilized. Experimental stroke models may play a unique role in understanding the adaptive response of cerebral collaterals during ischemia and their potential for therapeutic modulation. The systematic assessment of collateral perfusion in experimental stroke models may be used as a \"stratification factor\" in multiple regression analysis of neuroprotection studies, in order to control the within-group variability. Exploring the modulatory mechanisms of cerebral collaterals in stroke models may promote the translational development of therapeutic strategies for increasing collateral flow and directly compare them in term of efficacy, safety and feasibility.

{"title": "Vascularized versus Nonvascularized Bone Grafts: What Is the Evidence?", "abstract": "There is a general perception in practice that a vascular supply should be used when large pieces of bone graft are used, particularly those greater than 6 cm in length for long-bone and large-joint reconstructions. However, the scientific source of this recommendation is not clear.\nWe wished to perform a systematic review to (1) investigate the origin of evidence for this 6-cm rule, and (2) to identify whether there is strong evidence to support the importance of vascularization for longer grafts and/or the lack of vascularization for shorter grafts.\nTwo systematic reviews were performed using SCOPUS and Medline, one for each research question. For the first research purpose, a review of studies from 1975 to 1983 matching article title (\"bone\" and \"graft\") revealed 725 articles, none of which compared graft length. To address the second purpose, a review of articles before 2014 that matched \"bone graft\" AND (\"vascularised\" OR \"vascularized\") AND (\"non-vascularised\" OR \"non-vascularized\") revealed 633 articles, four met prespecified inclusion criteria and were evaluated qualitatively. MINORS ratings ranged from 16 to 18 of 24, and National Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC] Evidence Hierarchy ratings ranged from III-2 (comparative studies without concurrent controls) to III-3 (comparative studies with concurrent controls).\nNo evidence was found that clarified grafts longer than 6 cm should be vascularized. The first reference to the 6-cm rule cites articles that do not provide strong evidence for the rule. Of the four articles found in the second systematic review, none examined osseous union of vascularized and nonvascularized grafts with respect to length. One study (III-3, MINORS 18 of 24) of fibular grafts to various limb defects found that vascularization made no difference to union rate or time to union. Vascularized grafts were more likely to require surgical revision for wound breakdown, nonunion, graft fracture, or mechanical problems (hazard ratio [HR], 5.97, p = 0.008) and grafts smaller than 10 cm had fewer complications requiring revision (HR, 0.88; p = 0.03). Three studies (III-2 to III-3, MINORS 16 to 18 of 24) that examined fibular grafts to the femoral head found that vascularized grafts had superior Harris hip and pain scores. Two of the three articles showed that vascularization was associated with superior radiologic measures of collapse progression.\nNo compelling evidence was found to illuminate the origin of the 6-cm rule for vascularized bone grafts, or that such a rule is based on published research. The evidence we found for grafts to long-bone defects suggested that vascularization might increase the risk of complications that require a surgical revision without increasing union rates or time to union. For large joints, vascularization may result in better functional scores and pain scores, while the evidence that they improve radiologic measures of progression is mixed. There were no studies of long-bone or large-joint reconstructions that examined the role of length with respect to osseous union. We suggest that future studies should present data for graft lengths quantitatively and with individual data points rather than categories of length ranges.\nLevel III, therapeutic study.", "journal": "Clinical orthopaedics and related research", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["Bradley JAllsopp", "David JHunter-Smith", "Warren MRozen"], "doi": "10.1007/s11999-016-4769-4\n10.1016/0002-9610(68)90401-7\n10.1016/j.joms.2008.12.015\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2010.02013.x\n10.1016/0002-9610(76)90289-0\n10.1177/1753193408090400\n10.1007/s00264-014-2281-6\n10.1002/micr.1920150403\n10.1002/micr.1920040107\n10.1097/00000637-197807000-00002\n10.1097/00006534-198811000-00011\n10.1016/0021-9290(82)90053-7\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0347(199901)21:1<66::AID-HED9>3.0.CO;2-Z\n10.1097/00006534-198609000-00001\n10.2106/JBJS.D.02593\n10.1016/8756-3282(91)90018-E\n10.1097/00006534-199705010-00028\n10.1186/1471-2288-9-34\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097\n10.1097/00006534-198403000-00007\n10.1016/S0278-2391(97)90165-8\n10.1097/00006534-197909000-00013\n10.1007/s00264-009-0862-6\n10.1111/ans.12722\n10.1007/s00276-012-1072-2\n10.1007/s00276-013-1098-0\n10.1302/0301-620X.96B9.33230\n10.1046/j.1445-2197.2003.02748.x\n10.1016/S0020-1383(13)70016-0\n10.1097/00006534-197505000-00002\n10.1016/j.joms.2008.04.021\n10.3109/17453678008990768\n10.1097/00006534-198409000-00006\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000138811.88807.65"}

Infiltration and/or migration of macrophages into the infarct area early after MI is critical for infarct healing, vascularization, and cardiac function. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been demonstrated to possess cardioprotective effects post MI and during the progress of cardiac remodeling. However, the specific molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in macrophage recruitment by H2S remain to be identified. In this study, the NaHS (exogenous sources of H2S) treatment exerted an increased infiltration of macrophages into the infarcted myocardium at early stage of MI cardiac tissues in both wild type (WT) and cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase-knockout (CSE-KO) mice. And NaHS accelerated the migration of macrophage cells in vitro. While, the inhibitors not only significantly diminished the migratory ability in response to NaHS, but also blocked the activation of phospho-Src, -Pyk2, -FAK(397), and -FAK(925). Furthermore, NaHS induced the internalization of integrin \u03b21 on macrophage surface, but, integrin \u03b21 silencing inhibited macrophage migration and Src signaling activation. These results indicate that H2S may have the potential as an anti-infarct of MI by governing macrophage migration, which was achieved by accelerating internalization of integrin \u03b21 and activating downstream Src-FAK/Pyk2-Rac pathway.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["LeiMiao", "XiaomingXin", "HongXin", "XiaoyanShen", "Yi-ZhunZhu"], "doi": "10.1038/srep22363"}

Alloplastic implants are an option for facial augmentation, however many avoid their use due to concerns for morbidity associated with their use.\nTo validate our hypothesis that when used properly, alloplastic implants have a low complication profile and provides excellent aesthetic results.\nA retrospective review was performed of all Asian patients undergoing alloplastic facial augmentation between 2009 and 2013 by a single surgeon. Procedures included augmentation of the forehead, nasal dorsum, midface, and chin. Charts were reviewed for outcomes including infection, extrusion, malposition, and operative revision.\nTwo hundred and fifteen patients had 243 implants placed. Of 141 nasal augmentations, there were 2 infections (1.4%), 1 extrusion (0.7%), 7 malpositions (4.9%), and 16 revisions (11.3%), 5 for malposition, 2 for contour irregularity, and 9 for aesthetic change. Augmentation genioplasty was performed in 40 patients with 1 malposition (2.5%) and 6 revisions (15%), 4 for under-correction and 2 for aesthetic change. Thirty-one midface and 31 forehead augmentations were performed without complications. One patient (3.2%) had forehead implant removal for aesthetic change. Overall infection and extrusion rates were 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.\nBy utilizing surgical techniques such as creation of a precise sub-periosteal pocket, placing the implant away from the incision site, and leaving well-vascularized soft tissue coverage under minimal tension, alloplastic implants can safely be used as a first-line option for Asian facial augmentation.\n4 Therapeutic.", "journal": "Aesthetic surgery journal", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["Jerry WChao", "James CLee", "Michelle MChang", "EdmundKwan"], "doi": "10.1093/asj/sjw013"}

Staining in different islet areas corresponding to islet cells adjacent or not to peripheral or central vascular channels was quantified by computerized morphometry. As results, \u03b1, PP and \u03b4 cells were preferentially found adjacent to vessels. In contrast to \u03b1 cells, which were evenly distributed between islet periphery and intraislet vascular channels, PP and \u03b4 cells had asymmetric and opposite distributions: PP staining was higher and somatostatin staining was lower in the islet periphery than in the area around intraislet vascular channels. Additionally, frequencies of PP and \u03b4 cells were negatively correlated in the islets. No difference was observed between islets from the head and the tail of the pancreas, and from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors. In conclusion, the distribution of \u03b4 cells differs from that of PP cells in human islets, suggesting that vessels at the periphery and at the centre of islets drain different hormonal cocktails.", "journal": "The Journal of endocrinology", "date": "2016-03-05", "authors": ["CharlotteBarbieux", "G\u00e9raldineParnaud", "VanessaLavallard", "EstelleBrioudes", "J\u00e9r\u00e9myMeyer", "MohamedAlibashe Ahmed", "EkaterineBerishvili", "ThierryBerney", "DomenicoBosco"], "doi": "10.1530/JOE-15-0542"}

In order to improve bone graft substitutes, both mechanisms should be addressed simultaneously. While the individual effects of various bioinorganics have been studied, an understanding of the combinatorial effects is lacking. Cobalt and fluoride ions, in appropriate concentrations, are known to individually favor the vascularization and mineralization processes, respectively. This study investigated the potential of using a combination of fluoride and cobalt ions to simultaneously promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis in human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). Using a two-step biomimetic method, wells of tissue culture plates were coated with a calcium phosphate (CaP) layer without or with the incorporation of cobalt, fluoride, or both. In parallel, hMSCs were cultured on uncoated well plates, and cultured with cobalt and/or fluoride ions within the media. The results revealed that cobalt ions increased the expression of angiogenic markers, with the effects being stronger when the ions were added as a dissolved salt in cell medium as compared to incorporation into CaP. Cobalt ions generally suppressed the ALP activity, the expression of osteogenic genes, and the level of mineralization, regardless of delivery method. Fluoride ions, individually or in combination with cobalt, significantly increased the expression of many of the selected osteogenic markers, as well as mineral deposition. This study demonstrates an approach to simultaneously target the two essential mechanisms in bone healing: angiogenesis and osteogenesis.

{"title": "Histochemical differences along the intestine of Corydoras paleatus (Siluriformes: Callichthyidae).", "abstract": "The Neotropical catfish Corydoras paleatus is a facultative air-breather and the caudal half of the intestine is involved in gas exchange. In South America, air-breathing fishes are found in tropical or sub-tropical freshwaters where the probability of hypoxia is high. The aim of this study was to characterize by traditional histochemical and lectinhistochemical methods the pattern of carbohydrate in the intestinal mucosa. Intestine samples were taken from 25 healthy adult specimens collected in Buenos Aires (Argentina). Samples were fixed by immersion in 10 % buffered formalin and routinely processed and embedded in paraffin wax. Subsequently, these sections were incubated in the biotinylated lectins battery. Labeled Streptavidin-Biotin (LSAB) system was used for detection, diaminobenzidine as chromogen and haematoxylin as a contrast. To locate and distinguish glycoconjugates (GCs) of the globet cells, we used the following histochemical methods: PAS; PAS*S; KOH/ PA*S; PA/Bh/KOH/PAS; KOH/PA*/Bh/PAS; Alcian Blue and Toluidine Blue at different pHs. Microscopically, the general structure of vertebrate intestine was observed and showed all the cell types characteristic of the intestinal epithelium. The cranial sector of catfish intestine is a site of digestion and absorption and its structure is similar to other fish groups. In contrast, enterocytes of the caudal portion are low cuboidal cells; and between these, globet cells and capillaries are observed, these latter may reach the mucosal lumen. Underlying the epithelium, observed a well-developed lamina propria-submucosa made of connective tissue; this layer was highly vascularized and did not exhibit glands. According to histochemistry, the diverse GCs elaborated and secreted in the intestine are associated with specific functions in relation to their physiological significance, with special reference to their role in lubrication, buffering effect and prevention of proteolytic damage to the epithelium together with other biological processes, such as osmoregulation and ion exchange. The lectinhistochemical analysis of the intestinal mucosa reveals the presence of terminal residues of glucose, mannose and galactose. In conclusion, this study has shown that GCs synthesized in the intestine of C. paleatus exhibit a high level of histochemical complexity and that the lectin binding pattern of the intestinal mucosa is characteristic of each species and the variations are related with the multiple functions performed by the mucus in the digestive tract.

VCAs are distinguished from solid organ transplants by the requirement of rigorous physical therapy for optimal outcomes and the fact that these procedures are not lifesaving in most cases.

{"title": "Dietary macronutrients and the aging liver sinusoidal endothelial cell.", "abstract": "Fenestrations are pores within the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) that line the sinusoids of the highly vascularized liver. Fenestrations facilitate the transfer of substrates between blood and hepatocytes. With pseudocapillarization of the hepatic sinusoid in old age, there is a loss of fenestrations. LSECs are uniquely exposed to gut-derived dietary and microbial substrates delivered by the portal circulation to the liver. Here we studied the effect of 25 diets varying in content of macronutrients and energy on LSEC fenestrations using the Geometric Framework method in a large cohort of mice aged 15 mo. Macronutrient distribution rather than total food or energy intake was associated with changes in fenestrations. Porosity and frequency were inversely associated with dietary fat intake, while fenestration diameter was inversely associated with protein or carbohydrate intake. Fenestrations were also linked to diet-induced changes in gut microbiome, with increased fenestrations associated with higher abundance of Firmicutes and reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes Diet-induced changes in levels of several fatty acids (C16:0, C19:0, and C20:4) were also significantly inversely associated with fenestrations, suggesting a link between dietary fat and modulation of lipid rafts in the LSECs.

In mandibular reconstruction, when a free flap is contraindicated a pedicled scapular flap has been described vascularized by the DSA. During the dissection of this flap, there is a risk of lesion of the TCA, which could be fatal to the flap if the DCA is a branch of the TCA. To evaluate the frequency of this anatomic situation, a dissection and radiologic study has been performed. 50 anatomic dissections on fresh cadavers and 93 arteriographies from 47 patients have been studied, to determine what was the DSA origin. In our dissections we found the origin of the DSA was a type I origin in 19 cases (38\u00a0%), a type II in 19 cases (38\u00a0%) and a type III in 12 cases (24\u00a0%).

{"title": "Long Non-Coding RNA Malat-1 Is Dispensable during Pressure Overload-Induced Cardiac Remodeling and Failure in Mice.", "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules with diverse regulatory functions during embryonic development, normal life, and disease in higher organisms. However, research on the role of lncRNAs in cardiovascular diseases and in particular heart failure is still in its infancy. The exceptionally well conserved nuclear lncRNA Metastasis associated in lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat-1) is a regulator of mRNA splicing and highly expressed in the heart. Malat-1 modulates hypoxia-induced vessel growth, activates ERK/MAPK signaling, and scavenges the anti-hypertrophic microRNA-133. We therefore hypothesized that Malat-1 may act as regulator of cardiac hypertrophy and failure during cardiac pressure overload induced by thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) in mice.\nAbsence of Malat-1 did not affect cardiac hypertrophy upon pressure overload: Heart weight to tibia length ratio significantly increased in WT mice (sham: 5.78\u00b10.55, TAC 9.79\u00b11.82 g/mm; p<0.001) but to a similar extend also in Malat-1 knockout (KO) mice (sham: 6.21\u00b11.12, TAC 8.91\u00b11.74 g/mm; p<0.01) with no significant difference between genotypes. As expected, TAC significantly reduced left ventricular fractional shortening in WT (sham: 38.81\u00b16.53%, TAC: 23.14\u00b111.99%; p<0.01) but to a comparable degree also in KO mice (sham: 37.01\u00b14.19%, TAC: 25.98\u00b19.75%; p<0.05). Histological hallmarks of myocardial remodeling, such as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, increased interstitial fibrosis, reduced capillary density, and immune cell infiltration, did not differ significantly between WT and KO mice after TAC. In line, the absence of Malat-1 did not significantly affect angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, dysfunction, and overall remodeling. Above that, pressure overload by TAC significantly induced mRNA levels of the hypertrophy marker genes Nppa, Nppb and Acta1, to a similar extend in both genotypes. Alternative splicing of Ndrg2 after TAC was apparent in WT (isoform ratio; sham: 2.97\u00b10.26, TAC 1.57\u00b10.40; p<0.0001) and KO mice (sham: 3.64\u00b10.37; TAC: 2.24\u00b10.76; p<0.0001) and interestingly differed between genotypes both at baseline and after pressure overload (p<0.05 each).\nThese findings confirm a role for the lncRNA Malat-1 in mRNA splicing.

Because TAMs enhance tumor growth, development, and metastatic potential, redirection of TAM activation may have significant therapeutic benefit. Our studies in primary human macrophages and murine breast TAMs suggest that the synthetic oleanane triterpenoid CDDO-methyl ester (CDDO-Me) reprograms the activation profile of TAMs from tumor-promoting to tumor-inhibiting. We show that CDDO-Me treatment inhibits expression of IL-10 and VEGF in stimulated human M2 macrophages and TAMs but increases expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Surface expression of CD206 and CD163, which are characteristic of M2 activation, is significantly attenuated by CDDO-Me. In contrast, CDDO-Me up-regulates surface expression of HLA-DR and CD80, which are markers of M1 activation, and importantly potentiates macrophage activation of autologous T cells but inhibits endothelial cell vascularization.

{"title": "Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca(2+) Handling and Apoptotic Resistance in Tumor-Derived Endothelial Colony Forming Cells.", "abstract": "Truly endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can be mobilized from bone marrow to support the vascular network of growing tumors, thereby sustaining the metastatic switch. Endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) are the only EPC subtype belonging to the endothelial phenotype and capable of incorporating within neovessels. The intracellular Ca(2+) machinery plays a key role in ECFC activation and is remodeled in renal cellular carcinoma-derived ECFCs (RCC-ECFCs). Particularly, RCC-ECFCs seems to undergo a drop in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+) ]ER ). This feature is remarkable when considering that inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3 )-dependent ER-to-mitochondria Ca(2+) transfer regulates the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Herein, we sought to assess whether: (1) the [Ca(2+) ]ER and the InsP3 -induced ER-mitochondria Ca(2+) shuttle are reduced in RCC-ECFCs; and (2) the dysregulation of ER Ca(2+) handling leads to apoptosis resistance in tumor-derived cells. RCC-ECFCs displayed a reduction both in [Ca(2+) ]ER and in the InsP3 -dependent mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, while they expressed normal levels of Bcl-2 and Bak. The decrease in [Ca(2+) ]ER was associated to a remarkable ER expansion in RCC-ECFCs, which is a hallmark of ER stress, and did not depend on the remodeling of the Ca(2+) -transporting and the ER Ca(2+) -storing systems. As expected, RCC-ECFCs were less sensitive to rapamycin- and thapsigargin-induced apoptosis; however, buffering intracellular Ca(2+) levels with BAPTA dampened apoptosis in both cell types. Finally, store-operated Ca(2+) entry was seemingly uncoupled from the apoptotic machinery in RCC-ECFCs. Thus, the chronic underfilling of the ER Ca(2+) pool could confer a survival advantage to RCC-ECFCs and underpin RCC resistance to pharmacological treatment. J. Cell.

They were divided into 4 groups: (1) hypertensive-ischemia, (2) hypertensive-sham, (3) normotensive-ischemia, and (4) normotensive-sham. Four months after the operation, the global changes of the eye and pupillary light reflex were assessed. Then each rat was perfused, and randomly one of the bulbuses oculi was prepared as retinal flat mounts for investigation of vascular changes. The opposite eyeball was prepared as a paraffin section for observation of the linear density of retinal ganglion cells and for thickness measurement. One hypertensive-ischemia rat had a cataract in one eye and another rat in the same group had bulbus oculi collapse in one eye. The light reflex disappeared in 13.33% of hypertensive-ischemia rats, and the rest of the hypertensive-ischemia rats and normotensive-ischemia rats had slow reflex. Compared with the respective controls, the peripheral retinal vascular network in hypertensive-ischemia and normotensive-ischemia rats was sparse; linear density of the retinal ganglion cells was significantly reduced; and the retinal thickness was reduced. Compared with normotensive-ischemia rats, the hypertensive-ischemia rats demonstrated more severe changes. After bilateral common carotic artery occlusion, the eyes of hypertensive rats developed various pathological changes similar to those of ocular ischemic syndrome. In conclusion, an animal model for ocular ischemic syndrome can be created by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

{"title": "Micro-CT based modelling for characterising injection-moulded porous titanium implants.", "abstract": "Design of prosthetic implants to ensure rapid and stable osseointegration remains a significant challenge, and continuous efforts have been directed to new implant materials, structures and morphology. This paper aims to develop and characterise a porous titanium dental implant fabricated by metallic powder injection-moulding. The surface morphology of the specimens was first examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), followed by microscopic computerised tomography (\u03bc-CT) scanning to capture its 3D microscopic features non-destructively. The nature of porosity and pore sizes were determined statistically. A homogenisation technique based on the Hills-energy theorem was adopted to evaluate its directional elastic moduli, and the conservation of mass theorem was employed to quantify the oxygen diffusivity for bio-transportation feature. This porous medium was found to have pore sizes varying from 50 to 400\u2009\u00b5m and the average porosity of 46.90\u2009\u00b1\u20091.83%. The anisotropic principal elastic moduli were found fairly close to the upper range of cortical bone, and the directional diffusivities could potentially enable radial osseous tissue ingrowth and vascularisation. This porous titanium successfully reduces the elastic modulus mismatch between implant and bone for dental and orthopaedic applications, and provides improved capacity for transporting oxygen, nutrient and waste for pre-vascular network formation.

{"title": "Periosteal vascularization of the distal femur in relation to distal femoral osteotomies: a cadaveric study.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate periosteal vessels location as intra-operative landmarks in distal femoral osteotomies and focused on the branching pattern of the vascular supply of the medial and lateral femoral condyle, its constancy, and the relationship to the height of distal femoral osteotomies. Anastomoses of relevant vessels were studied to analyze the risk of vascular insufficiency after transection of landmark vessels.\nA human cadaver dissection study on the vascular supply of the medial and lateral side of the distal femur was conducted. Surgical dissection was performed in eight knees in total. Distances between the vascular supply and bony landmarks were calculated. Relation of the vascular structures to the transverse bone cuts of distal femoral osteotomies was described, as well as anastomoses of relevant vessels.\nOn the medial side of the distal femur the periosteum was primarily supplied by the descending genicular artery (DGA) in 87.5 % of the specimens. In the absence of the DGA, the superior medial genicular artery was the supplier. Vascularization took place through two constant branches, the upper transverse artery (UTA) and the central longitudinal artery. The UTA originated at a mean distance of 6.9\u00a0cm (range 5.9-7.9\u00a0cm) above the knee joint line. On the lateral side of the distal femur the superior lateral genicular artery was the main vessel. In all dissected knees it gave off the lateral transverse artery (LTA). The LTA originated at a mean distance of 6.9\u00a0cm (range 5.8-7.6\u00a0cm) above the knee joint line. Anastomoses between the UTA, LTA and the longitudinal arch of the femoral shaft were found that could prevent vascular insufficiencies after transection of the UTA and LTA.\nThe vascular supply of the medial and lateral aspects of the femoral condyle is highly constant. Both the UTA, on the medial side, and the LTA, on the lateral side, can serve as a landmark for orthopedic surgeons in determining the height of the osteotomy cuts in distal femoral osteotomies. Transection of these landmark vessels during the osteotomy will not result in vascular insufficiency because of a collateral supply.", "journal": "Journal of experimental orthopaedics", "date": "2016-02-26", "authors": ["J A Dvan der Woude", "R Jvan Heerwaarden", "R L A WBleys"], "doi": "10.1186/s40634-016-0042-8\n10.1097/01.blo.0000223995.79894.5e\n10.1097/00004647-199609000-00029\n10.1007/s11999-014-4007-x\n10.1016/j.otsr.2014.07.021\n10.1016/j.jhsb.2006.10.015\n10.1053/jhsu.2000.5993\n10.1007/s00276-010-0658-9\n10.1007/BF01628486\n10.1007/s00167-010-1138-9\n10.1007/s004020050288\n10.1097/00005131-199908000-00002\n10.1007/s00064-010-9006-9\n10.1007/s001670050114\n10.1007/s00132-009-1458-y\n10.1002/ca.21060\n10.1007/s00276-010-0629-1\n10.1016/j.jhsa.2011.07.015\n10.1177/0363546510363664\n10.1055/s-2000-10135\n10.1007/s00167-013-2503-2\n10.1097/00006534-199102000-00011\n10.1007/s00276-002-0004-y\n10.1016/j.aanat.2012.12.001\n10.1007/s00167-012-2127-y\n10.1097/JSA.0b013e3182900720\n10.1007/s00167-012-2133-0\n10.1177/1753193410364484"}

In this study, osteomyocutaneous allografts (alloOMCs) from Balb/c (H2(d) ) mice were transplanted into C57BL/6 (H2(b) ) recipients. Immunosuppression consisted of 1 mg anti-CD154 on day 0, 0.5 mg CTLA4Ig on day 2 and rapamycin (RPM; 3 mg/kg per day from days 0-7, then every other day for 3 weeks). Long-term allograft survival, donor-specific tolerance and donor-recipient cell trafficking were evaluated. Treatment with costimulation blockade plus RPM resulted in long-term graft survival (>120 days) of alloOMC in 12 of 15 recipients compared with untreated controls (median survival time [MST] \u224810.2 \u00b1 0.8 days), RPM alone (MST \u224833 \u00b1 5.5 days) and costimulation blockade alone (MST \u224845.8 \u00b1 7.1 days). Donor-specific hyporesponsiveness in recipients with viable grafts was demonstrated in vitro. Evidence of donor-specific tolerance was further assessed in vivo by secondary donor-specific skin graft survival and third-party graft rejection. A significant increase of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells was evident in tolerant animals. Donor cells populated peripheral blood, thymus, and both donor and recipient bone marrow. Consequently, combined anti-CD154/CTLA4Ig costimulation blockade-based therapy induces donor-specific tolerance in a stringent murine alloOMC transplant model.", "journal": "American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons", "date": "2016-02-26", "authors": ["C HLin", "Y LWang", "M RAnggelia", "W YChuang", "H YCheng", "QMao", "J AZelken", "C HLin", "X XZheng", "W P ALee", "GBrandacher"], "doi": "10.1111/ajt.13694"}
{"title": "3D spheroid culture enhances survival and therapeutic capacities of MSCs injected into ischemic kidney.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture has been reported to increase the therapeutic potentials of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of 3D spheroids of human adipose-derived MSCs for acute kidney injury (AKI). In vitro studies indicated that 3D spheroids of MSCs produced higher levels of extracellular matrix proteins (including collagen I, fibronectin and laminin), and exhibited stronger anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative capacities than two-dimensional (2D) cultured cells. Furthermore, 3D culture increased the paracrine secretion of cytokines by MSCs, including angiogenic factors (VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor), anti-apoptotic factors (epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor), the anti-oxidative factor insulin-like growth factor and the anti-inflammatory protein tumour necrosis factor-alpha stimulated gene/protein 6. Consistent with in\u00a0vitro experiments, 3D spheroids of MSCs showed enhanced survival and paracrine effects in\u00a0vivo. More importantly, when injected into the kidney of model rats with ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced AKI, 3D spheroids were more beneficial in protecting the I/R kidney against apoptosis, reducing tissue damage, promoting vascularization and ameliorating renal function compared with 2D cultured cells. Therefore, the 3D culture strategy improved the therapeutic effects of MSCs, and might be promising for AKI treatment.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2016-02-26", "authors": ["YongXu", "TaopingShi", "AxiangXu", "LeiZhang"], "doi": "10.1111/jcmm.12651"}
{"title": "The First Hand Allotransplantation in Taiwan: A Report at 9 Months.", "abstract": "Hand transplantations have been initiated and have been encouraged by promising results for more than 1 decade. The aim of this study was to present the first case of hand transplantation performed in Taiwan.\nOn September 3, 2014, we transplanted the left distal forearm and hand of a brain-dead managed 37 years to a man aged 45 years who had traumatic amputation of the distal third of his right forearm 30 years ago. The total ischemic time during the transplantation was 6 hours and 45 minutes. Immunosuppression included anti-thymocyte globulins, and methylprednisolone (Solumedrol) was used for the induction. Maintenance therapy included systemic tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid [mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)], and prednisone. A combination of systemic (tacrolimus/MMF/prednisolone) and topical immunosuppressant cream (clobetasol and tacrolimus) was applied if acute rejection occurred. Follow-up included routine posttransplant laboratory tests, skin biopsies, intensive physiotherapy, and psychological support.\nThe initial postoperative course was uneventful. No surgical complications were observed. Immunosuppression was well tolerated using tacrolimus, MMF, and prednisone, except for some immune-related complications. One episode of mild clinical and histological signs of cutaneous rejection was seen at 105 days after surgery. These signs disappeared after pulse therapy with Solumedrol and the topical application of immunosuppressive creams (tacrolimus and clobetasol). One infection episode occurred due to local cellulitis and axillary lymphadenopathy on day 140 and was successfully treated with antibiotics. The patient developed cytomegalovirus infection at 7 months that responded to medication. Intensive physiotherapy led to satisfactory progress in motor functioning. Sensory progress (Tinel sign) was good and reached the wrist by 3 months for the median and ulnar nerves, and could be felt in the finger tip by 9 months in response to deep pressure and light touch sensations. The patient has a lateral pinch that allows him to pick up and grip objects during daily living, although his muscle power is still insufficient.\nHand allotransplantation is technically feasible. Currently available immunosuppression methods seem to control vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation rejection.

{"title": "Oxygen Tension-Controlled Matrices with Osteogenic and Vasculogenic Cells for Vascularized Bone Regeneration In Vivo.", "abstract": "Despite recent progress, segmental bone defect repair is still a significant challenge in orthopedic surgery. While bone tissue engineering approaches using biodegradable matrices along with bone/blood vessel forming cells offered improved possibilities, current regenerative strategies lack the ability to achieve vascularized bone regeneration in critical-sized/segmental bone defects. In this study, we introduced and evaluated a two-pronged approach for vascularized bone regeneration in vivo. The goal was to demonstrate vascularized bone formation using oxygen tension-controlled (OTC) matrices seeded with bone and blood vessel forming cells. OTC matrices were coimplanted with rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and peripheral blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells (PB-EPCs) to demonstrate the osteogenic and vasculogenic differentiation of these cells, postseeding on a matrix, especially deep inside the matrix pore structure. Matrices coimplanted with varied rabbit MSC and PB-EPC ratios (1:4, 1:1, and 4:1) were assessed in a nude mouse subcutaneous implantation model to determine a coimplantation ratio with superior osteogenic as well as vasculogenic properties. The implants were analyzed, at week 8, for endothelial (CD31 and Von Willebrand factor [vWF]) and osteogenic marker (RunX2 and Col I) staining qualitatively and collagen deposition and number of vessel formation quantitatively. Results from these experiments established MSC-to-PB-EPC ratio 1:1 as the best coimplantation ratio. OTC matrix with 1:1 coimplantation ratio was assessed for segmental bone defect repair in a rabbit critical-sized bone defect model. The group under investigation was OTC matrix, and the matrix was seeded with MSCs, EPCs, or MSCs:EPCs in a 1:1 ratio. Explants at week 12 were evaluated for bone defect repair via micro-CT and histology. Results from rabbit in vivo experiments show enhanced mineralization and vascularization for the 1:1 coimplantation group.

We conducted a study of the plasma proteome of 500 Nepalese children 6-8 years of age (male/female ratio\u2009=\u20090.99) to identify proteins associated with VK status. We measured the concentrations of plasma lipids and protein induced by VK absence-II (PIVKA-II) and correlated relative abundance of proteins quantified by mass spectrometry with PIVKA-II. VK deficiency (PIVKA-II>2\u2009\u03bcg/L) was associated with a higher abundance of low-density lipoproteins, total cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations (p<0.01). Among 978 proteins observed in >10% of the children, five proteins were associated with PIVKA-II and seven proteins were differentially abundant between VK deficient versus sufficient children, including coagulation factor-II, hemoglobin, and vascular endothelial cadherin, passing a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 10% (q<0.10). Among 27 proteins associated with PIVKA-II or VK deficiency at a less stringent FDR (q<0.20), a network comprised of hemoglobin subunits and erythrocyte anti-oxidative enzymes were highly and positively correlated each other (all r>0.7).

We show the impact of mutations, genomic instability, lymphatic and blood vascularization, and the immune contexture of the tumor microenvironment on synchronous metastases in large cohorts of colorectal cancer patients. We observed large genetic heterogeneity among primary tumors, but no major differences in chromosomal instability or key cancer-associated mutations. Similar patterns of cancer-related gene expression levels were observed between patients. No cancer-associated genes or pathways were associated with M stage. Instead, mutations of FBXW7 were associated with the absence of metastasis and correlated with increased expression of T cell proliferation and antigen presentation functions. Analyzing the tumor microenvironment, we observed two hallmarks of the metastatic process: decreased presence of lymphatic vessels and reduced immune cytotoxicity. These events could be the initiating factors driving both synchronous and metachronous metastases.

{"title": "Effects of Voluntary Locomotion and Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide on the Dynamics of Single Dural Vessels in Awake Mice.", "abstract": "The dura mater is a vascularized membrane surrounding the brain and is heavily innervated by sensory nerves. Our knowledge of the dural vasculature has been limited to pathological conditions, such as headaches, but little is known about the dural blood flow regulation during behavior. To better understand the dynamics of dural vessels during behavior, we used two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) to measure the diameter changes of single dural and pial vessels in the awake mouse during voluntary locomotion. Surprisingly, we found that voluntary locomotion drove the constriction of dural vessels, and the dynamics of these constrictions could be captured with a linear convolution model. Dural vessel constrictions did not mirror the large increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) during locomotion, indicating that dural vessel constriction was not caused passively by compression. To study how behaviorally driven dynamics of dural vessels might be altered in pathological states, we injected the vasodilator calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which induces headache in humans.

{"title": "In Vivo Quantitative Microcomputed Tomographic Analysis of Vasculature and Organs in a Normal and Diseased Mouse Model.", "abstract": "Non-bone in vivo micro-CT imaging has many potential applications for preclinical evaluation. Specifically, the in vivo quantification of changes in the vascular network and organ morphology in small animals, associated with the emergence and progression of diseases like bone fracture, inflammation and cancer, would be critical to the development and evaluation of new therapies for the same. However, there are few published papers describing the in vivo vascular imaging in small animals, due to technical challenges, such as low image quality and low vessel contrast in surrounding tissues. These studies have primarily focused on lung, cardiovascular and brain imaging. In vivo vascular imaging of mouse hind limbs has not been reported. We have developed an in vivo CT imaging technique to visualize and quantify vasculature and organ structure in disease models, with the goal of improved quality images. With 1-2 minutes scanning by a high speed in vivo micro-CT scanner (Quantum CT), and injection of a highly efficient contrast agent (Exitron nano 12000), vasculature and organ structure were semi-automatically segmented and quantified via image analysis software (Analyze). Vessels of the head and hind limbs, and organs like the heart, liver, kidneys and spleen were visualized and segmented from density maps. In a mouse model of bone metastasis, neoangiogenesis was observed, and associated changes to vessel morphology were computed, along with associated enlargement of the spleen. The in vivo CT image quality, voxel size down to 20 \u03bcm, is sufficient to visualize and quantify mouse vascular morphology. With this technique, in vivo vascular monitoring becomes feasible for the preclinical evaluation of small animal disease models.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-02-26", "authors": ["Nanditha MohanDas", "SarahHatsell", "KalyanNannuru", "LilyHuang", "XialingWen", "LiliWang", "Li-HsienWang", "VincentIdone", "Jeffrey AMeganck", "AndrewMurphy", "ArisEconomides", "LiQinXie"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0150085\n10.1016/j.acra.2010.09.003\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2009.08.007\n10.1002/art.34370\n10.1371/journal.pone.0017336\n10.1371/journal.pone.0031179\n10.1111/micc.12102\n10.1152/ajpheart.00928.2003\n10.1007/s00259-010-1450-0\n10.1387/ijdb.103229jm\n10.1016/j.acra.2013.06.003\n10.3390/s130606957\n10.1161/circimaging.108.784702\n10.1088/0967-3334/31/2/010\n10.1002/ijc.24332\n10.1371/journal.pone.0025692\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.04.066\n10.1021/cr200358s\n10.1016/j.acra.2013.06.002\n10.1016/j.ejmp.2014.05.011\n10.1038/nm1101\n10.1371/journal.pone.0086562\n10.1016/j.bone.2010.05.033\n10.1371/journal.pone.0097381\n10.1016/j.acra.2014.07.022\n10.1371/journal.pone.0068103\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016078\n10.1016/j.yexmp.2006.06.007\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019099\n10.1186/1477-3155-10-10\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.09.026\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2009.08.007\n10.1161/strokeaha.108.521740\n10.1162/1535350042380326\n10.1515/bmt.2010.031\n10.1177/0284185113475608\n10.1002/cmmi.394"}
{"title": "Cadaveric Study of a Z-Plasty Modification to the Moberg Flap for Increased Advancement and Decreased Morbidity.", "abstract": "The Moberg advancement flap is a well-established tool to provide sensate, vascularized tissue for thumb reconstruction. Modifications providing additional length have been described, but no studies have examined how much additional advancement can be achieved consistently, and at what cost. The authors hypothesized that Z-plasty modification at the base of the Moberg flap would allow additional advancement compared with the traditional technique, and maintain primary closure of the donor-site and avoid additional morbidity.\nStandard Moberg flaps were performed and advancement was measured on 20 cadaver specimens. Ten flaps were then modified with the O'Brien technique of incising proximally and skeletonizing the neurovascular bundles. The other 10 flaps were modified with Z-plasties at the base of the thumb. Differences in distance of advancement were compared, as was the ability to primarily close donor sites.\nAverage advancement for Moberg flaps was 7.3 \u00b1 1.2 mm, compared with 15.0 \u00b1 2.5 mm for the O'Brien modification (p < 0.01) and 11.3 \u00b1 1.7 mm for the Z-plasty modification (p < 0.01).\nAlthough the O'Brien modification allows approximately 50 percent further advancement than the Z-plasty modification compared with the standard Moberg flaps, the increase correlates to a large area of exposed neurovascular bundles at the volar base of the thumb, which requires secondary coverage. However, all Z-plasty donor-sites could be closed primarily. Primary closure of all donor sites will decrease healing time, wound complications, digital nerve sensitivity, and cosmetic appearance.

This portion is highly modified, being well vascularized with capillaries between epithelial cells, which makes it well suited for gas exchange. Instead, the cranial portion is a digestion and absorption site, as it has a typical intestinal epithelium with columnar cells arranged in a single row, villi and less vascularized tunica mucosa. Therefore, the intestine was studied by light and electron microscopy to assess differences between the cranial, middle and caudal portions. To characterize the potential for cell proliferation of this organ, we used anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen antibody and anti-Na(+) K(+) -ATPase monoclonal antibody to detect the presence of Na(+) /K(+) pump. In C. paleatus it was observed that cell dynamics showed a decreasing gradient of proliferation in cranio-caudal direction. Also, the intestine of this catfish is an important organ in ionoregulation: the basolateral Na(+) /K(+) pump may have an active role, transporting Na(+) out of the cell while helping to maintain the repose potential and to regulate cellular volume.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2016-02-26", "authors": ["Silvia EPlaul", "RaquelPastor", "Alcira OD\u00edaz", "Claudio GBarbeito"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.22614"}

Reiterations of endothelial-tip-cell selection, sprout extension and anastomosis are the basis for vascular network generation, a process governed by the VEGF/Notch feedback loop. Here, we find that temporal regulation of this feedback loop, a previously unexplored dimension, is the key mechanism to determine vascular density. Iterating between computational modeling and in vivo live imaging, we demonstrate that the rate of tip-cell selection determines the length of linear sprout extension at the expense of branching, dictating network density. We provide the first example of a host tissue-derived signal (Semaphorin3E-Plexin-D1) that accelerates tip cell selection rate, yielding a dense network.

{"title": "Revascularization of the graft in obliterative bronchiolitis after heterotopic tracheal transplantation.", "abstract": "Obliterative bronchiolitis is the principal long-term problem for lung transplant patients. One of the simplest and most reproducible animal models of obliterative bronchiolitis is heterotopic tracheal transplantation in subcutaneous tissue, where the graft is not primarily vascularized. We demonstrate here the rapid graft revascularization and the kinetics of expression of its angiogenic and lymphatic factors. We performed iso- and allotracheal transplantations harvested on day 0-21. The number of functional blood vessels, quantified after intravenous biotinylated dextran administration, increased from D0 (0 for both iso- and allografts) to D21 (44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0vessels/mm(2) in isografts and 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 in allografts, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for both vs. D0). VEGF mRNA expression assessed by qPCR peaked on D1 (4.3-fold increase in isografts and 4.0-fold in allografts, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for both vs. D0), but receded thereafter. Angiopoietin-1, involved in the maturation of the neoformed vessels, increased later on, by 6.2-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in isografts and 11.5-fold in allografts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) by D21, and angiopoietin-2 by 7.8-fold in isografts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 13.8-fold in allografts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Although always present in the iso- and allografts, there were significantly more and larger LYVE1(+) lymphatic vessels at D21 in allografts than in isografts. Thus, we demonstrate that tracheal grafts are rapidly revascularized by functional blood and lymphatic vessels, due to early VEGF and subsequent angiopoietins expression, which is a new advantage of this model, in addition to its ease of use, reproducibility, and viability in the absence of immunosuppressive treatment.", "journal": "Physiological reports", "date": "2016-02-26", "authors": ["SimonaNemska", "Fran\u00e7oisDaubeuf", "NellyFrossard"], "doi": "10.14814/phy2.12690"}
{"title": "The Bromodomain BET Inhibitor JQ1 Suppresses Tumor Angiogenesis in Models of Childhood Sarcoma.", "abstract": "The bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitor JQ1 has marked antitumor activity against several hematologic malignancies as well as solid tumor models. Here, we investigated its activity in vitro and in vivo against models of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. In vitro, JQ1 (but not the inactive enantiomer JQ1R) inhibited cell proliferation and increased G1 fraction of cells, although there was no correlation between cell line sensitivity and suppression of c-MYC or MYCN. In vivo, xenografts showed significant inhibition of growth during the period of treatment, and rapid regrowth after treatment was stopped, activity typical of antiangiogenic agents. Furthermore, xenografts derived from cell lines intrinsically resistant or sensitive to JQ1 in vitro had similar sensitivity in vivo as xenografts. Further investigation showed that JQ1 reduced tumor vascularization. This was secondary to both drug-induced downregulation of tumor-derived growth factors and direct effects of JQ1 on vascular elements. JQ1 suppressed VEGF-stimulated vascularization of Matrigel plugs in mice, and in vitro suppressed differentiation, proliferation, and invasion of human umbilical cord vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC). In HUVECs, JQ1 partially suppressed c-MYC levels, but dramatically reduced AP-1 levels and activity through suppression of the AP-1-associated protein FOSL1. Our data suggest that the antitumor activity of JQ1 in these sarcoma models is largely a consequence of its antiangiogenic activity.

After loading, implant success rates, biological and prosthetic complications, patient satisfaction, and psychological changes were recorded.\nBone augmentation of the jaw was successful and vascularized grafts provided an additional vascular supply in compromised irradiated tissue. Rehabilitation was successful in all of the patients after loading. Thirty-eight dental implants failed, and 35 implants were removed. The success rate of the implants was 93.6\u00a0% for 10\u00a0years after loading. It was not a significant difference in implant success rate between the HBO group and the other groups. The prosthodontic maintenance results and complication rates showed that patients required intervention 0.19 times per year. All patients were satisfied with the oral restoration results.\nThe restoration of oral function in radiotherapy patients with tumor resection using implant-supported prostheses is a viable treatment option.\nEither alone or in combination with HBO, dental implant-supported prostheses can be used an effective therapeutic approach for irradiated patients with oral function reconstruction.", "journal": "Clinical oral investigations", "date": "2016-02-26", "authors": ["YiqunWu", "WeiHuang", "ZhiyongZhang", "ZhiyuanZhang", "DuohongZou"], "doi": "10.1007/s00784-016-1753-z"}
{"title": "Endothelial Plasticity: Shifting Phenotypes through Force Feedback.", "abstract": "The endothelial lining of the vasculature is exposed to a large variety of biochemical and hemodynamic stimuli with different gradients throughout the vascular network. Adequate adaptation requires endothelial cells to be highly plastic, which is reflected by the remarkable heterogeneity of endothelial cells in tissues and organs. Hemodynamic forces such as fluid shear stress and cyclic strain are strong modulators of the endothelial phenotype and function. Although endothelial plasticity is essential during development and adult physiology, proatherogenic stimuli can induce adverse plasticity which contributes to disease. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), the hallmark of endothelial plasticity, was long thought to be restricted to embryonic development but has emerged as a pathologic process in a plethora of diseases. In this perspective we argue how shear stress and cyclic strain can modulate EndMT and discuss how this is reflected in atherosclerosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "journal": "Stem cells international", "date": "2016-02-24", "authors": ["GuidoKrenning", "Valerio GBarauna", "Jos\u00e9 EKrieger", "Martin CHarmsen", "Jan-Renier A JMoonen"], "doi": "10.1155/2016/9762959\n10.1007/3-540-36028-X_3\n10.1038/nrm2596\n10.1146/annurev.bioeng.3.1.1\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000183609.55154.44\n10.1146/annurev.cb.11.110195.000445\n10.1152/physiol.00020.2006\n10.1152/ajpheart.01047.2006\n10.1016/0021-9150(87)90090-6\n10.1161/01.atv.5.3.293\n10.4244/eijv11sva4\n10.1115/1.4028969\n10.1097/HCO.0b013e328331630b\n10.1152/ajpheart.00325.2011\n10.5830/cvja-2011-068\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2013.08.006\n10.1139/y11-107\n10.1093/cvr/cvv175\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003734\n10.1161/circresaha.113.301792\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3006927\n10.1002/aja.1001480108\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.05.034\n10.1093/cvr/cvq012\n10.1161/01.RES.0000021432.70309.28\n10.1152/ajplung.00378.2006\n10.1016/s1097-2765(03)00386-1\n10.1093/emboj/21.7.1743\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600386\n10.1093/cvr/cvq236\n10.1042/bj20101500\n10.1083/jcb.200403050\n10.1074/jbc.m109.011833\n10.1101/gad.276304\n10.1016/j.imbio.2012.05.026\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.07.042\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.03.016\n10.1002/jcp.22264\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.300504\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.09.026\n10.1016/j.bcp.2006.04.011\n10.1186/1475-2840-9-31\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.06.052\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.02.572\n10.1093/cvr/cvq285\n10.1161/atvbaha.108.168278\n10.1038/nm.2252\n10.1681/ASN.2008050513\n10.1038/nm1613\n10.1038/cddis.2013.558\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.04.007\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-3127\n10.1161/01.atv.18.5.677\n10.1152/ajpheart.00311.2013\n10.3171/2013.2.jns12968\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.04.061\n10.1152/ajpheart.00257.2015\n10.1039/c3ib40199e\n10.1152/ajpheart.00764.2012\n10.1083/jcb.201408103\n10.7554/elife.04645\n10.1016/j.cub.2013.04.049\n10.1002/jcb.24416\n10.1007/s12195-013-0276-9\n10.1096/fj.12-222299\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.10.108\n10.1073/pnas.0607224103\n10.1007/s004240000307\n10.1073/pnas.0407474101\n10.1042/bj20021228\n10.1016/S0898-6568(01)00190-5\n10.1038/nature03952\n10.1152/ajpcell.00117.2012\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.03.011\n10.1172/jci81067\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.116988\n10.4049/jimmunol.1400571\n10.1074/jbc.274.1.143\n10.1074/jbc.m110.103127\n10.1007/s11302-014-9442-3\n10.1172/jci24787\n10.1084/jem.20031132\n10.1161/01.res.0000159707.05637.a1\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.165811\n10.1182/blood-2005-08-3465\n10.1074/jbc.c500200200\n10.1161/01.atv.0000256466.65450.ce\n10.1182/blood-2002-01-0046\n10.1073/pnas.171259298\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.12.002\n10.1074/jbc.m700078200\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.06.124\n10.1038/sj.cr.7290271\n10.1007/s10456-015-9485-2\n10.1073/pnas.1232341100\n10.1073/pnas.1233635100\n10.1074/jbc.m412862200\n10.1074/jbc.m006323200\n10.1165/rcmb.2006-0043OC\n10.1161/circresaha.110.219592\n10.1152/ajpheart.00854.2003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0111409\n10.1152/ajpcell.00306.2005\n10.1128/mcb.24.10.4241-4254.2004\n10.2353/ajpath.2007.070226\n10.1097/ccm.0000000000001203\n10.1161/01.res.82.5.532\n10.1096/fj.02-1064com\n10.1189/jlb.0206087\n10.1161/01.res.82.10.1094\n10.1152/ajpheart.00515.2003\n10.1161/01.res.0000104087.29395.66\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.2898\n10.1074/jbc.m300703200\n10.1161/01.RES.0000145728.22878.45\n10.1002/bit.25291\n10.1016/j.lfs.2005.12.051\n10.1111/1440-1681.12412\n10.1152/ajpheart.00872.2012\n10.1161/atvbaha.109.194738\n10.1093/cvr/20.3.208\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.02.013\n10.1016/s0014-5793(03)00285-0\n10.1152/ajpcell.00314.2004\n10.1007/s10439-009-9826-7\n10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02628-1\n10.1038/ncb1137\n10.1038/sj.embor.7401157\n10.1042/0264-6021:3480241\n10.1160/th09-06-0403\n10.1073/pnas.0506041102\n10.1177/1535370215570191\n10.1152/ajplung.00336.2002\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.050431\n10.1083/jcb.200201105\n10.1073/pnas.1106954108\n10.1172/jci200319270\n10.1161/atvbaha.113.300647\n10.1152/ajpcell.00522.2003\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2005.04.023\n10.1152/ajprenal.00183.2002\n10.1093/jb/mvr121\n10.1002/jcb.24832\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.1.82\n10.1016/s0008-6363(03)00428-0\n10.1006/exmp.1999.2260\n10.1038/nrcardio.2010.102\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000143855.85343.0e\n10.1371/journal.pone.0129952\n10.1016/j.bpj.2014.12.023\n10.7150/ijms.5723\n10.2353/ajpath.2007.061196\n10.1161/hq1201.100229\n10.1016/s0008-6363(99)00169-8\n10.1146/annurev.pathol.2.010506.092033\n10.1136/hrt.51.4.407\n10.1152/ajplung.00428.2006\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.07.030\n10.1152/ajplung.00106.2009\n10.1038/onc.2012.127\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601213\n10.1242/jcs.028282\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2015.03.019\n10.1161/circulationaha.114.008750\n10.1161/01.cir.0000153798.78540.87\n10.1038/79226\n10.1016/s1359-6101(97)00036-1\n10.1183/09031936.00187310"}
{"title": "The gut microbiota: a puppet master in the pathogenesis of endometriosis?", "abstract": "Endometriosis is a frequent gynecologic disease with a complex, multifactorial cause. It is characterized by the cyclic estrogen-driven proliferation and bleeding of endometriotic lesions (ie, ectopic endometrial glands and stroma) outside the uterus. These lesions induce a chronic activation of the innate immune system within the peritoneal cavity that is associated with the release of various inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic growth factors into the peritoneal fluid. This stimulates angiogenesis and the further spread of the lesions and triggers the typical pain that is symptomatic of the disease. Moreover, circulating stem and progenitor cells are recruited into the ectopic endometrial tissue and contribute to its growth and vascularization. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have indicated that the gut microbiota is not only essential for a physiologic gastrointestinal function but acts as a central regulator of a variety of inflammatory and proliferative conditions. Besides, the gut flora affects estrogen metabolism and stem-cell homeostasis. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the gut microbiota may be involved crucially in the onset and progression of endometriosis. In the future, this novel view of the pathogenesis of endometriosis may be verified by analysis of the development of endometriotic lesions in animal models with a defined composition of the gut microbiota and by investigation of the microbiota of patients with endometriosis with modern next-generation sequencing tools. This could open the door for completely new preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches for endometriosis.", "journal": "American journal of obstetrics and gynecology", "date": "2016-02-24", "authors": ["Matthias WLaschke", "Michael DMenger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajog.2016.02.036"}
{"title": "Three Dimensional Collagen Scaffold Promotes Intrinsic Vascularisation for Tissue Engineering Applications.", "abstract": "Here, we describe a porous 3-dimensional collagen scaffold material that supports capillary formation in vitro, and promotes vascularization when implanted in vivo. Collagen scaffolds were synthesized from type I bovine collagen and have a uniform pore size of 80 \u03bcm. In vitro, scaffolds seeded with primary human microvascular endothelial cells suspended in human fibrin gel formed CD31 positive capillary-like structures with clear lumens. In vivo, after subcutaneous implantation in mice, cell-free collagen scaffolds were vascularized by host neovessels, whilst a gradual degradation of the scaffold material occurred over 8 weeks. Collagen scaffolds, impregnated with human fibrinogen gel, were implanted subcutaneously inside a chamber enclosing the femoral vessels in rats. Angiogenic sprouts from the femoral vessels invaded throughout the scaffolds and these degraded completely after 4 weeks. Vascular volume of the resulting constructs was greater than the vascular volume of constructs from chambers implanted with fibrinogen gel alone (42.7\u00b15.0 \u03bcL in collagen scaffold vs 22.5\u00b12.3 \u03bcL in fibrinogen gel alone; p<0.05, n = 7). In the same model, collagen scaffolds seeded with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) produced greater increases in vascular volume than did cell-free collagen scaffolds (42.9\u00b14.0 \u03bcL in collagen scaffold with human ASCs vs 25.7\u00b11.9 \u03bcL in collagen scaffold alone; p<0.05, n = 4). In summary, these collagen scaffolds are biocompatible and could be used to grow more robust vascularized tissue engineering grafts with improved the survival of implanted cells.

Reconstruction of the skull base is paramount to achieve an uncomplicated postoperative course. Repair of small dural defects can be reliably achieved using a multilayer grafting technique, which yields a high success rate (>90%). Repair of larger defects associated with a high-flow cerebrospinal fluid leak, or defects in previously irradiated fields, often requires a local or regional pedicled vascularized graft as the first reconstructive choice. When these are unavailable, free microvascular tissue transfer remains an option.", "journal": "Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery", "date": "2016-02-24", "authors": ["Ralph AbiHachem", "AhmadElkhatib", "AndreBeer-Furlan", "DanielPrevedello", "RicardoCarrau"], "doi": "10.1097/MOO.0000000000000233"}
{"title": "VEGF stimulates intramembranous bone formation during craniofacial skeletal development.", "abstract": "Deficiency of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) has been associated with severe craniofacial anomalies in both humans and mice. Cranial neural crest cell (NCC)-derived VEGF regulates proliferation, vascularization and ossification of cartilage and membranous bone. However, the function of VEGF derived from specific subpopulations of NCCs in controlling unique aspects of craniofacial morphogenesis is not clear. In this study a conditional knockdown strategy was used to genetically delete Vegfa expression in Osterix (Osx) and collagen II (Col2)-expressing NCC descendants. No major defects in calvaria and mandibular morphogenesis were observed upon knockdown of VEGF in the Col2(+) cell population. In contrast, loss of VEGF in Osx(+) osteoblast progenitor cells led to reduced ossification of calvarial and mandibular bones without affecting the formation of cartilage templates in newborn mice. The early stages of ossification in the developing jaw revealed decreased initial mineralization levels and a reduced thickness of the collagen I (Col1)-positive bone template upon loss of VEGF in Osx(+) precursors. Increased numbers of proliferating cells were detected within the jaw mesenchyme of mutant embryos. Explant culture assays revealed that mandibular osteogenesis occurred independently of paracrine VEGF action and vascular development. Reduced VEGF expression in mandibles coincided with increased phospho-Smad1/5 (P-Smad1/5) levels and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) expression in the jaw mesenchyme. We conclude that VEGF derived from Osx(+) osteoblast progenitor cells is required for optimal ossification of developing mandibular bones and modulates mechanisms controlling BMP-dependent specification and expansion of the jaw mesenchyme.", "journal": "Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology", "date": "2016-02-24", "authors": ["XuchenDuan", "Seth RBradbury", "Bjorn ROlsen", "Agnes DBerendsen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.matbio.2016.02.005"}

Patients treated for cSDH between 2009 and 2013 at our institution were included in this retrospective case-control study. Medical charts were reviewed retrospectively and data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Out of 203 patients (58 females, mean age 73.2years), 53 (26%) patients were on ACE inhibitors before their presentation with cSDH. Median initial hematoma volume in individuals with ACE inhibitors (179.2\u00b1standard error of the mean [SEM] 13.0ml) was significantly higher compared to patients without ACE inhibitors (140.4\u00b1SEM 6.2ml; p=0.007). There was an increased probability of surgical reintervention in the ACE inhibitor group (12/53, 23% versus 19/153, 12%; p=0.079), especially in patients older than 80years (6/23, 26% versus 3/45, 7%; p=0.026). ACE inhibitors are associated with higher hematoma volume in patients with cSDH and with a higher frequency of recurrences requiring surgery (especially in the very old).

Hemostatic agents were applied on the epidural region after laminectomy was performed until the identification of dura mater and nerve root. After a follow-up period of 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed, and histologic sections were performed proximal and distal to laminectomy zone. Groups were histopathologically compared in terms of chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and vascularization.\nThere was no difference between groups in terms of acute inflammation (P\u00a0= 0.159). Chronic inflammation was more remarkable in the herbal hemostatic group (P\u00a0= 0.036), and there was severe fibrosis in absorbable collagen hemostatic, fibrin sealant, and powder hemostatic agent groups (P < 0.001). Vascularity was more obvious in herbal hemostatic; fibrin sealant; absorbable collagen; fibrin sealant containing fibrinogen, factor XIII, and thrombin; hemostatic powder; and oxidized cellulose polymer groups (P < 0.001).\nHemostatic agents can cause notable histopathologic alterations, including inflammation, fibrosis, and vascularity.

{"title": "An Endochondral Ossification-Based Approach to Bone Repair: Chondrogenically Primed Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Laden Scaffolds Support Greater Repair of Critical-Sized Cranial Defects Than Osteogenically Stimulated Constructs In Vivo.", "abstract": "The lack of success associated with the use of bone grafts has motivated the development of tissue engineering approaches for bone defect repair. However, the traditional tissue engineering approach of direct osteogenesis, mimicking the process of intramembranous ossification (IMO), leads to poor vascularization. In this study, we speculate that mimicking an endochondral ossification (ECO) approach may offer a solution by harnessing the potential of hypertrophic chondrocytes to secrete angiogenic signals that support vasculogenesis and enhance bone repair. We hypothesized that stimulation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) chondrogenesis and subsequent hypertrophy within collagen-based scaffolds would lead to improved vascularization and bone formation when implanted within a critical-sized bone defect in vivo. To produce ECO-based constructs, two distinct scaffolds, collagen-hyaluronic acid (CHyA) and collagen-hydroxyapatite (CHA), with proven potential for cartilage and bone repair, respectively, were cultured with MSCs initially in the presence of chondrogenic factors and subsequently supplemented with hypertrophic factors. To produce IMO-based constructs, CHA scaffolds were cultured with MSCs in the presence of osteogenic factors. These constructs were subsequently implanted into 7\u2009mm calvarial defects on Fischer male rats for up to 8 weeks in vivo. The results demonstrated that IMO- and ECO-based constructs were capable of supporting enhanced bone repair compared to empty defects. However, it was clear that the scaffolds, which were previously shown to support the greatest cartilage formation in vitro (CHyA), led to the highest new bone formation (p\u2009<\u20090.05) within critical-sized bone defects 8 weeks postimplantation. We speculate this to be associated with the secretion of angiogenic signals as demonstrated by the higher VEGF protein production in the ECO-based constructs before implantation leading to the greater blood vessel ingrowth. This study thus demonstrates the ability of recapitulating a developmental process of bone formation to develop tissue-engineered constructs that manifest appreciable promise for bone defect repair.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Images obtained at different gaze angles were montaged and corrected for peripheral distortion using a stereographic projection method to provide a single image for grading of the peripheral edge of the visible vasculature. The border of the vascularized retina was expressed as a radial surface distance from the center of the optic disc. The vascularized area was calculated based on this mean peripheral border position for each quadrant.\nMean distance (mm) from the center of optic disc to the peripheral vascular border.\nIn normal eyes, the mean radial surface distance from the center of the optic disc to the peripheral edge of the visible vasculature was 20.3\u00b11.4 mm and the mean area of normal perfused retina was 977.0 mm(2).

Patients of both groups removed their elastic garments after 6 months and were re-examined 1 year later. All the 36 patients had detailed evaluation of the affected extremity including limb volume measurement, infection episodes and scale scoring of pain, feeling of heaviness and functional status both at baseline and 18 month. Limb volume reduction was observed in both groups; mean reduction was greater in group A (57 %) than in group B (18 %). Infection episodes in group A were significantly reduced compared to those in group B patients. All group A patients reported painless and feeling of heaviness-free extremities with overall functional improvement, while the corresponding changes in group B patients were no more than marginal. Moreover, the LNT procedure was estimated as cost effective compared to conservative treatment alone.

Thirty-two patients with diabetic foot ulcer were randomly divided into an insulin (n=18) and a control (n=14) group. In the diabetic foot ulcer wound, the insulin group were administered insulin and the control group were administered an equal volume of saline. Prior to injection and at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 h after injection, the fingertip blood glucose levels were determined. The growth of granulation tissue was assessed continuously for 12 days.

{"title": "Vasohibin-1 expression inhibits advancement of ovarian cancer producing various angiogenic factors.", "abstract": "Vasohibin-1 (VASH1) is a negative feedback regulator of angiogenesis, the first to be discovered, and was identified in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated vascular endothelial cells. Vasohibin-1 inhibits abnormal vascularization induced by various angiogenic factors including fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), in addition to VEGF. By focusing on this characteristic of VASH1, we investigated the antitumor effects of VASH1 expression on ovarian cancer cells that produce different angiogenic factors. By using a high VEGF-producing ovarian cancer cell line, SHIN-3, and a high PDGF-producing ovarian cancer cell line, KOC-2S, the cells were transfected with either a VEGF antagonist, soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1, or sFlt-1), or VASH1 genes to establish their respective cellular expression. The characteristics of these transfectants were compared with controls. We previously reported that the expression of sFlt-1 inhibited tumor vascularization and growth of high VEGF-producing ovarian cancer cells, reduced peritoneal dissemination and ascites development, and prolonged the survival time of the host. However, in the current study, the expression of sFlt-1 had no such effect on the high PDGF-producing ovarian cancer cells used here, whereas VASH1 expression inhibited tumor vascularization and growth, not only in high VEGF-producing cells, but also in high PDGF-producing cells, reduced their peritoneal dissemination and ascites, and prolonged the survival time of the host.

Endoscopic endonasal transclival and transodontoid approaches are routinely performed in leading skull base centers. Usually, these approaches involve a posterior bony and mucosal septectomy, which may compromise the vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap (PNSF), a robust reconstructive option for repair of large skull base defects. With the possibility of an intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak and the reported success of the PNSF for repair of these defects, preserving the integrity of the PNSF is beneficial during the endoscopic endonasal approach to the CCJ. We describe three new variations/refinements of the endoscopic endonasal approach to the CCJ that preserve the mucosal integrity of the posterior nasal septum and PNSF.\nPhoto and video documentation of cadaveric dissections.\nThe steps required for the different variations in approaching the CCJ are demonstrated. These three options are: 1) nonopposing Killian incisions with submucosal elevation of PNSFs laterally under the inferior turbinates (the PNSFs are retracted laterally and left attached superiorly onto the nasal septum and laterally under the inferior turbinate); 2) bilateral non-opposing PNSFs tucked beneath their respective middle turbinate or into the sphenoid sinus; and 3) a hybrid approach combining option 1 performed on one side and option 2 on the contralateral side. All three options allowed for a mucosal-sparing septectomy to provide ample access to the CCJ.\nThese variations/refinements of the mucosal-sparing approach to the CCJ allowed adequate surgical access with sufficient maneuverability while preserving both PNSFs.\nNA.

Ideally, the nasal deformity is treated from childhood. This approach leads to the need for several surgeries and revisions until full growth is reached. As a result of multiples procedures, the skin over the nasal dorsum sometimes becomes thin, atrophic and could be strongly attached to underlying grafts. For this setting of patients when another rhinoplasty is required, it becomes a technical challenge. The authors describe their experience in complex secondary rhinoplasty performed in patients with thin atrophic skin using the anteriorly based galeo-pericranial frontalis flap (GPFF) to improve the quality of the covering soft tissue along the whole nose skeleton area.\nSince 2013, 3 female patients; 2 of them with Binder syndrome and 1 cleft lip/palate patient (average 18 years) with previous rhinoplasty (3-6 procedures) are subjected to secondary rhinoplasty using GPFF turning it over the osteochondral nasal framework. Postoperative follow-up was 3 to 18 months. There were no viability complications of the dorsum skin flap in the immediate postoperative period. At long-term follow-up, a visible improvement of local skin conditions and restoration of the nasal contour was achieved.\nThe anteriorly based GPFF is a well-vascularized versatile flap used extensively in anterior cranial fossa surgery and frontal sinus trauma.

Endothelial cell medium is typically supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as hydrocortisone (HC). The effect of EGF on adipocytes is discussed controversially. Some studies say it inhibits adipocyte differentiation while others reported of improved adipocyte lipogenesis. HC is known to have lipolytic activities, which might result in mature adipocyte dedifferentiation. In this study, we evaluated the influence of EGF and HC on the co-culture of endothelial cells and mature adipocytes regarding their cell morphology and functionality. We showed in mono-culture that high levels of HC promoted dedifferentiation and proliferation of mature adipocytes, whereas EGF seemed to have no negative influence. Endothelial cells kept their typical cobblestone morphology and showed a proliferation rate comparable to the control independent of EGF and HC concentration. In co-culture, HC promoted dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes, which was shown by a higher glycerol release. EGF had no negative impact on adipocyte morphology. No negative impact on endothelial cell morphology and functionality could be seen with reduced EGF and HC supplementation in co-culture with mature adipocytes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that reduced levels of HC are needed for co-culturing mature adipocytes and endothelial cells. In co-culture, EGF had no influence on mature adipocytes. Therefore, for the composition of vascularized adipose tissue constructs, the media with low levels of HC and high or low levels of EGF can be used.", "journal": "Cell biology international", "date": "2016-02-19", "authors": ["BirgitHuber", "Alina MariaCzaja", "Petra JulianeKluger"], "doi": "10.1002/cbin.10595"}

The rats were divided into an MTR group that ran on a treadmill for 4 weeks and a control group that remained in cages. After MTR, a window defect was created in the patellar tendons of all rats and wound healing was analyzed. We found that MTR accelerated wound healing by promoting quicker closure of wounds, improving the organization of collagen fibers, and decreasing senescent cells in the wounded tendons when compared to the cage control. MTR also lowered vascularization, increased the numbers of tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSCs) and TSC proliferation than the control. Besides, MTR significantly increased the expression of stem cell markers, OCT-4 and Nanog, and tenocyte genes, Collagen I, Collagen III and tenomodulin, and down-regulated PPAR-\u03b3, Collagen II and Runx-2 (non-tenocyte genes).

Endowed with diverse mediators, resident MC represent first-line fine-tuners of local microenvironment. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) functions as a pluripotent signaling sphingolipid metabolite in health and disease. S1P formation occurs at low levels in resting MC and is upregulated upon activation. Its export can result in type 2 S1P receptor- (S1PR2-) mediated stimulation of MC, further fueling inflammation. However, the role of S1PR2 ligation in proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor- (VEGF-) A and matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 2 release from MC is unknown. Using a preclinical MC-dependent model of acute allergic responses and in vitro stimulated primary mouse bone marrow-derived MC (BMMC) or human primary skin MC, we report that S1P signaling resulted in substantial amount of VEGF-A release. Similar experiments using S1pr2-deficient mice or BMMC or selective S1P receptor agonists or antagonists demonstrated that S1P/S1PR2 ligation on MC is important for VEGF-A secretion. Further, we show that S1P stimulation triggered transcriptional upregulation of VEGF-A and MMP-2 mRNA in human but not in mouse MC. S1P exposure also triggered MMP-2 secretion from human MC.

The cellular responses of HUVECs on TiO2 nanofibrous surfaces were studied through cell adhesion, cell proliferation, capillary-like tube formation, growth factors secretion (VEGF and BFGF), and angiogenic-endogenic-associated gene (VEGF, VEGFR2, BFGF, PGF, HGF, Ang-1, VWF, PECAM-1 and ENOS) expression analysis after 2 weeks of cell seeding.

We have previously shown that in rejected corneal allografts regulatory T cells (Treg) demonstrate diminished Foxp3 expression and immunoregulatory function. Treatment with low doses of IL-2 selectively expands Treg and has been proposed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of low-dose IL-2 administration on Treg function and corneal allograft survival.\nAllogeneic corneal transplantation was performed on inflamed host beds. Low-dose systemic IL-2 was administered starting 3 days before grafting until 6 weeks after transplantation. Frequencies of Treg and their immunosuppressive function and antigen specificity were assessed using flow cytometry, in vitro proliferation assays, and adoptive transfer experiments. Frequencies of effector T cells (Teff) and graft infiltrating immune cells were measured at 2 weeks posttransplantation. Long-term allograft survival was evaluated for up to 9 weeks using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.\nTreatment with low-dose IL-2 significantly increased frequencies of CD4CD25Foxp3 Treg and their immunosuppressive function. It also suppressed alloimmune response as shown by the decreased CD4 IFN\u03b3 T cell frequencies and graft infiltration of CD45 and CD4 cells. Clinical evaluation of the grafts showed significant improvement in long-term corneal allograft survival in the IL-2 treated group compared with controls.\nOur study is the first to report that treatment with low-dose IL-2 increases survival of corneal allografts.

Etirinotecan pegol pharmacology is reviewed in this paper along with safety and efficacy data from preclinical and clinical trials. In the phase II advanced breast cancer setting, etirinotecan pegol provided promising activity, which was maintained in poor prognostic subgroups, with low rates of neutropenia and neuropathy - issues plaguing our currently available agents.\nEtirinotecan pegol demonstrates anti-tumor activity and improved tolerability in patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer. As a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor in breast cancer, etirinotecan pegol holds great therapeutic potential, allowing the challenge of resistance in the advanced disease setting to be addressed.", "journal": "Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy", "date": "2016-02-18", "authors": ["ElenaL\u00f3pez-Miranda", "JavierCort\u00e9s"], "doi": "10.1517/14656566.2016.1154537"}
{"title": "Cellular Model of Atherogenesis Based on Pluripotent Vascular Wall Pericytes.", "abstract": "Pericytes are pluripotent cells that can be found in the vascular wall of both microvessels and large arteries and veins. They have distinct morphology with long branching processes and form numerous contacts with each other and with endothelial cells, organizing the vascular wall cells into a three-dimensional network. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that pericytes may play a key role in the pathogenesis of vascular disorders, including atherosclerosis. Macrovascular pericytes are able to accumulate lipids and contribute to growth and vascularization of the atherosclerotic plaque. Moreover, they participate in the local inflammatory process and thrombosis, which can lead to fatal consequences. At the same time, pericytes can represent a useful model for studying the atherosclerotic process and for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. In particular, they are suitable for testing various substances' potential for decreasing lipid accumulation induced by the incubation of cells with atherogenic low-density lipoprotein. In this review we will discuss the application of cellular models for studying atherosclerosis and provide several examples of successful application of these models to drug research.", "journal": "Stem cells international", "date": "2016-02-18", "authors": ["Ekaterina AIvanova", "Alexander NOrekhov"], "doi": "10.1155/2016/7321404\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.07.001\n10.1007/978-1-60761-938-3_2\n10.1007/s12307-012-0106-y\n10.1634/stemcells.2004-0166\n10.1161/circulationaha.109.899252\n10.1093/cvr/cvu168\n10.1152/ajpheart.00343.2009\n10.1016/j.biocel.2012.06.031\n10.1056/nejm199901143400207\n10.1161/atvbaha.111.243212\n10.1093/cvr/cvs135\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.03.258\n10.1002/jnr.490390410\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2005.10.021\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2012.01617.x\n10.1002/biot.201200199\n10.1161/01.RES.0000182903.16652.d7\n10.1007/s12015-015-9590-z\n10.1111/j.1549-8719.2010.00038.x\n10.1007/s00395-015-0491-8\n10.1172/JCI116391\n10.1016/0040-8166(92)90040-e\n10.1084/jem.167.3.1003\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2015.04.003\n10.1016/s0040-8166(05)80069-2\n10.1161/circresaha.107.156372\n10.1161/01.cir.0000144457.55518.e5\n10.4093/dmj.2014.38.1.32\n10.4093/dmj.2015.39.2.87\n10.1083/jcb.201412052\n10.2174/1381612811319330011\n10.1016/0021-9150(88)90087-1\n10.1055/s-0035-1549089\n10.1017/S0954422410000338\n10.1016/s0021-9150(99)00060-x\n10.1016/j.immuni.2013.06.009\n10.1038/ni.2001\n10.1016/j.trsl.2015.06.012\n10.1055/s-0034-1384624\n10.2174/138955712798995020\n10.3109/07853899709113696\n10.1016/s1567-5688(08)70689-5\n10.1016/j.jacl.2008.08.059"}
{"title": "Glioblastoma Stem Cells Microenvironment: The Paracrine Roles of the Niche in Drug and Radioresistance.", "abstract": "Among all solid tumors, the high-grade glioma appears to be the most vascularized one. In fact, \"microvascular hyperplasia\" is a hallmark of GBM. An altered vascular network determines irregular blood flow, so that tumor cells spread rapidly beyond the diffusion distance of oxygen in the tissue, with the consequent formation of hypoxic or anoxic areas, where the bulk of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) reside. The response to this event is the induction of angiogenesis, a process mediated by hypoxia inducible factors. However, this new capillary network is not efficient in maintaining a proper oxygen supply to the tumor mass, thereby causing an oxygen gradient within the neoplastic zone. This microenvironment helps GSCs to remain in a \"quiescent\" state preserving their potential to proliferate and differentiate, thus protecting them by the effects of chemo- and radiotherapy. Recent evidences suggest that responses of glioblastoma to standard therapies are determined by the microenvironment of the niche, where the GSCs reside, allowing a variety of mechanisms that contribute to the chemo- and radioresistance, by preserving GSCs. It is, therefore, crucial to investigate the components/factors of the niche in order to formulate new adjuvant therapies rendering more efficiently the gold standard therapies for this neoplasm.",

Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) injection represents a valid alternative therapy to enhance trophism and tone of dystrophic tissues. We evaluated efficacy of ADSCs-based therapy in the dystrophic areas. From February to April 2013 we enrolled 8 patients with vulvar dystrophy. A biopsy specimen was performed before and after treatment. Digital photographs were taken at baseline and during the follow-up. Pain was detected with Visual Analogue Scale and sexual function was evaluated with Female Sexual Function Index. All patients received 2 treatments in 3 months. Follow-up was at 1 week , 1 and 3 months, and 1 and 2 years. We obtained a significant vulvar trophism enhancement in all patients, who reported pain reduction and sexual function improvement. Objective exam with speculum was easy to perform after treatment.

{"title": "An on-chip microfluidic pressure regulator that facilitates reproducible loading of cells and hydrogels into microphysiological system platforms.", "abstract": "Coculturing multiple cell types together in 3-dimensional (3D) cultures better mimics the in vivo microphysiological environment, and has become widely adopted in recent years with the development of organ-on-chip systems. However, a bottleneck in set-up of these devices arises as a result of the delivery of the gel into the microfluidic chip being sensitive to pressure fluctuations, making gel confinement at a specific region challenging, especially when manual operation is performed. In this paper, we present a novel design of an on-chip regulator module with pressure-releasing safety microvalves that can facilitate stable gel delivery into designated microchannel regions while maintaining well-controlled, non-bursting gel interfaces. This pressure regulator design can be integrated into different microfluidic chip designs and is compatible with a wide variety of gel injection apparatuses operated automatically or manually at different flow rates. The sensitivity and working range of this pressure regulator can be adjusted by changing the width of its pressure releasing safety microvalve design. The effectiveness of the design is validated by its incorporation into a microfluidic platform we have developed for generating 3D vascularized micro-organs (VMOs). Reproducible gel loading is demonstrated for both an automatic syringe pump and a manually-operated micropipettor. This design allows for rapid and reproducible loading of hydrogels into microfluidic devices without the risk of bursting gel-air interfaces.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2016-02-18", "authors": ["XiaolinWang", "Duc T TPhan", "DaZhao", "Steven CGeorge", "Christopher C WHughes", "Abraham PLee"], "doi": "10.1039/c5lc01563d"}
{"title": "Establishment of a rat model: Associating liver partition with portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy.", "abstract": "We adapted the anatomically oriented parenchyma-preserving resection technique for associating liver partition with portal vein ligation (PVL) for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) in rats and examined the role of revascularization in intrahepatic size regulation.\nWe performed the procedures based on anatomic study. The ALPPS procedure consisted of a 70% PVL (occluding the left median, left lateral, and right lobes), parenchymal transection (median lobe) and partial (10%) hepatectomy (PHx; caudate lobe). The transection effect was evaluated by measuring the extent of hepatic atrophy or regeneration of individual liver lobes in the ALPPS and control groups (70% PVL and 10% PHx without transection). The survival rates after stage II resection and collateral formation within the portal vein system was examined.\nAnatomic study revealed a close spatial relationship between the demarcation line and the middle median hepatic vein. This enabled placing the transection plane without injuring the hepatic vein. Transection was achieved via stepwise clamping, followed by 2-3 parenchyma-preserving piercing sutures on both sides of the clamp. Ligated liver lobes atrophy was significantly enhanced after ALPPS compared with the control group. In contrast, both a significantly greater relative weight of the regenerated lobe and proliferation index on the first postoperative day were observed. All animals tolerated stage II-resection without complications.

We present an integrated tissue-organ printer (ITOP) that can fabricate stable, human-scale tissue constructs of any shape. Mechanical stability is achieved by printing cell-laden hydrogels together with biodegradable polymers in integrated patterns and anchored on sacrificial hydrogels. The correct shape of the tissue construct is achieved by representing clinical imaging data as a computer model of the anatomical defect and translating the model into a program that controls the motions of the printer nozzles, which dispense cells to discrete locations. The incorporation of microchannels into the tissue constructs facilitates diffusion of nutrients to printed cells, thereby overcoming the diffusion limit of 100-200 \u03bcm for cell survival in engineered tissues.

Our DSAF had a dominant vascular pedicle, microcirculatory vascularity, and a sensory nerve network and retained three-dimensional (3D) nanofibrous structures well. DSAF, which was composed of collagen and laminin with well-preserved growth factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor), was successfully repopulated with human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which integrated with DSAF and formed 3D aggregates and vessel-like structures in vitro. We used microsurgery techniques to re-anastomose the recellularized DSAF into nude rats. In vivo, the engineered flap construct underwent neovascularization and constructive remodeling, which was characterized by the predominant infiltration of M2 macrophages and significant adipose tissue formation at 3months postoperatively. Our results indicate that DSAF co-cultured with hASCs and HUVECs is a promising platform for vascularized soft tissue flap engineering. This platform is not limited by the flap size, as the entire construct can be immediately perfused by the recellularized vascular network following simple re-integration into the host using conventional microsurgical techniques.\nSignificant soft tissue loss resulting from traumatic injury or tumor resection often requires surgical reconstruction using autologous soft tissue flaps. However, the limited availability of qualitative autologous flaps as well as the donor site morbidity significantly limits this approach. Engineered soft tissue flap grafts may offer a clinically relevant alternative to the autologous flap tissue. In this study, we engineered vascularized soft tissue free flap by using skin/adipose flap extracellular matrix scaffold (DSAF) in combination with multiple types of human cells. Following vascular reanastomosis in the recipient site, the engineered products successful regenerated large-scale fat tissue in vivo.

We report a case that was masked by prior facial trauma and associated with pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Disease progression and aggressive debridements led to severe facial tissue loss. The decision to perform a face transplant was controversial because of the risk of disease relapse on the facial allograft. We reviewed renal transplant outcomes in GPA for possible relevance. A PubMed search retrieved 29 studies. Patient and graft survival, relapse, morbidity, mortality, rejection and immunosuppression were assessed. Ten-year patient survival and graft survival were 84.4% and 72.6%, respectively. GPA relapse occurred in 31.5%, and upper airway/ocular relapse occurred in 17.8% (resolved in 76.9%). Mortality was 12.3%. Acute and chronic rejection rates were 14.9% and 6.8%, respectively. Traditional posttransplant immunosuppression was effective. Our review suggests that GPA renal transplant outcomes are comparable to general renal transplant cohorts. Furthermore, transplanted GPA patients exhibit lower disease relapse secondary to lifelong immunosuppression. This supported our decision to perform a face transplant in this patient, which has been successful up to the present time (1-year posttransplantation).

This can result in protracted hospital stays, additional procedures, delayed postoperative recovery, and increased cost of care. Removal of large middle fossa-infratemporal fossa tumors are particularly problematic as they result in a large dead space with gravity-facilitated CSF leakage into the cavity. In this report we describe the use of a novel technique, the \"inverted gull wing\" titanium mesh reconstruction.\nAttempts to address this problem have focused primarily on closure and the use of myocutaneous flaps. Patients who have had multiple prior treatments are often afflicted with significant tissue attenuation that preclude dural closure or the use of local flaps. Although vascularized free flaps are an effective option in this scenario, they can add significant operative time and often yield suboptimal cosmetic results. We describe the use of the inverted gull wing titanium mesh reconstruction in the closure of 2 patients who underwent complex transzygomatic infratemporal fossa approaches for tumor with dural and sinonasal transgression.\nPostoperatively, there were no pseudomeningoceles, CSF leaks, or technique-related morbidities.\nThe inverted gull wing technique represents a simple, fast, and effective closure for complex transzygomatic infratemporal fossa approaches.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2016-02-16", "authors": ["Ricky HWong", "SivieroAgazzi", "Harryvan Loveren"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2016.02.025"}

{"title": "Healthy human second-trimester fetal skin is deficient in leukocytes and associated homing chemokines.", "abstract": "The lack of immune cells in mid-gestational fetal skin is often mentioned as a key factor underlying scarless healing. However, the scarless healing ability is conserved until long after the immune system in the fetus is fully developed. Therefore, we studied human second-trimester fetal skin and compared the numbers of immune cells and chemokine levels from fetal skin with adult skin. By using immunohistochemistry, we show that healthy fetal skin contains significant lower numbers of CD68(+) -macrophages, Tryptase(+) -mast cells, Langerin(+) -Langerhans cells, CD1a(+) -dendritic cells, and CD3(+) -T cells compared to adult skin. Staining with an early lineage leukocyte marker, i.e., CD45, verified that the number of CD45(+) -immune cells was indeed significantly lower in fetal skin but that sufficient numbers of immune cells were present in the fetal lymph node. No differences in the vascular network were observed between fetal and adult skin. Moreover, significant lower levels of lymphocyte chemokines CCL17, CCL21, and CCL27 were observed in fetal skin. However, levels of inflammatory interleukins such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were undetectable and levels of CCL2 were similar in healthy fetal and adult skin. In conclusion, this study shows that second-trimester fetal skin contains low levels of immune cells and leukocyte chemokines compared to adult skin. This immune cell deficiency includes CD45(+) leukocytes, despite the abundant presence of these cells in the lymph node. The immune deficiency in healthy second-trimester fetal skin may result in reduced inflammation during wound healing, and could underlie the scarless healing capacities of the fetal skin.", "journal": "Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society", "date": "2016-02-14", "authors": ["Mari\u00eblleWalraven", "WendyTalhout", "Robert H JBeelen", "Marjoleinvan Egmond", "Magda M WUlrich"], "doi": "10.1111/wrr.12421"}

{"title": "Ultrasound diagnosis and management of acquired uterine enhanced myometrial vascularity/arteriovenous malformations.", "abstract": "Arteriovenous malformation is a short circuit between an organ's arterial and venous circulation. Arteriovenous malformations are classified as congenital and acquired. In the uterus, they may appear after curettage, cesarean delivery, and myomectomy among others. Their clinical feature is usually vaginal bleeding, which may be severe, if curettage is performed in unrecognized cases. Sonographically on 2-dimensional grayscale ultrasound scanning, the pathologic evidence appears as irregular, anechoic, tortuous, tubular structures that show evidence of increased vascularity when color Doppler is applied. Most of the time they resolve spontaneously; however, if left untreated, they may\u00a0require involved treatments such as uterine artery embolization or hysterectomy. In the past, uterine artery angiography was the gold standard for the diagnosis; however, ultrasound scanning has diagnosed successfully and helped in the clinical management. Recently, arteriovenous malformations have been referred to as enhanced myometrial vascularities.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of transvaginal ultrasound scanning in the diagnosis and treatment of acquired enhanced myometrial vascularity/arteriovenous malformations to outline the natural history of conservatively followed vs treated lesions.\nThis was a retrospective study to assess the presentation, treatment, and clinical pictures of patients with uterine Enhanced myometrial vascularity/arteriovenous malformations that were diagnosed with transvaginal ultrasound scanning. We reviewed both (1) ultrasound data (images, measured dimensions, and Doppler blood flow that were defined by its peak systolic velocity and (2) clinical data (age, reproductive status, clinical presentation, inciting event or procedure, surgical history, clinical course, time intervals that included detection to resolution or detection to treatment, and treatment rendered). The diagnostic criteria were \"subjective\" with a rich vascular network in the myometrium with the use of color Doppler images and \"objective\" with a high peak systolic velocity of \u226520 cm/sec in the vascular web. Statistical analysis was performed and coded with statistical software where necessary.\nTwenty-seven patients met the diagnostic criteria of uterine enhanced myometrial vascularity/arteriovenous malformation. Mean age was 31.8 years (range, 18-42 years). Clinical diagnoses of the patients included 10 incomplete abortions, 6 missed abortions, 5 spontaneous complete abortions, 5 cesarean scar pregnancies, and 1 molar pregnancy. Eighty-nine percent of patients had bleeding (n\u00a0= 24/27), although 1\u00a0patient was febrile, and 2 patients were asymptomatic. Recent surgical procedures were performed in 55.5% patients (15/27) that included curettage (n\u00a0= 10), cesarean deliveries (n\u00a0= 5), or both (n\u00a0= 1); 4 patients had a remote history of uterine surgery that included myomectomy. Treatment was varied and included expectant treatment alone in 48% of the patients with serial ultrasound scans and serum human chorionic gonadotropin until resolution (n\u00a0= 13/27 patients), uterine artery embolization (29.6%; 8/27 patients), methotrexate administration (22.2%; 6/27 patients), hysterectomy (7.4%; 2/27 patients), and curettage (3.7%; 1/27 patients). Three patients required a blood transfusion. Of the 9 patients whose condition required embolization, the conditions of 7 patients resolved after the procedure although 1 patient's condition required operative hysteroscopy and 1 patient's condition required hysterectomy for intractable bleeding. Average peak systolic velocity after embolization in the 9 patients was 85.2 cm/sec (range, 35-170 cm/sec); the average peak systolic velocity of the 16 patients with spontaneous resolution was 58.5 cm/sec (range, 23-90 cm/sec).\nAcquired enhanced myometrial vascularity/arteriovenous malformations occurred after unsuccessful pregnancies or treatment procedures that included uterine curettage, cesarean delivery, or cesarean scar pregnancy. Triage of patients for expectant treatment vs intervention with uterine artery embolization based on their clinical status, which was supplemented by objective measurements of blood velocity measurement in the arteriovenous malformation, appears to be a good predictor of outcome.

In an effort to overcome this limitation, we present an efficient and reproducible method to form human composite islets (CIs) with proangiogenic cell types in a controlled manner using nonadherent agarose microwell templates. In this study, we assessed the three-dimensional structure, function, and angiogenic potential of human CIs with human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs), with or without human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and preconditioned hMSCs (PC-hMSCs) in EGM-2 under shear stress. Distinct cellular rearrangements could be observed in CIs, but islet functionality was maintained. In vitro angiogenesis assays found significantly enhanced sprout formation in case of CIs. In particular, the number of sprouts emanating from CIs with PC-hMSCs was significantly increased compared to other conditions. Subsequent in vivo assessment confirmed the proangiogenic potential of CIs. However, in contrast to our in vitro angiogenesis assays, CIs with hMSCs and HUVECs exhibited a higher in vivo angiogenic potential compared to control islets or islets combined with hMSCs or PC-hMSCs. These findings highlight the importance and necessity of verifying in vitro studies with in vivo models to reliably predict, in this case, revascularization outcomes.

Modifying inorganic SCPP scaffolds with biological macromolecules could obviously improve its bioactivity and eliminate its palpable brittleness. However, it was hard to execute directly due to extremely bad interfacial compatibility between them. In this research, dopamine (DOPA) was introduced onto strontium-doped calcium polyphosphate (SCPP) scaffolds, subsequently the preliminary material was successfully further modified by silk fibroin (SF). SCPP/D/SF possessed suitable biomechanical properties, ability to stimulate angiogenic factor secretion and excellent biocompatibility. Biomechanical examination demonstrated that SCPP/D/SF scaffolds yielded better compressive strength because of improved interfacial compatibility. MTT assay and CLSM observation showed that SCPP/D/SF scaffolds had good cytocompatibility and presented better inducing-cell-migration potential than pure SCPP scaffolds. Meanwhile, its ability to stimulate angiogenic factor secretion was measured through the ELISA assay and immunohistological analysis in vitro and in vivo respectively. The results revealed, superior to SCPP, SCPP/D/SF could effectively promote VEGF and bFGF expression, possibly leading to enhancing angiogenesis and osteogenesis.

They serve as microvascular stabilizers, are potential regulators of microvascular blood flow and have a central role in angiogenesis, as they for example regulate endothelial cell proliferation. Furthermore, pericytes, as part of the neurovascular unit, are a major component of the blood-retina/brain barrier. CNS pericytes are a heterogenic cell population derived from mesodermal and neuro-ectodermal germ layers acting as modulators of stromal and niche environmental properties. In addition, they display multipotent differentiation potential making them an intriguing target for regenerative therapies. Pericyte-deficiencies can be cause or consequence of many kinds of diseases. In diabetes, for instance, pericyte-loss is a severe pathological process in diabetic retinopathy (DR) with detrimental consequences for eye sight in millions of patients. In this review, we provide an overview of our current understanding of CNS pericyte origin and function, with a special focus on the retina in the healthy and diseased. Finally, we highlight the role of pericytes in de- and regenerative processes.", "journal": "Frontiers in cellular neuroscience", "date": "2016-02-13", "authors": ["AndreaTrost", "SimonaLange", "FalkSchroedl", "DanielaBruckner", "Karolina AMotloch", "BarbaraBogner", "AlexandraKaser-Eichberger", "ClemensStrohmaier", "ChristianRunge", "LudwigAigner", "Francisco JRivera", "Herbert AReitsamer"], "doi": "10.3389/fncel.2016.00020\n10.1167/iovs.12-11481\n10.1038/jcbfm.2012.109\n10.1007/s00417-004-1092-7\n10.1161/01.RES.0000182903.16652.d7\n10.1016/j.devcel.2011.07.001\n10.1038/nature09522\n10.10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306146\n10.1023/A:1011965307612\n10.1167/iovs.10-6293\n10.2353/ajpath.2008.071070\n10.2337/db08-0537\n10.1016/j.neuron.2010.09.043\n10.2174/09298673113209990022\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2004.03.005\n10.1186/scrt512\n10.1016/j.scr.2012.09.003\n10.1096/fj.05-4944fje\n10.1523/jneurosci.3281-07.2007\n10.1002/jcp.21200\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.08.008\n10.1002/stem.1285\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1156-14.2014\n10.1111/nan.12188\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04967.x\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.07.003\n10.1038/nature09513\n10.1016/s0960-9822(07)00562-3\n10.1038/ncb1542\n10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.5.828\n10.1007/978-1-60761-938-3_2\n10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600272\n10.1179/016164111x12881719352372\n10.1111/j.1440-1789.2011.01290.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0042488\n10.1093/emboj/cdf418\n10.1007/s004010000195\n10.1161/01.cir.0000144457.55518.e5\n10.1073/pnas.1011321108\n10.1038/jcbfm.2012.187\n10.1002/glia.10191\n10.4049/jimmunol.180.5.3183\n10.1056/NEJMra021678\n10.1167/iovs.05-0691\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.09.013\n10.1007/s00441-003-0745-x\n10.1002/ana.24512\n10.1126/science.1203165\n10.1016/j.survophthal.2007.08.005\n10.3109/01913123.2011.620220\n10.1038/nature13165\n10.1038/jcbfm.2015.44\n10.3389/fnene.2010.00005\n10.2337/db10-0454\n10.2337/diabetes.51.10.3107\n10.2337/diabetes.53.4.1104\n10.1016/j.ajo.2004.02.073\n10.1083/jcb.153.3.543\n10.1016/j.neuron.2015.06.001\n10.1124/jpet.108.146381\n10.1167/iovs.10-5768\n10.2353/ajpath.2010.090517\n10.1167/iovs.12-11125\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.07.007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.251546\n10.1113/jphysiol.2003.047977\n10.1002/jnr.21884\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2013.02.001\n10.1002/cne.1423\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1971-14.2014\n10.1016/0165-5728(95)00024-v\n10.1046/j.1471-4159.1994.62062375.x\n10.1155/2013/106594\n10.1189/jlb.0506309\n10.1016/j.drudis.2012.12.007\n10.1101/gad.8.16.1875\n10.1126/science.277.5323.242\n10.1101/gad.266803\n10.1016/j.neulet.2015.04.047\n10.1049/iet-nbt:20060019\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2015.03.001\n10.1007/s00417-006-0307-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0065691\n10.1371/journal.pone.0045469\n10.1097/00004647-200304000-00007\n10.4049/jimmunol.180.8.5344\n10.1002/stem.1977\n10.1007/bf00645048\n10.1083/jcb.113.1.147\n10.1016/j.arcmed.2014.11.013\n10.3109/08977198908998003\n10.1186/2001-1326-1-30\n10.1167/iovs.05-0309\n10.1002/dvdy.1200\n10.2337/db13-1942\n10.1002/ajmg.a.30221\n10.1371/journal.pone.0035577\n10.1038/nature05193\n10.2337/db08-0325\n10.1007/s00424-013-1272-6\n10.1155/2011/693426\n10.1007/s00592-015-0752-x\n10.1182/blood-2004-01-0336\n10.1016/s0006-8993(02)03218-3\n10.1016/s0039-6257(00)00206-x\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2006.03.030\n10.1038/ncomms3932\n10.1167/iovs.13-12581\n10.1006/mvre.1998.2086\n10.1111/bpa.12004\n10.1016/s0002-9440(10)64612-3\n10.1002/dvg.22003\n10.1038/ncb1288\n10.1101/gad.8.16.1888\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0000052\n10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999<::aid-dvdy1089>3.3.co;2-o\n10.1016/j.exer.2015.05.010\n10.1167/iovs.13-12946\n10.1111/j.1549-8719.2010.00045.x\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06368.x\n10.1016/s0165-3806(02)00581-3\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.10.019\n10.1186/1750-1326-5-32\n10.1038/nn.2946\n10.1111/bpa.12152\n10.1007/s00401-012-1039-8\n10.1016/j.exer.2011.12.003\n10.1016/j.exer.2014.03.005\n10.1152/ajpheart.01007.2002\n10.1038/nm.2022\n10.1161/01.res.0000110419.50982.1c\n10.1007/978-3-642-92456-9\n10.1016/j.neuron.2008.01.003"}
{"title": "Cancer drug troglitazone stimulates the growth and response of renal cells to hypoxia inducible factors.", "abstract": "Troglitazone has been used to suppress the growth of a number of tumors through apoptosis and autophagy. However, previous in\u00a0vitro studies have employed very high concentrations of troglitazone (\u226510(-5)\u00a0M) in order to elicit growth inhibitory effects. In this report, when employing lower concentrations of troglitazone in defined medium, troglitazone was observed to stimulate the growth of primary renal proximal tubule (RPT) cells. Rosiglitazone, like troglitazone, is a thiazolidinedione (TZD) that is known to activate Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor \u03a5 (PPAR\u03a5). Notably, rosiglitazone also stimulates RPT cell growth, as does \u03a5-linolenic acids, another PPAR\u03a5 agonist. The PPAR\u03a5 antagonist GW9662 inhibited the growth stimulatory effect of troglitazone. In addition, troglitazone stimulated transcription by a PPAR Response Element/Luciferase construct. These results are consistent with the involvement of PPAR\u03a5 as a mediator of the growth stimulatory effect of troglitazone. In a number of tumor cells, the expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is increased, promoting the expression of HIF inducible genes, and vascularization. Troglitazone was observed to stimulate transcription by a HIF/luciferase construct. These observations indicate that troglitazone not only promotes growth, also the survival of RPT cells under conditions of hypoxia.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2016-02-13", "authors": ["MaryTaub"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.02.018"}

Use of a vascularized adipose flap to secure the anteriorly transposed ulnar nerve can help reduce nerve adherence and may enhance nerve recovery. In the study reported here, we retrospectively reviewed the long-term outcomes of ulnar nerve anterior subcutaneous transposition secured with either an adipose flap (16 patients) or a fascial sling (17 patients). The 33 patients underwent physical examinations and completed the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) questionnaire, visual analog scales (VASs), and the Modified Bishop Rating Scale (MBRS). There were no significant differences in DASH (P = .673), VAS pain (P = .413), or VAS weakness (P = .362) scores between the adipose flap and fascial sling groups. Physical examinations revealed no significant differences in flexion-extension arc (P = .668) or supination-pronation arc (P = .226) between the operated and nonoperated extremities. Lateral pinch strength and grip strength were comparable. On the MBRS, excellent and good outcomes were reported by 62.5% and 37.5% of the adipose flap patients, respectively, and 59% and 41% of the fascial sling patients. The contribution of perineural scarring to postoperative recurrent ulnar neuropathy is well documented. We think the pedicled adipofascial flap benefits the peripheral nerve by providing a scar tissue barrier and an optimal milieu for vascular regeneration. For all patients in the present study, symptoms improved, though the adipose flap and fascial sling groups were not significantly different in their objective outcomes.

A detailed overview of the technique including tips and tricks as well as an explanation of common errors are included.\nGraphic and clinical study of the approach, indications and feasibility.\nThe reported benefits of the direct anterior technique include enhanced post-operative recovery and respect for all the innervation and vascularization territories. It has been shown to be safe and effective in revision settings, to decrease the occurrence of heterotopic ossification, to enhance the accuracy of acetabular cup positioning, and to improve post-operative rehabilitation while having comparable outcomes in terms of loosening or component failure. Additionally, thromboembolic events have been shown to be decreased compared to other approaches. The most common reported complications in the revision setting is intra-operative fracture. The decision of a surgeon to transition to this approach, however, comes with a learning curve and potentially detrimental complications if done improperly.\nIn addition to its appeal in the primary setting, the approach could possibly be a solution to decrease the morbidity associated with revision surgery through its use of a fresh tissue plane not previously traumatized with the primary approach.", "journal": "International orthopaedics", "date": "2016-02-13", "authors": ["Philip JYork", "Charles TSmarck", "ThierryJudet", "CyrilMauffrey"], "doi": "10.1007/s00264-016-3125-3"}

{"title": "A Novel Microsurgical Model for Heterotopic, En Bloc Chest Wall, Thymus, and Heart Transplantation in Mice.", "abstract": "Exploration of novel strategies in organ transplantation to prolong allograft survival and minimizing the need for long-term maintenance immunosuppression must be pursued. Employing vascularized bone marrow transplantation and co-transplantation of the thymus have shown promise in this regard in various animal models. Vascularized bone marrow transplantation allows for the uninterrupted transfer of donor bone marrow cells within the preserved donor microenvironment, and the incorporation of thymus tissue with vascularized bone marrow transplantation has shown to increase T-cell chimerism ultimately playing a supportive role in the induction of immune regulation. The combination of solid organ and vascularized composite allotransplantation can uniquely combine these strategies in the form of a novel transplant model. Murine models serve as an excellent paradigm to explore the mechanisms of acute and chronic rejection, chimerism, and tolerance induction, thus providing the foundation to propagate superior allograft survival strategies for larger animal models and future clinical application. Herein, we developed a novel heterotopic en bloc chest wall, thymus, and heart transplant model in mice using a cervical non-suture cuff technique.

The promotion of rapid vascularization of scaffolds is critical for thick artificial constructs. In the present study co-cultures of human endothelial and adipose tissue-derived stem cells have been performed in poly(ethyl acrylate) scaffolds with two different pore structures: grid-like (PEA-o) or sponge-like (PEA-s), in combination with a self-assembling peptide gel filling the pores, which aims to mimic the physiological niche. After 2 and 7 culture days, cell adhesion, proliferation and migration, the expression of cell surface markers like CD31 and CD90 and the release of VEGF were assessed by means of immunocytochemistry, scanning electronic microscopy, flow cytometry and ELISA analyses. The study demonstrated that PEA-s scaffolds promoted greater cell organization into tubular-like structures than PEA-o scaffolds, and this was enhanced by the presence of the peptide gel.

The hVE-cad-Fc protein naturally formed homodimers and was used to construct hVE-cad-Fc matrix by stably adsorbing on polystyrene plates. Atomic force microscop assay showed uniform hVE-cad-Fc distribution with nanorod topography. The hVE-cad-Fc matrix markedly promoted human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) adhesion and proliferation with fibroblastoid morphology. Additionally, the hVE-cad-Fc matrix improved HUVECs migration, vWF expression, and NO release, which are closely related to vascularization. Furthermore, the hVE-cad-Fc matrix activated endogenous VE-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin proteins and effectively triggered the intracellular signals such as F-actin stress fiber, p-FAK, AKT, and Bcl-2.

Scaffolds should be degradable and bioresorbable as well as display good porosity, interconnecting pores, and topographic features; these properties favour tissue integration and vascularization. These requirements could be fulfilled by hybrid hydrogels using a combination of natural and synthetic components. Here, the mechanical and biological properties of a polyethylene glycol-fibrinogen hydrogel (PFHy) are improved in order to favour the proliferation and differentiation of human Sca-1(pos) cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs). PFHys are modified by embedding air- or perfluorohexane-filled bovine serum albumin microbubbles (MBs) and characterized. Changes in cell morphology are observed in MBs-PFHys, suggesting that MBs could enhance the formation of bundles of cells and influence the direction of the spindle growth. The properties of MBs as carriers of active macromolecules are also exploited. For the first time, enzyme-coated MBs have been used as systems for the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2 S)-releasing scaffolds. Novel H2 S-releasing PFHys are produced, which are able to improve the growth of hCPCs.

A combination of in vivo and in vitro techniques was used to look at the relative importance of the gills versus the gut in Na(+), Cl(-), and K(+) balance in two closely related erythrinid species: a facultative air-breather, the jeju (Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus) and an obligate water-breather, the traira (Hoplias malabaricus). The jeju has a well-vascularized physostomous swimbladder, while that in the traira is poorly vascularized, but the gills are much larger. Both species are native to the Amazon and are common in the ion-poor, acidic blackwaters of the Rio Negro. Under fasting conditions, the traira was able to maintain positive net Na(+) and Cl(-) balance in this water, and only slightly negative net K(+) balance. However, the jeju was in negative net balance for all three ions and had lower plasma Na(+) and Cl(-) concentrations, despite exhibiting higher branchial Na(+), K(+)ATPase and v-type H(+)ATPase activities. In the intestine, activities of these same enzymes were also higher in the jeju, and in vitro measurements of net area-specific rates of Na(+), Cl(-), and K(+) absorption, as well as the overall intestinal absorption capacities for these three ions, were far greater than in the traira. When acutely exposed to disturbances in water O2 levels (severe hypoxia ~15% or hyperoxia ~420% saturation), gill ionoregulation was greatly perturbed in the traira but less affected in the jeju, which could \"escape\" the stressor by voluntarily air-breathing. We suggest that a shift of ionoregulatory capacity from the gills to the gut may have occurred in the evolutionary transition to air-breathing in jeju, and in consequence branchial ionoregulation, while less powerful, is also less impacted by variations in water O2 levels.", "journal": "Journal of comparative physiology.

{"title": "Advances in endoscopic ultrasound imaging of colorectal diseases.", "abstract": "The development of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has had a significant impact for patients with digestive diseases, enabling enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, with most of the available evidence focusing on upper gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatico-biliary diseases. For the lower GI tract the main application of EUS has been in staging rectal cancer, as a complementary technique to other cross-sectional imaging methods. EUS can provide highly accurate in-depth assessments of tumour infiltration, performing best in the diagnosis of early rectal tumours. In the light of recent developments other EUS applications for colorectal diseases have been also envisaged and are currently under investigation, including beyond-rectum tumour staging by means of the newly developed forward-viewing radial array echoendoscope. Due to its high resolution, EUS might be also regarded as an ideal method for the evaluation of subepithelial lesions. Their differential diagnosis is possible by imaging the originating wall layer and the associated echostructure, and cytological and histological confirmation can be obtained through EUS-guided fine needle aspiration or trucut biopsy. However, reports on the use of EUS in colorectal subepithelial lesions are currently limited. EUS allows detailed examination of perirectal and perianal complications in Crohn's disease and, as a safe and less expensive investigation, can be used to monitor therapeutic response of fistulae, which seems to improve outcomes and reduce the need for additional surgery. Furthermore, EUS image enhancement techniques, such as the use of contrast agents or elastography, have recently been evaluated for colorectal indications as well. Possible applications of contrast enhancement include the assessment of tumour angiogenesis in colorectal cancer, the monitoring of disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease based on quantification of bowel wall vascularization, and differentiating between benign and malignant subepithelial tumours. Recent reports suggest that EUS elastography enables highly accurate discrimination of colorectal adenocarcinomas from adenomas, while inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes can be distinguished based on the strain ratio calculation. Among EUS-guided therapies, the drainage of abdominal and pelvic collections has been regarded as a safe and effective procedure to be used as an alternative for the transcutaneous route, while the placing of fiducial markers under EUS guidance for targeted radiotherapy in rectal cancer or the use of contrast microbubbles as drug-delivery vehicles represent experimental therapeutic applications that could greatly impact the forthcoming management of patients with colorectal diseases, pending on further investigations.", "journal": "World journal of gastroenterology", "date": "2016-02-09", "authors": ["Elena TatianaC\u00e2r\u021b\u00e2n\u0103", "Dan Ionu\u021bGheonea", "AdrianS\u0103ftoiu"], "doi": "10.3748/wjg.v22.i5.1756"}

The aim of this study was to develop a model in which hyperoxia-driven microvascular changes could be quantified and to test the hypothesis that microcirculatory responses to both normobaric (NB) and hyperbaric (HB) hyperoxic maneuvers are reversible. Sublingual mucosa microcirculation vessel density, proportion of perfused vessels, vessel diameters, microvascular flow index, macrohemodynamic, and blood gas parameters were examined in male rabbits breathing sequential O2/air mixtures of 21%, 55%, 100%, and return to 21% during NB (1.0 bar) and HB (2.5 bar) conditions. The results indicate that NB hyperoxia (55% and 100%) produced significant decreases in microvascular density and vascular diameters (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively) accompanied by significant increases in systolic and mean arterial blood pressure (p<0.05, respectively) with no changes in blood flow indices when compared to NB normoxia. HB normoxia/hyperoxia resulted in significant decreases in microvascular density (p<0.05), a transient rise in systolic blood pressure at 55% (p<0.01), and no changes in blood vessel diameter and blood flow indices when compared to NB hyperoxia. All microcirculation parameters reverted back to normal values upon return to NB normoxia. We conclude that NB/HB hyperoxia-driven changes elicit reversible physiological control of sublingual mucosa blood perfusion in the presence of steady cardiovascular function and that the absence of microvascular vasoconstriction during HB conditions suggests a beneficial mechanism associated with maintaining peak tissue perfusion states.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2016-02-07", "authors": ["Dan M JMilstein", "Ren\u00e9eHelmers", "SanneHackmann", "Charly N WBelterman", "Robert Avan Hulst", "Jande Lange"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2016.02.001"}

Conventional surgery was performed in another 15 patients. Proplan CMF surgical planning (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium) was performed preoperatively in the virtual planning group. Fibular flaps were harvested and underwent osteotomy assisted by prefabricated cutting guides, and the maxilla and midface were resected and reconstructed assisted by the prefabricated cutting guides and templates in the virtual planning group. The operative time and fibular flap positions were evaluated in the 2\u00a0groups. Postoperative fibular positions of the maxillary reconstruction were compared with virtual plans in the virtual planning group. The postoperative facial appearance and occlusal function were assessed.\nThe operations were performed successfully without complications. The ischemia time and total operative time were shorter in the virtual planning group than those in the conventional surgery group (P < .05). High precision of the cutting guides and templates was found on both the fibula and maxilla in the virtual planning group. The positions of the fibular flaps, including the vertical and horizontal positions, were more accurate in the virtual planning group than those in the conventional surgery group (P < .05). Bone-to-bone contact between the maxilla and fibular segments was more precise in the virtual planning group (P < .05). Postoperative computed tomography scans showed excellent contour of the fibular flap segments in accordance with the virtual plans in the virtual planning group. All patients were alive with no evidence of disease. Functional mandibular range of motion, good occlusion, and an ideal facial appearance were observed in the virtual planning group.\nVirtual surgical planning appears to achieve precise maxillary reconstruction with a vascularized fibular flap after tumor ablation, as well as an ideal facial appearance and function after dental rehabilitation.

We reported that the PI3K/mTOR pathway, which AMPK can regulate through multiple inputs, modulates PaSC activation and fibrogenic potential. Here, using primary and immortalized mouse PaSC, we assess the relative contributions of AMPK/mTOR signaling, autophagy and the UPR to cell fate responses during metabolic stress induced by mitochondrial dysfunction. The mitochondrial uncoupler rottlerin at low doses (0.5-2.5 \u03bcM) was added to cells cultured in 10% FBS complete media. Mitochondria rapidly depolarized, followed by altered mitochondrial dynamics and decreased cellular ATP levels. This mitochondrial dysfunction elicited rapid, sustained AMPK activation, mTOR pathway inhibition, and blockade of autophagic flux. Rottlerin treatment also induced rapid, sustained PERK/CHOP UPR signaling. Subsequently, high doses (>5 \u03bcM) induced loss of cell viability and cell death. Interestingly, AMPK knock-down using siRNA did not prevent rottlerin-induced mTOR inhibition, autophagy, or CHOP upregulation, suggesting that AMPK is dispensable for these responses. Moreover, CHOP genetic deletion, but not AMPK knock-down, prevented rottlerin-induced apoptosis and supported cell survival, suggesting that UPR signaling is a major modulator of cell fate in PaSC during metabolic stress. Further, short-term rottlerin treatment reduced both PaSC fibrogenic potential and IL-6 mRNA expression. In contrast, expression levels of the angiogenic factors HGF and VEGF\u03b1 were unaffected, and the immune modulator IL-4 was markedly upregulated. These data imply that metabolic stress-induced PaSC reprogramming differentially modulates neighboring cells in the tumor microenvironment.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2016-02-06", "authors": ["Hsin-YuanSu", "Richard TWaldron", "RaymondGong", "V KrishnanRamanujan", "Stephen JPandol", "AureliaLugea"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0148999\n10.1111/j.1440-1746.2011.07013.x\n10.1053/j.gastro.2012.11.037\n10.1053/j.gastro.2011.12.044\n10.1101/cshperspect.a008763\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.049\n10.1038/ncb3172\n10.1038/ncb3195\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2013.11.014\n10.1038/nrm3440\n10.1074/jbc.M110.216093\n10.1126/science.1254312\n10.1093/nar/gkt563\n10.1038/ncb2738\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2689\n10.1038/nrm3311\n10.1038/ncb2329\n10.1152/ajpgi.00257.2009\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.09.007\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2014.02.018\n10.1021/pr2006318\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.024\n10.1016/j.jhep.2013.02.016\n10.1038/nrm3877\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2014.03.009\n10.1186/1476-4598-12-171\n10.1371/journal.pone.0057289\n10.1371/journal.pone.0114573\n10.1016/j.tibs.2015.01.002\n10.1038/nrm3270\n10.1016/j.tcb.2012.02.006\n10.1093/carcin/bgu122\n10.1007/s11010-012-1316-9\n10.1038/ncomms8158\n10.1100/2012/350826\n10.1016/j.canlet.2013.10.003\n10.1016/j.cmet.2010.03.014\n10.1016/j.ccr.2014.05.004\n10.1073/pnas.1011736107\n10.1016/j.ccr.2014.04.005\n10.1016/j.ccr.2014.04.021"}

Traditional urethroplasty techniques in this group are unpredictable. We describe a novel technique of a buccal mucosa-prelaminated radial forearm free flap urethroplasty, which seeks to improve the quality of life for this group of patients. Methods\u2003Known, reliable techniques from two surgical specialties were combined to create a novel surgical solution, consisting of a radial forearm free flap prelaminated with buccal mucosa. Prospective data were collected on patient and stricture characteristics, complications, and results, including voiding flow rates, urethrography, and cystourethroscopy. Success was defined as the ability to void per urethra. The procedure was performed in four patients, previously considered unreconstructable and who were suprapubic catheter dependent. Results\u2003Microsurgical transfer was successful in all four cases. All patients were voiding per urethra and remained catheter free at a minimum of 12-month follow-up. There was no significant donor morbidity and all patients were able to return to their usual occupation. Mean voiding flow rates were 17.3 mL/s. Flexible cystoscopy revealed well-vascularized, patent neomucosa. Conclusions\u2003We demonstrate proof of concept for a novel technique of microsurgical urethroplasty.

Many surgical techniques have been described to address these challenges, including non-vascularized bone grafts, vascularized bone grafts, and approaches related to tissue engineering. This review summarizes different modifications of the free vascularized fibula graft, which, since its introduction by Hidalgo in 1989, has become the first option for mandibular reconstruction. The fibula free flap can undergo various modifications according to the individual requirements of a particular reconstruction. Osteocutaneous flaps can be harvested for reconstruction of composite defects. 'Double-barreling' of the fibula can, for instance, enable enhanced aesthetic and functional results, as well as immediate one-stage osseointegrated dental implantation. Recently described preoperative virtual surgery planning to facilitate neomandible remodeling could guarantee good results. To conclude, the free fibula bone graft can currently be regarded as the \"gold standard\" for mandibular reconstruction in case of composite (inside and outside) oral cavity defects as well as a way of enabling the performance of one-stage dental implantation.", "journal": "Archives of plastic surgery", "date": "2016-02-06", "authors": ["GeorgeKokosis", "RobinSchmitz", "David BPowers", "DetlevErdmann"], "doi": "10.5999/aps.2016.43.1.3"}

A semi-automated algorithm was developed to remove speckle noise and to extract and measure the volume of the choroidal vessels from the obtained OCT data.\nIn all cases, analysis of the choroidal vessels could be performed with SS-OCT without the need for pupillary dilation. The proposed method allows speckle noise-free, structure-guided visualization and measurement of the larger choroidal vessels in three dimensions. The obtained data suggest that speckle noise-free OCT may be more effective at identifying choroidal structures than traditional OCT methods. The measured volume of the extracted choroidal vessels of Haller's layer and Sattler's layer in the examined tumorous eyes was on average 0.982463955\u00a0mm(3) /982463956\u00a0\u03bcm(3) (range of 0.209764406\u00a0mm(3) /209764405.9\u00a0\u03bcm(3)to 1.78105544\u00a0mm(3) /1781055440\u00a0\u03bcm(3)).

This review summarizes the recent advances in MMD pathophysiology, including the genetic and circulating factors related to disease development. Genetic and environmental factors may play important roles in the development of the vascular stenosis and aberrant angiogenesis in complex ways. These factors include the related changes in circulating endothelial/smooth muscle progenitor cells, cytokines related to vascular remodeling and angiogenesis, and endothelium, such as caveolin which is a plasma membrane protein. With a better understanding of MMD pathophysiology, nonsurgical approaches targeting MMD pathogenesis may be available to stop or slow the progression of this disease.

Although its etiology remains unknown, recent genetic studies identified RNF213 in the 17q25-ter region as an important susceptibility gene of MMD among East Asian populations. Possibly because of genetic differences, MMD is relatively common in people living in East Asian countries such as Korea and Japan, compared to those in the Western Hemisphere. The prevalence of MMD appears to be slightly lower among Chinese, compared to Koreans or Japanese. There are two peaks of incidence with different clinical presentations, at around 10 years and 30-40 years. The peak appears to occur later in women than men. In children, ischemic symptoms, especially transient ischemic attacks, are predominant. Intellectual decline, seizures, and involuntary movements are also more common in this age group. In contrast, adult patients present with intracranial hemorrhage more often than pediatric patients. In patients with MMD, intracerebral hemorrhage is more often accompanied by intraventricular hemorrhage than in patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. These different age peaks and different clinical presentations in each age group are also observed in MMD patients in the USA. Catheter angiography is the diagnostic method of choice.

The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant cell hybrids is unknown. Here we augment fusion of transplanted MSCs with recipient cardiac cell types via viral fusogens to determine how cardiac function is impacted. Using a Cre/LoxP-based luciferase reporter system coupled to biophotonic imaging and echocardiography, we found that augmenting fusion with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) increased the amount of fusion in the recipient mouse heart, but led to diminished cardiac function. Specifically, MSCs transfected with VSVG (MSC-VSVG) had the lowest mean fold increase in fractional area change (FAC) and cardiac output (CO). Although the amount of fusion detected had a strong positive correlation (Pearson) with fractional area change and cardiac output at day 7, this effect was lost by day 28. The decrease in cardiac function seen with MSC-VSVG treatment versus MSC alone or sham treatment was associated with decreased MSC retention, altered immune cell responsiveness and reduced vascularization in the heart. This outcome garners consideration in the context of cellular transplantation to damaged tissues, those with viral infection or other microenvironmental conditions that might promote fusion.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-02-06", "authors": ["Brian TFreeman", "Brenda MOgle"], "doi": "10.1038/srep20283"}

{"title": "Alterations in Hair Follicle Morphology and Hair Shaft Production After Follicular Unit Transplantation.", "abstract": "Follicular unit transplantation is the most commonly performed technique in modern restorative hair transplantation surgery. It relies on the acquisition of intact follicular units from microdissected scalp skin strips and their subsequent transplantation into the recipient regions affected by alopecia. Ideally, the translocation of follicular units from the balding-resistant areas of the scalp (usually the occipital region) to the recipient site should not result in any morphological change in the grafts. Nevertheless, the insults associated with surgical intervention present grafted follicles to mechanical and chemical cues differently from those of the physiological steady-state conditions in undamaged skin. This disruption of the normal follicular microenvironment might alter important aspects of hair biology in grafts, for example, hair cycle and pigmentation, and, in turn, could lead to differences in hair appearance, eventually culminating in a diminished esthetical outcome of the surgery. In this study, the authors analyzed native and grafted scalp hair follicles (HFs) from 2 patients who had undergone follicular unit transplantation surgeries formerly. Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy-based histomorphometry revealed a marked enlargement of follicular structures in the grafts with a concomitant increase in hair shaft diameter. Immunohistological staining confirmed a thickening of the dermal sheath in transplanted HFs that also harbored a denser vascular network. Taken together, these results show that the grafted HFs analyzed were subjected to marked morphological changes during their residence in the recipient site and that this phenomenon is associated with a modulation of follicular vascularization.", "journal": "The American Journal of dermatopathology", "date": "2016-02-05", "authors": ["Reza PAzar", "Alexander HThomas", "MarcusMaurer", "GerdLindner"], "doi": "10.1097/DAD.0000000000000526"}

{"title": "Nonthermal ablation of deep brain targets: A simulation study on a large animal model.", "abstract": "Thermal ablation with transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (FUS) is currently limited to central brain targets because of heating and other beam effects caused by the presence of the skull. Recently, it was shown that it is possible to ablate tissues without depositing thermal energy by driving intravenously administered microbubbles to inertial cavitation using low-duty-cycle burst sonications. A recent study demonstrated that this ablation method could ablate tissue volumes near the skull base in nonhuman primates without thermally damaging the nearby bone. However, blood-brain disruption was observed in the prefocal region, and in some cases, this region contained small areas of tissue damage. The objective of this study was to analyze the experimental model with simulations and to interpret the cause of these effects.\nThe authors simulated prior experiments where nonthermal ablation was performed in the brain in anesthetized rhesus macaques using a 220 kHz clinical prototype transcranial MRI-guided FUS system. Low-duty-cycle sonications were applied at deep brain targets with the ultrasound contrast agent Definity. For simulations, a 3D pseudospectral finite difference time domain tool was used. The effects of shear mode conversion, focal steering, skull aberrations, nonlinear propagation, and the presence of skull base on the pressure field were investigated using acoustic and elastic wave propagation models.\nThe simulation results were in agreement with the experimental findings in the prefocal region. In the postfocal region, however, side lobes were predicted by the simulations, but no effects were evident in the experiments. The main beam was not affected by the different simulated scenarios except for a shift of about 1 mm in peak position due to skull aberrations. However, the authors observed differences in the volume, amplitude, and distribution of the side lobes. In the experiments, a single element passive cavitation detector was used to measure the inertial cavitation threshold and to determine the pressure amplitude to use for ablation. Simulations of the detector's acoustic field suggest that its maximum sensitivity was in the lower part of the main beam, which may have led to excessive exposure levels in the experiments that may have contributed to damage in the prefocal area.\nOverall, these results suggest that case-specific full wave simulations before the procedure can be useful to predict the focal and the prefocal side lobes and the extent of the resulting bioeffects produced by nonthermal ablation. Such simulations can also be used to optimally position passive cavitation detectors. The disagreement between the simulations and the experiments in the postfocal region may have been due to shielding of the ultrasound field due to microbubble activity in the focal region.

The diameter of the hollow channel can be precisely controlled and varied between 500\u00a0\u03bcm - 2\u00a0mm by changing applied flow rates or print-head speed. These channels are integrated into gel layers with a thickness of 800\u00a0\u03bcm - 2.5\u00a0mm. The structural rigidity of these constructs allows the fabrication of multi-layered structures without causing the collapse of hollow channels in lower layers. The 3D printing method was fully characterized at a range of operating speeds (0-40\u00a0m/min) and corresponding flow rates (1-30\u00a0mL/min) were identified to produce precise definition. This microfluidic design also allows the incorporation of a wide range of scaffold materials as well as biological constituents such as cells, growth factors, and ECM material. Media perfusion of the channels causes a significant viability increase in the bulk of cell-laden structures over the long-term. With this setup, gel constructs with embedded arrays of hollow channels can be created and used as a potential substitute for blood vessel networks.", "journal": "Biomedical microdevices", "date": "2016-02-05", "authors": ["RAttalla", "CLing", "PSelvaganapathy"], "doi": "10.1007/s10544-016-0042-6"}
{"title": "Repair of Avascular Meniscus Tears with Electrospun Collagen Scaffolds Seeded with Human Cells.", "abstract": "The self-healing capacity of an injured meniscus is limited to the vascularized regions and is especially challenging in the inner avascular regions. As such, we investigated the use of human meniscus cell-seeded electrospun (ES) collagen type I scaffolds to produce meniscal tissue and explored whether these cell-seeded scaffolds can be implanted to repair defects created in meniscal avascular tissue explants. Human meniscal cells (derived from vascular and avascular meniscal tissue) were seeded on ES scaffolds and cultured. Constructs were evaluated for cell viability, gene expression, and mechanical properties. To determine potential for repair of meniscal defects, human meniscus avascular cells were seeded and cultured on aligned ES collagen scaffolds for 4 weeks before implantation. Surgical defects resembling \"longitudinal tears\" were created in the avascular zone of bovine meniscus and implanted with cell-seeded collagen scaffolds and cultured for 3 weeks. Tissue regeneration and integration were evaluated by histology, immunohistochemistry, mechanical testing, and magentic resonance imaging. Ex vivo implantation with cell-seeded collagen scaffolds resulted in neotissue that was significantly better integrated with the native tissue than acellular collagen scaffolds or untreated defects. Human meniscal cell-seeded ES collagen scaffolds may therefore be useful in facilitating meniscal repair of avascular meniscus tears.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Vascularized composite allotransplantation: a closer look at the banff working classification.", "abstract": "The first Banff vascularized composite allotransplantation meeting was held in 2007 to standardize criteria for the characterization and reporting of severity and types of rejection. As a result, the 2007 Banff VCA working classification for skin allograft pathology was formalized and now serves as the standard for diagnosis of VCA rejection. Similar to other working classification systems, strengths and limitations have been identified including the adequacy of the specimen, the definition of severity between grades, the reproducibility, the adequacy of the specimens, the types of rejection, and the integration of newer technologies such as molecular and genomic approaches. Although a relatively few number of cases have been performed and followed up to date, additional phenotypes such as antibody-mediated rejection, fibrosis, atrophy, and vascular changes are being reported and characterized based on accumulated experience in the field of VCA and parallels with other solid organs. This study aims to consider strengths and limitations of the Banff VCA working system and highlights ongoing challenges and opportunities available related to histopathology in this emerging field of transplantation.", "journal": "Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation", "date": "2016-02-04", "authors": ["MichelleSchneider", "Adela Rambi GCardones", "M AngelicaSelim", "Linda CCendales"], "doi": "10.1111/tri.12750"}

This article gives an overview over the various possibilities of breast reconstruction, including implant- and expander-based reconstruction, flap-based reconstruction (vascularized autologous tissue), the combination of implant and flap, reconstruction using non-vascularized autologous fat, as well as refinement surgery after breast reconstruction.", "journal": "Frontiers in surgery", "date": "2016-02-03", "authors": ["DanielSchmauss", "Hans-G\u00fcntherMachens", "YvesHarder"], "doi": "10.3389/fsurg.2015.00071\n10.3322/caac.21262\n10.1111/j.1365-2354.2008.01060.x\n10.1038/bjc.1967.28\n10.1056/NEJM198503143121102\n10.1016/j.breast.2015.02.037\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181ccdac5\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61629-2\n10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70386-3\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3182729cde\n10.1097/00006534-199109000-00001\n10.1245/ASO.2003.01.910\n10.1016/S0039-6109(03)00035-5\n10.1056/NEJM199901143400201\n10.1016/j.bjps.2013.07.034\n10.1023/A:1006441018271\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000156974.69184.5E\n10.1016/j.bjps.2004.12.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0125655\n10.1097/SAP.0b013e31822ed5ce\n10.1016/j.amjsurg.2015.03.019\n10.1007/s00268-012-1450-2\n10.1097/00006534-197046010-00001\n10.1097/00006534-197701000-00001\n10.1056/NEJM199703063361001\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000000021\n10.1097/00006534-198202000-00001\n10.1111/tbj.12395\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e31829586e2\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e318230c29e\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000117194.21748.02\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181ab112d\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e318199eef3\n10.1016/j.bjps.2014.05.020\n10.1097/00006534-198312000-00037\n10.1097/00006534-197609000-00004\n10.1097/00006534-197760030-00003\n10.1016/0007-1226(77)90117-5\n10.1016/0007-1226(76)90036-9\n10.1097/01.prs.0000207396.22527.68\n10.1097/00006534-198701000-00010\n10.1097/00006534-200209010-00005\n10.1097/00006534-198202000-00006\n10.1016/0007-1226(88)90007-0\n10.1097/00006534-198905000-00009\n10.1016/S0007-1226(03)00132-2\n10.1097/00000637-199401000-00007\n10.1016/0007-1226(94)90033-7\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182426757\n10.1097/01.SAP.0000041489.11933.03\n10.1016/j.bjps.2006.01.005\n10.1097/01.sap.0000237635.05337.a1\n10.1055/s-0032-1313773\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e318177436c\n10.1016/j.anplas.2007.09.005\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181aeeadd\n10.1097/SAP.0b013e3182920ad0\n10.1016/j.anplas.2012.10.007\n10.3205/000185\n10.1007/s00266-014-0406-3\n10.1097/01.prs.0000234610.81672.e7\n10.1097/SAP.0000000000000561\n10.1097/PRS.0b013e31824a2a8e\n10.1016/j.anplas.2007.09.003\n10.1155/2015/120949\n10.1097/PRS.0000000000001321\n10.1016/j.breast.2011.01.003\n10.1002/bjs.8722\n10.1093/annonc/mdr158"}

Knowledge of the structural organization is crucial for the differential diagnosis and establishment of prognosis of pathologies with involvement of the brainstem. Familiarity with the location of the lesions in the brainstem is essential, especially in the pediatric population. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive and specific imaging technique for diagnosing disorders of the posterior fossa and, particularly, the brainstem. High magnetic static field MRI allows detailed visualization of the morphology, signal intensity and metabolic content of the brainstem nuclei, together with visualization of the normal development and myelination. In this pictorial essay we review the brainstem pathology in pediatric patients and consider the MR imaging patterns that may help the radiologist to differentiate among vascular, toxico-metabolic, infective-inflammatory, degenerative and neoplastic processes. Helpful MR tips can guide the differential diagnosis: These include the location and morphology of lesions, the brainstem vascularization territories, gray and white matter distribution and tissue selective vulnerability.", "journal": "World journal of radiology", "date": "2016-02-03", "authors": ["Carlo CosimoQuattrocchi", "YuriErrante", "Maria CamillaRossi Espagnet", "StefaniaGalassi", "Sabino WalterDella Sala", "BrunoBernardi", "GiuseppeFariello", "DanielaLongo"], "doi": "10.4329/wjr.v8.i1.1"}

Here, we introduce a thermoresponsive hyaluronan hydrogel for cartilage repair obtained by covalently grafting poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) to hyaluronan, to give a brush co-polymer HpN. The gel is fluid at room temperature and becomes gel at body temperature. In this pilot study HpN safety and repair response were evaluated in an osteochondral defect model in rabbit. Follow-up was of 1 week and 12 weeks and the empty defect served as a control, for a total of four experimental groups. At 12 weeks the defect sites were evaluated macroscopically and histologically. Local lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and kidneys were analyzed for histopathological evaluation. HpN could be easily injected and remained into the defect throughout the study. The macroscopic score was statistically superior for HpN versus empty. Histological score gave opposite trend but not statistically significant. A slight tissue reaction was observed around HpN, however, vascularization and subchondral bone formation were not impeded. An upper proteoglycans rich fibro-cartilaginous tissue with fairly good continuity and lateral integration into the existing articular cartilage was observed in all cases. No signs of local or systemic acute or subacute toxicity were observed. In conclusion, HpN is easily injectable, remains into an osteochondral defect within a moving synovial joint, is biocompatible and does not interfere with the intrinsic healing response of osteochondral defects in a rabbit model. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two patients provided the unique opportunity to demonstrate that vascular changes directly contribute to joint bleeding.\nTwo patients had severe hemophilic arthropathies; joint vascularity and bleeding were studied during periods of normalized plasma clotting factor activities with MSKUS and PD. One patient was \"cured\" of hemophilia with liver transplantation. Abnormal elbow vascularization persisted despite normalization of coagulation status and was associated with severe bleeding years after transplant. Dynamic vascular changes were detected prior to and during bleeding; angiography revealed enlarged, thickened vessels consistent with remodeling, and required arterial embolization. The second patient had continued knee bleeding and fluctuating vascular changes for months following knee replacement, unresponsive to intense daily factor treatment. Subsequently, new bleeds developed in other joints associated with similar vascular changes despite continued factor replacement.\nVascular remodeling contributes to perpetuated hemophilic joint bleeding and therefore contributes to progressive arthropathy.

{"title": "Promoting Endochondral Bone Repair Using Human Osteoarthritic Articular Chondrocytes.", "abstract": "Current tissue engineering strategies to heal critical-size bone defects through direct bone formation are limited by incomplete integration of grafts with host bone and incomplete graft vascularization. An alternative strategy for bone regeneration is the use of cartilage grafts that form bone through endochondral ossification. Endochondral cartilages stimulate angiogenesis and are remodeled into bone, but are found in very small quantities in growth plates and healing fractures. We sought to develop engineered endochondral cartilage grafts using osteoarthritic (OA) articular chondrocytes as a cell source. Such chondrocytes often undergo hypertrophy, which is a characteristic of endochondral cartilages.\nWe compared the ability of unmodified human OA (hOA) cartilage and cartilage grafts formed in vitro from hOA chondrocytes to undergo endochondral ossification in mice. Scaffold-free engineered chondrocyte grafts were generated by pelleting chondrocytes, followed by culture with transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and bone morphogenetic protein 4. Samples derived from either primary or passaged chondrocytes were implanted subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice. Grafts derived from passaged chondrocytes from three patients were implanted into critical-size tibial defects in mice. Bone formation was assessed with histology after 4 weeks of implantation. The composition of tibial repair tissue was quantified with histomorphometry.\nEngineered cartilage grafts generated from passaged OA chondrocytes underwent endochondral ossification after implantation either subcutaneously or in bone. Cartilage grafts integrated with host bone at 15 out of 16 junctions. Grafts variably remodeled into woven bone, with the proportion of bony repair tissue in tibial defects ranging from 22% to 85% (average 48%). Bony repair tissue bridged the tibial defects in half of the animals. In contrast, unmodified OA cartilage and engineered grafts formed from primary chondrocytes did not undergo endochondral ossification in vivo.\nhOA chondrocytes can adopt an endochondral phenotype after passaging and TGF-\u03b2 superfamily treatment. Engineered endochondral cartilage grafts can integrate with host bone, undergo ossification, and heal critical-size long-bone defects in a mouse model. However, additional methods to further enhance ossification of these grafts are required before the clinical translation of this approach.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Debridement and washout are required for grossly infected wounds and necrotizing soft tissue infections. Cutaneous cancers such as squamous cell carcinomas may contribute to chronic wounds and vice versa; if diagnosed, these should be treated with wide local excision. Arterial, venous, and even lymphatic flows can be restored in select cases to enhance delivery of nutrients and removal of metabolic waste and promote wound healing. In cases where vital structures, such as bones, joints, tendons, and nerves, are exposed, vascularized tissue transfers are often required. These tissue transfers can be local or remote, the latter of which necessitates anastomoses of arteries and veins. Pressure sores are managed by relieving pressure, treating acute trauma or infection, and using rotation fasciocutaneous flaps. Lastly, the surgeon must always consider the possibility of osteomyelitis and retained foreign body as etiology for chronic wounds.", "journal": "Rhode Island medical journal (2013)", "date": "2016-02-02", "authors": ["Benjamin RJohnston", "Austin YHa", "DanielKwan"], "doi": null}

Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) signals contain also information about the neurovascular coupling, vascular reactivity, oxygenation and blood propagation. Temporal relationship between BOLD fluctuations in different parts of the brain provides also a mean to investigate the blood delay information. We used the induced desaturation as a label to profile transit times through different brain areas, reflecting oxygen utilization of tissue. In this study, we aimed to compare blood flow propagation delay times between these patients and healthy subjects in areas vascularized by anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries. In a group comparison analysis with control subjects, BOLD changes in these areas were found to be almost simultaneous and shorter in the SCD patients, because of their increased brain blood flow. Secondly, the analysis of a patient with a stenosis on the anterior cerebral artery indicated that signal of the area vascularized by this artery lagged the MCA signal.

Conventional endodontic treatments result in a devitalized and weakened tooth. In this work, we synthesized novel star-shaped polymer to self-assemble into unique nanofibrous spongy microspheres (NF-SMS), which were used to carry human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) into the pulp cavity to regenerate living dental pulp tissues. It was found that NF-SMS significantly enhanced hDPSCs attachment, proliferation, odontogenic differentiation and angiogenesis, as compared to control cell carriers. Additionally, NF-SMS promoted vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression of hDPSCs in a 3D hypoxic culture. Hypoxia-primed hDPSCs/NF-SMS complexes were injected into the cleaned pulp cavities of rabbit molars for subcutaneous implantation in mice. After 4 weeks, the hypoxia group significantly enhanced angiogenesis inside the pulp chamber and promoted the formation of ondontoblast-like cells lining along the dentin-pulp interface, as compared to the control groups (hDPSCs alone group, NF-SMS alone group, and hDPSCs/NF-SMS group pre-cultured under normoxic conditions). Furthermore, in an in situ dental pulp repair model in rats, hypoxia-primed hDPSCs/NF-SMS were injected to fully fill the pulp cavity and regenerate pulp-like tissues with a rich vasculature and a histological structure similar to the native pulp.\nVascularization is key to the regeneration of many vital tissues.

Using a clinically-relevant surgical procedure and a hypoxic treatment, the nanofibrous spongy microspheres were used to deliver stem cells and successfully regenerate dental pulp with a rich vasculature and a complex histologic structure similar to that of the native dental pulp.

Cranio- and dentofacial skeletal deformities in infant and adolescent patients can be treated by applying tensile force to sutures to induce sutural bone formation. The early gene expression induced by mechanical stress is essential for bone formation in long bones; however, early gene expression during sutural bone formation induced by tensile force is poorly characterized. In vivo studies are essential to evaluate molecular responses to mechanical stresses in heterogeneous cell populations, such as sutures. In this paper we examined in vivo early gene expression and the underlying regulatory mechanism for this expression in tensile-force-applied cranial sutures, focusing on genes involved in vascularization. Tensile force upregulated expression of vascular factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) and endothelial cell markers, in sutures within 3\u00a0h. The expression of connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) and Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (Rock2) was also upregulated by tensile force. A CTGF-neutralizing antibody and the ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, abolished tensile-force-induced Vegf expression. Moreover, tensile force activated extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling in sagittal sutures, and the ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, partially inhibited tensile-force-induced Ctgf expression. These results indicate that tensile force induces in vivo gene expression associated with vascularization early in tensile-force-induced sutural bone formation. Moreover, the early induction of Vegf gene expression is regulated by CTGF and ROCK2.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral metabolism", "date": "2016-01-31", "authors": ["NobuoTakeshita", "MasakazuHasegawa", "KiyoSasaki", "DaisukeSeki", "MasahiroSeiryu", "ShunroMiyashita", "IkukoTakano", "ToshihitoOyanagi", "YukiMiyajima", "TerukoTakano-Yamamoto"], "doi": "10.1007/s00774-016-0737-z"}

However, obstacles including limited activity preservation, difficulty in controlled release, and high cost obstructed the practical application of this strategy. In this study, TEB scaffold were modified with cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) and the effects of CNPs existed at the scaffold surface on the growth and paracrine behavior of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were investigated. The CNPs could improve the proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of MSCs. Meanwhile, the interaction between the cell membrane and the nanoparticle surface could activate the calcium channel of MSCs leading to the rise of intracellular free Ca(2+) level, which subsequently augments the stability of HIF-1\u03b1. These chain reactions finally resulted in high expression of angiogenic factor VEGF. The improved paracrine of VEGF could thereby promote the proliferation, differentiation, and tube formation ability of EPCs.

A comparably high rate of connective tissue (48.25%) surrounding the remaining bone substitute granules (42.13%) was observed. Accordingly, the amount of bone tissue (9.62%) built the smallest fraction within the biopsy. Further, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive and -negative multinucleated giant cells (4.35 and 3.93 cells/mm(2), respectively) were detected on the material-tissue interfaces. The implantation bed showed a mild vascularization of 10.03 vessels/mm(2) and 0.78%. The present case report shows that after 3 years, a comparable small amount of bone tissue was observable. Thus, the foreign body response to the bone substitute seems to be folded without further degradation or regeneration.", "journal": "The Journal of oral implantology", "date": "2016-01-30", "authors": ["JonasLorenz", "MikeBarbeck", "Robert ASader", "Charles JKirkpatrick", "PhilippeRusse", "JosephChoukroun", "ShahramGhanaati"], "doi": "10.1563/aaid-joi-D-15-00133"}

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality which helps understand the complex pathological changes, and images the blood vessels across different layers based on their flow characteristics.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted on 56 eyes of Asian Indian eyes of 28 consecutive patients with MacTel 2 studied during a 3-month period in a tertiary eye care hospital of South India. Clinically diagnosed cases of MacTel 2 underwent fundus photography, spectral domain OCT and OCTA. Fluorescein angiography was performed only when clinically indicated. Mean capillary density was calculated using a MATLAB-based automated software. The images were thresholded and binarised to derive the mean value.\nThe mean age at presentation was 60\u00b15.2, with a female preponderance of 71.42%. Vascular network on OCTA shows an increase in the intervascular spaces with progressive capillary rarefaction and abnormal capillary anastomosis. The outer retina and choroid were involved during the later stages and showed a prominent vascular network.

{"title": "Relationship of brown adipose tissue perfusion and function: a study through \u03b22-adrenoreceptor stimulation.", "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation increases glucose and lipid consumption; as such, it is been considered as a potential therapy to decrease obesity. BAT is highly vascularized and its activation is associated with a necessary increase in blood flow. However, whether increasing BAT blood flow per se increases BAT activity is unknown. To examine this hypothesis, we investigated whether an isolated increase in BAT blood flow obtained by \u03b22-adrenoreceptor (\u03b22-AR) stimulation with salbutamol increased BAT activity. BAT blood flow was estimated in vivo in mice using contrast-enhanced ultrasound. The absence of direct effect of salbutamol on the function of isolated brown adipocytes was assessed by measuring oxygen consumption. The effect of salbutamol on BAT activity was investigated by measuring BAT glucose uptake in vivo. BAT blood flow increased by 2.3 \u00b1 0.6-fold during \u03b22-AR stimulation using salbutamol infusion in mice (P= 0.003). \u03b22-AR gene expression was detectable in BAT but was extremely low in isolated brown adipocytes. Oxygen consumption of isolated brown adipocytes did not change with salbutamol exposure, confirming the absence of a direct effect of \u03b22-AR agonist on brown adipocytes. Finally, \u03b22-AR stimulation by salbutamol increased BAT glucose uptake in vivo (991 \u00b1 358 vs. 135 \u00b1 49 ng glucose/mg tissue/45 min in salbutamol vs. saline injected mice, respectively,P= 0.046). In conclusion, an increase in BAT blood flow without direct stimulation of the brown adipocytes is associated with increased BAT metabolic activity.

The exact mechanism that regulates vascular integrity requires further definition. Using a microarray screen for angiogenesis-associated genes during murine embryogenesis, we identified thrombospondin type I domain 1 (THSD1) as a new putative angiopotent factor with unknown biological function. We sought to characterize the role of THSD1 in endothelial cells during vascular development and cardiovascular disease.\nFunctional knockdown of Thsd1 in zebrafish embryos and in a murine retina vascularization model induced severe haemorrhaging without affecting neovascular growth. In human carotid endarterectomy specimens, THSD1 expression by endothelial cells was detected in advanced atherosclerotic lesions with intraplaque haemorrhaging, but was absent in stable lesions, implying involvement of THSD1 in neovascular bleeding. In vitro, stimulation with pro-atherogenic factors (3% O2 and TNF\u03b1) decreased THSD1 expression in human endothelial cells, whereas stimulation with an anti-atherogenic factor (IL10) showed opposite effect. Therapeutic evaluation in a murine advanced atherosclerosis model showed that Thsd1 overexpression decreased plaque vulnerability by attenuating intraplaque vascular leakage, subsequently reducing macrophage accumulation and necrotic core size. Mechanistic studies in human endothelial cells demonstrated that THSD1 activates FAK-PI3K, leading to Rac1-mediated actin cytoskeleton regulation of adherens junctions and focal adhesion assembly.\nTHSD1 is a new regulator of endothelial barrier function during vascular development and protects intraplaque microvessels against haemorrhaging in advanced atherosclerotic lesions.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2016-01-30", "authors": ["Remco AHaasdijk", "Wijnand KDen Dekker", "CarolineCheng", "DennieTempel", "RobertSzulcek", "Frank LBos", "Dorien M AHermkens", "IhsanChrifi", "Maarten MBrandt", "ChrisVan Dijk", "Yan JuanXu", "Esther H MVan De Kamp", "Lau A JBlonden", "JanVan Bezu", "Judith CSluimer", "Erik A LBiessen", "Geerten PVan Nieuw Amerongen", "Henricus JDuckers"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvw015"}

In particular, in vitro construction of 3D-iPSC-CM tissues with blood capillary networks have attracted much attention because blood capillaries are crucial for nutrient and oxygen supplies for CMs. Blood capillaries in 3D-iPSC-CM tissues will also be important for in vitro toxicity assay of prodrugs because of the signaling interaction between cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. Here, we report construction of vascularized 3D-iPSC-CM tissues by a newly-discovered filtration-Layer-by-Layer (LbL) technique for cells, instead of our previous centrifugation-LbL technique. The filtration-LbL allowed us to fabricate nanometer-sized extracellular matrices (ECM), fibronectin and gelatin (FN-G), films onto iPSC-CM surfaces without any damage and with high yield, although centrifugation-LbL induced physical stress and a lower yield. The fabricated FN-G nanofilms interacted with integrin molecules on the cell membrane to construct 3D-tissues. We found that the introduction of normal human cardiac fibroblasts (NHCFs) into the iPSC-CM tissues modulated organization and synchronous beating depending on NHCF ratios. Moreover, co-culture with normal human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (NHCMECs) successfully provided blood capillary-like networks in 3D-iPSC-CM tissues, depending on NHCF ratios. The vascularized 3D-iPSC-CM tissues indicated significantly different toxicity responses as compared to 2D-iPSC-CM cells by addition of doxorubicin as a model of a toxic drug. The constructed vascularized 3D-iPSC-CM tissues would be a promising tool for tissue regeneration and drug development.\nIn vitro fabrication of vascularized three-dimensional (3D) human cardiomyocyte (CM) tissues derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has attracted much attention owing to their requirement of much amount of nutrition and oxygen, but not yet published. In this manuscript, we report construction of vascularized 3D-iPSC-CM tissues by a newly-discovered filtration-Layer-by-Layer (LbL) technique. The filtration-LbL fabricates nanometer-sized fibronectin and gelatin (FN-G) films onto iPSC-CM surfaces.

{"title": "Bioglass promotes wound healing by affecting gap junction connexin 43 mediated endothelial cell behavior.", "abstract": "It is well known that gap junctions play an important role in wound healing, and bioactive glass (BG) has been shown to help healing when applied as a wound dressing. However, the effects of BG on gap junctional communication between cells involved in wound healing is not well understood. We hypothesized that BG may be able to affect gap junction mediated cell behavior to enhance wound healing. Therefore, we set out to investigate the effects of BG on gap junction related behavior of endothelial cells in order to elucidate the mechanisms through which BG is operating. In in\u00a0vitro studies, BG ion extracts prevented death of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) following hypoxia in a dose dependent manner, possibly through connexin hemichannel modulation. In addition, BG showed stimulatory effects on gap junction communication between HUVECs and upregulated connexin43 (Cx43) expression. Furthermore, BG prompted expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor as well as their receptors, and vascular endothelial cadherin in HUVECs, all of which are beneficial for vascularization. In\u00a0vivo wound healing results showed that the wound closure of full-thickness excisional wounds of rats was accelerated by BG with reduced inflammation during initial stages of healing and stimulated angiogenesis during the proliferation stage. Therefore, BG can stimulate wound healing through affecting gap junctions and gap junction related endothelial cell behaviors, including prevention of endothelial cell death following hypoxia, stimulation of gap junction communication and upregulation of critical vascular growth factors, which contributes to the enhancement of angiogenesis in the wound bed and finally to accelerate wound healing. Although many studies have reported that BG stimulates angiogenesis and wound healing, this work reveals the relationship between BG and gap junction connexin 43 mediated endothelial cell behavior and elucidates one of the possible mechanisms through which BG stimulates wound healing.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-01-29", "authors": ["HaiyanLi", "JinHe", "HongfeiYu", "Colin RGreen", "JiangChang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.033"}

In particular, reducing the exposure or erosion of vaginal implants to obtain improved functional reconstruction is challenging. There is an urgent need for the development of new materials and/or products for POP treatment. A nanofibrous biomimetic mesh was recently developed to address this issue.\nIn this study, the basic properties of the newly developed mesh, including structural characteristics, mechanical properties, biological response of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, and tissue regeneration and biocompatibility in vivo, were evaluated and compared with those of Gynemesh\u2122PS.\nScanning electron microscopy and uniaxial tensile methods were used to evaluate microstructure and mechanical properties, respectively. Mesenchymal stem cell growth on the meshes was observed by fluorescence microscopy to visualize the expression of enhanced red fluorescent protein. Twenty-four mature female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to two groups: group 1 (nanofibrous biomimetic mesh, Medprin, Germany, n=12) and group 2 (Gynemesh(TM)PS, Ethicon, USA; n=12). The posterior vaginal wall was incised from the introitus, and the mesh was then implanted. Three implants of each type were tested for 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Connective tissue organization, inflammation, vascularization, and regenerated tissue were histologically assessed.\nThe nanofibrous biomimetic mesh is a relatively heavy material and exhibited lower porosity than Gynemesh(TM)PS. The new mesh was stiffer than Gynemesh(TM)PS (p<0.001) but supported human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell attachment. Erosion of the grafts did not occur in any animal. The nanofibrous biomimetic mesh was encapsulated by a thicker layer of connective tissue and was associated with significantly greater inflammatory scores compared with Gynemesh(TM)PS. At 12 weeks, the vascularization of the new mesh was greater than that of Gynemesh(TM)PS (p<0.05). No significant difference in the thickness of the smooth muscle layer following implantation was observed between the two groups (p>0.05).\nThe nanofibrous biomimetic mesh is a candidate for reinforcing pelvic reconstruction. The mesh could be improved by decreasing its weight and stiffness and increasing its porosity.

The Boston keratoprosthesis (B-KPro) is a final option for patients with end-stage corneal disease and a poor prognosis with conventional penetrating keratoplasty. In this article the results of the first 13 eyes that received a B-KPro type I at the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Cologne, Germany are reported and the usefulness of postoperative slit-lamp optical coherence tomography (SL-OCT) for control purposes is evaluated.\nAll recipients of a B-KPro type I between September 2013 and May 2015 were included in the study. The feasibility of the operation, clinical outcomes, complications and revision surgery were investigated. The visualization of wound healing by SL-OCT was analyzed.\nThe age of the patients ranged from 26 to 92 years (mean 57.3\u2009\u00b1\u200920.9 years). In all 13 eyes from 12 patients (6 males and 6 females) dense corneal opacification with vascularization and sometimes also conjunctivalization was present. Preoperative visual acuity was reduced and ranged from mere light perception up to a maximum of 1/35 eye chart. All 13 eyes could be supplied with a B-KPro type I without any intraoperative complications, in 6 eyes no significant postoperative complications occurred, whereas in 7 eyes various additional surgical interventions were required and 1 B-KPro could not be preserved. Postoperative visual acuity ranged from light perception to 20/32 and was significantly improved in 85\u2009% of the treated eyes. The use of SL-OCT reproducibly allowed the postoperative assessment of stromal thinning.\nThe B-KPro provides the possibility of visual rehabilitation in high-risk eyes that could never be achieved without artificial cornea replacement.

Because muscle is known to respond to mechanical loading, we investigated instead whether a material system capable of massage-like compressions could promote regeneration. Magnetic actuation of biphasic ferrogel scaffolds implanted at the site of muscle injury resulted in uniform cyclic compressions that led to reduced fibrous capsule formation around the implant, as well as reduced fibrosis and inflammation in the injured muscle.

{"title": "Heterotopic Vascularized Joint Transfer in Mutilating Hand Injuries.", "abstract": "In cases of mutilating hand injuries, the primary goal is recovery of prehensile function. This is particularly true in the case of joints, which are extremely difficult to replace or reconstruct adequately when damaged. Heterotopic vascularized joint transfer is indicated when salvageable joints are available for transfer to a more functionally optimal position on the hand.\nSeven cases of mutilating hand injuries treated with heterotopic vascularized joint transfers from 2003 to 2012 were retrospectively identified. All patients sustained severe metacarpophalangeal joint (MPJ) or proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) damage that threatened recovery of optimal hand function. All patients were men, with an average age of 34.7 years. Operative, perioperative, and postoperative details including final active range of motion were collected and analyzed.\nSeven joints were taken from nonsalvageable amputated digits: 4 from the amputated parts, and 3 from the proximal stumps. Five joints were transferred as free flaps requiring microvascular anastomosis, and 2 were transferred on neurovascular pedicles. One joint was lost due to vasospasm. Average active range of motion was 68.3\u00b0 for homojoint transfers (MPJ to MPJ, PIPJ to PIPJ), and 35\u00b0 for heterojoint transfers. All but 1 patient were able to achieve tripod pinch; the remaining patient achieved only side-to-side pinch.\nHeterotopic vascularized joint transfer is a useful technique to consider in cases of mutilating hand injuries. Improved recovery of prehensile function can be achieved with thoughtful design and execution, followed by proper patient education and rehabilitation.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2016-01-26", "authors": ["Nai-JenChang", "Johnny TChang", "Chung-ChenHsu", "Cheng-HungLin", "Chih-HungLin", "Yu-TeLin"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0000000000000712"}

Reconstruction of a full-length finger with normal appearance, in patients with proximal digital amputation, remains a challenge.\nBetween January 2002 and November 2013, a total of 86 fingers (60 patients) with proximal phalanx amputation were surgically repaired. A compound flap comprising an expanded wraparound flap from the great toe and a vascularized proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint from the second toe was harvested to reconstruct a full-length finger. The flap was used to reconstruct the nail, skin, and the distal phalanx; the PIP joint was used to reconstruct the PIP joint. To attain normal length of the finger and right PIP joint positioning, an iliac bone graft was inserted into the distal-middle or proximal phalanx.\nAll reconstructed fingers retained their viability and natural appearance and were of near-normal length with a normal PIP joint positioning; 12.8% (9/86) of the procedures required re-exploration owing to compromised circulation. Secondary procedures were required in 71% (61/86) of the cases. With the exception of 1 case, the donor-site complications were mild; the average range of motion at the other PIP joints was 52 degrees (-15 to -5 degrees of extension, 25-90 degrees of flexion). Approximately 80% of the normal functionality and 93% of the normal appearance with respect to aesthetics were restored.\nThe full-length finger reconstruction procedure allows for construction of natural-appearing full-length fingers with normal PIP joint positioning and a near-normal functional recovery for proximal digital amputation.

{"title": "A Mobile Extracorporeal Extremity Salvage System for Replantation and Transplantation.", "abstract": "Traumatic amputation is the second leading cause of limb loss in the United States. The preferred treatment is salvage and replantation of the amputated limb, whenever possible, and allotransplantation is a novel procedure whereby healthy limbs are procured from deceased organ donors and transplanted into the amputee recipient. A major restriction for both procedures is the irrecoverable muscle damage occurring due to ischemia. We investigated the feasibility of using a novel lightweight, mobile perfusion device specifically designed to perfuse amputated porcine limbs with an acellular perfusion solution to delay ischemic muscle damage prior to transplantation or replantation.\nBilateral hind limbs of Yorkshire pigs were amputated; one of the limbs was preserved by perfusion in the mobile perfusion device, and the other by storage in ice slurry for 12 hours.\nFive sets of bilateral limbs were preserved as described previously. A defined pressure of 30 mm Hg was reliably maintained in the arterial system without loss of flow. Comparison of the perfusate composition before and after limb passage revealed significant differences. Muscle biopsies showed a consistent progression of clusters of hypoxic cells in the control limbs with time. Similar changes could not be observed in the perfused tissue.\nWe have designed and built a small, mobile perfusion device that is operational and that more closely mimics the normal physiological environment when compared with the current standard of preservation in ice slurry.

In this study, it was aimed to research the effects of desferroxamine (DFO) application on bone and bone graft healing due to the effects of osteoblast and osteoclast regulation and stimulation of angiogenesis.\nRat zygomatic arch critical-size bone defect model (5 mm) was used as the experimental model. Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats (64 zygomatic arches) were divided into 4 groups (16 zygomatic arches in each). In groups 1 and 2, defects were reconstructed with the bone grafts harvested from the other side, and the right arc was named as group 1, and the left was group 2. At group 1, 200 \u03bcM/300 \u03bcL dosage of DFO was injected at the zygomatic arch region starting at the seventh day preoperatively and lasting until the 45th day postoperatively. Group 2 animals were defined as the control group of group 1, and 0.9% NaCl injection was applied. In groups 3 and 4, there was no repair after the formation of defects, and the right arc region was treated with DFO, and left was treated with 0.9% NaCl for postoperative 45 days, respectively. Radiological (computed tomography), histological (hematoxylin-eosin), and biomechanical (3-point bending test) tests were used for the evaluation.\nIn radiological evaluation, there was a statistically significant decrease (P < 0.05) in bone defect size in group 3 animals at the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks, and bone graft volume showed a statistical difference at all weeks (P < 0.05). In histological evaluation, it was observed that there was an increase in osteoblast number and vascularity rates (P < 0.05) in the DFO-treated groups at all weeks. Biomechanical evaluation of the subjects showed increase in bone strength in group 1 animals at 12 weeks.\nIn this study, it was shown that DFO treatment increased bone graft incorporation and healing in critical-size bone defects. In this aspect, we suggest that DFO can be used to increase graft incorporation in risky areas and reduce the defect size in patients who are not suitable for vascularized bone graft transfer.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2016-01-26", "authors": ["SerbulentGuzey", "AndacAykan", "SerdarOzturk", "HakanAvsever", "YildirimKarslioglu", "AtillaErtan"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0000000000000679"}

{"title": "Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff.", "abstract": "Calcific tendinitis within the rotator cuff tendon is a common shoulder disorder that should be differentiated from dystrophic calcification as the pathogenesis and natural history of both is totally different. Calcific tendinitis usually occurs in the fifth and sixth decades of life among sedentary workers. It is classified into formative and resorptive phases. The chronic formative phase results from transient hypoxia that is commonly associated with repeated microtrauma causing calcium deposition into the matrix vesicles within the chondrocytes forming bone foci that later coalesce. This phase may extend from 1 to 6 years, and is usually asymptomatic. The resorptive phase extends from 3 wk up to 6 mo with vascularization at the periphery of the calcium deposits causing macrophage and mononuclear giant cell infiltration, together with fibroblast formation leading to an aggressive inflammatory reaction with inflammatory cell accumulation, excessive edema and rise of the intra-tendineous pressure. This results in a severely painful shoulder. Radiological investigations confirm the diagnosis and suggest the phase of the condition and are used to follow its progression. Although routine conventional X-ray allows detection of the deposits, magnetic resonance imaging studies allow better evaluation of any coexisting pathology. Various methods of treatment have been suggested. The appropriate method should be individualized for each patient. Conservative treatment includes pain killers and physiotherapy, or \"minimally invasive\" techniques as needling or puncture and aspiration. It is almost always successful since the natural history of the condition ends with resorption of the deposits and complete relief of pain. Due to the intolerable pain of the acute and severely painful resorptive stage, the patient often demands any sort of operative intervention. In such case arthroscopic removal is the best option as complete removal of the deposits is unnecessary.", "journal": "World journal of orthopedics", "date": "2016-01-26", "authors": ["Mohamed TahaElShewy"], "doi": "10.5312/wjo.v7.i1.55"}

In pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) VEGF expression is higher in benign and low-grade tumors and associated with good prognosis (neuroendocrine paradox) while the VEGF role in gastrointestinal NETs (GI-NETs) is still unclear. In this study, we examined the VEGF-1154A/G polymorphism in 145 GEP-NET patients and 150 controls. Next, we measured VEGF serum levels and VEGF tumor protein expression, comparing it with Ki67 and tumor grade. Patients' VEGF serum levels were compared with VEGF -1145A/G genotypes and metastatic status as well as with chromogranin A (CgA) and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) in case of GI-NET patients. In this study GEP-NET patients had elevated VEGF serum values when compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0013). VEGF-1145G allele correlated with higher VEGF serum levels (p = 0.002).

{"title": "The potential role of telocytes in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine.", "abstract": "Research and ideas for potential applications in the field of Tissue Engineering (TE) and Regenerative Medicine (RM) have been constantly increasing over recent years, basically driven by the fundamental human dream of repairing and regenerating lost tissue and organ functions. The basic idea of TE is to combine cells with putative stem cell properties with extracellular matrix components, growth factors and supporting matrices to achieve independently growing tissue. As a side effect, in the past years, more insights have been gained into cell-cell interaction and how to manipulate cell behavior. However, to date the ideal cell source has still to be found. Apart from commonly known various stem cell sources, telocytes (TC) have recently attracted increasing attention because they might play a potential role for TE and RM. It becomes increasingly evident that TC provide a regenerative potential and act in cellular communication through their network-forming telopodes. While TE in vitro experiments can be the first step, the key for elucidating their regenerative role will be the investigation of the interaction of TC with the surrounding tissue. For later clinical applications further steps have to include an upscaling process of vascularization of engineered tissue. Arteriovenous loop models to vascularize such constructs provide an ideal platform for preclinical testing of future therapeutic concepts in RM.

These ECS cells grow as non-attached spheroids, and display enhanced migration and invasion. We show that ECS cell-produced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is required for the maintenance of this phenotype, as knockdown of VEGF-A gene expression or treatment with VEGF-A-inactivating antibody reduces these responses. In addition, treatment with bevacizumab reduces tumor vascularity and growth. Surprisingly, the classical mechanism of VEGF-A action via interaction with VEGF receptors does not mediate these events, as these cells lack VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Instead, VEGF-A acts via the neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) co-receptor. Knockdown of NRP-1 inhibits ECS cell spheroid formation, invasion and migration, and attenuates tumor formation.

However, the molecular processes regulating normal papillary outgrowth during the postnatal period are unclear. In this study, transcriptional profiling of the renal medulla across postnatal development revealed enrichment of non-canonical Wnt signalling, vascular development, and planar cell polarity genes, all of which may contribute to perinatal medulla/papilla maturation. These pathways were investigated in a model of papillary hypoplasia with functional obstruction, the Crim1(KST264/KST264) transgenic mouse. Postnatal elongation of the renal papilla via convergent extension was unaffected in the Crim1(KST264/KST264) hypoplastic renal papilla.

{"title": "Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells in Stromal Evolution and Cancer Progression.", "abstract": "The study of cancer biology has mainly focused on malignant epithelial cancer cells, although tumors also contain a stromal compartment, which is composed of stem cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs), endothelial cells, immune cells, adipocytes, cytokines, and various types of macromolecules comprising the extracellular matrix (ECM). The tumor stroma develops gradually in response to the needs of epithelial cancer cells during malignant progression initiating from increased local vascular permeability and ending to remodeling of desmoplastic loosely vascularized stromal ECM. The constant bidirectional interaction of epithelial cancer cells with the surrounding microenvironment allows damaged stromal cell usage as a source of nutrients for cancer cells, maintains the stroma renewal thus resembling a wound that does not heal, and affects the characteristics of tumor mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). Although MSCs have been shown to coordinate tumor cell growth, dormancy, migration, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance, recently they have been successfully used in treatment of hematopoietic malignancies to enhance the effect of total body irradiation-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy. Hence, targeting the stromal elements in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics and usage of MSCs to attenuate graft-versus-host disease may offer new strategies to overcome cancer treatment failure and relapse of the disease.", "journal": "Stem cells international", "date": "2016-01-23", "authors": ["FrancescaCammarota", "Mikko OLaukkanen"], "doi": "10.1155/2016/4824573\n10.1084/jem.4.5-6.559\n10.1084/jem.16.2.149\n10.1084/jem.18.4.397\n10.1002/path.1711530209\n10.1002/1097-0142(19871015)60:8<1757::AID-CNCR2820600814>3.0.CO;2-W\n10.1038/bjc.1992.14\n10.1182/blood-2005-08-3210\n10.1002/path.1711230306\n10.1038/nm1101-1194\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1231\n10.1038/nm0797-730\n10.1038/nature03128\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.05.007\n10.1158/1541-7786.mcr-12-0274\n10.1016/j.canlet.2014.07.047\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.01.040\n10.1016/0304-419x(89)90004-8\n10.1074/jbc.m109.009894\n10.1016/j.tcb.2005.05.001\n10.1073/pnas.041359198\n10.1007/bf00717735\n10.1073/pnas.1018438108\n10.1182/blood-2011-07-358432\n10.1056/nejm198612253152606\n10.1371/journal.pone.0012180\n10.1515/bchm3.1992.373.2.611\n10.1101/cshperspect.a006544\n10.1055/s-0034-1370766\n10.1038/ncb3015\n10.1007/s00268-005-0391-4\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2011.03791.x\n10.1007/s00428-013-1484-3\n10.1002/emmm.201000073\n10.1016/j.matbio.2008.10.001\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.06.034\n10.1016/j.tcb.2012.08.009\n10.1073/pnas.95.21.12468\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2464\n10.1038/nature06188\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0538\n10.1172/JCI45273\n10.1242/jcs.02932\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1406\n10.1002/stem.187\n10.1155/2013/130763\n10.1371/journal.pone.0004992\n10.1186/1475-2867-14-41\n10.1007/s10555-012-9415-3\n10.1093/molehr/gag064\n10.1002/ijc.28848\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-08-1357\n10.1074/jbc.m308083200\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-12-0877\n10.1091/mbc.E08-03-0321\n10.1371/journal.pone.0035036\n10.1371/journal.pone.0010088\n10.1182/blood.v99.10.3838\n10.1038/sj.leu.2404489\n10.1309/ajcpqzqn50hkiaha\n10.1016/j.lungcan.2008.08.007\n10.1016/j.orthres.2004.05.003\n10.1038/nature05372\n10.14343/JCSCR.2014.2e1003\n10.1016/j.stem.2014.10.001\n10.1073/pnas.1310501111\n10.1089/scd.2011.0691\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.024\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2372\n10.1038/ni.2026\n10.1073/pnas.1120358109\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.02.020\n10.1073/pnas.0510511103\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033739\n10.1002/stem.1361\n10.1089/scd.2013.0249\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.07.023\n10.1016/0014-4827(61)90348-2\n10.1084/jem.131.4.863\n10.1073/pnas.011417098\n10.1038/nm.2385\n10.1002/stem.559\n10.1016/j.bbmt.2013.11.001\n10.1038/bmt.2008.348\n10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.02.001\n10.1158/2159-8290.cd-13-0040\n10.1126/science.1171362\n10.4049/jimmunol.165.10.5502\n10.1002/1097-0215(200102)9999:9999&lt;::AID-IJC1170>3.0.CO;2-U\n10.1159/000069863\n10.1186/1479-5876-11-187\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2805\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082658\n10.1172/jci26532\n10.1159/000309252\n10.1053/gast.2003.50147\n10.1002/ijc.22217"}
{"title": "Priming Dental Pulp Stem Cells With Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 Increases Angiogenesis of Implanted Tissue-Engineered Constructs Through Hepatocyte Growth Factor and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Secretion.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering strategies based on implanting cellularized biomaterials are promising therapeutic approaches for the reconstruction of large tissue defects. A major hurdle for the reliable establishment of such therapeutic approaches is the lack of rapid blood perfusion of the tissue construct to provide oxygen and nutrients. Numerous sources of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) displaying angiogenic potential have been characterized in the past years, including the adult dental pulp. Establishment of efficient strategies for improving angiogenesis in tissue constructs is nevertheless still an important challenge. Hypoxia was proposed as a priming treatment owing to its capacity to enhance the angiogenic potential of stem cells through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release. The present study aimed to characterize additional key factors regulating the angiogenic capacity of such MSCs, namely, dental pulp stem cells derived from deciduous teeth (SHED). We identified fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) as a potent inducer of the release of VEGF and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) by SHED. We found that FGF-2 limited hypoxia-induced downregulation of HGF release. Using three-dimensional culture models of angiogenesis, we demonstrated that VEGF and HGF were both responsible for the high angiogenic potential of SHED through direct targeting of endothelial cells. In addition, FGF-2 treatment increased the fraction of Stro-1+/CD146+ progenitor cells. We then applied in vitro FGF-2 priming to SHED before encapsulation in hydrogels and in vivo subcutaneous implantation. Our results showed that FGF-2 priming is more efficient than hypoxia at increasing SHED-induced vascularization compared with nonprimed controls. Altogether, these data demonstrate that FGF-2 priming enhances the angiogenic potential of SHED through the secretion of both HGF and VEGF.", "journal": "Stem cells translational medicine", "date": "2016-01-23", "authors": ["CarolineGorin", "Gael YRochefort", "RumeyzaBascetin", "HanruYing", "JulieLesieur", "J\u00e9r\u00e9mySadoine", "NathanBeckouche", "SarahBerndt", "AnitaNovais", "MatthieuLesage", "BenoitHosten", "LaetitiaVercellino", "PascalMerlet", "DominiqueLe-Denmat", "CarmenMarchiol", "DidierLetourneur", "AntoninoNicoletti", "Sibylle OpsahlVital", "AnnePoliard", "BenjaminSalmon", "LaurentMuller", "CatherineChaussain", "St\u00e9phaneGermain"], "doi": "10.5966/sctm.2015-0166"}

The aim of the present study was to investigate the detailed histopathological features of eHCC. We investigated 66 small vaguely nodular lesions resected from 40 patients. The degree of cellular and structural atypia and stromal invasion were assessed. The immunohistochemical expression of HCC-related markers adenylate cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), Bmi-1, CD34 and h-caldesmon were evaluated. Of the 66 nodules, 10 were diagnosed as low-grade dysplastic nodules (LGDN), 10 as high-grade dysplastic nodules (HGDN) and 46 as eHCC. Among the 46 eHCC, 18 nodules (39.1%) showed marked stromal invasion and/or the presence of the scirrhous component and were subclassified as high-grade eHCC (HGeHCC). The remaining 28 eHCC, which lacked these features, were subclassified as low-grade eHCC (LGeHCC) and were examined further. HGeHCC showed high levels of cellular and structural atypia and large tumor size. The immunohistochemical expression of CAP2 and the area of sinusoidal vascularization showed increases from LGDN to HGeHCC. The density of arterial tumor vessels was high in HGeHCC compared with other nodule types. Cluster analysis of these parameters subclassified 65 nodules into HGeHCC-dominant, LGeHCC and HGDN-dominant, and LGDN-dominant groups. These results indicate the increased malignant potential of HGeHCC and suggest that it is already a transitional stage to advanced HCC.

The ability of the reconstructed mandible to grow remains controversial, and associated factors are unclear. A systematic search of the English-language and Chinese literature was conducted for the period January 1989 to April 2014 using selected key words associated with the topic. Individual patients aged <18 years who underwent mandibular reconstruction with the vascularized fibula flap and had known outcomes related to growth potential were included. Data on postoperative growth and associated factors, including condylar management, age at reconstruction, malignancy, and postoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy, were reviewed systematically. In total, 51 patients reported in 15 articles were included. The proportion of patients with a preserved growth potential (58.8%) was higher than that of patients with no growth potential.

{"title": "Involvement of ion channels and transporters in carcinoma angiogenesis and metastasis.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a finely tuned process, which is the result of the equilibrium between pro- and antiangiogenic factors. In solid tumor angiogenesis, the balance is highly in favor of the production of new, but poorly functional blood vessels, initially intended to provide growing tumors with nutrients and oxygen. Among the numerous proteins involved in tumor development, several types of ion channels are overexpressed in tumor cells, as well as in stromal and endothelial cells. Ion channels thus actively participate in the different hallmarks of cancer, especially in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Indeed, from their strategic localization in the plasma membrane, ion channels are key operators of cell signaling, as they sense and respond to environmental changes. This review aims to decipher how ion channels of different families are intricately involved in the fundamental angiogenesis and metastasis hallmarks, which lead from a nascent tumor to systemic dissemination. An overview of the possible use of ion channels as therapeutic targets will also be given, showing that ion channel inhibitors or specific antibodies may provide effective tools, in the near future, in the treatment of carcinomas.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Whom to blame for metastasis, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition or the tumor microenvironment?", "abstract": "Changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can trigger the activation of otherwise non-malignant cells to become highly aggressive and motile. This is evident during initial tumor growth when the poor vascularization in tumors generates hypoxic regions that trigger the latent embryonic program, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in epithelial carcinoma cells (e-cars) leading to highly motile mesenchymal-like carcinoma cells (m-cars), which also acquire cancer stem cell properties. After that, specific bidirectional interactions take place between m-cars and the cellular components of TME at different stages of metastasis. These interactions include several vicious positive feedback loops in which m-cars trigger a phenotypic switch, causing normal stromal cells to become pro-tumorigenic, which then further promote the survival, motility, and proliferation of m-cars. Accordingly, there is not a single culprit accounting for metastasis. Instead both m-cars and the TME dynamically interact, evolve and promote metastasis. In this review, we discuss the current status of the known interactions between m-cars and the TME during different stages of metastasis and how these interactions promote the metastatic activity of highly malignant m-cars by promoting their invasive mesenchymal phenotype and CSC properties.", "journal": "Cancer letters", "date": "2016-01-23", "authors": ["MPietil\u00e4", "JIvaska", "S AMani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.canlet.2015.12.033"}

Integration of synthetic implants with host tissue can be problematic but could be improved by topographical modifications. We describe optimization of POSS-PCU by dispersion of porogens (sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium chloride (NaCl) and sucrose) onto the material surface, with the principle aim of increasing surface porosity, thus providing additional opportunities for improved cellular and vascular ingrowth. We assess the effect of the porogens on the material's mechanical strength, surface chemistry, wettability and cytocompatibilty. Surface porosity was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). There was no alteration in surface chemistry and wettability and only modest changes in mechanical properties were detected. The size of porogens correlated well with the porosity of the construct produced and larger porogens improved interconnectivity of spaces within constructs. Using primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) we demonstrate moderate in vitro cytocompatibility for all surface modifications; however, larger pores resulted in cellular aggregation. These cells were able to differentiate on POSS-PCU scaffolds. Implantation of the scaffold in vivo demonstrated that larger pore sizes favor cellular integration and vascular ingrowth. These experiments demonstrate that surface modification with large porogens can improve POSS-PCU nanocomposite scaffold integration and suggest the need to strike a balance between the non-porous surfaces required for epithelial coverage and the porous structure required for integration and vascularization of synthetic scaffolds in future construct design.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-01-21", "authors": ["ClaireCrowley", "PoramateKlanrit", "Colin RButler", "AikateriniVaranou", "ManuelaPlat\u00e9", "Robert EHynds", "Rachel CChambers", "Alexander MSeifalian", "Martin ABirchall", "Sam MJanes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.01.005\n10.1155/2011/290602"}
{"title": "Modelling radiation-induced cell death and tumour re-oxygenation: local versus global and instant versus delayed cell death.", "abstract": "The resistance of hypoxic cells to radiation, due to the oxygen dependence of radiosensitivity, is well known and must be taken into account to accurately calculate the radiation induced cell death. A proper modelling of the response of tumours to radiation requires deriving the distribution of oxygen at a microscopic scale. This usually involves solving the reaction-diffusion equation in tumour voxels using a vascularization distribution model. Moreover, re-oxygenation arises during the course of radiotherapy, one reason being the increase of available oxygen caused by cell killing, which can turn hypoxic tumours into oxic. In this work we study the effect of cell death kinetics in tumour oxygenation modelling, analysing how it affects the timing of re-oxygenation, surviving fraction and tumour control. Two models of cell death are compared, an instantaneous cell killing, mimicking early apoptosis, and a delayed cell death scenario in which cells can die shortly after being damaged, as well as long after irradiation. For each of these scenarios, the decrease in oxygen consumption due to cell death can be computed globally (macroscopic voxel average) or locally (microscopic). A re-oxygenation model already used in the literature, the so called full re-oxygenation, is also considered. The impact of cell death kinetics and re-oxygenation on tumour responses is illustrated for two radiotherapy fractionation schemes: a conventional schedule, and a hypofractionated treatment. The results show large differences in the doses needed to achieve 50% tumour control for the investigated cell death models. Moreover, the models affect the tumour responses differently depending on the treatment schedule. This corroborates the complex nature of re-oxygenation, showing the need to take into account the kinetics of cell death in radiation response models.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2016-01-21", "authors": ["AraceliGago-Arias", "PabloAguiar", "IgnacioEspinoza", "BeatrizS\u00e1nchez-Nieto", "JuanPardo-Montero"], "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/61/3/1204"}

A major obstacle has been low islet cell survival due largely to the innate inflammatory response. Connexin43 (Cx43) channels play a key role in early inflammation and have proven to be viable therapeutic targets. Even if cell death due to early inflammation is avoided, insufficient vascularization is a primary obstacle to maintaining the viability of implanted cells. We have invented technologies targeting the inflammatory response and poor vascularization: a Cx43 mimetic peptide that inhibits inflammation and a novel prevascularized tissue engineered construct. We combined these technologies with isolated islets to create a prevascularized bioartificial pancreas that is resistant to the innate inflammatory response. Immunoconfocal microscopy showed that constructs containing islets express insulin and possess a vascular network similar to constructs without islets. Glucose stimulated islet-containing constructs displayed reduced insulin secretion compared to islets alone. However, labeling for insulin post-glucose stimulation revealed that the constructs expressed abundant levels of insulin. This discrepancy was found to be due to the expression of insulin degrading enzyme. These results suggest that the prevascularized bioartificial pancreas is potentially a tool for improving long-term islet cell survival in vivo.", "journal": "Journal of diabetes research", "date": "2016-01-21", "authors": ["J MatthewRhett", "HongjunWang", "HeatherBainbridge", "LiliSong", "Michael JYost"], "doi": "10.1155/2016/7262680\n10.1053/j.gastro.2013.02.008\n10.1038/ctg.2015.2\n10.2337/diabetes.51.1.66\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2005.01157.x\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2011.12.040\n10.1001/archsurg.135.9.1106\n10.1208/s12248-010-9175-3\n10.1097/SAP.0b013e3182012597\n10.1023/a:1008965826397\n10.1097/01.sap.0000151459.07978.fa\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.078\n10.1016/j.cub.2003.09.007\n10.1189/jlb.0802406\n10.1002/bdrc.21019\n10.2217/17460751.4.2.205\n10.1097/prs.0b013e3181a0741d\n10.2337/diabetes.48.10.1907\n10.1111/j.1399-3089.2007.00419.x\n10.1111/ajt.12558\n10.1126/science.1195491\n10.1126/science.1132559\n10.1089/ten.teb.2013.0554\n10.1042/bj20082319\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.10.003\n10.1007/s00232-012-9465-z\n10.1016/j.brainres.2012.08.042\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.12.005\n10.1161/01.RES.0000250174.31269.70\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002801\n10.1167/iovs.04-1181\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07210.x\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2011.06.005\n10.1097/01.tp.0000229023.38873.c0\n10.1038/jid.2014.318\n10.1111/wrr.12275\n10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0651\n10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00424-9\n10.1080/cac.10.4-6.431.435\n10.1089/ten.teb.2013.0541\n10.1007/s10439-014-0986-8\n10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0183\n10.1097/sap.0000000000000439\n10.1073/pnas.97.24.13003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050265\n10.2337/diabetes.54.5.1400\n10.1016/S1054-8807(02)00166-7\n10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.035\n10.1002/dvdy.10339\n10.1002/dvdy.20101\n10.1073/pnas.92.17.7657\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.01.013\n10.2337/db08-0814\n10.1155/2013/352315\n10.1172/jci36209\n10.1038/nature06063\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026379\n10.1002/ar.a.20232\n10.1186/s12885-015-1229-6\n10.1091/mbc.E10-06-0548\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.01.012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.235747\n10.1016/j.febslet.2014.02.047\n10.1016/j.neulet.2004.07.034\n10.1002/jnr.20809\n10.1186/1750-1326-4-4\n10.1038/nbt.2842\n10.2337/db07-0981\n10.1126/science.6776628\n10.3389/fncel.2014.00306\n10.1007/s00232-012-9488-5"}

{"title": "PlexinD1 is required for proper patterning of the periocular vascular network and for the establishment of corneal avascularity during avian ocular development.", "abstract": "The anterior eye is comprised of an avascular cornea surrounded by a dense periocular vascular network and therefore serves as an excellent model for angiogenesis. Although signaling through PlexinD1 underlies various vascular patterning events during embryonic development, its role during the formation of the periocular vascular network is yet to be determined. Our recent study showed that PlexinD1 mRNA is expressed by periocular angioblasts and blood vessels during ocular vasculogenesis in patterns that suggest its involvement with Sema3 ligands that are concurrently expressed in the anterior eye. In this study, we used in vivo knockdown experiments to determine the role of PlexinD1 during vascular patterning in the anterior eye of the developing avian embryos. Knockdown of PlexinD1 in the anterior eye caused mispatterning of the vascular network in the presumptive iris, which was accompanied by lose of vascular integrity and profuse hemorrhaging in the anterior chamber. We also observed ectopic vascularization of the cornea in PlexinD1 knockdown eyes, which coincided with the formation of the limbal vasculature in controls. Finally we show that Sema3E and Sema3C transcripts are expressed in ocular tissue that is devoid of vasculature. These results indicate that PlexinD1 plays a critical role during vascular patterning in the iris and limbus, and is essential for the establishment of corneal avascularity during development. We conclude that PlexinD1 is involved in vascular response to antiangiogenic Sema3 signaling that guides the formation of the iris and limbal blood vessels by inhibiting VEGF signaling.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2016-01-20", "authors": ["Sam CKwiatkowski", "Ana FOjeda", "Peter YLwigale"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.01.001"}

In response to injury, typically the balance between macrophage sub-populations shifts from an M1 phenotype (pro-inflammatory) to an M2 phenotype (anti-inflammatory). In tissue engineering scenarios, after implantation of any device, it is desirable to exercise control on this M1-M2 progression and to ensure a timely and smooth transition from the inflammatory to the healing stage. In this review, we briefly introduce the current state of knowledge regarding macrophage function and nomenclature. Next, we discuss the use of controlled release strategies to tune the balance between the M1 and M2 phenotypes in the context of tissue engineering applications. We discuss recent literature related to the release of anti-inflammatory molecules (including nucleic acids) and the sequential release of cytokines to promote a timely M1-M2 shift.

{"title": "Timing effect of intramyocardial hydrogel injection for positively impacting left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Intramyocardial injection of various injectable hydrogel materials has shown benefit in positively impacting the course of left ventricular (LV) remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). However, since LV remodeling is a complex, time dependent process, the most efficacious time of hydrogel injection is not clear. In this study, we injected a relatively stiff, thermoresponsive and bioabsorbable hydrogel in rat hearts at 3 different time points - immediately after MI (IM), 3 d post-MI (3D), and 2 w post-MI (2W), corresponding to the beginnings of the necrotic, fibrotic and chronic remodeling phases. The employed left anterior descending coronary artery ligation model showed expected infarction responses including functional loss, inflammation and fibrosis with distinct time dependent patterns. Changes in LV geometry and contractile function were followed by longitudinal echocardiography for 10 w post-MI. While all injection times positively affected LV function and wall thickness, the 3D group gave better functional outcomes than the other injection times and also exhibited more local vascularization and less inflammatory markers than the earlier injection time. The results indicate an important role for injection timing in the increasingly explored concept of post-MI biomaterial injection therapy and suggest that for hydrogels with mechanical support as primary function, injection at the beginning of the fibrotic phase may provide improved outcomes.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-01-18", "authors": ["TomoYoshizumi", "YangZhu", "HongbinJiang", "AntonioD'Amore", "HirokazuSakaguchi", "JasonTchao", "KimimasaTobita", "William RWagner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.12.002"}

{"title": "Fabrication of biomimetic vascular scaffolds for 3D tissue constructs using vascular corrosion casts.", "abstract": "Vascularization is among the most pressing technical challenges facing tissue engineering of 3D organs. While small engineered constructs can rely solely on vascular infiltration and diffusion from host tissues following implantation, larger avascular constructs do not survive long enough for vessel ingrowth to occur. To address this challenge, strategies for pre-vascularization of engineered constructs have been developed. Various biofabrication techniques have been utilized for pre-vascularization, but limitations exist with respect to the size and complexity of the resulting vessels. To this end, we developed a simple and novel fabrication method to create biomimetic microvascular scaffolds using vascular corrosion casting as a template for pre-vascularization of engineered tissue constructs. Gross and electron microscopic analysis demonstrates that polycaprolactone (PCL)-derived kidney vascular corrosion casts are able to capture the architecture of normal renal tissue and can serve as a sacrificial template for the creation of a collagen-based vascular scaffold. Histological analysis demonstrates that the collagen vascular scaffolds are biomimetic in structure and can be perfused, endothelialized, and embedded in hydrogel tissue constructs. Our scaffold creation method is simple, cost effective, and provides a biomimetic, tissue-specific option for pre-vascularization that is broadly applicable in tissue engineering.\nTissues in the body are vascularized to provide nutrients to the cells within the tissues and carry away waste, but creating tissue engineered constructs with functional vascular networks has been challenging. Current biofabrication techniques can incorporate blood vessel-like structures with straight or simple branching patterns into tissue constructs. Unfortunately, these techniques are expensive, complicated and create simplified versions of the complex vessel structures seen in native tissue. Our technique uses novel vascular corrosion casts of normal tissue as templates to create vascular scaffolds that are a copy of normal vessels. These vascular scaffolds can be easily incorporated into 3D tissue constructs. Our process is simple, inexpensive and inherently tissue-specific, making it widely applicable in the field of tissue engineering.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2016-01-17", "authors": ["JenniferHuling", "In KapKo", "AnthonyAtala", "James JYoo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2016.01.005"}
{"title": "Vegfa signaling promotes zebrafish intestinal vasculature development through endothelial cell migration from the posterior cardinal vein.", "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying organ vascularization are not well understood. The zebrafish intestinal vasculature forms early, is easily imaged using transgenic lines and in-situ hybridization, and develops in a stereotypical pattern thus making it an excellent model for investigating mechanisms of organ specific vascularization. Here, we demonstrate that the sub-intestinal vein (SIV) and supra-intestinal artery (SIA) form by a novel mechanism from angioblasts that migrate out of the posterior cardinal vein and coalesce to form the intestinal vasculature in an anterior to posterior wave with the SIA forming after the SIV. We show that vascular endothelial growth factor aa (vegfaa) is expressed in the endoderm at the site where intestinal vessels form and therefore likely provides a guidance signal. Vegfa/Vegfr2 signaling is required for early intestinal vasculature development with mutation in vegfaa or loss of Vegfr2 homologs causing nearly complete inhibition of the formation of the intestinal vasculature. Vegfc and Vegfr3 function, however, are dispensable for intestinal vascularization. Interestingly, ubiquitous overexpression of Vegfc resulted in an overgrowth of the SIV, suggesting that Vegfc is sufficient to induce SIV development. These results argue that Vegfa signaling directs endothelial cells to migrate out of existing vasculature and coalesce to form the intestinal vessels. It is likely that a similar mechanism is utilized during vascularization of other organs.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2016-01-16", "authors": ["Andrew LKoenig", "KristinaBaltrunaite", "Neil IBower", "AndreaRossi", "Didier Y RStainier", "Benjamin MHogan", "SauliusSumanas"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.01.002"}

{"title": "Improved fertility in suckled beef cows ovulating large follicles or supplemented with long-acting progesterone after timed-AI.", "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the effects and the interaction of size of the preovulatory follicle (POF) and long-acting progesterone (P4) supplementation after timed-AI on CL function and pregnancy success in beef cows. In experiment 1, ovulations of beef cows were synchronized starting on Day -10, and cows were split to receive sodium cloprostenol (large follicle group; LF; n\u00a0=\u00a031) or nothing (small follicle group; SF; n\u00a0=\u00a035). Ovulations were induced on Day 0, and cows were inseminated. Ovulated cows were assigned to receive placebo (LF/control group, n\u00a0=\u00a014; and SF/control group, n\u00a0=\u00a09) or 150\u00a0mg of long-acting P4 on Day 4.5 (LF/P4 group, n\u00a0=\u00a013; and SF/P4 group, n\u00a0=\u00a012). Diameter of POF, blood flow in POF wall, ovulation rate, and size and vascularization of CL were greater (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in LF group. In experiments 2 (unknown cyclic status) and 4 (noncycling), ovulations were synchronized, and beef cows received placebo or 150\u00a0mg of long-acting P4 on Day 4 after timed-artificial insemination. In experiment 2, pregnancy/AI (P/AI) did not differ (P\u00a0>\u00a00.1) between P4-treated (53.2%; 209/393) and control cows (56.2%; 219/390), but P/AI was greater in cows with a CL\u00a0<\u00a00.9\u00a0cm(2) on Day 4 that were P4-treated (57.9%, 22/38) versus placebo-treated (40.4%, 21/52; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In Experiment 4, P/AI was greater (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in P4-treated cows (55.6%, 105/189 vs. 46.0%, 86/187). In Experiment 3, cyclic-suckled beef cows were treated as described in Experiment 1 to generate animals with small (SF; n\u00a0=\u00a0111) or large POF (LF; n\u00a0=\u00a0109), and subdivided to receive placebo or P4 on Day 4. POF size, ovulation rate, CL area, and P/AI were greater (P\u00a0<\u00a00.007) in the LF group. Pregnancy/AI in ovulated cows were lower (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05) in the SF/control group (41.5%, 17/41) compared to LF/control group (62%, 31/50) and were similar for the SF/P4 group (55.6%, 25/45) and LF/P4 group (57%, 28/49) compared to others. In summary, smaller and less vascularized POF results in less functional CL and reduces ovulatory rate and P/AI in cyclic beef cows; the long-acting P4 injection on Day 4 after timed-artificial insemination may attenuate the negative effects of small POF/CL; and postovulatory P4 supplementation improved fertility in anestrous beef cattle.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2016-01-15", "authors": ["GPugliesi", "F BSantos", "ELopes", "\u00c9Nogueira", "J R GMaio", "MBinelli"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.12.006"}

EHTs were generated from an unpurified cell mix of newborn mouse hearts and were cultured under standard serum-containing conditions.

EC(iLacZ) EHTs showed a dense X-gal-positive vessel-like network with distinct tubular structures. Immunofluorescence revealed that ECs were mainly associated with cardiomyocytes within the EHT. EC(iLacZ) EHT developed spontaneous and regular contractility with forces up to 0.1 mN. Coherent contractility and the presence of an extensive vessel-like network were both dependent on the presence of animal sera in the culture medium. Contractile EC(iLacZ) EHTs successfully served as grafts in implantation studies onto the hearts of immunodeficient mice. Four weeks after implantation, EHTs showed X-gal-positive lumen-forming vessel structures connected to the host myocardium circulation as they contained erythrocytes on a regular basis. Taken together, genetic labeling of ECs revealed the extensive formation of vessel-like structures in EHTs in vitro.

BSP has been less studied than other SIBLING proteins such as Osteopontin (OPN), which is coexpressed with it in several skeletal cell types.

The studies made so far highlight the role of BSP in skeletal mineralization, as well as its importance for proper osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and activity, most prominently in primary/repair bone. The absence of BSP also affects the local environment of the bone tissue, in particular hematopoiesis and vascularization. Interestingly, lack of BSP induces an overexpression of OPN, and the cognate protein could be responsible for some aspects of the BSP gene knockout skeletal phenotype, while replacing BSP for some of its functions.

After a drill-hole injury was made in the tibial growth plate and bone, increased injury site mRNA expression was observed for neurotrophins NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 and their Trk receptors. NT-3 and its receptor TrkC showed the highest induction. NT-3 was localized to repairing cells, whereas TrkC was observed in stromal cells, osteoblasts, and blood vessel cells at the injury site. Moreover, systemic NT-3 immunoneutralization reduced bone volume at injury sites and also reduced vascularization at the injured growth plate, whereas recombinant NT-3 treatment promoted bony repair with elevated levels of mRNA for osteogenic markers and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2) and increased vascularization and mRNA for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelial cell marker CD31 at the injured growth plate. When examined in vitro, NT-3 promoted osteogenesis in rat bone marrow stromal cells, induced Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation, and enhanced expression of BMPs (particularly BMP-2) and VEGF in the mineralizing cells. It also induced CD31 and VEGF mRNA in rat primary endothelial cell culture. BMP activity appears critical for NT-3 osteogenic effect in vitro because it can be almost completely abrogated by co-addition of the BMP inhibitor noggin. Consistent with its angiogenic effect in vivo, NT-3 promoted angiogenesis in metatarsal bone explants, an effect abolished by co-treatment with anti-VEGF. This study suggests that NT-3 may be an osteogenic and angiogenic factor upstream of BMP-2 and VEGF in bony repair, and further studies are required to investigate whether NT-3 may be a potential target for preventing growth plate faulty bony repair or for promoting bone fracture healing. \u00a9 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2016-01-15", "authors": ["Yu-WenSu", "RosaChung", "Chun-ShengRuan", "Shek ManChim", "VincentKuek", "Prem PDwivedi", "MohammadhosseinHassanshahi", "Ke-MingChen", "YangliXie", "LinChen", "Bruce KFoster", "VickiRosen", "Xin-FuZhou", "JiakeXu", "Cory JXian"], "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.2786"}
{"title": "Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase potentiates bevacizumab treatment in cholangiocarcinoma.", "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a unique liver cancer subtype with an increasing incidence globally. The lack of specific symptoms and definite diagnostic markers results in a delayed diagnosis and disease progression. Systemic chemotherapy is commonly selected for advanced CCA even though its advantages remain unknown. Targeted therapy, especially anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, is promising for CCA; however, improvements in the therapeutic regimen are necessary to overcome subsequent resistance. We demonstrated VEGF expression was higher in CCA cell lines than in other liver cancer cells. Secreted VEGFs played roles in the induction of peri- and intra-tumoral vascularization. VEGF neutralization by bevacizumab effectively reduced tumor growth, mainly through the suppression of angiogenesis; however, increases in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) and HIF1\u03b1-responsive genes (such as VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX and CAXII) indicated the potential for subsequent therapeutic resistance. Supplementation with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, enhanced the anti-CCA effects of bevacizumab. Anti-angiogenesis and anti-proliferation were observed with the combination treatment. These results suggested a novel treatment strategy to overcome anti-angiogenesis resistance and the importance of \"induced essentiality\" in the treatment of CCA.", "journal": "Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine", "date": "2016-01-15", "authors": ["KulthidaVaeteewoottacharn", "RyushoKariya", "PaweenaDana", "SawakoFujikawa", "KoukiMatsuda", "KoichiOhkuma", "ErikoKudo", "RatthapholKraiklang", "ChaisiriWongkham", "SopitWongkham", "SeijiOkada"], "doi": "10.1007/s13277-016-4785-8"}

Limited information on its influence on parameters including; tumor growth, vascularization, hypoxia and imaging characteristics is currently available. This study evaluates the potential effect of matrigel use in a human head and neck cancer xenograft model (FaDu; hypopharyngeal carcinoma) in NMRI nude mice. The FaDu cell line was chosen based on its frequent use in studies of cancer imaging and tumor microenvironment.\nNMRI nude mice (n\u2009=\u200934) were divided into two groups and subcutaneously injected with FaDu cells in medium either including (+MG) or excluding matrigel (-MG). In sub study I seven mice from each group (+MG, n\u2009=\u20097; -MG, n\u2009=\u20097) were (18)F- fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT scanned on Day 5, 8, 12, 15, and 19.

Tumors for IHC were collected according to size (200-400 mm(3), 500-700 mm(3), 800-1100 mm(3)).\nFDG uptake and tumor growth was statistically compatible for the tumors established with or without MG. The IHC analysis on all parameters only identified a significantly higher micro vessel density for tumor size 500-700 mm(3) and 800-1100 mm(3) and average vessel area for tumor size 500-700 mm(3) in the -MG group. Comparable variations were observed for tumors of both the +MG and -MG groups. No difference in tumor take rate was observed between groups in study.\nMatrigel did not affect tumor growth or tumor take for the FaDu xenograft model evaluated. Tumors in the -MG group displayed increased angiogenesis compared to the +MG tumors. No difference in (18)F-FDG PET uptake for tumors of different groups was found.

{"title": "Hsp90 inhibitor celastrol reinstates growth plate angiogenesis in thiram-induced tibial dyschondroplasia.", "abstract": "Tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) is an important long bone defect of broiler chickens that disturbs the proximal growth plate and is characterized by non-vascularized cartilage, a distended growth plate and lameness. Celastrol, a medicinal root extract from the plant Tripterygium wilfordii, is reported widely as a well-known heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor. Recently, Hsp90 inhibition in chondrocyte differentiation and growth-plate vascularization were effective in restoring the morphology of the growth plate. The present study was aimed at investigating Hsp90 inhibition in TD using celastrol. The broiler chicks were divided into three groups; Control; TD induced (40 mg/kg thiram) and celastrol treatment. Hsp90, vascular endothelial growth factor and Flk-1 expressions were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and the protein levels of Hsp90 were measured by Western blot analysis. Antioxidant enzymes were determined to assess the liver damage caused by thiram and the protective effects of the medicine were evaluated by levels of serum biomarkers. The expression levels of Hsp90 and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA transcripts were increased while Flk-1 receptor was decreased in TD-affected chicks. Celastrol therapy inhibited Hsp90 mRNA and protein levels and up-regulated the expressions of receptor Flk-1 in TD-affected tibial growth plates significantly (P < 0.05) in addition to rectifying the damaging effects of thiram on the liver by decreasing the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and malondialdehyde and correcting the oxidative imbalance. In conclusion, administering celastrol to dyschondroplastic chicks prevented un-vascularized growth plate, lameness and reinstated angiogenesis. Celastrol may be efficacious for the treatment of TD through the inhibition of Hsp90 expression and limiting the liver damage caused by thiram in broiler chickens.", "journal": "Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A", "date": "2016-01-14", "authors": ["FazulNabi", "MuhammadShahzad", "JingyingLiu", "KunLi", "ZhaoqingHan", "DingZhang", "Muhammad KashifIqbal", "JiakuiLi"], "doi": "10.1080/03079457.2016.1141170"}

However, to realize the true potential of 3D bioprinted tissues for clinical use requires the fabrication of an interconnected and effective vascular network. Solving this challenge is critical, as human tissue relies on an adequate network of blood vessels to transport oxygen, nutrients, other chemicals, biological factors and waste, in and out of the tissue. Here, we have successfully designed and printed a series of novel 3D bone scaffolds with both bone formation supporting structures and highly interconnected 3D microvascular mimicking channels, for efficient and enhanced osteogenic bone regeneration as well as vascular cell growth. Using a chemical functionalization process, we have conjugated our samples with nano hydroxyapatite (nHA), for the creation of novel micro and nano featured devices for vascularized bone growth. We evaluated our scaffolds with mechanical testing, hydrodynamic measurements and in vitro human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) adhesion (4 h), proliferation (1, 3 and 5 d) and osteogenic differentiation (1, 2 and 3 weeks). These tests confirmed bone-like physical properties and vascular-like flow profiles, as well as demonstrated enhanced hMSC adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation.

These include a narrow prepontine space, vascularized third ventricular floor, the presence of prominent blood vessels traversing within the prepontine space, significant basal exudates, thickened and ill-defined third ventricular floor, and distorted floor anatomy. In such situations, an endoscopic lamina terminalis opening may provide a safer and more effective alternative to the standard technique.\nThe paper aims to discuss the different indications, technical nuances, and outcome of endoscopic third ventriculostomy through the lamina terminalis (ETV LT) utilizing the standard transventricular transforaminal route.\nA total of 240 patients underwent ETV between January 2007 and January 2014.

{"title": "Transcriptomic Changes in Osteoblasts Following Endothelial Cell-Cocultivation Suggest a Role of Extracellular Matrix in Cellular Interaction.", "abstract": "Vascularization is important for bone development, fracture healing and engineering of artificial bone tissue. In the context of bone tissue engineering, it was shown that coimplantation of human primary umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human osteoblasts (hOBs) results in the formation of functional blood vessels and enhanced bone regeneration. Implanted endothelial cells do not only contribute to blood vessel formation, but also support proliferation, cell survival and osteogenic differentiation of coimplanted hOBs. These effects are partially mediated by direct heterotypic cell contacts. In a previous report we could show that cocultivated hOBs strongly increase the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) formation in HUVECs, suggesting that ECM may be involved in the intercellular communication between hOBs and HUVECs. The present study aimed at investigating whether comparable changes occur in hOBs. We therefore performed a microarray analysis of hOBs cultivated in direct contact with HUVECs, revealing 1,004 differentially expressed genes. The differentially expressed genes could be assigned to the functional clusters ECM, proliferation, apoptosis and osteogenic differentiation. The microarray data could be confirmed by performing quantitative real time RT-PCR on selected genes. Furthermore, we could show that the ECM produced by HUVECs increased the expression of the osteogenic differentiation marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in hOBs. In summary, our data demonstrate that HUVECs provoke complex changes in gene expression patterns in cocultivated hOBs and that ECM plays and important role in this interaction. J. Cell.

Concurrent ocular disease was present in 40 eyes (91%) and included keratoconjunctivitis sicca, cataracts, and corneal ulcers. Twenty-three dogs (59%) suffered from concurrent systemic disease, most frequently diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, and systemic hypertension. Less commonly, life-threatening systemic conditions were identified in dogs with ICH including immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, metastatic neoplasia, and sepsis. Intracorneal hemorrhage was found in all corneal locations, and corneal vascularization was present in each affected eye.\nIntracorneal hemorrhage is an uncommon condition in dogs that occurs in association with corneal vascularization. The risk of ICH may be increased due to certain ocular and systemic diseases. Although uncommon, ICH may also be an ocular manifestation of severe immune-mediated, infectious, and neoplastic systemic diseases in dogs.", "journal": "Veterinary ophthalmology", "date": "2016-01-11", "authors": ["Nathaniel PViolette", "Eric CLedbetter"], "doi": "10.1111/vop.12340"}

Before the start of chemoradiation therapy, all women were submitted to undergo transvaginal 3D-PDUS for assessing tumor volume and tumor vascularization. After finishing chemoradiation, all women were evaluated to assess clinical response. Complete clinical response was determined when no residual tumor was apparent. Partial clinical response (PCR) was determined when persistent residual tumor was observed and confirmed by histological analysis. Patients with PCR underwent salvage surgery. Local recurrence was defined as reappearance of the tumor within the pelvis at any time during follow-up.\nThirty-nine women (mean age, 50.3 years; ranging from 30 to 81 years) were included in the study. Complete clinical response was achieved in 29 women (70.7%), whereas 10 women (24.4%) had PCR. Eight women (20.5%) had local recurrence during follow-up. We did not find statistical significant differences in tumor size, volume, and vascularization between those women who had complete clinical response and those who had PCR and between those who had local recurrence and those who had not.\nA single 3D-PDUS assessment of tumor size and vascularization before treatment seems to be of limited value for predicting tumor response to chemoradiation therapy and for predicting tumor recurrence in women with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix.", "journal": "International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society", "date": "2016-01-09", "authors": ["Juan LuisAlcazar", "SaraArribas", "RafaelMartinez-Monge", "MatiasJurado"], "doi": "10.1097/IGC.0000000000000641"}
{"title": "Redirecting Transport of Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel to Macrophages Enhances Therapeutic Efficacy against Liver Metastases.", "abstract": "Current treatments for liver metastases arising from primary breast and lung cancers are minimally effective. One reason for this unfavorable outcome is that liver metastases are poorly vascularized, limiting the ability to deliver therapeutics from the systemic circulation to lesions. Seeking to enhance transport of agents into the tumor microenvironment, we designed a system in which nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nAb-PTX) is loaded into a nanoporous solid multistage nanovector (MSV) to enable the passage of the drug through the tumor vessel wall and enhance its interaction with liver macrophages. MSV enablement increased nAb-PTX efficacy and survival in mouse models of breast and lung liver metastasis. MSV-nAb-PTX also augmented the accumulation of paclitaxel and MSV in the liver, specifically in macrophages, whereas paclitaxel levels in the blood were unchanged after administering MSV-nAb-PTX or nAb-PTX. In vitro studies demonstrated that macrophages treated with MSV-nAb-PTX remained viable and were able to internalize, retain, and release significantly higher quantities of paclitaxel compared with treatment with nAb-PTX. The cytotoxic potency of the released paclitaxel was also confirmed in tumor cells cultured with the supernatants of macrophage treated with MSV-nAB-PTX. Collectively, our findings showed how redirecting nAb-PTX to liver macrophages within the tumor microenvironment can elicit a greater therapeutic response in patients with metastatic liver cancer, without increasing systemic side effects.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2016-01-09", "authors": ["TomonoriTanei", "FransiscaLeonard", "XuewuLiu", "Jenolyn FAlexander", "YukiSaito", "MauroFerrari", "BianaGodin", "KenjiYokoi"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1576"}
{"title": "HBx regulates fatty acid oxidation to promote hepatocellular carcinoma survival during metabolic stress.", "abstract": "Due to a high rate of nutrient consumption and inadequate vascularization, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells constantly undergo metabolic stress during tumor development. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HBV-induced HCC. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of HBx in HCC adaptation to metabolic stress. Up-regulation of HBx increased the intracellular ATP and NADPH generation, and induced the resistance to glucose deprivation, whereas depletion of HBx via siRNA abolished these effects and conferred HCC cells sensitive to glucose restriction. Though HBx did not affect the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation capacity of HCC cells under normal culture conditions, it facilitated fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in the absence of glucose, which maintained NADPH and ATP levels. Further investigation showed that HBx expression, under glucose deprivation, stimulated phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) via a calcium/CaMKK-dependent pathway, which was required for the activation of FAO. Conversely, inhibition of FAO by etomoxir (ETO) restored the sensitivity of HBx-expressing cells to glucose deficiency in vitro and retarded xenograft tumor formation in vivo. Finally, HBx-induced activation of the AMPK and FAO pathways were also observed in xenograft tumors and HBV-associated HCC specimens. Our data suggest that HBx plays a key role in the maintenance of redox and energy homeostasis by activating FAO, which is critical for HCC cell survival under conditions of metabolic stress and might be exploited for therapeutic benefit.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-01-09", "authors": ["Ming-DaWang", "HanWu", "ShuaiHuang", "Hui-LuZhang", "Chen-JieQin", "Ling-HaoZhao", "Gong-BoFu", "XuZhou", "Xian-MingWang", "LiangTang", "WenWen", "WenYang", "Shan-HuaTang", "DanCao", "Lin-NaGuo", "MinZeng", "Meng-ChaoWu", "He-XinYan", "Hong-YangWang"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.6817"}

Initial experiences with this new method and especially the correlation with the current standard diagnostic procedure of fluorescein angiography show that new information can be obtained regarding specific vascular and neovascular changes. For three-dimensional neovascular changes, such as those found in exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD,) a more sophisticated diagnostic analysis strategy must be specifically developed.

{"title": "Novel method to improve vascularization of tissue engineered constructs with biodegradable fibers.", "abstract": "Tissue engineered grafts lack adequate vascularization and suffer from poor perfusion in vivo curtailing clinical application. Improving vascularization in any tissue implants would hence increase their survivability and treatment efficacy. Many prevascularization strategies established to date involves the angiogenic induction of endothelial progenitor cells in thick tissue engineered scaffolds to obtain vascularization. These 3D scaffolds typically require a dynamic cell culturing system involving/needful of bioreactors to obtain vascularization in thick tissue engineered scaffolds. Herein, we developed a novel method to engineer a vessel network without bioreactor, where 3D blood vessels could be simply obtained in a 2D static cell culturing system. This network could be used to augment the prevascularization of tissue engineered grafts. Endothelial cells (HUVECs) were confluently cultured on resorbable electrospun poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) microfibers of capillary dimensions. These cell encapsulated capillary fibers were further embedded in collagen with HUVECs and vascular endothelial growth factor. Green fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein expressing HUVECs were used to label cells on fiber and in collagen respectively for visualization and monitoring of capillary network formation. Seeded HUVECs in the hybrid construct were subsequently cultured for 30 days before implantation. Vessel density was measured by the total tubule length per unit area at different time points. In vitro results indicated that the fibers provide contact guidance to form primary networks to direct more vessels branching of HUVECs in hybrid constructs and the vessel integrity of microvasculature was retained after fiber degradation. In addition, these preformed engineered capillaries could capably inosculate with de novo capillaries in collagen when combined, giving rise to a hybrid pre-vascularized scaffold of more extensive vessel network and interconnections, thereby markedly improved prevascularization. When implanted onto the dorsal skin of immune-deficient mice, vessels of hybrid pre-vascularized scaffold also rapidly anastomosed with mice vasculature within a day as confirmed with the immunostaining of endothelial cell markers CD31 and von Willebrand factor. This proof of concept study showed that artificial capillaries formed through contact guidance of endothelial cells on resorbable capillary sized microfibers can significantly enhance prevascularization in tissue engineered constructs intended for surgical implantation.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-01-08", "authors": ["Hui KianWong", "Chee RenIvan Lam", "FengWen", "Seow KhoonMark Chong", "Nguan SoonTan", "ChanJerry", "MintuPal", "Lay PohTan"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015004"}
{"title": "Macro- and micro-designed chitosan-alginate scaffold architecture by three-dimensional printing and directional freezing.", "abstract": "While many tissue-engineered constructs aim to treat cartilage defects, most involve chondrocyte or stem cell seeding on scaffolds. The clinical application of cell-based techniques is limited due to the cost of maintaining cellular constructs on the shelf, potential immune response to allogeneic cell lines, and autologous chondrocyte sources requiring biopsy from already diseased or injured, scarce tissue. An acellular scaffold that can induce endogenous influx and homogeneous distribution of native stem cells from bone marrow holds great promise for cartilage regeneration. This study aims to develop such an acellular scaffold using designed, channeled architecture that simultaneously models the native zones of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Highly porous, hydrophilic chitosan-alginate (Ch-Al) scaffolds were fabricated in three-dimensionally printed (3DP) molds designed to create millimeter scale macro-channels. Different polymer preform casting techniques were employed to produce scaffolds from both negative and positive 3DP molds. Macro-channeled scaffolds improved cell suspension distribution and uptake overly randomly porous scaffolds, with a wicking volumetric flow rate of 445.6 \u00b1 30.3 mm(3) s(-1) for aqueous solutions and 177 \u00b1 16 mm(3) s(-1) for blood. Additionally, directional freezing was applied to Ch-Al scaffolds, resulting in lamellar pores measuring 300 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm on the long and short axes, thus creating micrometer scale micro-channels. After directionally freezing Ch-Al solution cast in 3DP molds, the combined macro- and micro-channeled scaffold architecture enhanced cell suspension uptake beyond either macro- or micro-channels alone, reaching a volumetric flow rate of 1782.1 \u00b1 48 mm(3) s(-1) for aqueous solutions and 440.9 \u00b1 0.5 mm(3) s(-1) for blood. By combining 3DP and directional freezing, we can control the micro- and macro-architecture of Ch-Al to drastically improve cell influx into and distribution within the scaffold, while achieving porous zones that mimic articular cartilage zonal architecture. In future applications, precisely controlled micro- and macro-channels have the potential to assist immediate endogenous bone marrow uptake, stimulate chondrogenesis, and encourage vascularization of bone in an osteochondral scaffold.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2016-01-08", "authors": ["StephanieReed", "GraceLau", "BenjaminDelattre", "David DonLopez", "Antoni PTomsia", "Benjamin MWu"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/8/1/015003"}

Two key transcription factors that are targets of LH surge are C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta, and their depletion in granulosa cells results in complete infertility. Microarray analyses of these mutant mice revealed altered expression of a number of genes, including growth arrest specific-1 (Gas1). To investigate functions of Gas1 in ovulation- and luteinization-related processes, we crossed Cyp19a1-Cre and Gas1(flox/flox) mice to conditionally delete Gas1 in granulosa and cumulus cells. While expression of Gas1 is dramatically increased in granulosa and cumulus cells around 12-16 h post-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation in wild-type mice, this increase is abolished in Cebpa/b double mutant and in Gas1 mutant mice. GAS1 is also dynamically expressed in stromal cells of the ovary independent of C/EBPalpha/beta. Female Gas1 mutant mice are fertile, exhibit enhanced rates of ovulation, increased fertility, and higher levels of Areg and Lhcgr mRNA in granulosa cells. The morphological appearance and vascularization of corpora lutea appeared normal in these mutant females. Interestingly, levels of mRNA for a number of genes (Cyp11a1, Star, Wnt4, Prlr, Cd52, and Sema3a) associated with luteinization are decreased in corpora lutea of Gas1 mutant mice as compared with controls at 24 h post-hCG; these differences were no longer detectable by 48 h post-hCG.

The location and size of the defect as well as the rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow are important considerations for selection of the most appropriate reconstructive approach. Recent literature provides evidence suggesting that pedicled flaps may be more effective for clival defects and high-flow CSF leaks, potentially reducing the incidence of postoperative CSF leaks. Although the nasoseptal flap (NSF) continues to be the mainstay of endoscopic skull base reconstruction, alternative vascularized flaps exist when the NSF is impractical or unavailable, and new surgical approaches continue to evolve.\nVascularized pedicled flaps, and especially the NSF, have greatly reduced complications associated with endoscopic skull base surgery.

Control specimens developed well vascularized tumors and lung metastases, whereas in Ned-19-treated mice tumor growth and vascularization as well as lung metastases were strongly inhibited. In vitro experiments showed that Ned-19 treatment controls the growth of B16 cells in vitro, their migratory ability, adhesive properties and VEGFR2 expression, indicating NAADP involvement in intercellular autocrine signaling. To this regard, Ca(2+) imaging experiments showed that the response of B16 cells to VEGF stimulation is NAADP-dependent.

Twenty-six cadaveric lower limbs were investigated. The architecture of the quadriceps femoris was examined with special attention to innervation and vascularization patterns. All muscle components were traced from origin to insertion and their affiliations were determined. A TVI was found in all dissections. It was supplied by independent muscular and vascular branches of the femoral nerve and lateral circumflex femoral artery. Further distally, the TVI combined with an aponeurosis merging separately into the quadriceps tendon and inserting on the medial aspect of the patella. Four morphological types of TVI were distinguished: Independent-type (11/26), VI-type (6/26), VL-type (5/26), and Common-type (4/26). This study demonstrated that the quadriceps femoris is architecturally different from previous descriptions: there is an additional muscle belly between the VI and VL, which cannot be clearly assigned to the former or the latter. Distal exposure shows that this muscle belly becomes its own aponeurosis, which continues distally as part of the quadriceps tendon.", "journal": "Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2016-01-07", "authors": ["KGrob", "TAckland", "M SKuster", "MManestar", "LFilgueira"], "doi": "10.1002/ca.22680"}

To investigate the complex processes that control the composition of the plasma proteome, we developed a mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy to infer the origin of proteins detected in murine plasma. The strategy relies on the construction of a comprehensive protein tissue atlas from cells and highly vascularized organs using shotgun mass spectrometry. The protein tissue atlas was transformed to a spectral library for highly reproducible quantification of tissue-specific proteins directly in plasma using SWATH-like data-independent mass spectrometry analysis. We show that the method can determine drastic changes of tissue-specific protein profiles in blood plasma from mouse animal models with sepsis. The strategy can be extended to several other species advancing our understanding of the complex processes that contribute to the plasma proteome dynamics.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2016-01-07", "authors": ["ErikMalmstr\u00f6m", "OlaKilsg\u00e5rd", "SimonHauri", "EmanuelSmeds", "HeikoHerwald", "LarsMalmstr\u00f6m", "JohanMalmstr\u00f6m"], "doi": "10.1038/ncomms10261"}

Single studies have demonstrated the role of different treatment modalities to prevent or treat spinal cord ischemia. A multimodal approach, however, is advocated by most authors. Even after the employment of endovascular techniques become routine, the rate of spinal cord ischemia after treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic pathology remained unchanged over time. Spinal cord ischemia is often treatable by different means that concur to improve indirect spinal perfusion through collateral circulation; it should, therefore, be managed promptly and aggressively due to its potential reversibility.

{"title": "Treponema pallidum (syphilis) antigen TpF1 induces angiogenesis through the activation of the IL-8 pathway.", "abstract": "Over 10 million people every year become infected by Treponema pallidum and develop syphilis, a disease with broad symptomatology that, due to the difficulty to eradicate the pathogen from the highly vascularized secondary sites of infection, is still treated with injections of penicillin. Unlike most other bacterial pathogens, T. pallidum infection produces indeed a strong angiogenic response whose mechanism of activation, however, remains unknown. Here, we report that one of the major antigen of T. pallidum, the TpF1 protein, has growth factor-like activity on primary cultures of human endothelial cells and activates specific T cells able to promote tissue factor production. The growth factor-like activity is mediated by the secretion of IL-8 but not of VEGF, two known angiogenic factors. The pathogen's factor signals IL-8 secretion through the activation of the CREB/NF-\u03baB signalling pathway. These findings are recapitulated in an animal model, zebrafish, where we observed that TpF1 injection stimulates angiogenesis and IL-8, but not VEGF, secretion. This study suggests that the angiogenic response observed during secondary syphilis is triggered by TpF1 and that pharmacological therapies directed to inhibit IL-8 response in patients should be explored to treat this disease.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2016-01-06", "authors": ["TommasoPozzobon", "NicolaFacchinello", "FleurBossi", "NagajaCapitani", "MarisaBenagiano", "GiuliettaDi Benedetto", "CristinaZennaro", "NicoleWest", "GaiaCodolo", "MarialinaBernardini", "Cosima TatianaBaldari", "Mario MilcoD'Elios", "LucaPellegrini", "FrancescoArgenton", "Marinade Bernard"], "doi": "10.1038/srep18785"}
{"title": "Cutaneous vascularization of the femoral triangle in\u00a0respect to groin incisions.", "abstract": "The purpose of this anatomic study was to describe the cutaneous vascularization of the femoral triangle and its variation to evaluate the potential consequences of the classic incisions used in vascular surgery. The ultimate goal was to suggest surgical approaches that would take into account the vascularization of the inguinal region to potentially reduce the vascular lesions and wound complications at the groin.\nThe cutaneous arteries of the femoral triangle were studied in 11 lower limbs from 6 human embalmed cadavers. The technique included embalming of the cadavers, radiopaque latex injection, radiographs, and anatomic dissection.\nThe comparison of the vascular patterns revealed that despite the high variability of the arborization of the cutaneous arteries, their distribution patterns share many characteristics. The main vascularization of the femoral triangle comes from three arteries: the superficial circumflex iliac, the superficial epigastric, and the external pudendal. The first two arteries originate generally through a common trunk that buds laterally from the femoral artery at about 1.5\u00a0cm below the inguinal ligament. This study shows that the classic vertical incision at the groin would lead to damage of the cutaneous branches that cross over the femoral artery in its proximal part (the superficial epigastric artery in 82% and the common trunk of the superficial epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries in 18%); these lesions could lead to the postsurgical disruption of the dermal blood flow.\nThe classic incisions could disrupt the cutaneous blood supply and thus increase the risk of tissue necrosis around the wound, explaining the observed postsurgical complications and infections. We propose to lower the vertical incision to start 2\u00a0cm under the inguinal ligament to reduce lesions of the cutaneous arteries and the potential devascularization of the wounds.", "journal": "Journal of vascular surgery", "date": "2016-01-05", "authors": ["C\u00e9ciliaTremblay", "DetlevGrabs", "DanielBourgouin", "GillesBronchti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jvs.2015.04.385"}
{"title": "VEGF/VEGFR2 Signaling Regulates Germ Cell Proliferation in vitro and Promotes Mouse Testicular Regeneration in vivo.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays fundamental roles in testicular development; however, its function on testicular regeneration remains unknown. The objective of this study was to explore the roles VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling plays in mouse germ cells and in mouse testicular regeneration. VEGF and the VEGFR2 antagonist SU5416 were added to culture medium to evaluate their effects on spermatogonial stem cell line (C18-4 cells) proliferation. Testicular cells obtained from newborn male ICR mice were grafted into the dorsal region of male BALB/c nude mice. VEGF and SU5416 were injected into the graft sites to assess the effects of the VEGF and VEGFR2 signaling pathways on testicular reconstitution. The grafts were analyzed after 8 weeks. We found that VEGF promoted C18-4 proliferation in vitro, indicating its role in germ cell survival. HE staining revealed that seminiferous tubules were reconstituted and male germ cells from spermatogonia to spermatids could be observed in testis-like tissues 8 weeks after grafting. A few advantaged male germ cells, including spermatocytes and spermatids, were found in SU5416-treated grafts. Moreover, VEGF enhanced the expression of genes specific for male germ cells and vascularization in 8-week grafts, whereas SU5416 decreased the expression of these genes. SU5416-treated grafts had a lower expression of MVH and CD31, indicating that blockade of VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling reduces the efficiency of seminiferous tubule reconstitution. Collectively, these data suggest that VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling regulates germ cell proliferation and promotes testicular regeneration via direct action on germ cells and the enhancement of vascularization.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2016-01-05", "authors": ["RuhuiTian", "ShiYang", "YongZhu", "ShashaZou", "PengLi", "JunlongWang", "ZijueZhu", "YiranHuang", "ZupingHe", "ZhengLi"], "doi": "10.1159/000440949"}

The application of osseointegrated dental implants using either an obturator prosthesis or a free vascularized flap has tremendously changed the retention and stability of the superstructure.

{"title": "Vascularized bone grafting fixed by biodegradable magnesium screw for treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head.", "abstract": "Hip-preserving surgery with vascularized bone graft implantation has been widely practiced in treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). However, the current approach presents a drawback, in which the implanted bone graft without screw fixation may slip or exhibit a certain degree of displacement postoperatively. This study was designed to investigate the application potential of biodegradable magnesium (Mg) screws for the fixation of vascularized bone graft in ONFH patients. Forty-eight patients were randomly divided into two groups: the Mg screw group (vascularized bone grafting fixed by Mg screws) and the control group (vascularized bone grafting without fixation). During 12 month follow-up period after surgery, treatment outcomes in patients were assessed by multiple imaging techniques including x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scanning as well as functional recovery Harris hip score (HHS). The temporal changes in serum levels of Mg, Ca, and P as well as in\u00a0vivo degradation rate of Mg screws were determined. The absence of potential adverse effects induced by degradation products from Mg screws on surrounding bone tissue was validated via CT imaging analysis. HHS was significantly improved in the Mg screw group when compared to the control group. X-ray imaging analysis showed that the screw shape did not show significant alteration due to the diameter of Mg screws measured with approximate 25% reduction within 12 months post-surgically. The postoperative serum levels of Ca, Mg, and P, which are relevant for liver and kidney function, were all within normal physiological range in all patients of both groups. The use of biodegradable Mg screws may provide a promising bone graft-screw fixation route in treating ONFH and present considerable potential for orthopedic applications.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2016-01-03", "authors": ["DeweiZhao", "ShiboHuang", "FaqiangLu", "BenjieWang", "LeiYang", "LingQin", "KeYang", "YangdeLi", "WeirongLi", "WeiWang", "SimiaoTian", "XiuzhiZhang", "WenbinGao", "ZongpuWang", "YuZhang", "XinhuiXie", "JialiWang", "JunleiLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.038"}

Nanogels (NGs) based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) macromers chain-extended with short lactide (L) and glycolide (G) segments were used for grafting and timed-release of BMP2 and VEGF. NGs with 12kDa PEG molecular weight (MW), 24 LG segment length, and 60/40L/G ratio (P12-II, NG(10)) released the grafted VEGF in 10days.

Groups included patterned constructs without BMP2/VEGF (None), with directly added BMP2/VEGF, and NG-BMP2/NG-VEGF. Based on the results, timed-release of VEGF in the microchannels in 10days from NG(10) and BMP2 in the matrix in 21days from NG(21) resulted in highest extent of osteogenic and vasculogenic differentiation of the encapsulated hMSCs and ECFCs compared to direct addition of VEGF and BMP2. Further, timed-release of VEGF from NG(10) in hMSC+ECFC encapsulating microchannels and BMP2 from NG(21) in hMSC encapsulating matrix sharply increased bFGF expression in the patterned constructs.

However, metastatic disease to the thyroid gland is rare. When it does occur kidney is the most common primary tumor site, followed by melanoma, lung, breast, esophagus, uterus and colon carcinoma. We describe the case of an isolated thyroid metastasis from clear cell renal carcinoma occurring 16 years after nephrectomy. An 82 years-old woman presented for the recent growth of a right thyroid nodule, diagnosed 3 years before, when a fine needle aspiration biopsy found a benign cytology suggesting a well-differentiated follicular thyroid adenoma. Her medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and a right nephrectomy for a clear cell renal carcinoma done 16 years before. The patient has lost weight but she was otherwise asymptomatic. The right lobe goiter was painless, firm, and mobile with deglutition, without signs of local compression or latero-cervical lymphadenopathy. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed an enlarged (9.9 cm) macronodular right lobe, with multiple cystic areas, with normal left lobe and a thrombus in the right internal jugular vein. Thyroid function tests were normal. The patient was suspected of thyroid carcinoma and underwent a near total thyroidectomy. Histopathological examination revealed a metastasis of clear cell renal carcinoma in the right thyroid gland lobe (8.5/5/5 cm). Further imaging showed no primary tumor or other metastases. Metastatic renal carcinoma to the thyroid should be considered in any patient presenting with a thyroid mass and a medical history of operated renal cell carcinoma, since it can occur up to 25 years after nephrectomy.", "journal": "Acta endocrinologica (Bucharest, Romania : 2005)", "date": "2016-01-01", "authors": ["M LGheorghiu", "RIorgulescu", "C DVrabie", "C CTupea", "H IUrsu"], "doi": "10.4183/aeb.2016.80"}

The most frequently there were diagnosed III C and II B stages of the disease, while 62.5% of all cases were of stage III. Adenocarcinoma of low and moderate differentiation was diagnosed in 30 (67.2%) cases. Most cases (87.5%) occurred in the body and antrum. Men were 21 (52.5%), women - 19 (47.5%). The mean age of patients was 60.9\u00b111.4 years. At the time of initiation of treatment complicated course of locally advanced gastric cancer was in almost all patients. Anemia of varying severity was diagnosed in 24, signs of bleeding were found in 6 patients. Subcompensated stenosis of the antrum was detected in 9 patients. All patients underwent diagnostic angiography to study the vascular anatomy hepatopancreatoduodenal zone as well as to determine the nature of vascularization of tumor of the stomach and the sources of its blood supply. In 34 patients, whose vascular anatomy of tumor was represented by the presence of main supply vessel, the first phase of the combined treatment was selective intraarterial oil chemoembolization. Surgical stage of combined treatment was carried out in 30 patients. Distal subtotal gastrectomy was performed in 13 patients, total gastrectomy - 15 patients. Radical removal tumor (RO) was achieved in 26 patients with a relatively small number of postoperative complications.

The experiment was conducted with 18 Pulawska pigs, 24 Polish Large White (PLW) pigs, and 24 Pietrain pigs slaughtered at 105 kg body weight. The results obtained indicate that the breed of pigs has a significant effect on both muscle fibre composition and vascularization. The muscles of Pulawska pigs are the most oxidative, as evidenced by the greatest number of capillaries and the highest percentage of type I and IIA fibres compared to the muscle of PLW and Pietrain pigs. In turn, the most glycolytic muscles (highest percentage of type IIB fibres, poorest vascularization as well as the greatest diameters of muscle fibres of all types under analysis) were noted in Pietrain pigs. Analysis of the physico-chemical parameters of the meat showed the lowest pH45, a* and IMF, as well as the highest L*, drip loss and shear force values in Pietrain pigs compared to Pulawska and PLW pigs.

Skull base fractures are a frequent complication of high-impact trauma; due to the inherent anatomic relationships of the skull base, they may be associated with significant intracranial complications, including CSF leakage, and their detection is therefore important. The ethmoid roof and the cribriform plate region are the sites most vulnerable to fractures and dural tears. Rhinorrhoea is a non-specific finding; the presence of CSF in a sample must be confirmed with beta 2 transferin or beta trace protein. Accurate identification of the leakage site is necessary for a successful surgical treatment. Various modalities are available for this purpose, such as CT scan and MRI. Persistent CSF rhinorrhoea necessitates surgical intervention, due to the risk of meningitis. Continued improvements in endoscopic reconstruction techniques have led to fewer open surgeries for repair.

{"title": "[Mechanisms of corneal neovascularization and modern options for its suppression].", "abstract": "Quite a number of pathological factors exist that can disturb the balance between anti-angiogenic and proangiogenic mechanisms, thus causing vascularization of the cornea. The neovessels are immature, ill-formed, and show increased permeability, which is dangerous of corneal edema, lipid deposition, and opacification. Moreover, as known, corneal neovascularization (CNV; preexisting or postoperative) may contribute to immune response against the transplant. Suppression of neovascularization is able to decrease the risk of corneal transplant rejection. In order to identify the principal strategy for struggling against CNV, we should first get a better understanding of its etiology, pathogenesis, and role in transplant immunity as well as mechanisms of action of available treatment methods.\n\u041f\u043e\u0434 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0441 \u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0443. \u042d\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u044b \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e, \u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a \u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0443, \u043e\u0442\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043b\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0443\u0442\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u044b. \u041a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f (\u0420\u041d\u0412) \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044e \u0438\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438. \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a \u043e\u0442\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0435 \u0441 \u0420\u041d\u0412 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u043d\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430, \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f.", "journal": "Vestnik oftalmologii", "date": "2016-01-01", "authors": ["V RMamikonyan", "E APivin", "D AKrakhmaleva"], "doi": "10.17116/oftalma2016132481-87"}
{"title": "Role of NG2 proteoglycan in macrophage recruitment to brain tumors and sites of CNS demyelination.", "abstract": "Macrophage infiltration is a factor in most if not all inflammatory pathologies. Understanding molecular interactions that underlie this process is therefore important for our ability to modulate macrophage behavior for therapeutic purposes. Our studies show that cell surface expression of the nerveglial antigen 2 (NG2) proteoglycan is important for the ability of macrophages to colonize both brain tumors and sites of central nervous system (CNS) demyelination. Myeloid-specific ablation of NG2 using LysM-Cre deleter mice results in large decreases in macrophage abundance in both an intracranial melanoma model and a lysolecithin model of spinal cord demyelination. In the melanoma model, decreased macrophage recruitment in the NG2 null mice leads to diminished tumor growth. In line with observations in the literature, this phenomenon is based in part on deficits in tumor vascularization that result from loss of pericyte interaction with endothelial cells in the absence of a macrophage-derived factor(s). In the demyelination model, decreased macrophage infiltration in the NG2 null mice is associated with an initial reduction in lesion size, but nevertheless also with deficits in repair of the lesion. Diminished myelin repair is due not only to reduced clearance of myelin debris, but also to decreased proliferation/recruitment of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the absence of a macrophage-derived factor(s). Thus, in both models macrophages have secondary effects on other cell types that are important for progression of the specific pathology. Efforts are underway to identify mechanisms by which NG2 influences macrophage recruitment and by which macrophages signal to other cell types involved in the pathologies.", "journal": "Trends in cell & molecular biology", "date": "2016-01-01", "authors": ["PilarCejudo-Martin", "KarolinaKucharova", "William BStallcup"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Distribution of Iron Oxide Core-Titanium Dioxide Shell Nanoparticles in VX2 Tumor Bearing Rabbits Introduced by Two Different Delivery Modalities.", "abstract": "This work compares intravenous (IV) versus fluoroscopy-guided transarterial intra-catheter (IC) delivery of iron oxide core-titanium dioxide shell nanoparticles (NPs) in vivo in VX2 model of liver cancer in rabbits. NPs coated with glucose and decorated with a peptide sequence from cortactin were administered to animals with developed VX2 liver cancer. Two hours after NPs delivery tumors, normal liver, kidney, lung and spleen tissues were harvested and used for a series on histological and elemental analysis tests. Quantification of NPs in tissues was done both by bulk inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis and by hard X-ray fluorescence microscopy. Both IV and IC NPs injection are feasible modalities for delivering NPs to VX2 liver tumors with comparable tumor accumulation. It is possible that this is an outcome of the fact that VX2 tumors are highly vascularized and hemorrhagic, and therefore enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) plays the most significant role in accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor tissue. It is, however, interesting to note that IV delivery led to increased sequestration of NPs by spleen and normal liver tissue, while IC delivery lead to more NP positive Kupffer cells. This difference is most likely a direct outcome of blood flow dynamics.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of different anatomical variation of celiac axis, SMA, hepatic artery, and its branches with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography of upper abdomen arteries.\nMDCT of 607 kidney donor and traumatic patients that referred to MDCT unit at Al Zahra Hospital in Isfahan from 2012 to 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. We excluded patients with history of abdominal vascular surgery and hepatic or pancreatic surgery. Computed tomography images of the patient were obtained with 64-row MDCT scanner and anatomical variations were analyzed.\nThree hundred and eighty-eight (63.9%) of the 607 patients had classic arterial anatomy and 219 (36.1%) patients had variant types. The most common type of variation was the origin of the right hepatic artery (RHA) from SMA (9.6%), and the next common variation was the origin of the left hepatic artery (LHA) from the left gastric artery (6.9%). Variations in the origin of the common hepatic artery (CHA) were seen in 16 (2.6%) patients. Buhler arc was identified in two patients. The RHA originated from the celiac axis in 11 (1.8%) patients and from the aorta in 8 (1.3%) patients. Trifurcation of CHA into gastroduodenal artery, RHA, and LHA was detected in 11 (1.8%) patients.\nThe results of the present study showed that anatomical variation occurs in a high percentage of patients.

{"title": "Resident microglia rather than peripheral macrophages promote vascularization in brain tumors and are source of alternative pro-angiogenic factors.", "abstract": "Myeloid cells are an essential part of the glioblastoma microenvironment. However, in brain tumors the function of these immune cells is not sufficiently clarified. In our study, we investigated differential pro-angiogenic activities of resident microglia and peripheral macrophages and their impact on glioma vascularization and progression. Our data demonstrate stable accumulation of microglia/macrophages during tumor growth. These cells often interact with tumor blood vessels correlating with vascular remodeling. Here, we identified resident microglia as well as peripheral macrophages as part of the perivascular niche, primarily contacting endothelial cells. We found overexpression of a variety of pro-angiogenic molecules within freshly isolated microglia/macrophages from glioma. CXCL2, until now a poorly described chemokine, was strongly up-regulated and showed better angiogenic activity than VEGF in vitro. Blocking the CXCL2-CXCR2 signaling pathway resulted in considerably diminished glioma sizes. Additionally, the importance of microglia/macrophages in tumor angiogenesis was confirmed by depletion of these cells in vivo. Vessel density decreased by 50% leading to significantly smaller tumor volumes. Remarkably, selective reduction of resident microglia affected tumoral vessel count comparable to ablation of the whole myeloid cell fraction. These results provide evidence that resident microglia are the crucial modulatory cell population playing a central role in regulation of vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis in brain tumors. Thus, resident microglia represent an alternative source of pro-angiogenic growth factors and cytokines.", "journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "date": "2016-01-01", "authors": ["SusanBrandenburg", "AnnettM\u00fcller", "KatiTurkowski", "Yordan TRadev", "SergejRot", "ChristinSchmidt", "Alexander DBungert", "G\u00fclizAcker", "AnneSchorr", "AndreasHippe", "KellyMiller", "Frank LHeppner", "BernhardHomey", "PeterVajkoczy"], "doi": "10.1007/s00401-015-1529-6"}

Given the localization of the protein Dp71 around the retinal vessels in adult mice and its role in maintaining retinal homeostasis, the aim of this study was to determine if Dp71 was involved in astrocyte and vascular development regulation. An experimental study in mouse retinas was conducted. Using a dual immunolabeling with antibodies to Dp71 and anti-GFAP for astrocytes on retinal sections and isolated astrocytes, it was found that Dp71 was expressed in wild-type (WT) mouse astrocytes from early developmental stages to adult stage. In Dp71-null mice, a reduction in GFAP-immunopositive astrocytes was observed as early as postnatal day 6 (P6) compared with WT mice. Using real-time PCR, it was showed that Dp71 mRNA was stable between P1 and P6, in parallel with post-natal vascular development. Regarding morphology in Dp71-null and WT mice, a significant decrease in overall astrocyte process number in Dp71-null retinas at P6 to adult age was found.

For group 1 (9 patients), patient-specific guides were designed and manufactured using additive manufacturing technology. During surgery, the guides were used to define the orientation of the reduced fragments. The scaphoids in group 2 (13 patients) were reduced with the conventional freehand technique. All scaphoids in both groups were fixed with a headless compression screw or K-wires, and all bone defects (except one) were filled with autologous bone grafts or vascularized grafts. Postoperative CT scans were acquired 2 or more months after the operations to monitor consolidation and compare the final result with the preoperative plan. The clinical results and accuracy of the reconstructions were compared.\nIn group 1, 8 of 9 scaphoids healed after 2 to 6 months, and partial nonunion after 9 months was observed in one patient. In group 2, 11 of 13 scaphoids healed between 2 and 34 months whereas 2 scaphoids did not consolidate. Comparison of the preoperative and postoperative 3-dimensional data revealed an average residual displacement of 7\u00b0 (4\u00b0 in flexion-extension, 4\u00b0 in ulnar-radial deviation, and 3\u00b0 in pronation-supination) in group 1. In group 2, residual displacement after surgery was 26\u00b0 (22\u00b0 in flexion-extension, 12\u00b0 in ulnar-radial deviation, and 7\u00b0 in pronation-supination). The difference in the accuracy of reconstruction was significant.\nAlthough the scaphoid is small, patient-specific guides can be used to perform scaphoid reconstructions.

In this study, autologous transplantation of stromal vascular fraction cells was used in combination with skin grafts to determine whether it improved the texture and other physical property of skin grafts.\nStromal vascular fraction cells were isolated and injected under full-thickness skin grafts in a cohort of 20 rats; a second cohort of 20 rats served as controls.

Compared to normal gingiva, negative for VEGF/VEGFR2, periodontal lesions had a progressive increase for these markers from low to severe periodontal lesions.

Epithelial vascularization was firstly observed in moderate periodontal lesions and persists during severe periodontal disease. All the parameters used to quantify angiogenesis in periodontal lesions, were significantly increased in severe periodontal lesions dependent on VEGF expression in both the epithelial and stromal compartment.

Within 20 h of incubation, the more sulfated coatings induced the HUVECS to the form tube-like structures accompanied by an increased expression of angiogenic-associated genes, such as angiopoietin-1 and VEGF A. This may be a cost-effective approach to modify 2D/3D constructs to instruct angiogenic cells towards the formation of neo-vascularization, driven by multiple and synergistic stimulations from the PL combined with sulfated polysaccharides.\nThe presence, or fast induction, of a stable and mature vasculature inside 3D constructs is crucial for new tissue formation and its viability. This has been one of the major tissue engineering challenges, limiting the dimensions of efficient tissue constructs.

The delivery and support of cells seeded throughout acellular scaffolds are typically conducted through the vascular axis of the tissues. However, it is unclear how cell concentration and injection frequency can affect the distribution of cells throughout the scaffold. Furthermore, what effects re-endothelialization have on vascular patency and function are not well understood. We investigated the use of ultrasound-guided photoacoustic (US/PA) imaging as a technique to visualize the distribution of microvascular endothelial cells within an optimized acellular construct upon re-endothelialization and perfusion conditioning. We also evaluated the vascular performance of the re-endothelialized scaffold using quantitative vascular corrosion casting (qVCC) and whole-blood perfusion. We found US/PA imaging was an effective technique to visualize the distribution of cells. Cellular retention following perfusion conditioning was also detected with US/PA imaging. Finally, we demonstrated that a partial recovery of vascular performance is possible following re-endothelialization-confirmed by fewer extravasations in qVCC and improved blood clearance following whole-blood perfusion.\nRe-endothelialization is a method that enables decellularized tissue to become useful as a tissue engineering construct by creating a nutrient delivery and waste removal system for the entire construct. Our approach utilizes a decellularization method that retains the basement ECM of a highly vascularized tissue upon which endothelial cells can be injected to form an endothelium. The US/PA method allows for rapid visualization of cells within a construct several cm thick. This approach can be experimentally used to observe changes in cellular distribution over large intervals of time, to help optimize cell seeding parameters, and to verify cell retention within re-endothelialized constructs.

Twenty-four fully MHC-mismatched hemiface transplantations were performed between ACI (RT1(a)) donors and Lewis (RT1(l)) recipients under combined seven-day immunosuppressive regimen of anti-\u03b1\u03b2-T-cell receptor (TCR) monoclonal antibody and cyclosporin A.

This study investigated the safety and efficacy of Glubran, a liquid embolic agent, for the embolization of this type of meningioma compared with polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) particles.\nFrom January 2006 to June 2015, 157 consecutive patients (98 females; mean age = 48.3 years) who suffered from meningiomas and were preoperatively referred for embolization were retrospectively analyzed. Glubran (n = 40) and PVA (n = 55) were used to devascularize tumors. Sixty-two patients were not embolized because of dangerous anastomosis or other tumor characteristics. Intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative time, degree of angiographic devascularization and embolization-related complications were analyzed.\nThe intraoperative blood loss and operative time were significantly lower in the Glubran-embolized versus non-embolized group. Furthermore, Glubran embolization significantly reduced intraoperative blood loss and operative time for meningiomas that received their primary blood supply from the ICA and/or VA compared with PVA embolization.\nPreoperative meningioma embolization with Glubran decreases intraoperative blood loss and operative time. Furthermore, embolization with Glubran produces more effective devascularization compared with PVA for meningiomas supplied by the ICA and/or VA.

Nude mice bearing HT29 and HepG2 tumors were treated with daily i.p. injections of 10mg/kg panobinostat for 4 weeks. During this time, tumor size was determined with a calliper and mice were repeatedly subjected to PET imaging. Tumor tissues were analyzed immunohistochemically with a focus on proliferation and endothelial cell markers (Ki-67, Meca-32) and by Western blot applying specific markers of apoptosis.\nIn vitro, panobinostat inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and HT29 cells. Contrary to the situation in HepG2 tumors in vivo, where panobinostat treatment is known to reduce proliferation and vascularization resulting in a decreased tumor growth, HT29 tumors did not show any effect on these parameters. We demonstrated by Western blotting, that panobinostat induced apoptosis in HT29 tumors in vivo. Longitudinal PET imaging studies in HepG2 tumor-bearing mice using 2-[(18)F]FGlc-RGD demonstrated that the standard uptake value (SUVmax) in HepG2 tumors was significantly decreased by 39% at day 7 after treatment. The comparative PET study using HT29 tumor-bearing animals did not reveal any response of the tumors to panobinostat treatment.\nSmall-animal PET imaging using 2-[(18)F]FGlc-RGD was successfully applied to the non-invasive monitoring of the HepG2-tumor response to panobinostat in nude mice early after begin of treatment. Thus, PET imaging of angiogenesis using 2-[(18)F]FGlc-RGD could be a valuable tool to monitor panobinostat therapy in further preclinical studies.\nWhen successfully translated to the clinical surrounding, PET imaging of angiogenesis could therefore facilitate therapy planning and monitoring of therapy success with panobinostat in hepatocellular carcinoma.", "journal": "Nuclear medicine and biology", "date": "2015-12-26", "authors": ["SimoneMaschauer", "SusanneGahr", "MuktheshwarGandesiri", "PhilippTripal", "RegineSchneider-Stock", "TorstenKuwert", "MatthiasOcker", "OlafPrante"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2015.10.003"}
{"title": "Controlled Dual Growth Factor Delivery From Microparticles Incorporated Within Human Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Aggregates for Enhanced Bone Tissue Engineering via Endochondral Ossification.", "abstract": "Bone tissue engineering via endochondral ossification has been explored by chondrogenically priming cells using soluble mediators for at least 3 weeks to produce a hypertrophic cartilage template. Although recapitulation of endochondral ossification has been achieved, long-term in vitro culture is required for priming cells through repeated supplementation of inductive factors in the media. To address this challenge, a microparticle-based growth factor delivery system was engineered to drive endochondral ossification within human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) aggregates. Sequential exogenous presentation of soluble transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) at various defined time courses resulted in varying degrees of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis as demonstrated by glycosaminoglycan and calcium content. The time course that best induced endochondral ossification was used to guide the development of the microparticle-based controlled delivery system for TGF-\u03b21 and BMP-2. Gelatin microparticles capable of relatively rapid release of TGF-\u03b21 and mineral-coated hydroxyapatite microparticles permitting more sustained release of BMP-2 were then incorporated within hMSC aggregates and cultured for 5 weeks following the predetermined time course for sequential presentation of bioactive signals. Compared with cell-only aggregates treated with exogenous growth factors, aggregates with incorporated TGF-\u03b21- and BMP-2-loaded microparticles exhibited enhanced chondrogenesis and alkaline phosphatase activity at week 2 and a greater degree of mineralization by week 5. Staining for types I and II collagen, osteopontin, and osteocalcin revealed the presence of cartilage and bone. This microparticle-incorporated system has potential as a readily implantable therapy for healing bone defects without the need for long-term in vitro chondrogenic priming. Significance: This study demonstrates the regulation of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis with regard to endochondral bone formation in high-density stem cell systems through the controlled presentation of inductive factors from incorporated microparticles. This work lays the foundation for a rapidly implantable tissue engineering system that promotes bone repair via endochondral ossification, a pathway that can delay the need for a functional vascular network and has an intrinsic ability to promote angiogenesis. The modular nature of this system lends well to using different cell types and/or growth factors to induce endochondral bone formation, as well as the production of other tissue types.", "journal": "Stem cells translational medicine", "date": "2015-12-25", "authors": ["Phuong NDang", "NehaDwivedi", "Lauren MPhillips", "XiaohuaYu", "SamuelHerberg", "CaitlinBowerman", "Loran DSolorio", "William LMurphy", "EbenAlsberg"], "doi": "10.5966/sctm.2015-0115"}

{"title": "Histidine-rich glycoprotein promotes macrophage activation and inflammation in chronic liver disease.", "abstract": "Pathogen- and injury-related danger signals as well as cytokines released by immune cells influence the functional differentiation of macrophages in chronic inflammation. Recently, the liver-derived plasma protein, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), was demonstrated, in mouse tumor models, to mediate the transition of alternatively activated (M2) to proinflammatory (M1) macrophages, which limit tumor growth and metastasis. We hypothesized that liver-derived HRG is a critical endogenous modulator of hepatic macrophage functionality and investigated its implications for liver inflammation and fibrosis by comparing C57BL/6N wild-type (WT) and Hrg(-/-) mice. In homeostatic conditions, hepatic macrophages were overall reduced and preferentially polarized toward the anti-inflammatory M2 subtype in Hrg(-/-) mice. Upon chronic liver damage induced by CCl4 or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet, liver injury and fibrosis were attenuated in Hrg(-/-) , compared to WT, mice. Macrophage populations were reduced and skewed toward M2 polarization in injured livers of Hrg(-/-) mice. Moreover, HRG-deficient mice showed significantly enhanced hepatic vascularization by micro-computed tomography and histology, corroborating proangiogenic activities of M2-polarized liver macrophages. Purified HRG protein induced, but HRG-deficient serum prevented, M1 macrophage differentiation in vitro. Accordingly, Hrg(-/-) mice transplanted with Hrg(+/+) bone marrow, but not Hrg(-/-) -transplanted Hrg(+/+) mice, remained protected from experimental steatohepatitis. Consistent with these findings, patients with chronic hepatitis C and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis significantly up-regulated hepatocytic HRG expression, which was associated with M1 polarization of adjacent macrophages.\nLiver-derived HRG, similar to alarmins, appears to be an endogenous molecular factor promoting polarization of hepatic macrophages toward the M1 phenotype, thereby promoting chronic liver injury and fibrosis progression, but limiting angiogenesis. Therefore, controlling tissue levels of HRG or PGF might be a promising strategy in chronic inflammatory liver diseases.", "journal": "Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)", "date": "2015-12-25", "authors": ["MatthiasBartneck", "ViktorFech", "JosefEhling", "OlivierGovaere", "Klaudia TheresaWarzecha", "KanishkaHittatiya", "MihaelVucur", "J\u00e9r\u00e9mieGautheron", "TomLuedde", "ChristianTrautwein", "TwanLammers", "TaniaRoskams", "WilliJahnen-Dechent", "FrankTacke"], "doi": "10.1002/hep.28418"}

Among the key players in the initial phase of bone regeneration are mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) that are in close contact in many tissues. Additionally, the generation of tissue constructs for in vivo transplantations has included the use of ECs since insufficient vascularization is one of the bottlenecks in (bone) tissue engineering. Here, 3D cocultures of human bone marrow derived MSCs (hBM-MSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in synthetic biomimetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based matrices are directed toward vascularized bone mimicking tissue constructs. In this environment, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) or fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) promotes the formation of vascular networks. However, while osteogenic differentiation is achieved with BMP-2, the treatment with FGF-2 suppressed osteogenic differentiation. Thus, this study shows that cocultures of hBM-MSCs and HUVECs in biological inert PEG matrices can be directed toward bone and bone marrow-like 3D tissue constructs.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2015-12-24", "authors": ["UlrichBlache", "St\u00e9phanieMetzger", "QueraltVallmajo-Martin", "IvanMartin", "ValentinDjonov", "MartinEhrbar"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201500795"}

The vascularized area in the alkali burned cornea was significantly reduced in the tofacitinib group compared with that in the PBS group. The immunoreactivity of Gr-1, F4/80, IFN-\u03b3, and phosphorylated STAT(signal transducer and activator of transcription)1 in corneal stroma was diminished significantly in the tofacitinib group. Using laser capture microdissection system and quantitative PCR array analysis, the expression levels of CXCL9, CXCL5, CCL7, CCL2, MMP(matrix metalloproteinase)-9, and STAT1 in corneal stroma were down-regulated in the tofacitinib group. In in\u00a0vitro study, human fibroblast pretreated by IFN-\u03b3 showed phosphorylation of STAT1, and this phosphorylation was down-regulated by adding tofacitinib to the culture medium. These results indicate the topical application of JAK inhibitor causes down-regulation of JAK- or IFN-\u03b3-related molecules.

{"title": "Blockade of CCR7 leads to decreased dendritic cell migration to draining lymph nodes and promotes graft survival in low-risk corneal transplantation.", "abstract": "The chemokine receptor CCR7 is essential for migration of mature dendritic cells (DCs) to the regional lymph nodes, and it has been shown that blocking of CCR7 improves graft survival after high-risk corneal transplantation in vascularized recipient corneas. However, it is so far unknown whether blocking of CCR7 reduces migration of DCs from the avascular cornea to the draining lymph nodes and whether this leads to improved graft survival also in the low-risk setting of corneal transplantation, which accounts for the majority of perforating transplantations performed. Therefore, in this study, pellets containing Freund's adjuvant and bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated to Alexa488 fluorescent dye were implanted into the corneal stroma of BALB/c mice to analyze antigen uptake by corneal DCs and their migration to the regional lymph nodes. After pellet implantation, mice were either treated by local administration of a CCR7 blocking fusion protein that consisted of CCL19 fused to the Fc part of human IgG1 or a control-IgG. In\u00a0vivo fluorescence microscopy showed uptake of Alexa488-conjugated BSA by corneal DCs within 8\u00a0h. Furthermore, analysis of single cell suspensions of draining lymph nodes prepared after 48\u00a0h revealed that 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3% of CD11c(+) cells were also Alexa488(+). Importantly, DC migration was significantly reduced after topical administration of CCL19-IgG (1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). To test the effect of CCR7 blockade on graft rejection after allogeneic low-risk keratoplasty, corneal transplantations were performed using C57BL/6-mice as donors and BALB/c-mice as recipients. Treatment mice received two intraperitoneal loading doses of CCL19-IgG prior to transplantation, followed by local treatment with CCL19-IgG containing eye drops for the first two weeks after transplantation. Control mice received same amounts of control-IgG. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that in the CCL19-IgG treated group, 76% of the grafts survived through the end of the 8 week observation period, whereas 38% of the grafts survived in the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

{"title": "A prosurvival and proangiogenic stem cell delivery system to promote ischemic limb regeneration.", "abstract": "Stem cell therapy is one of the most promising strategies to restore blood perfusion and promote muscle regeneration in ischemic limbs. Yet its therapeutic efficacy remains low owing to the inferior cell survival under the low oxygen and nutrient environment of the injured limbs. To increase therapeutic efficacy, high rates of both short- and long-term cell survival are essential, which current approaches do not support. In this work, we hypothesized that a high rate of short-term cell survival can be achieved by introducing a prosurvival environment into the stem cell delivery system to enhance cell survival before vascularization is established; and that a high rate of long-term cell survival can be attained by building a proangiogenic environment in the system to quickly vascularize the limbs. The system was based on a biodegradable and thermosensitive poly(N-Isopropylacrylamide)-based hydrogel, a prosurvival and proangiogenic growth factor bFGF, and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). bFGF can be continuously released from the system for 4weeks. The released bFGF significantly improved MSC survival and paracrine effects under low nutrient and oxygen conditions (0% FBS and 1% O2) in vitro. The prosurvival effect of the bFGF on MSCs was resulted from activating cell Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) pathway. When transplanted into the ischemic limbs, the system dramatically improved MSC survival. Some of the engrafted cells were differentiated into skeletal muscle and endothelial cells, respectively. The system also promoted the proliferation of host cells. After only 2weeks of implantation, tissue blood perfusion was completely recovered; and after 4weeks, the muscle fiber diameter was restored similarly to that of the normal limbs. These pronounced results demonstrate that the developed stem cell delivery system has a potential for ischemic limb regeneration.\nStem cell therapy is a promising strategy to restore blood perfusion and promote muscle regeneration in ischemic limbs.

Before the flap transfer, a cutting template for the fibula is made according to the measures and requirements of the facial defect. The segmentalized bone is then osteosynthesized to the facial skeleton and revascularized.

In a previous study, endothelial cells migrated to form a net-shaped structure in co-culture. However, the specific network formation behavior of endothelial cells during migration remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated the tracing behavior and cell cycle of endothelial cells using Fucci-labeled (Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator) endothelial cells. Here, we observed the co-culture of Fucci-labeled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) together with normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) using time-lapse imaging and analyzed by multicellular concurrent tracking. In the G0/G1 period, HUVECs migrate faster than in the S/G2/M period, because G0/G1 is the mobile phase and S/G2/M is the proliferation phase in the cell cycle. When HUVECs are co-cultured, they tend to move randomly until they find existing tracks that they then follow to form clusters. Extracellular matrix (ECM) staining showed that collagen IV, laminin and thrombospondin deposited in accordance with endothelial cell networks. Therefore the HUVECs may migrate on the secreted ECM and exhibit tracing behavior, where the HUVECs migrate toward each other.

Doxorubicin (Dox) is commonly used as a model of cardiomyopathy, a condition that often precedes cardiovascular remodeling and heart failure.

Human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMVEC) treated with Dox also showed increased levels of ALK4/5 ligands, Smad2/3 transcriptional targets, a decrease in proliferation and suppression of vascular network formation in a HCMVEC and human cardiac fibroblasts co-culture assay.

We used the inhibitor of ALK4/5 kinases SB431542 (SB) in concert with Dox to ascertain the role of TGF-\u03b2 pathway activation in doxorubicin induced endothelial cell defects. SB prevented the suppression of HCMVEC proliferation in the presence of TGF-\u03b22 and activin A, and alleviated the inhibition of HCMVEC proliferation by Dox.

The MetAP2 subtype is up-regulated in many cancers, and selective inhibition of MetAP2 suppresses both vascularization and growth of tumors in animal models. The natural product fumagillin is a selective and potent irreversible inhibitor of MetAP2, and semisynthetic derivatives of fumagillin have shown promise in clinical studies for the treatment of cancer, and, more recently, for obesity. Further development of fumagillin derivatives has been complicated, however, by their generally poor pharmacokinetics. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we developed an easily diversifiable synthesis of a novel class of MetAP2 inhibitors that were designed to mimic fumagillin's molecular scaffold but have improved pharmacological profiles. These substances were found to be potent and selective inhibitors of MetAP2, as demonstrated in biochemical enzymatic assays against three MetAP isoforms. Inhibitors with the same relative and absolute stereoconfiguration as fumagillin displayed significantly higher activity than their diastereomeric and enantiomeric isomers. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the inhibitors covalently modify His231 in the MetAP2 active site via ring-opening of a spiroepoxide. Biochemically active substances inhibited the growth of endothelial cells and a MetAP2-sensitive cancer cell line, while closely related inactive isomers had little effect on the proliferation of either cell type.

The RT-PCR analysis of RET expression in breast tumors of 446 patients and 57 PDX, showed elevated levels of RET in ER+ and HER2+ subtypes and in a small subgroup of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). The activity of Vandetanib was tested in vivo in three PDX models of TNBC and one model of HER2+ BC with different expression levels of RET and EGFR. Vandetanib induced tumor regression in PDX models with high expression of RET or EGFR. The effect was associated with inhibition of RET/EGFR phosphorylation and MAP kinase pathway and increased necrosis. In a PDX model with no expression of RET nor EGFR, Vandetanib slowed tumor growth without inducing tumor regression. In addition, treatment by Vandetanib decreased expression of murine Vegf receptors and the endothelial marker Cd31 in the four PDX models tested, suggesting inhibition of tumor vascularization.

The sizes of the MTF and inferior turbinate flap (ITF) and these distances up to the frontal base were analyzed by computed tomography (CT) using a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) in 20 patients. The minimum flap measurement to reconstruct the skull base was defined as the distance from the basal plate to the medial slope or lateral slope edge of the MTF and the ITF on the coronal view. Next, we reviewed clinical data from three patients with dural deficits who underwent endoscopic vascularized MTF reconstruction. The distance to the frontal base from the ITF was significantly longer than that from the MTF. The minimum length of the MTF measured by coronal CT was similar to the distance to the frontal base. In contrast, the minimum length of the ITF was shorter than the distance to the frontal base.

Forced expression of the Mena(INV) isoform drives invasion, intravasation and metastasis. However, the abundance and distribution of endogenously expressed Mena(INV) within primary tumors during progression remain unknown, as most studies to date have only assessed relative mRNA levels from dissociated tumor samples. We have developed a Mena(INV) isoform-specific monoclonal antibody and used it to examine Mena(INV) expression patterns in mouse mammary and human breast tumors. Mena(INV) expression increases during tumor progression and to examine the relationship between Mena(INV) expression and markers for epithelial or mesenchymal status, stemness, stromal cell types and hypoxic regions. Further, while Mena(INV) robustly expressed in vascularized areas of the tumor, it is not confined to cells adjacent to blood vessels.

Here, the oxygen-sensing system (PHD-HIF) has recently been put into focus, since the prolyl-hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD) and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are considered as potential therapeutic targets to treat ischemia, cancers or age-related macula degeneration. While the oxygen-sensing system (PHD-HIF) has been studied intensively in this respect, only little is known from developing vertebrate embryos since mutations within this pathway led to an early decease of embryos due to placental defects. During vertebrate embryogenesis, a progenitor cell called hemangioblast is assumed to give rise to blood cells and blood vessels in a process called hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis, respectively. Xenopus provides an ideal experimental system to address these processes in vivo, as its development does not depend on a functional placenta and thus allows analyzing the role of oxygen directly. To this end, we adopted a computer-controlled four-channel system, which allowed us to culture Xenopus embryos under defined oxygen concentrations. Our data show that the development of vascular structures and blood cells is strongly impaired under hypoxia, while general development is less compromised. Interestingly, suppression of Phd2 function using specific antisense morpholinos or a chemical inhibitor resulted in mostly overlapping vascular defects; nevertheless, blood cell was formed almost normally. Our results provide the first evidence that oxygen via Phd2 has a decisive influence on the formation of the vascular network during vertebrate embryogenesis.

This, in turn, is a major prerequisite for the constructs' long-term function. 'Prevascularization' has emerged as a promising concept in tissue engineering, aiming at the generation of a preformed microvasculature in tissue constructs prior to their implantation. This should shorten the time period during which the constructs are avascular and suffer hypoxic conditions. Herein, we provide an overview of current strategies for the generation of preformed microvascular networks within tissue constructs. In vitro approaches use cell seeding, spheroid formation or cell sheet technologies. In situ approaches use the body as a natural bioreactor to induce vascularization by angiogenic ingrowth or flap and arteriovenous (AV)-loop techniques. In future, these strategies may be supplemented by the transplantation of adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments or the in vitro generation of highly organized microvascular networks by means of sophisticated microscale technologies and microfluidic systems.

Recent in vitro evidence in the literature, using cell lines, proposes that the peptide hormone ghrelin may have angiogenic properties. In this study, we aim to investigate if ghrelin could promote postischemic angiogenesis in a mouse model of CLI and, further, identify the mechanistic pathway(s) that underpin ghrelin's proangiogenic properties. CLI was induced in male CD1 mice by femoral artery ligation. Animals were then randomized to receive either vehicle or acylated ghrelin (150 \u03bcg/kg sc) for 14 consecutive days. Subsequently, synchrotron radiation microangiography was used to assess hindlimb perfusion. Subsequent tissue samples were collected for molecular and histological analysis. Ghrelin treatment markedly improved limb perfusion by promoting the generation of new capillaries and arterioles (internal diameter less than 50 \u03bcm) within the ischemic hindlimb that were both structurally and functionally normal; evident by robust endothelium-dependent vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine. Molecular analysis revealed that ghrelin's angiogenic properties were linked to activation of prosurvival Akt/vascular endothelial growth factor/Bcl-2 signaling cascade, thus reducing the apoptotic cell death and subsequent fibrosis. Further, ghrelin treatment activated proangiogenic (miR-126 and miR-132) and antifibrotic (miR-30a) microRNAs (miRs) while inhibiting antiangiogenic (miR-92a and miR-206) miRs. Importantly, in vitro knockdown of key proangiogenic miRs (miR-126 and miR-132) inhibited the angiogenic potential of ghrelin.

Cyclic loading stimulates the activity of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 and thereby increases the expression and release of ANGPTL4 from human tendon cells. Targeting ANGPTL4 and its regulatory pathways is a potential avenue for regulating tendon vascularization to improve tendon healing or adaptation.\nThe mechanisms that regulate angiogenic activity in injured or mechanically loaded tendons are poorly understood. The present study examined the potential role of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) in the angiogenic response of tendons subjected to repetitive mechanical loading or injury. Cyclic stretching of human tendon fibroblasts stimulated the expression and release of ANGPTL4 protein via transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) signalling, and the released ANGPTL4 was pro-angiogenic. Angiogenic activity was increased following ANGPTL4 injection into mouse patellar tendons, whereas the patellar tendons of ANGPTL4 knockout mice displayed reduced angiogenesis following injury. In human rotator cuff tendons, the expression of ANGPTL4 was correlated with the density of tendon endothelial cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study characterizing a role of ANGPTL4 in the tendon. ANGPTL4 may assist in the regulation of vascularity in the injured or mechanically loaded tendon.

To model the human condition, a high-fat Western diet that includes liquid sugar consumption has been used in mice. Even though liver pathophysiology has been well characterized in the model, little is known about the metabolic phenotype (e.g., energy expenditure, activity, or food intake). Furthermore, whether the consumption of liquid sugar exacerbates the development of glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and adipose tissue dysfunction in the model is currently in question. In our study, a high-fat Western diet (HFWD) with liquid sugar [fructose and sucrose (F/S)] induced acute hyperphagia above that observed in HFWD-fed mice, yet without changes in energy expenditure. Liquid sugar (F/S) exacerbated HFWD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance and impaired the storage capacity of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). Hepatic TG, plasma alanine aminotransferase, and normalized liver weight were significantly increased only in HFWD+F/S-fed mice. HFWD+F/S also resulted in increased hepatic fibrosis and elevated collagen 1a2, collagen 3a1, and TGF\u03b2 gene expression. Furthermore, HWFD+F/S-fed mice developed more profound eWAT inflammation characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy, macrophage infiltration, a dramatic increase in crown-like structures, and upregulated proinflammatory gene expression. An early hypoxia response in the eWAT led to reduced vascularization and increased fibrosis gene expression in the HFWD+F/S-fed mice.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the microvascular blood flow, oxygenation, and survival of a tarsoconjunctival flap in an experimental porcine model of the modified Hughes procedure.\nThe modified Hughes procedure was performed in 9 pigs. Microvascular blood flow was measured by laser Doppler velocimetry. Tissue oxygenation was measured using a Licox system, and tissue survival was determined by analyzing histologic sections of biopsy specimens from the lower edge of the flap.\nBlood flow and the oxygenation of the tissue decreased gradually during dissection and advancement of the tarsoconjunctival flap. At the time when the flap was sutured into place, there was virtually no blood flow or oxygenation of the tissue. However, flap survival did not seem to be compromised, as shown by the absence of pyknotic cell nuclei necrosis in the biopsy specimens, 12 hours after the procedure.\nThe pedicle of the tarsoconjunctival flap does not seem to contribute to the nourishment of the tarsoconjunctival flap.

Prevascularizing hMSC sheets with endothelial cells (ECs) will improve 3D tissue performance by supporting cell survival and accelerating integration with host tissue. It is hypothesized that hypoxia cultured hMSC sheets can promote microvessel network formation and preserve stemness of hMSCs. This study investigates the vascularization of hMSC sheets under different oxygen tensions. It is found that the HN condition, in which hMSC sheets formed under physiological hypoxia (2% O2 ) and then cocultured with ECs under normoxia (20% O2 ), enables longer and more branched microvessel network formation. The observation is corroborated by higher levels of angiogenic factors in coculture medium. Additionally, the hypoxic hMSC sheet is more uniform and less defective, which facilitates fabrication of 3D prevascularized tissue construct by layering the prevascularized hMSC sheets and maturing in rotating wall vessel bioreactor. The hMSCs in the 3D construct still maintain multilineage differentiation ability, which indicates the possible application of the 3D construct for various connective tissues regeneration.

VEGF-loaded RGD hydrogels increased vascularization compared to VEGF-free RGD hydrogels, but the levels of vascularization for these VEGF-containing RGD hydrogels were similar to those of VEGF-free GFOGER hydrogels.

The narrow fetoscopic field of views and the vast vascular network on the placenta make examination and photocoagulation treatment of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome challenging. Though ultrasonography is used for intraoperative guidance, its navigational ability is not fully exploited. This work aims to integrate 3D ultrasound imaging and endoscopic vision seamlessly for placental vasculature mapping through a self-contained framework without external navigational devices.\nThis is achieved through development, integration, and experimentation of novel navigational modules. Firstly, a framework design that addresses the current limitations based on identified gaps is conceptualized. Secondly, integration of navigational modules including (1) ultrasound-based localization, (2) image alignment, and (3) vision-based tracking to update the scene texture map is implemented. This updated texture map is projected to an ultrasound-constructed 3D model for photorealistic texturing of the 3D scene creating a panoramic view of the moving fetoscope. In addition, a collaborative scheme for the integration of the modular workflow system is proposed to schedule updates in a systematic fashion. Finally, experiments are carried out to evaluate each modular variation and an integrated collaborative scheme of the framework.\nThe modules and the collaborative scheme are evaluated through a series of phantom experiments with controlled trajectories for repeatability. The collaborative framework demonstrated the best accuracy (5.2\u00a0% RMS error) compared with all the three single-module variations during the experiment. Validation on an ex vivo monkey placenta shows visual continuity of the freehand fetoscopic panorama.\nThe proposed developed collaborative framework and the evaluation study of the framework variations provide analytical insights for effective integration of ultrasonography and endoscopy.

Here, we investigated the growth pattern of solid sarcoma implanted into the murine cranial and caudal anatomical locations and tried to explore the location specific expression pattern of crucial mammalian mitotic regulators such as Aurora kinase A, Histone H3 and c-Myc in the cranio-caudally originated solid tumors. In addition, the influence of local tumor microenvironment on regional sarcoma growth was also taken into consideration. We found that solid sarcoma developed differentially when implanted into two different anatomical locations and most notably, enhanced tumor growth was observed in case of cranially implanted sarcoma than the caudal sarcoma. Interestingly, Aurora kinase A and c-Myc expression and histone H3 phosphorylation level were comparatively higher in the cranial tumor than the caudal. In addition, variation of tumor stroma in a location specific manner also facilitated tumor growth. Cranial sarcoma microenvironment was well vascularized than the caudal one and consequently, a significantly higher microvessel density count was observed which was parallel with low hypoxic response with sign of local tumor inflammation in this region.

{"title": "Reck enables cerebrovascular development by promoting canonical Wnt signaling.", "abstract": "The cerebral vasculature provides the massive blood supply that the brain needs to grow and survive. By acquiring distinctive cellular and molecular characteristics it becomes the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a selectively permeable and protective interface between the brain and the peripheral circulation that maintains the extracellular milieu permissive for neuronal activity. Accordingly, there is great interest in uncovering the mechanisms that modulate the formation and differentiation of the brain vasculature. By performing a forward genetic screen in zebrafish we isolated no food for thought (nft\u2009(y72)), a recessive late-lethal mutant that lacks most of the intracerebral central arteries (CtAs), but not other brain blood vessels. We found that the cerebral vascularization deficit of nft\u2009(y72) mutants is caused by an inactivating lesion in reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs [reck; also known as suppressor of tumorigenicity 15 protein (ST15)], which encodes a membrane-anchored tumor suppressor glycoprotein. Our findings highlight Reck as a novel and pivotal modulator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway that acts in endothelial cells to enable intracerebral vascularization and proper expression of molecular markers associated with BBB formation. Additional studies with cultured endothelial cells suggest that, in other contexts, Reck impacts vascular biology via the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) cascade.

However, its effects on angiogenesis have not been known yet. Here, we sought to determine the biological effects of CS-6 on signaling mechanisms during angiogenesis. Our present results fully demonstrate that CS-6 could significantly inhibit VEGF triggered HUVECs proliferation, migration, invasion and tubulogenesis in vitro and blocked vascularization in Matrigel plugs impregnated in C57/BL6 mice as well as reduced vessel density in human lung tumor xenograft implanted in nude mice. Computer simulations revealed that CS-6 interacted with the ATP-binding sites of VEGFR-2 using molecular docking. Furthermore, western blot analysis indicated that CS-6 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 kinase and suppressed the activity of VEGFR-2-mediated signaling cascades. Therefore, our studies demonstrated that CS-6 inhibited angiogenesis by inhibiting the activation of VEGFR-2 signaling pathways and CS-6 could be a potential candidate in angiogenesis-related disease therapy.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["NingTang", "LeiShi", "ZhenlongYu", "PeipeiDong", "ChaoWang", "XiaokuiHuo", "BaojingZhang", "ShanshanHuang", "SaDeng", "KexinLiu", "TonghuiMa", "XiaoboWang", "LijunWu", "Xiao-ChiMa"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.6514"}
{"title": "Putative CD133+ melanoma cancer stem cells induce initial angiogenesis in vivo.", "abstract": "Tumor angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis, and is regulated by a complex network of various types of cells, chemokines, and stimulating factors. In contrast to sprouting angiogenesis, tumor angiogenesis is also influenced by hypoxia, inflammation, and the attraction of bone-marrow-derived cells. Recently, cancer stem cells have been reported to mimic vascularization by differentiating into endothelial cells and inducing vessel formation. In this study, the influence of cancer stem cells on initial angiogenesis was evaluated for the metastatic melanoma cell line D10. Following flow cytometry, CD133+ and CD133- cells were isolated using magnetic cell separation and different cell fractions were transferred to porcine gelatin sponges, which were implanted into the dorsal skinfold chamber of immunocompromised mice. Angiogenesis was analyzed based on microvessel density over a 10-day period using in vivo fluorescence microscopy, and the results were verified using immunohistology. CD133+ D10 cells showed a significant induction of early angiogenesis in vivo, contrary to CD133- D10 cells, unsorted D10 cells, and negative control. Neovascularization was confirmed by visualizing endothelial cells by immunohistology using an anti-CD31 antibody. Because CD133+ cells are rare in clinical specimens and hardly amenable to functional assays, the D10 cell line provides a suitable model to study the angiogenic potential of putative cancer stem cells and the leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction in the dorsal skinfold chamber in vivo. This cancer stem cell model might be useful in the development and evaluation of therapeutic agents targeting tumors.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["R\u00fcdiger MZimmerer", "PeterMatthiesen", "FritjofKreher", "AndreasKampmann", "SimonSpalthoff", "PhilippJehn", "GidoBittermann", "Nils-ClaudiusGellrich", "FrankTavassol"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2015.12.001"}

Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and autofluorescence images and also fluorescein angiograms were analyzed to determine the functional and morphologic development over time.\nThe long-term outcome of 22 eyes (21 patients, 13 women and 8 men; 65-85 years; mean: 76 years) with RPE tear was performed with minimal follow-up of 3 years (range: 3-5 years, mean: 44 months) and re-treatment with different therapeutic strategies. The eyes were differentiated in 2 groups according to the course of BCVA after the first 2 years of follow-up: Group 1 (11 eyes) demonstrated a stabilized or improved BCVA after 2 years and Group 2 (11 eyes) demonstrated a decrease in BCVA after 2 years. The initial BCVA between both groups was comparable. Also the mean initial size of the RPE tear was the same between the 2 groups, the area of the RPE tear decreased continuously during follow-up in Group 1, whereas this was the case in Group 2 only at the beginning of treatment with a further increase of the size of the RPE tear with longer follow-up. This corresponded with a different morphologic development between the two groups. In Group 1, increasing recovery of autofluorescence at the RPE-free area was visible beginning from the outer border, whereas in Group 2, further growth of the neovascular complex in the area of the RPE tear was observed resulting in larger fibrovascular scars. In addition, in both groups, the development of hyperreflective tissue was seen on spectral domain optical coherence tomography in the RPE-free area. The major therapeutic difference between the 2 groups was a significantly larger number of injections especially during the first year in Group 1.\nThe development of RPE tear after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for vascularized pigment epithelial detachment in exudative age-related macular degeneration does not necessarily result in large disciform scars and functional loss, but multiple injections seem to be beneficial especially in the first year. With this strategy, RPE tears seem to be covered by autofluorescent and hyperreflective tissue and a regrowth of the neovascular complex can be prohibited. As a result, photoreceptor cells regain their metabolic support with functional recovery.", "journal": "Retina (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["BrittaHeimes", "Marie-LouiseFarecki", "SinaBartels", "AnnaBarrelmann", "MatthiasGutfleisch", "GeorgSpital", "AlbrechtLommatzsch", "DanielPauleikhoff"], "doi": "10.1097/IAE.0000000000000823"}
{"title": "Multiple Beneficial Roles of Repressor of Estrogen Receptor Activity (REA) in Suppressing the Progression of Endometriosis.", "abstract": "Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent, inflammation-driven gynecologic disorder in which endometrial tissue creates inflammatory lesions at extrauterine sites, leading to pelvic pain and impaired fertility. Although dysregulated estrogen receptor (ER) signaling has been implicated, understanding of this disease is incomplete and current therapies are of limited benefit. Using an immunocompetent syngeneic murine model, we used combinations of donor uterine tissue and/or recipient host mice with partial genetic deletion of the ER coregulator, repressor of ER activity (REA) (also known as prohibitin 2), to investigate roles of REA in the contributions of donor uterine tissue and host cell influences on endometriosis establishment and progression. Ectopic lesions derived from donor tissue with half the wild-type gene dosage of REA (REA(+/-)) grown in REA(+/-) hosts displayed enhanced proliferation, vascularization, and markedly increased neuron innervation and inflammatory responses, including elevated cytokine production, nuclear factor kappa B activation, cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and immune cell infiltration. Although lesion progression was greatest when REA was reduced in both donor tissue and host animals, other donor/host combinations indicated that distinct stimulatory inputs were derived from ectopic tissue (proliferative signals) and host cells (inflammatory signals). Importantly, depletion of REA in primary human endometriotic stromal cells led to elevated proliferation and expression of cell cycle regulators. Notably, REA was significantly lower in human endometriotic tissue versus normal human endometrium. Thus, REA modulates cross talk among multiple cell types in the uterine tissue and host background, serving as a brake on the estradiol-ER axis and restraining multiple aspects that contribute to the pathologic progression of endometriosis.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2015-12-15", "authors": ["YuechaoZhao", "YiruChen", "YeKuang", "Milan KBagchi", "Robert NTaylor", "John AKatzenellenbogen", "Benita SKatzenellenbogen"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2015-1324"}

{"title": "Establishment of an Early Vascular Network Promotes the Formation of Ectopic Bone.", "abstract": "Vascularization is crucial for the induction of bone formation. In this study, we investigated the application of two subtypes of peripheral blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to stimulate vessel formation in ectopic bone constructs. Early and late outgrowth EPCs (E-EPC and L-EPC, respectively) were characterized for their ability to form network structures in vitro and perfused vessels subcutaneously in mice. Only L-EPCs showed the formation of fully connected networks on Matrigel two-dimensional (2D) angiogenesis assays. The presence of multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) inhibited network formation in 2D assays, but stimulated network formation in three-dimensional plugs. In vivo studies revealed that at 2 weeks, the highest incidence of formed perfused vessels was reached by implanted E-EPC/MSC constructs and this could be attributed to the presence of E-EPCs. L-EPCs displayed a significantly lower frequency of blood vessel formation than E-EPCs and this was accompanied by a lowering of total luminal area densities. Nevertheless, combined E-EPC/L-EPC application somewhat increased the percentage incidence of perfused vessels. After 6 weeks, differences in vascularization were still obvious as all three EPC-based constructs contained higher numbers of perfused vessels than constructs containing MSCs alone. Bone was formed in all constructs at an incidence that coincided with high density of perfused vessels after 2 weeks. Altogether, our findings suggest the differential establishment of vascular networks by E-EPCs and L-EPCs and suggest the importance of early vasculogenesis in ectopic bone formation.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Our aim was to compare the local tissue response to implanted human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC). MSC and EC were cultured in poly(L-lactide-co-1,5-dioxepan-2-one) scaffolds for 1 week in a bioreactor system, after which they were implanted subcutaneously in NOD/SCID mice. After 3 weeks, scaffolds were retrieved, and the mRNA expression of selected genes involved in hypoxia and inflammation was examined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and correlated with immunofluorescent staining for corresponding proteins. The Toll-like receptor signaling pathway was examined by superarray hybridization. The expression of 53 angiogenesis-related proteins was investigated by a proteome profiler angiogenesis antibody array kit. Vascularization was quantified using immunohistochemistry for CD31. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factors and biomarkers for angiogenesis was more strongly upregulated in response to implanted EC than to MSC, suggesting a higher sensitivity to low oxygen tension among EC. Hypoxic signaling was increased after implantation of EC compared with MSC, leading to a prolonged acute inflammatory phase that promoted ingrowth of vascular cells and establishment of the circulation. Inflammatory cytokines were also differently expressed at the gene and protein levels in the two experimental groups, resulting in altered recruitment of acute and chronic inflammatory cells. The end result of these differences was increased vessel formation within the constructs in the EC group.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Pgf/PGF, Vegfa/VEGF, Vegf receptor (Vegfr)1 and Vegfr2 expression were examined in the brains of embryonic day (E)12.5, 14.5, 16.5 and 18.5 C57BL/6 (B6) mice using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. The cerebral vasculature was compared between Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) and B6 embryonic and adult brains using whole mount techniques. Vulnerability to cerebral ischemia was investigated using a left common carotid ligation assay.\nPgf/PGF and Vegfr1 are highly expressed in E12.5-14.5 forebrain relative to VEGF and Vegfr2. Vegfa/VEGF is relatively more abundant in hindbrain (HB). PGF and VEGF expression were similar in midbrain. Delayed HB vascularization was seen at E10.5 and 11.5 in Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) brains. At E14.5, Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) circle of Willis showed unilateral hypoplasia and fewer collateral vessels, defects that persisted post-natally. Functionally, adult Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) mice experienced cerebral ischemia after left common carotid arterial occlusion while B6 mice did not.\nSince Pgf\u200a\u200a(-/-) mice were used, consequences of complete absence of maternal and fetal PGF were defined. Therefore, the effects of maternal versus fetal PGF deficiency on cerebrovascular development cannot be separated. However, as PGF was strongly expressed in the developing brain at all timepoints, we suggest that local PGF has a more important role than distant maternal or placental sources. Full PGF loss is not expected in PE pregnancies, predicting that the effects of PGF deficiency identified in this model will be more severe than any effects in PE-offspring.\nThese studies provoke the question of whether PGF expression is decreased and cerebral vascular maldevelopment occurs in fetuses who experience a preeclamptic gestation. These individuals have already been reported to have elevated risk for stroke and cognitive impairments.\nN/A.\nThis work was supported by awards from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the Canada Research Chairs Program and the Canadian Foundation for Innovation to B.A.C. and by training awards from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Brazil to R.L.L.; Queen's University to V.R.K. and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to M.T.R.

{"title": "Enhanced brain distribution of carboplatin in a primate model after blood-brain barrier disruption using an implantable ultrasound device.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma is both the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Carboplatin chemotherapy has shown only modest efficacy in progressive high-grade gliomas. The limited clinical efficacy of carboplatin may be due to its low concentration in tissue when the drug is delivered intravenously. The aim of this study was to assess whether the tissue concentration of intravenously administered carboplatin could be enhanced by ultrasound-induced blood-brain disruption in a primate model.\nCarboplatin was administered intravenously for 60 min to a single primate following blood-brain barrier opening induced by an implantable ultrasound device. Blood and brain samples were collected after animal killing, which occurred 60 min after the end of carboplatin administration. Platinum quantification in ultrafiltrate plasma and brain samples was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.\nThe brain concentration of platinum was highly enhanced (5.2\u00d7) in the 3.9 cm(3) region sonicated by the US beam, with a higher concentration in more vascularized anatomical structures. At 5 and 10 mm from the US beam axis, platinum concentrations were slightly enhanced (2.2\u00d7 and 1.3\u00d7 respectively).\nThis study demonstrates that BBB opening using an implantable ultrasound transducer enhances the brain distribution of carboplatin in a loco-regional manner. Such a treatment approach is of significant interest for the treatment of primary brain tumors and is under current evaluation in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02253212).", "journal": "Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology", "date": "2015-12-10", "authors": ["LaurianeGoldwirt", "MichaelCanney", "CatherineHorodyckid", "JoelPoupon", "SamiaMourah", "AlexandreVignot", "Jean-YvesChapelon", "AlexandreCarpentier"], "doi": "10.1007/s00280-015-2930-5"}
{"title": "Contribution of synovial lining cells to synovial vascularization of the rat temporomandibular joint.", "abstract": "The lining layer of the synovial membrane in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) contains two types of lining cells: macrophage-like type A and fibroblast-like type B cells. The type B cells are particularly heterogeneous in their morphology and immunoreactivity, so that details of their functions remain unclear. Some of the type B cells exhibit certain resemblances in their ultrastructure to those of an activated capillary pericyte at the initial stage of the angiogenesis. The articular surface, composed of cartilage and the disc in the TMJ, has few vasculatures, whereas the synovial lining layer is richly equipped with blood capillaries to produce the constituent of synovial fluid. The present study investigated at both the light and electron microscopic levels the immunocytochemical characteristics of the synovial lining cells in the adult rat TMJ, focusing on their contribution to the synovial vascularization. It also employed an intravascular perfusion with Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) lectin to identify functional vessels in\u00a0vivo. Results showed that several type B cells expressed desmin, a muscle-specific intermediate filament which is known as the earliest protein to appear during myogenesis as well as being a marker for the immature capillary pericyte. These desmin-positive type B cells showed immunoreactions for vimentin and pericyte markers (neuron-glial 2; NG2 and PDGFR\u03b2) but not for the other markers of myogenic cells (MyoD and myogenin) or a contractile apparatus (\u03b1SMA and caldesmon). Immunoreactivity for RECA-1, an endothelial marker, was observed in the macrophage-like type A cells. The arterioles and venules inside the synovial folds extended numerous capillaries with RECA-1-positive endothelial cells and desmin-positive pericytes to distribute densely in the lining layer. The distal portion of these capillaries showing RECA-1-immunoreactivity lacked lectin-staining, indicating a loss of blood-circulation due to sprouting or termination in the lining layer. The desmin-positive type B and RECA-1-positive type A cells attached to this portion of the capillaries. Some capillaries in the lining layer also expressed ninein, a marker for sprouting endothelial cells, called tip cells. Since an activated pericyte, macrophage and tip cell are known to act together at the forefront of the vessel sprout during angiogenesis, the desmin-positive type B cell and RECA-1-positive type A cell might serve as these angiogenic cells in the synovial lining layer. Tomato lectin perfusion following decalcification would be a highly useful tool for research on the vasculature of the mineralized tissue. Use of this technique combined with immunohistochemistry should permit future extensive investigations on the presence of the physiological angiogenesis and on the function of the lining cells in the synovial membrane.", "journal": "Journal of anatomy", "date": "2015-12-09", "authors": ["KayokoNozawa-Inoue", "FumikoHarada", "JinMagara", "AtsushiOhazama", "TakeyasuMaeda"], "doi": "10.1111/joa.12426\n10.1155/2014/732720"}

Although >30 such operations performed worldwide have yielded promising short-term results, data on long-term outcomes remain scarce. Three full-face transplant recipients were followed for 40 months. Severe changes in volume and composition of the facial allografts were noted. Data from computed tomography performed 6, 18 and 36 months after transplantation were processed to separate allograft from recipient tissues and further into bone, fat and nonfat soft tissues. Skin and muscle biopsies underwent diagnostic evaluation. All three facial allografts sustained significant volume loss (mean 19.55%) between 6 and 36 months after transplant. Bone and nonfat soft tissue volumes decreased significantly over time (17.22% between months 6 and 18 and 25.56% between months 6 and 36, respectively), whereas fat did not. Histological evaluations showed atrophy of muscle fibers. Volumetric and morphometric changes in facial allografts have not been reported previously. The transformation of facial allografts in this study resembled aging through volume loss but differed substantially from regular aging. These findings have implications for risk-benefit assessment, donor selection and measures counteracting muscle and bone atrophy.

Since the treatment of large bone defects is still unsatisfactory, researchers have endeavoured to obtain scaffolds able to release growth and differentiation factors for mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts and endothelial cells in order to obtain faster mineralization and prompt a reliable vascularization. Nowadays, the application of osteoblastic cultures spans from cell physiology and pharmacology to cytocompatibility measurement and osteogenic potential evaluation of novel biomaterials. To overcome the simple traditional monocultures in\u00a0vitro, co-cultures of osteogenic and vasculogenic precursors were introduced with very interesting results. Increasingly complex culture systems have been developed, where cells are seeded on proper scaffolds and stimulated so as to mimic the physiological conditions more accurately.

The aims of this study were to provide detailed anatomical data for the perforating branches of the deep femoral artery and validate their usefulness as recipient vessels for vascularized fibular grafts.\nAnatomical dissection was performed on 11 fresh human cadaveric lower extremities. The number, locations, and diameters of the perforating branches were documented.

{"title": "The matricellular protein CYR61 interferes with normal pancreatic islets architecture and promotes pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor progression.", "abstract": "The significance of matricellular proteins during development and cancer progression is widely recognized. However, how these proteins actively contribute to physiological development and pathological cancer progression is only partially elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of the matricellular protein Cysteine-rich 61 (CYR61) in pancreatic islet development and carcinogenesis. Transgenic expression of CYR61 in \u03b2 cells (Rip1CYR mice) caused irregular islets morphology and distorted sorting of \u03b1 cells, but did not alter islets size, number or vascularization. To investigate the function of CYR61 during carcinogenesis, we crossed Rip1CYR mice with Rip1Tag2 mice, a well-established model of \u03b2 cell carcinogenesis. Beta tumors in Rip1Tag2CYR mice were larger, more invasive and more vascularized compared to tumors in Rip1Tag2 mice. The effect of CYR61 on angiogenesis was fully abrogated by treating mice with the anti-VEGFR2 mAb DC101. Results from in vitro assays demonstrated that CYR61 modulated integrin \u03b16\u03b21-dependent invasion and adhesion without altering its expression. Taken together, these results show that CYR61 expression in pancreatic \u03b2 cells interferes with normal islet architecture, promotes islet tumor growth, invasion and VEGF/VERGFR-2-dependent tumor angiogenesis.

{"title": "Characterization of vasculogenic potential of human adipose-derived endothelial cells in a three-dimensional vascularized skin substitute.", "abstract": "The need for clinically applicable skin substitutes continues to be a matter of fact. Hypothetically, a laboratory grown autologous skin analog with near normal architecture might be a suitable approach to yield both satisfactory functional and cosmetic long-term results. In this study, we explored the use of human endothelial cells derived from freshly isolated adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture model of vascularized bio-engineered skin substitute.\nThe SVF was isolated from human white adipose tissue samples and keratinocytes from human skin biopsies. The SVF, in particular endothelial cells, were characterized using flow cytometry and immuofluorescence analysis. Endothelial and mesenchymal progenitors from the SVF formed blood capillaries after seeding into a 3D collagen type I hydrogel in vitro. Subsequently, human keratinocytes were seeded on the top of those hydrogels to develop a vascularized dermo-epidermal skin substitute.\nFlow cytometric analysis of surface markers of the freshly isolated SVF showed the expression of endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, CD146), mesenchymal/stromal cell-associated markers (CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105), stem cell markers (CD49f, CD117, CD133), and additionally hematopoietic markers (CD14, CD15, CD45). Further analysis of white adipose-derived endothelial cells (watECs) revealed the co-expression of CD31, CD34, CD90, CD105, and partially CD146 on these cells. WatECs were separated from adipose-stromal cells (watASCs) using FACS sorting. WatASCs and watECs cultured separately in a 3D hydrogel for 3\u00a0weeks did not form any vascular structures. Only if co-cultured, both cell types aligned to develop a ramified vascular network in vitro with continuous endothelial lumen formation. Transplantation of those 3D-hydrogels onto immuno-incompetent rats resulted in a rapid connection of human capillaries with the host vessels and formation of functional, blood-perfused mosaic human-rat vessels within only 3-4\u00a0days.\nAdipose tissue represents an attractive cell source due to the ease of isolation and abundance of endothelial as well as mesenchymal cell lineages.

One of the surgical treatments comprises modification of a deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction to facilitate additional lymph node transplantation from the inguinal area.

A virtual planning based on this CTA created for the DIEP flap is presented, with the inguinal lymph nodes included, followed by preoperatively projecting this information on the patient's abdomen.\nA total of 10 patients underwent the standard imaging protocol: A preoperative CTA to assess the vascular anatomy of the lower abdomen.

While most methods focus on single vessel tracking, the few solutions that exist for tracking complete vascular networks are usually computationally intensive and require a lot of user interaction. In this paper we present a method to track full vascular networks iteratively using a single starting point. Our approach is based on a cloud of sampling points distributed over concentric spherical layers. We also proposed a vessel model and a metric of how well a sample point fits this model. Then, we implement the network tracking as a min-cost flow problem, and propose a novel optimization scheme to iteratively track the vessel structure by inherently handling bifurcations and paths. The method was tested using both synthetic and real images. On the 9 different data-sets of synthetic blood vessels, we achieved maximum accuracies of more than 98%. We further use the synthetic data-set to analyze the sensibility of our method to parameter setting, showing the robustness of the proposed algorithm. For real images, we used coronary, carotid and pulmonary data to segment vascular structures and present the visual results. Still for real images, we present numerical and visual results for networks of nerve fibers in the olfactory system. Further visual results also show the potential of our approach for identifying vascular networks topologies. The presented method delivers good results for the several different datasets tested and have potential for segmenting vessel-like structures.

This platform incorporates different stages of vascular development including vasculogenesis, endothelial cell (EC) lining, sprouting angiogenesis, and anastomosis in sequential order. After formation of a capillary network inside the tissue chamber via vasculogenesis, the adjacent microfluidic channels are lined with a monolayer of ECs, which then serve as the high-pressure input (\"artery\") and low pressure output (\"vein\") conduits. To promote a tight interconnection between the artery/vein and the capillary network, sprouting angiogenesis is induced, which promotes anastomosis of the vasculature inside the tissue chamber with the EC lining along the microfluidic channels. Flow of fluorescent microparticles confirms the perfusability of the lumenized microvascular network, and minimal leakage of 70 kDa FITC-dextran confirms physiologic tightness of the EC junctions and completeness of the interconnections between artery/vein and the capillary network. This versatile device design and its robust construction methodology establish a physiological transport model of interconnected perfused vessels from artery to vascularized tissue to vein.

Macro-capsules can be categorized into extravascular and intravascular devices, in which solute transport relies either on diffusion or convection, respectively. Failure of macroencapsulation strategies can be due to limited regenerative capacity of the encased insulin-producing cells, sub-optimal performance of encapsulation biomaterials, insufficient immunoisolation, excessive blood thrombosis for vascular perfusion devices, and inadequate modes of mass transfer to support cell viability and function. However, significant technical advancements have been achieved in macroencapsulation technology, namely reducing diffusion distance for oxygen and nutrients, using pro-angiogenic factors to increase vascularization for islet engraftment, and optimizing membrane permeability and selectivity to prevent immune attacks from host's body.

In addition, the phase sensitivity allows simultaneous label-free acquisition of vascularisation.\nWe demonstrate that FOCI allows longitudinal quantification of progressive autoimmune insulitis, including the three-dimensional quantification of beta cell volume, inflammation and vascularisation. The substantially increased backscattering of islets is dominated by the insulin-zinc nanocrystals in the beta cell granules. This translates into a high specificity for the functional beta cell volume of islets. Applying FOCI to a spontaneous mouse model of type 1 diabetes, we quantify the modifications of the pancreatic microvasculature accompanying the progression of diabetes and reveal a strong correlation between increasing insulitis and density of the vascular network of the islet.\nFOCI provides a novel imaging technique for investigating functional and structural diabetes-induced alterations of the islets. The label-free detection of beta cell volume and infiltration together with vascularisation offers a unique extension to study ACE-transplanted human islets. These results are contributing to a deeper understanding of human islet transplant rejection and label-free in vivo monitoring of drug efficacy.", "journal": "Diabetologia", "date": "2015-11-29", "authors": ["CorinneBerclaz", "AnjaSchmidt-Christensen", "DanielSzlag", "JeromeExtermann", "LisbethHansen", "ArnoBouwens", "MartinVilliger", "JoanGoulley", "FransSchuit", "AnneGrapin-Botton", "TheoLasser", "DanHolmberg"], "doi": "10.1007/s00125-015-3819-x"}

Drug-eluting biomaterial implants can be used to tune the endogenous repair process by the preferential recruitment of pro-regenerative cells. To enhance recruitment of AMs during inflammatory injury, a novel N-desulfated heparin-containing poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) hydrogel was engineered to deliver exogenous stromal derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1), utilizing the natural capacity of heparin to sequester and release growth factors. SDF-1\u03b1 released from the hydrogels maintained its bioactivity and stimulated chemotaxis of bone marrow cells in\u00a0vitro. Intravital microscopy and flow cytometry demonstrated that SDF-1\u03b1 hydrogels implanted in a murine dorsal skinfold window chamber promoted spatially-localized recruitment of AMs relative to unloaded internal control hydrogels. SDF-1\u03b1 delivery stimulated arteriolar remodeling that was correlated with AM enrichment in the injury niche. SDF-1\u03b1, but not unloaded control hydrogels, supported sustained arteriogenesis and microvascular network growth through 7 days. The recruitment of AMs correlated with parameters of vascular remodeling suggesting that tuning the innate immune response by biomaterial SDF-1\u03b1 release is a promising strategy for promoting vascular remodeling in a spatially controlled manner.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2015-11-28", "authors": ["J RKrieger", "M EOgle", "JMcFaline-Figueroa", "C ESegar", "J STemenoff", "E ABotchwey"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.10.045"}

METHODS The surgical anatomy of various tissue flaps and their vascular pedicles was studied in 5 colored silicone-injected anatomical specimens. Medical records were reviewed of 11 consecutive patients who underwent repair of extensive skull base defects with a combination of various vascularized flaps. RESULTS The supraorbital, supratrochlear, superficial temporal, greater auricular, and occipital arteries contribute to the vascular supply of the pericranium. The pericranial flap can be designed based on an axial blood supply. Laterally, various flaps are supplied by the deep or superficial temporal arteries. The nasoseptal flap is a vascular pedicled flap based on the nasoseptal artery. Patients with extensive skull base defects can undergo effective repair with dual flaps or triple flaps using these pedicled vascularized flaps. CONCLUSIONS Multiple pedicled flaps are available for reconstitution of the skull base. Knowledge of the surgical anatomy of these flaps is crucial for the skull base surgeon. These vascularized tissue flaps can be used effectively as single or combination flaps. Multilayered closure of cranial base defects with vascularized tissue can be used safely and may lead to excellent repair outcomes.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "date": "2015-11-28", "authors": ["SamSafavi-Abbasi", "NoritakaKomune", "Jacob BArcher", "HaiSun", "NicholasTheodore", "JeffreyJames", "Andrew SLittle", "PeterNakaji", "Michael ESughrue", "Albert LRhoton", "Robert FSpetzler"], "doi": "10.3171/2015.5.JNS15529"}

Hence, finding the most appropriate model is always a vital part of any experimental design. Angiogenesis research has also been much affected due to lack of simple, reliable, and relevant models which could be easily quantitated. The angiogenesis models have been used extensively for studying the action of various molecules for agonist or antagonistic behaviour and associated mechanisms. Here, we have described two protocols or models which have been popularly utilized for studying angiogenic parameters.

Five conditions were studied: no pre-culture (NP), 1 week pre-culture (1P), 2 week pre-culture (2P), 3 week pre-culture (3P), and scaffolds without cells (control, C). Scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model for 9 days.

We generated a pre-vascularized buccal mucosa equivalent in a tri-culture of primary buccal epithelial cells, fibroblasts and microvascular endothelial cells, using a native collagen membrane as a scaffold. A successful pre-vascularization and dense formation of capillary-like structures at superficial areas was demonstrated. The lumen size of pre-formed blood vessels corresponded to the capillary size in\u00a0vivo (10-30\u00a0\u03bcm). Comparing native with a highly cross-linked collagen membrane we found a distinct higher formation of capillary-like structures on the native membrane, apparently caused by higher secretion of angiogenic factors such as PDGF, IL-8 and angiopoietin by the cells. These capillary-like structures became functional blood vessels through anastomosis with the host vasculature after implantation in nude mice.

Rhesus macaques received belatacept maintenance therapy with or without the addition of LFA-1 blockade, which was achieved using a murine-derived LFA-1-specific antibody TS1/22. Additional experiments were performed using chimeric rhesus IgG1 (TS1/22R1) or IgG4 (TS1/22R4) variants, each engineered to limit antibody clearance. Despite evidence of proper binding to the target molecule and impaired cellular egress from the intravascular space indicative of a therapeutic effect similar to prior islet studies, LFA-1 blockade failed to significantly prolong graft survival. Furthermore, evidence of impaired protective immunity against cytomegalovirus was observed.

Twenty-eight patients affected by histopathologically confirmed STT were included in a prospective study. All patients underwent both DCE MRI and IVIM DWI. The perfusion fraction f, diffusion coefficient D and perfusion-related diffusion coefficient D* were estimated using a bi-exponential function to fit the DWI data.

Maps of the initial area under the gadolinium concentration curve (IAUGC), time to peak (TTP) and maximum slope of increase (MSI) were derived using commercial software. The relationships between the DCE MRI and IVIM DWI measurements were assessed by Spearman's test. To exclude false positive results under multiple testing, the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was applied. The Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate the differences between all variables in patients with non-myxoid and myxoid STT.

By modifying the tumor cell phenotype and the tumor microenvironment, it may also modulate the immune system. However, out-of-field reactions of RT mostly assume further immune activation. Here, the sequence of the applications of RT and immunotherapy is crucial, just as the dose and fractionation may be. Lower single doses may impact on tumor vascularization and immune cell infiltration in particular, while higher doses may impact on intratumoral induction and production of type I interferons. The induction of immunogenic cancer cell death seems in turn to be a common mechanism for most RT schemes. Dendritic cells (DCs) are activated by the released danger signals and by taking up tumor peptides derived from irradiated cells. DCs subsequently activate T cells, a process that has to be tightly controlled to ensure tolerance. Inhibitory pathways known as immune checkpoints exist for this purpose and are exploited by tumors to inhibit immune responses. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on T cells are two major checkpoints. The biological concepts behind the findings that RT in combination with anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-L1 blockade stimulates CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity are reviewed in detail.

{"title": "Lipid transport to avian oocytes and to the developing embryo.", "abstract": "Studies of receptor-mediated lipoprotein metabolic pathways in avian species have revealed that physiological intricacies of specific cell types are highly analogous to those in mammals. A prime example for the power of comparative studies across different animal kingdoms, elucidated in the chicken, is that the expression of different lipoprotein receptors in somatic cells and oocytes are the key to oocyte growth. In avian species, yolk precursor transport from the hen's liver to rapidly growing oocytes and the subsequent transfer of yolk nutrients via the yolk sac to the developing embryo are highly efficient processes. Oocytes grow from a diameter of 5 mm to 2.5-3 cm in only 7 days, and the yolk sac transfers nutrients from the yolk stored in the mature oocyte to the embryo within just 2 weeks. The underlying key transport mechanism is receptor-mediated endocytosis of macromolecules, i.e., of hepatically synthesized yolk precursors for oocyte growth, and of mature yolk components for embryo nutrition, respectively. Recently, the receptors involved, as well as the role of lipoprotein synthesis in the yolk sac have been identified. As outlined here, lipoprotein degradation/resynthesis cycles and the expression of lipoprotein receptors are not only coordinated with the establishment of the follicular architecture embedding the oocyte, but also with the generation of the yolk sac vasculature essential for nutrient transfer to the embryo.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical research", "date": "2015-11-21", "authors": ["Wolfgang JSchneider"], "doi": "10.7555/JBR.30.20150048"}

First results of systemic administration of Mitomycin C-treated PBMCs in VCA demonstrated a significant prolongation of allograft survival. The aim of this study is to evaluate if local administration of MMC-PBMCs prolongs allograft survival in allogeneic hind limb transplantations of the rat.\nSixty allogeneic hind limb transplantations in the rat were performed in six groups. Lewis rats (LEW) were used as hind limb donors and Brown-Norway rats (BN) as recipients. Animals in group A received donor-derived MMC-treated PBMCs locally (i.m.). Group B received no immunosuppressive therapy, group C received a standard immunosuppressive regime consisting of FK506 and Prednisolon, group D (BN to BN) comprised isograft transplantations without immunosuppressive treatment, group E received non-treated PBMCs (i.m.) and group F received phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without cells. The transplanted hind limbs were assessed for color, edema, skin, hair condition, and consistency of the thigh every 8 hours.\nRejection in group A was delayed to an average of 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 days.

It has previously been suggested that miRNAs have important roles in the initiation and progression of glioblastoma; however, the effects of miR\u2011566 in glioblastoma are currently unclear. The present study aimed to demonstrate that miR-566 can modulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by targeting Von Hippel\u2011Lindau (VHL) in glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the expression of miR-566. Glioblastoma is a highly vascularized tumor, which exhibits increased expression of angiogenic factors, including VEGF, which are crucial in the process of glioblastoma angiogenesis. Existing research has demonstrated that VHL is a tumor suppressor gene that is associated with various tumors. In addition, VHL is able to regulate the expression of VEGF by promoting the degradation of hypoxia\u2011inducible factor\u20111\u03b1 via ubiquitination. It has been predicted, using bioinformatics, that the VHL gene is regulated by miR\u2011566. Therefore, the present study hypothesized that miR\u2011566 may regulate VEGF expression by targeting VHL during the angiogenic process of glioblastoma multiforme. The results of the present study demonstrated that inhibition of miR\u2011566 expression increases the expression levels of VHL, decreases the expression levels of VEGF, and inhibits the invasive and migratory abilities of glioblastoma.

Because a flap resists infection better than an avascular graft, a vascularized IT graft is useful for reconstructive surgeries pertaining to infected wounds or wounds in contact with artificial material. The purpose of this study was to examine the vascular anatomy of the IT.\nThe study sample consisted of 39 limbs of freshly frozen cadavers. The study was divided into three parts. The ascending and transverse branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (LCFA) of all cadavers were injected with latex. Distance from the tensor fasciae latae muscle and the most distal point at which the vessel on the IT was stained by latex was recorded. A microscopic observation was performed for these limbs. The deep femoral artery (DFA) or superior lateral genicular artery (SLGA) was also observed.\nThe length of the IT fed by the LCFA was 162.3\u2009\u00b1\u200936.2 mm. The IT vascularity was located between the layered structure of the fascia and there was a vascular source for the IT within 1 mm above the IT by optical microscopy. The vascularity derived from the DFA or SLGA was not confirmed in any specimens.\nBlood supply of the IT was derived from the LCFA and a vascularized IT graft could be elevated in length to approximately 16 cm.

Exploring ways to disarm alloreactive T cells represents a potential strategy to promote long-term allograft acceptance and survival. T cell Ig domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) has previously been demonstrated as a central regulator of T helper 1 (Th1) responses and immune tolerance. Hence, TIM-3 may be an important molecule for decreasing immunological rejection during composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA). In this study, BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were chosen as the experimental animals. The effects of TIM-3 on allograft rejection were explored using TIM-3-modified mature dendritic cells (TIM-3 mDCs). A laser speckle blood flow (LSBF) imager was used to evaluate blood distribution of the BALB/c mice. ELISA, MTT, ELISPOT assays and flow cytometry analysis were carried out for further researches. We found that TIM-3 could obviously prolong the survival time of the transplanted limbs. And TIM-3 could mitigate the immune response and thus enhance immune tolerance after CTA. Also, TIM-3 can induce lymphocyte hyporesponsiveness, including facilitating lymphocyte apoptosis, decreasing lymphocyte proliferation, and influencing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, TIM-3 overexpression could induce CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into regulatory T cells (Tregs), which recalibrate the effector and regulatory arms of the alloimmune response. In summary, we concluded that TIM-3 can mitigate allograft rejection and thus enhance immune tolerance by inducing lymphocyte hyporesponsiveness and increasing the number of Tregs of the alloimmune response.

Echocardiography and histologic analyses demonstrated that both EPC and MSC improved cardiac function and enhanced vascularization, although fibrosis was reduced only in the EPC transplanted hearts. Different paracrine factors were enriched in EPC and MSC. However, once injected into the hearts, they induced similar types of paracrine factors in the heart. Transplanted EPC or MSC were mostly localized at the perivascular areas. This study demonstrated that EPC and MSC can be simultaneously derived from UCB under the same initial culture conditions, and that common paracrine factors are involved in the repair of MI.\nLate EPC and MSC are effective for infarct repair, apparently mediated through common humoral mechanisms.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2015-11-10", "authors": ["Sung-WhanKim", "Hong LianJin", "Seok-MinKang", "SinyoungKim", "Kyung-JongYoo", "YangsooJang", "Hyun OkKim", "Young-supYoon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.10.110"}
{"title": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) in tumor growth and progression: Lessons learned from pediatric oncology.", "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a sympathetic neurotransmitter with pleiotropic actions, many of which are highly relevant to tumor biology. Consequently, the peptide has been implicated as a factor regulating the growth of a variety of tumors. Among them, two pediatric malignancies with high endogenous NPY synthesis and release - neuroblastoma and Ewing sarcoma - became excellent models to investigate the role of NPY in tumor growth and progression. The stimulatory effect on tumor cell proliferation, survival, and migration, as well as angiogenesis in these tumors, is mediated by two NPY receptors, Y2R and Y5R, which are expressed in either a constitutive or inducible manner. Of particular importance are interactions of the NPY system with the tumor microenvironment, as hypoxic conditions commonly occurring in solid tumors strongly activate the NPY/Y2R/Y5R axis. This activation is triggered by hypoxia-induced up-regulation of Y2R/Y5R expression and stimulation of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), which converts NPY to a selective Y2R/Y5R agonist, NPY(3-36). While previous studies focused mainly on the effects of NPY on tumor growth and vascularization, they also provided insight into the potential role of the peptide in tumor progression into a metastatic and chemoresistant phenotype. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the role of NPY in neuroblastoma and Ewing sarcoma and its interactions with the tumor microenvironment in the context of findings in other malignancies, as well as discusses future directions and potential clinical implications of these discoveries.", "journal": "Neuropeptides", "date": "2015-11-10", "authors": ["JasonTilan", "JoannaKitlinska"], "doi": "10.1016/j.npep.2015.10.005"}

Adipose tissue dysfunction occurs in the above categories of patients. Adipose tissue plays a fundamental role in the modulation and selection of nutrients reaching the myocardium, and adipocytes secrete adipokines and other molecules affecting myocardial metabolism and regulating vascular function. In turn, the myocardium secretes a series of peptides affecting adipose tissue metabolism, and adipose tissue vascularization and perfusion contribute to the maintenance of adipose tissue health. This review addresses the reciprocal interaction linking adipose tissue to myocardial metabolism and vascular function. We summarize evidence of factors released by adipose tissue that affect cardiac metabolism and vice versa. Then, we address the role of adipose tissue in regulating vascular health, and examine whether adipose tissue hypoperfusion is causative or defensive of adipose tissue dysfunction.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical design", "date": "2015-11-10", "authors": ["PatriciaIozzo", "Maria AngelaGuzzardi"], "doi": "10.2174/1381612822666151109111834"}
{"title": "In vitro maturation of large-scale cardiac patches based on a perfusable starter matrix by cyclic mechanical stimulation.", "abstract": "The ultimate goal of tissue engineering is the generation of implants similar to native tissue. Thus, it is essential to utilize physiological stimuli to improve the quality of engineered constructs. Numerous publications reported that mechanical stimulation of small-sized, non-perfusable, tissue engineered cardiac constructs leads to a maturation of immature cardiomyocytes like neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or induced pluripotent stem cells/embryonic stem cells derived self-contracting cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of mechanical stimulation and perfusion on the maturation process of large-scale (2.5\u00d74.5cm), implantable cardiac patches based on decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) or Biological Vascularized Matrix (BioVaM) and a 3-dimensional construct containing neonatal rat heart cells. Application of cyclic mechanical stretch improved contractile function, cardiomyocyte alignment along the stretch axis and gene expression of cardiomyocyte markers. The development of a complex network formed by endothelial cells within the cardiac construct was enhanced by cyclic stretch. Finally, the utilization of BioVaM enabled the perfusion of the matrix during stimulation, augmenting the beneficial influence of cyclic stretch. Thus, this study demonstrates the maturation of cardiac constructs with clinically relevant dimensions by the application of cyclic mechanical stretch and perfusion of the starter matrix.\nConsidering the poor endogenous regeneration of the heart, engineering of bioartificial cardiac tissue for the replacement of infarcted myocardium is an exciting strategy. Most techniques for the generation of cardiac tissue result in relative small-sized constructs insufficient for clinical applications. Another issue is to achieve cardiomyocytes and tissue maturation in culture. Here we report, for the first time, the effect of mechanical stimulation and simultaneous perfusion on the maturation of cardiac constructs of clinical relevant dimensions, which are based on a perfusable starter matrix derived from porcine small intestine. In response to these stimuli superior organization of cardiomyocytes and vascular networks was observed in contrast to untreated controls.

{"title": "Relationships of peripheral IGF-1, VEGF and BDNF levels to exercise-related changes in memory, hippocampal perfusion and volumes in older adults.", "abstract": "Animal models point towards a key role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in mediating exercise-induced structural and functional changes in the hippocampus. Recently, also platelet derived growth factor-C (PDGF-C) has been shown to promote blood vessel growth and neuronal survival. Moreover, reductions of these neurotrophic and angiogenic factors in old age have been related to hippocampal atrophy, decreased vascularization and cognitive decline. In a 3-month aerobic exercise study, forty healthy older humans (60 to 77years) were pseudo-randomly assigned to either an aerobic exercise group (indoor treadmill, n=21) or to a control group (indoor progressive-muscle relaxation/stretching, n=19). As reported recently, we found evidence for fitness-related perfusion changes of the aged human hippocampus that were closely linked to changes in episodic memory function. Here, we test whether peripheral levels of BDNF, IGF-I, VEGF or PDGF-C are related to changes in hippocampal blood flow, volume and memory performance. Growth factor levels were not significantly affected by exercise, and their changes were not related to changes in fitness or perfusion. However, changes in IGF-I levels were positively correlated with hippocampal volume changes (derived by manual volumetry and voxel-based morphometry) and late verbal recall performance, a relationship that seemed to be independent of fitness, perfusion or their changes over time. These preliminary findings link IGF-I levels to hippocampal volume changes and putatively hippocampus-dependent memory changes that seem to occur over time independently of exercise. We discuss methodological shortcomings of our study and potential differences in the temporal dynamics of how IGF-1, VEGF and BDNF may be affected by exercise and to what extent these differences may have led to the negative findings reported here.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2015-11-08", "authors": ["AnneMaass", "SandraD\u00fczel", "TanjaBrigadski", "MoniqueGoerke", "AndreasBecke", "UweSobieray", "KatjaNeumann", "MartinL\u00f6vd\u00e9n", "UlmanLindenberger", "LarsB\u00e4ckman", "R\u00fcdigerBraun-Dullaeus", "D\u00f6rteAhrens", "Hans-JochenHeinze", "Notger GM\u00fcller", "VolkmarLessmann", "MichaelSendtner", "EmrahD\u00fczel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.10.084"}

{"title": "Porous, Dexamethasone-loaded polyurethane coatings extend performance window of implantable glucose sensors in vivo.", "abstract": "Continuous glucose sensors offer the promise of tight glycemic control for insulin dependent diabetics; however, utilization of such systems has been hindered by issues of tissue compatibility. Here we report on the in vivo performance of implanted glucose sensors coated with Dexamethasone-loaded (Dex-loaded) porous coatings employed to mediate the tissue-sensor interface. Two animal studies were conducted to (1) characterize the tissue modifying effects of the porous Dex-loaded coatings deployed on sensor surrogate implants and (2) investigate the effects of the same coatings on the in vivo performance of Medtronic MiniMed SOF-SENSOR\u2122 glucose sensors. The tissue response to implants was evaluated by quantifying macrophage infiltration, blood vessel formation, and collagen density around implants. Sensor function was assessed by measuring changes in sensor sensitivity and time lag, calculating the Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) for each sensor treatment, and performing functional glucose challenge test at relevant time points. Implants treated with porous Dex-loaded coatings diminished inflammation and enhanced vascularization of the tissue surrounding the implants. Functional sensors with Dex-loaded porous coatings showed enhanced sensor sensitivity over a 21-day period when compared to controls. Enhanced sensor sensitivity was accompanied with an increase in sensor signal lag and MARD score. These results indicate that Dex-loaded porous coatings were able to elicit an attenuated tissue response, and that such tissue microenvironment could be conducive towards extending the performance window of glucose sensors in vivo.\nIn the present article, a coating to extend the functionality of implantable glucose sensors in vivo was developed. Our study showed that the delivery of an anti-inflammatory agent with the presentation of micro-sized topographical cues from coatings may lead to improved long-term glucose sensor function in vivo. We believe that improved function of sensors treated with the novel coatings was a result of the observed decreases in inflammatory cell density and increases in vessel density of the tissue adjacent to the devices. Furthermore, extending the in vivo functionality of implantable glucose sensors may lead to greater adoption of these devices by diabetic patients.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-11-06", "authors": ["Suzana GVallejo-Heligon", "Nga LBrown", "William MReichert", "BruceKlitzman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.10.045"}

The pseudoislets formed in culture displayed an unusual cell arrangement, contrasting with the transplanted pseudoislets, which exhibited a cell arrangement similar to that observed in native pancreatic islet subunits. The pattern of revascularization and the distribution of extracellular matrix around transplanted pseudoislets were alike to those observed in native pancreatic islets. This organization of transplanted pseudoislets occurred also when revascularization was abolished by treating mice with an anti-VEGF antibody, but not when contact with extracellular matrix was prevented by encapsulation of pseudoislets within alginate hydrogel.

The pro-angiogenic effects of hMSCs, as well as their strong tumor tropism, have been shown both in vitro and in vivo. Some studies suggest using hMSCs as potential drug-carriers for tumor therapy. In previous investigations by our group, the pro-tumorigenic effects of hMSCs on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were shown. However, the influence of hMSCs on tumor vascularization as well as the possibility of its inhibition are yet to be elucidated. The cytokine patterns of the HNSCC cell line FaDu, native hMSCs (hMSCs-nat), hMSCs differentiated into adipocytes (hMSCs-adip) and osteocytes (hMSCs-ost) were evaluated. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were co-cultured with FaDu cells, hMSCs-nat, hMSCs-adip and hMSCs-ost. The capillary tube formation assay was applied. Furthermore, the migration capability of hMSCs-nat, hMSCs-adip and hMSCs-ost towards FaDu cells was measured in a Transwell system. Spheroids were cultured from hMSCs-nat, FaDu cells and DiI-labeled HUVECs. FaDu cells, hMSCs-nat, hMSCs-adip and hMSCs-ost released a wide range of cytokines and growth factors, e.g., IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GRO and MCP. In the capillary tube formation assay, HUVECs generated significantly longer tubes after co-cultivation with hMSCs-nat as compared to HUVECs alone and FaDu. Differentiation into adipocytes and osteocytes counteracted the tube formation. The adipogenic differentiation did not alter hMSC motility, whereas osteogenic differentiation significantly inhibited hMSC migration. Generation of multi-cellular spheroids from hMSCs-nat, FaDu cells and DiI-labeled HUVECs was possible. Florescence microscopy revealed that all HUVECs were present in the spheroid core. Taken together, hMSCs-nat have a pro-angiogenic effect. The effects are counteracted by the differentiation of hMSCs towards osteogenic and adipogenic lineages.

Among these, 22 recipient rats were randomly assigned to the HBOT (n = 11) and control (n = 11) groups. Rats in the HBOT group were treated with 100% oxygen for 60 minutes at 2.5 atmospheres of absolute pressure for 7 days. Recipient rats in both groups were euthanized at 1 week (n = 5) and 4 weeks (n = 6) after transplantation, defined as the early and late periods, respectively.\nIn the early period, no significant histopathologic differences were observed between groups (p > 0.05). However, microscopic evaluation of the control group during the late period showed low epithelization of the CTA. In contrast, microscopic evaluation of the HBOT group during this same period revealed epithelium covering the transplanted CTA lumen. Significant epithelization and vascularization and significantly reduced inflammation and fibrosis were found in the HBOT group compared with the control group (p < 0.05).\nHBOT may be effective in tracheal reconstruction by increasing epithelization and neovascularization after extended tracheal resection. HBOT, therefore, should be considered in CTA transplantation.", "journal": "The Annals of thoracic surgery", "date": "2015-11-01", "authors": ["FatihCandas", "RaufGorur", "AptullahHaholu", "AkinYildizhan", "OrhanYucel", "HakanAy", "AliMemis", "TurgutIsitmangil"], "doi": "10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.09.018"}

Furthermore, the 40kDa [(3)H]PEG-moiety was given separately to rats by single i.v. bolus doses, to investigate if the pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent. For both compounds, plasma pharmacokinetics, distribution and excretion pathways were investigated, based on total radioactivity measurements ([(3)H]N8-GP: 0.17-4.1mg/kg;~1300-30,000U/kg, PEG load of ~0.03-0.7mg/kg); ([(3)H]PEG: 0.6, 1, 12, 100 and 200mg/kg). The plasma concentration of the intact N8-GP conjugate was also measured by ELISA. After single i.v. administration to rats, both [(3)H]N8-GP and [(3)H]PEG were shown to be widely distributed, mainly in highly vascularized tissues, with the lowest levels of radioactivity found in the CNS. Though a slow elimination of radioactivity was observed over the 12-week study period, approximately half of the radioactive dose of either compound was removed from the body 1week post-dose. The radioactivity was eliminated mainly via the kidney into urine but also via the liver into feces, with a larger fraction found in the feces for [(3)H]N8-GP. Elimination of the 40kDa PEG-moiety was shown to be dose-dependent with faster elimination at lower dose levels. The clinical dose of N8-GP provides a substantially lower PEG exposure (50-75U/kg; PEG load of <0.002mg/kg) when compared to the PEG doses investigated in this paper (0.03-200mg/kg). This may imply an even faster clearance of the PEG-moiety after N8-GP administration of clinically relevant doses.", "journal": "European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences", "date": "2015-11-01", "authors": ["IngaBj\u00f8rnsdottir", "OlaSternebring", "Wendela AKappers", "HelleSelvig", "Hanne TKorn\u00f8", "Jesper BKristensen", "Morten ABagger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejps.2015.10.020"}

Here, we generated organoids using murine embryonic kidney cells, and documented that these tissues recapitulated the complex three-dimensional filtering structure of glomerular slits in vivo and accomplished selective glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. Exploiting this technology, we mixed human amniotic fluid stem cells with mouse embryonic kidney cells to establish three-dimensional chimeric organoids that engrafted in vivo and grew to form vascularized glomeruli and tubular structures. Human cells contributed to the formation of glomerular structures, differentiated into podocytes with slit diaphragms, and internalized exogenously infused BSA, thus attaining in vivo degrees of specialization and function unprecedented for donor stem cells.

The patient was asymptomatic and was managed conservatively.\nOur case showed that PCV developing in association with a stable choroidal nevus. Pathogenic mechanisms of this condition may include chronic degenerative or inflammatory changes at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium resulting in vascular changes.

Disruption of normal CSF circulation and turnover is believed to contribute to the development of many diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, ischemic and traumatic brain injury, and neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Recent insights into CSF biology suggesting that CSF and interstitial fluid exchange along a brain-wide network of perivascular spaces termed the 'glymphatic' system suggest that CSF circulation may interact intimately with glial and vascular function to regulate basic aspects of brain function. Dysfunction within this glial vascular network, which is a feature of the aging and injured brain, is a potentially critical link between brain injury, neuroinflammation and the development of chronic neurodegeneration. Ongoing research within this field may provide a powerful new framework for understanding the common links between neurodegenerative, neurovascular and neuroinflammatory disease, in addition to providing potentially novel therapeutic targets for these conditions.

{"title": "Controlled release of fibrin matrix-conjugated platelet derived growth factor improves ischemic tissue regeneration by functional angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Sustained, local, low dose growth factor stimulus of target tissues/cells is believed to be of imminent importance in tissue regeneration and engineering. Recently, a technology was developed to bind growth factors to a fibrin matrix using the transglutaminase (TG) activity of factor XIIIa, thus allowing prolonged release through enzymatic cleavage. In this study we aimed to determine whether TG-PDGF.AB in fibrin could improve tissue regeneration in a standard ischemic flap model. In vitro determination of binding and release kinetics of TG-PDGF.AB allowed proof of concept of the developed binding technology. A single spray application of TG-PDGF.AB in fibrin matrix at a concentration of 10 and 100ng/ml significantly reduced ischemia-induced flap tissue necrosis in vivo on day 7 after ischemic impact compared to controls. TG-PDGF.AB at a concentration of 100ng/ml fibrin induced distinct angiogenesis as reflected by significantly improved tissue perfusion assessed by laser Doppler imaging as well as enhanced von Willebrand factor (vWF) protein expression determined by immunohistochemical means. In addition, significantly more mature microvessels were observed with 100ng/ml TG-PDGF.AB in fibrin compared to control and vehicle groups as evidenced by an improved smooth muscle actin (sma)/vWF protein ratio. In conclusion, PDGF.AB in a conjugated fibrin matrix effectively reduced ischemia-induced tissue necrosis, increased tissue perfusion and induced the growth of a mature and functional neovasculature. The sealing properties of the fibrin matrix in conjunction with the prolonged growth factor stimulus enabled by the TG-hook binding technology may present an innovative and suitable tool in tissue regeneration.\nIn our experimental study we elucidated recombinant platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) as a potential candidate in inducing angiogenesis. To avoid preterm growth factor degradation in vivo PDGF.AB was covalently linked to a fibrin scaffold using a bi-domain functionalized peptide (FXIII substrate site and plasmin cleavage site). This allowed PDGF binding to fibrin during spray application to the donor site and subsequent prolonged release via endogenous plasmin. This resulted in a mature vascular network thus enhancing tissue perfusion and consequently improved clinical outcome. With our present work we could certainly provide researchers and clinicians with an innovative versatile and reproducible technology not only to induce functional vascularity but also to improve attempts in tissue engineering in general by e.g. using different growth factors. Hence, we believe that this approach studied in the present work may provide a valuable input in an effort to drive the aim forward bringing experimental work in tissue engineering to clinic by using a clinically well characterized and used fibrin scaffold in combination with a human recombinant growth factor (fibrin scaffold linked with the specific binding technology).", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2015-10-27", "authors": ["RainerMittermayr", "PaulSlezak", "NicolasHaffner", "DanielSmolen", "JoachimHartinger", "AnnaHofmann", "JasonSchense", "DanielSpazierer", "J\u00f6rgGampfer", "AndreasGoppelt", "HeinzRedl"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2015.10.028"}

It is debated whether this potentiation is related to a better drug delivery to the tumor due to the antiangiogenic effects on tumor vessel phenotype and functionality. We addressed this question by combining bevacizumab with paclitaxel on A2780-1A9 ovarian carcinoma and HT-29 colon carcinoma transplanted ectopically in the subcutis of nude mice and on A2780-1A9 and IGROV1 ovarian carcinoma transplanted orthotopically in the bursa of the mouse ovary. Paclitaxel concentrations together with its distribution by MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) were measured to determine the drug in different areas of the tumor, which was immunostained to depict vessel morphology and tumor proliferation. Bevacizumab modified the vessel bed, assessed by CD31 staining and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and potentiated the antitumor activity of paclitaxel in all the models. Although tumor paclitaxel concentrations were lower after bevacizumab, the drug distributed more homogeneously, particularly in vascularized, non-necrotic areas, and was cleared more slowly than controls. This happened specifically in tumor tissue, as there was no change in paclitaxel pharmacokinetics or drug distribution in normal tissues. In addition, the drug concentration and distribution were not influenced by the site of tumor growth, as A2780-1A9 and IGROV1 growing in the ovary gave results similar to the tumor growing subcutaneously.

Data abstraction was based on the clinical course as reported in the articles. For further analysis, patients were divided into groups according to their diagnosis (MMD or non-MMD). Descriptive statistics were computed for better integration of the results.\nThe final literature review contained 15 articles (11 case series, 4 single case studies) with data on 93 patients (29 non-MMD, 64 MMD).

Differences in improvement became apparent with regard to the initial symptomatology wherein transient ischemic attacks were related to superior recovery rates and language pathologies showed least improvement.\nSurgical revascularization using omental tissue has shown good success rates, particularly for recurrent transient ischemic attacks and prevention of further strokes and should be considered as treatment option for selected patients.

{"title": "Modeling nanoparticle delivery of TB drugs to granulomas.", "abstract": "Tuberculosis, which typically presents as a pulmonary disease, has a complex pathology. The primary site of infection, the Ghon focus, recruits immune cells and a granuloma forms. At earlier stages the granuloma is still vascularized, offering the best opportunity for drug treatment. In the more progressive state blood flow is reduced and a distinct caseous structure develops. Effective delivery of drugs to bacilli in the core of the granuloma becomes very difficult. It is perceivable that granuloma cores could create conditions where bacilli persist and develop resistance. In this study we analyze drug delivery to granulomas by means of a nanoparticle delivery system. The model consists of two parts; the overall distribution of the nanoparticles is described by a simple circulatory model and this result is used in the second part, focusing on transport in a capillary lined with macrophages. Nanoparticles enter the macrophages where they are metabolized and the drugs are released. The model reveals significant differences in drug concentrations between the plasma and macrophages.

Tissue engineered blood vessels (TEBVs) have great potential to improve the outcome of vascular grafting procedures. Here, we present a novel approach to generate autologous TEBV in vivo. Polymer rods were engineered and implanted, evoking an inflammatory response that culminates in encapsulation by a fibrocellular capsule. We hypothesized that, after extrusion of the rod, the fibrocellular capsule differentiates into an adequate vascular conduit once grafted into the vasculature.\nRods were implanted subcutaneously in pigs. After 4 weeks, rods with tissue capsules grown around it were harvested. Tissue capsules were grafted bilaterally as carotid artery interposition. One and 4-week patency were evaluated by angiography whereupon pigs were sacrificed. Tissue capsules before and after grafting were evaluated on tissue remodeling using immunohistochemistry, RNA profiling and mechanical testing. Rods were encapsulated by thick, well-vascularized tissue capsules, composed of circumferentially aligned fibroblasts, collagen and few leukocytes, with adequate mechanical strength. Patency was 100% after 1 week and 87.5% after 4 weeks. After grafting, tissue capsules remodeled towards a vascular phenotype. Gene profiles of TEBVs gained more similarity with carotid artery. Wall thickness and \u03b1SMA-positive area significantly increased. Interestingly, a substantial portion of (myo)fibroblasts present before grafting expressed smooth muscle cell markers. While leukocytes were hardly present anymore, the lumen was largely covered with endothelial cells.

{"title": "Regulation and localization of vascular endothelial growth factor within the mammary glands during the transition from late gestation to lactation.", "abstract": "The vascular network within the developing mammary gland (MG) grows in concert with the epithelium to prepare for lactation, although the mechanisms coordinating this vascular development are unresolved. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) mediates angiogenesis and vascular permeability in the MG during pregnancy and lactation, where its expression is upregulated by prolactin. Given our previous finding that late-gestational hyperprolactinemia induced by domperidone (DOM) increased subsequent milk yield from gilts, we sought to establish changes in vascular development during late gestation and lactation in the MGs of these pigs and determine whether DOM altered MG angiogenesis and the factors regulating it. Gilts received either no treatment (n = 6) or DOM (n = 6) during late gestation, then had their MG biopsied from late gestation through lactation to assess microvessel density, VEGF-A distribution and messenger RNA expression, and aquaporin (AQP) gene expression. Microvessel density in the MG was unchanged during gestation then increased between days 2 and 21 of lactation (P < 0.05). The local expression of messenger RNA for VEGF-A120, VEGF-A147, VEGF-A164, VEGF-A164b, VEGF-A188, VEGF receptors-1 and -2, and AQP1 and AQP3 all generally increased during the transition from gestation to lactation (P < 0.05). Immunostaining localized VEGF-A to the apical cytoplasm of secretory epithelial cells, consistent with a far greater concentration of VEGF-A in colostrum and/or milk vs plasma (P < 0.0001). There was no effect of DOM on any of the variables analyzed. In summary, we found that vascular development in the MG increases during lactation in first-parity gilts and that VEGF-A is a part of the mammary secretome.

A total of 52 HCC lesions were treated and assessed by C-arm CT before and after intervention. C-arm CT consisted of nonenhanced and contrast-enhanced acquisitions; from these, PBV maps were reconstructed. Lesion diameter, maximum PBV, and unenhanced parenchyma density were assessed before and after treatment. Diameter of visible contrast media deposits as well as residual vascularization was assessed after delivery of DEB. All patients underwent follow-up using cross-sectional imaging. All assessed lesions were evaluated concerning modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors for HCC.\nAll treated lesions showed significant decrease in PBV after DEB-TACE (mean difference, -15.61 mL/100 mL, P < 0.0001). Eleven lesions showed residual tumoral perfusion in PBV maps associated with an unfavorable outcome compared with completely treated lesions in terms of a lower tumor shrinkage over time (-0.02 \u00b1 0.49 vs -0.76 \u00b1 0.38; P < 0.0001).

Little is known about the effects of DHA on established solid tumors. Here we describe a low-density lipoprotein-based nanoparticle that acts as a transporter for unesterified DHA (LDL-DHA) and demonstrates selective\u00a0cytotoxicity toward HCC cells. We investigated the ability of LDL-DHA to reduce growth of orthotopic hepatomas in rats.\nAxC-Irish (ACI) rats were given intrahepatic injections of rat hepatoma cells (H4IIE); 24 tumor-bearing rats (mean tumor diameter, \u223c1 cm) were subject to a single hepatic artery injection of LDL nanoparticles (2 mg/kg) loaded with DHA (LDL-DHA), triolein (LDL-TO), or sham surgery controls. Tumor growth was measured by magnetic resonance imaging and other methods; tumor, liver, and serum samples were collected and assessed by histochemical, immunofluorescence, biochemical, and immunoblot analyses.\nThree days after administration of LDL-TO or sham surgery, the control rats had large, highly vascularized tumors that contained proliferating cells. However, rats given LDL-DHA had smaller, pale tumors that were devoid of vascular supply and >80% of the tumor tissue was necrotic. Four to 6 days after injection of LDL-DHA, the tumors were 3-fold smaller than those of control rats. The liver tissue that surrounded the tumors showed no histologic or biochemical evidence of injury. Injection of LDL-DHA into the hepatic artery of rats selectively deregulated redox reactions in tumor tissues by increasing levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, depleting and oxidizing glutathione and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and significantly\u00a0down-regulating the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase-4.

{"title": "Hypoxia Inhibits De Novo Vascular Assembly of Adipose-Derived Stromal/Stem Cell Populations, but Promotes Growth of Preformed Vessels.", "abstract": "Vascularization is critical for cell survival within tissue-engineered grafts. Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) are widely used in tissue engineering applications as they are a clinically relevant source of stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells. ASCs have previously been shown to self-assemble into pericyte-stabilized vascular networks in normoxic (20% O2) cultures. This capacity for de novo vascular assembly may accelerate graft vascularization in vivo rather than relying solely on angiogenic ingrowth. However, oxygen depletion within large cell-seeded grafts will be rapid, and it is unclear how this worsening hypoxic environment will impact the vascular assembly of the transplanted cells. The objectives of this study were to determine whether ASC-derived vessels could grow in hypoxia and to assess whether the vessel maturity (i.e., individual cells vs. preformed vessels) influenced this hypoxic response. Utilizing an in vitro vascularization model, ASCs were encapsulated within fibrin gels and cultured in vitro for up to 6 days in either normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (0.2% or 2% O2). In a subsequent experiment, vessels were allowed to preform in normoxia for 6 days before an additional 6 days of either normoxia or hypoxia. Viability, vessel growth, pericyte coverage, proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenic factor expression were assessed for each experimental approach. Vessel growth was dramatically inhibited in both moderate and severe hypoxia (47% and 11% total vessel length vs. normoxia, respectively), despite maintaining high cell viability and upregulating endogenous expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in hypoxia. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling indicated significantly reduced proliferation of endothelial cells in hypoxia. In contrast, when vascular networks were allowed to preform for 6 days in normoxia, vessels not only survived but also continued to grow more in hypoxia than those maintained in normoxia. These findings demonstrate that vascular assembly and growth are tightly regulated by oxygen tension and may be differentially affected by hypoxic conditions based on the maturity of the vessels.

In this study, modular protein microbeads were prepared from pure fibrin (FIB) and collagen-fibrin composites (COL-FIB) using a simple water-in-oil emulsification technique. Human endothelial cells and fibroblasts were embedded directly in the microbead matrix. The resulting microbeads were generally spheroidal with a diameter of 100-200\u03bcm. Cell viability was high (75-80% viable) in microbeads, but was marginally lower than in bulk hydrogels of corresponding composition (85-90% viable). Cell proliferation was significantly greater in COL-FIB microbeads after two weeks in culture, compared to pure FIB microbeads. Upon embedding of microbeads in a surrounding fibrin hydrogel, endothelial cell networks formed inside the microbead matrix and extended into the surrounding matrix. The number of vessel segments, average segment length, and number of branch points was higher in FIB samples, compared to COL-FIB samples, resulting in significantly longer total vessel networks. Anastomosis of vessel networks from adjacent microbeads was also observed. These studies demonstrate that primitive vessel networks can be formed by modular protein microbeads containing embedded endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Such microbeads may find utility as prevascularized tissue modules that can be delivered minimally invasively as a therapy to restore blood flow to ischemic tissues.\nVascularization is critically important for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and materials that support and/or promote neovascularization are of value both for translational applications and for mechanistic studies and discovery-based research. Therefore, we fabricated small modular microbeads formulated from pure fibrin (FIB) and collagen-fibrin (COL-FIB) containing endothelial cells and supportive fibroblasts. We explored how cells encapsulated within these materials form microvessel-like networks both within and outside of the microbeads when embedded in larger 3D matrices.

Key search terms used were female, urethra, urethral reconstruction, urethroplasty, pathology, stricture, vaginal flap, bladder flap, graft, dilation, pubovaginal sling, catheterization, imaging, tissue engineering and bioscaffold. We created a synopsis of relevant articles, including original research studies and reviews.\nUrethral tissue loss and strictures are caused by traumatic injuries, iatrogenic injuries and, rarely, infections and malignancies. A comprehensive patient history and physical examination are critical for diagnosis. Flexible cystoscopy, voiding cystourethrography and endovaginal magnetic resonance imaging can help to determine the surgical method of repair. Minimally invasive approaches to female urethral reconstruction are associated with poor outcomes. Definitive treatment options for repair of female urethral stricture include vaginal flap/wall urethroplasty, graft urethroplasty and distal urethrectomy with advancement meatoplasty. Repair techniques for urethral loss include primary closure, vaginal flap/wall urethroplasty and bladder flap urethroplasty. Vaginal flap approaches with well vascularized grafts and buccal mucosal grafts have high success rates. Tissue engineered grafts are being investigated as a novel treatment modality.\nFemale urethral reconstruction is complex, and one must carefully evaluate patients afflicted with urethral disorders. Urethral stricture and urethral loss have different etiologies. Variations of a standard approach might best address the condition of an individual patient.

MSCs isolated from rat femurs displayed expression of the bone-specific marker osteocalcin when cultured with P(VEGF), P(BMP-6), or P(VEGF+BMP-6) but not with P. Robust mineralization and increased alkaline phosphatase gene expression were seen in rat MSCs when cultured on P(VEGF+BMP-6) but not on P, P(VEGF), or P(BMP-6). Thus, unlike the delivery of VEGF or BMP-6 alone, the combined delivery of VEGF and BMP-6 to the bone defect significantly enhanced bone repair through the enhancement of angiogenesis and the differentiation of endogenously recruited MSCs into the bone repair site.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2015-10-18", "authors": ["AnusuyaDas", "Brian AFishero", "J JaredChristophel", "Ching-JuLi", "NikitaKohli", "YongLin", "Abhijit SDighe", "QuanjunCui"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-015-2301-x"}
{"title": "Extensive traumatic anterior skull base fractures with cerebrospinal fluid leak: classification and repair techniques using combined vascularized tissue flaps.", "abstract": "This article introduces a classification scheme for extensive traumatic anterior skull base fracture to help stratify surgical treatment options. The authors describe their multilayer repair technique for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak resulting from extensive anterior skull base fracture using a combination of laterally pediculated temporalis fascial-pericranial, nasoseptal-pericranial, and anterior pericranial flaps.\nRetrospective chart review identified patients treated surgically between January 2004 and May 2014 for anterior skull base fractures with CSF fistulas. All patients were treated with bifrontal craniotomy and received pedicled tissue flaps. Cases were classified according to the extent of fracture: Class I (frontal bone/sinus involvement only); Class II (extent of involvement to ethmoid cribriform plate); and Class III (extent of involvement to sphenoid bone/sinus). Surgical repair techniques were tailored to the types of fractures. Patients were assessed for CSF leak at follow-up. The Fisher exact test was applied to investigate whether the repair techniques were associated with persistent postoperative CSF leak.\nForty-three patients were identified in this series. Thirty-seven (86%) were male. The patients' mean age was 33 years (range 11-79 years). The mean overall length of follow-up was 14 months (range 5-45 months). Six fractures were classified as Class I, 8 as Class II, and 29 as Class III. The anterior pericranial flap alone was used in 33 patients (77%). Multiple flaps were used in 10 patients (3 salvage) (28%)--1 with Class II and 9 with Class III fractures. Five (17%) of the 30 patients with Class II or III fractures who received only a single anterior pericranial flap had persistent CSF leak (p < 0.31). No CSF leak was found in patients who received multiple flaps. Although postoperative CSF leak occurred only in high-grade fractures with single anterior flap repair, this finding was not significant.\nExtensive anterior skull base fractures often require aggressive treatment to provide the greatest long-term functional and cosmetic benefits. Several vascularized tissue flaps can be used, either alone or in combination. Vascularized flaps are an ideal substrate for cranial base repair. Dual and triple flap techniques that combine the use of various anterior, lateral, and nasoseptal flaps allow for a comprehensive arsenal in multilayered skull base repair and salvage therapy for extensive and severe fractures.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "date": "2015-10-17", "authors": ["Jacob BArcher", "HaiSun", "Phillip ABonney", "Yan DanielZhao", "Jared CHiebert", "Jose ASanclement", "Andrew SLittle", "Michael ESughrue", "NicholasTheodore", "JeffreyJames", "SamSafavi-Abbasi"], "doi": "10.3171/2015.4.JNS1528"}

While the field has witnessed tremendous advancements over the past few decades, it still faces many challenges. For example, it has been difficult to visualize, monitor, and assess the functions of the engineered tissue/organ constructs, particularly when three-dimensional scaffolds are involved. Conventional approaches based on histology are invasive and therefore only convey end-point assays. The development of volumetric imaging techniques such as confocal and ultrasonic imaging has enabled direct observation of intact constructs without the need of sectioning. However, the capability of these techniques is often limited in terms of penetration depth and contrast. In comparison, the recently developed photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has allowed us to address these issues by integrating optical and ultrasonic imaging to greatly reduce the effect of tissue scattering of photons with one-way ultrasound detection while retaining the high optical absorption contrast. PAM has been successfully applied to a number of studies, such as observation of cell distribution, monitoring of vascularization, and interrogation of biomaterial degradation. In this review article, we highlight recent progress in non-invasive and volumetric characterization of biomaterial-tissue interactions using PAM. We also discuss challenges ahead and envision future directions.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2015-10-17", "authors": ["Yu ShrikeZhang", "Lihong VWang", "YounanXia"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-015-1485-2"}

The supercharged latissimus dorsi (LD)-groin compound flap is an option that can provide a large skin paddle with simultaneous functional muscle transfer. It is necessary to supercharge the flap with the superficial circumflex iliac pedicle to ensure the viability of its groin extension. In this report, we present a case of a supercharged LD-groin flap in combination with vascularized inguinal lymph nodes, which was used for upper limb reconstruction in a young male patient, following excision of high-grade liposarcoma. Resection resulted in a 28 cm \u00d7 15 cm skin defect extending from the upper arm to the proximal forearm, also involving the triceps muscle, a segment of the ulnar nerve and the axillary lymph nodes. Restoration of triceps function was achieved with transfer of the innervated LD muscle. Part of the ulnar nerve was resected and repaired with sural nerve grafts. Post-operatively, the flap survived fully with no partial necrosis, and no complications at both the recipient and donor sites. At 1-year follow up, the patient had a well-healed wound with good elbow extension (against resistance), no tumor recurrence, and no signs of lymphedema. We believe this comprehensive approach may represent a valuable technique, for not only the oncological reconstruction of upper extremity, but also for the prevention of lymphedema. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Using intracranial, NG2-negative B16F10 melanomas, we have investigated the importance of PC and Mac NG2 in brain tumor progression. Reduced melanoma growth in Mac-NG2ko and PC-NG2ko mice demonstrates the importance of NG2 in both stromal compartments. In each genotype, the loss of PC-endothelial cell interaction diminishes the formation of endothelial junctions and assembly of the basal lamina. Tumor vessels in Mac-NG2ko mice have smaller diameters, reduced patency, and increased leakiness compared to PC-NG2ko mice, thus decreasing tumor blood supply and increasing hypoxia. While the reduced PC interaction with endothelial cells in PC-NG2ko mice results from the loss of PC activation of \u03b21 integrin signaling in endothelial cells, reduced PC-endothelial cell interaction in Mac-NG2ko mice results from 90% reduced Mac recruitment. The absence of Mac-derived signals in Mac-NG2ko mice causes the loss of PC association with endothelial cells. Reduced Mac recruitment may be due to diminished activation of integrins in the absence of NG2, causing decreased Mac interaction with endothelial adhesion molecules that are needed for extravasation.

The computational domains will be used in one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D)-1D coupled hemodynamic models. A 1D hemodynamic model employs a 1D network of a patient-specific vascular network with large number of vessels. The 1D network is the graph with nodes in the 3D space which bears additional geometric data such as length and radius of vessels. A 3D hemodynamic model requires a detailed 3D reconstruction of local parts of the vascular network. We propose algorithms which extend the automated segmentation of vascular and tubular structures, generation of centerlines, 1D network reconstruction, correction, and local adaptation. We consider two modes of centerline representation: (i) skeletal segments or sets of connected voxels and (ii) curved paths with corresponding radii. Individualized reconstruction of 1D networks depends on the mode of centerline representation. Efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on several examples of 1D network reconstruction. The networks can be used in modeling of blood flows as well as other physiological processes in tubular structures.

In this report, we present results of the use of vascularized iliac bone free flap for treating subtalar failed fusions in two patients. Two patients sustained calcaneal fractures due to foot trauma, which were initially or subsequently treated with subtalar arthrodesis. Case one developed septic subtalar nonunion during treatment and case two failed three attempts at subtalar arthrodeses. The iliac crest bone flap harvested measured 4 \u00d7 4 cm (case one) and 3 \u00d7 3 cm (case two). The flap was pedicled by the deep circumflex iliac artery, which was anastomosed to the anterior tibial artery at the recipient site. No flap donor or recipient site complications occurred. Fusion was confirmed on CT scan and weight bearing was initiated at 5-6 months. At latest follow up (1-2 years), no complications occurred.

The \"papillon\"-designed ALT flap, described by Hayden et al, offers an alternative method of using the ALT flap in this situation. We report our early experience with the papillon ALT flap in a patient cohort.\nOn retrospective review, all patients who underwent reconstruction of circumferential total pharyngolaryngectomy defects with the papillon ALT flap from February 2012 to February 2015 were identified from our departmental database. Demographic and clinical data, operative details, and complications were analyzed from the records.\nSeven patients were included in this study. The mean length of hospital stay was 15 days (range, 10 to 32 days). Acute complications occurred in 5 of 7 patients, namely, partial flap loss managed by a pectoralis flap (1 of 7 [14%]); an early pharyngocutaneous fistula (4 of 7 [57%]) managed by simple repair, wound packing, or delayed repair; and a donor-site hematoma (1 of 7 [14%]). At follow-up (range, 2 to 24 months), there was 1 stricture formation, but no chronic fistula. All patients were able to swallow orally.\nEarly results using the papillon ALT flap suggest that this technique is a viable alternative to the standard tubed ALT flap design. The advantages of this design include the following: 1) it offers simultaneous vascularized skin to resurface anterior neck skin deficiency without resorting to additional tissue elsewhere; 2) direct monitoring of the ALT flap is possible; and 3) any pharyngocutaneous fistula is exteriorized to the surface without compromising the internal neck structures and can be easily identified and repaired directly in the office.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2015-10-11", "authors": ["NaseemGhazali", "Todd CHanna", "DonitaDyalram", "Joshua ELubek"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2015.09.010"}

{"title": "Effect of ocular shape and vascular geometry on retinal hemodynamics: a computational model.", "abstract": "A computational model for retinal hemodynamics accounting for ocular curvature is presented. The model combines (i) a hierarchical Darcy model for the flow through small arterioles, capillaries and small venules in the retinal tissue, where blood vessels of different size are comprised in different hierarchical levels of a porous medium; and (ii) a one-dimensional network model for the blood flow through retinal arterioles and venules of larger size. The non-planar ocular shape is included by (i) defining the hierarchical Darcy flow model on a two-dimensional curved surface embedded in the three-dimensional space; and (ii) mapping the simplified one-dimensional network model onto the curved surface. The model is solved numerically using a finite element method in which spatial domain and hierarchical levels are discretized separately. For the finite element method, we use an exterior calculus-based implementation which permits an easier treatment of non-planar domains. Numerical solutions are verified against suitably constructed analytical solutions. Numerical experiments are performed to investigate how retinal hemodynamics is influenced by the ocular shape (sphere, oblate spheroid, prolate spheroid and barrel are compared) and vascular architecture (four vascular arcs and a branching vascular tree are compared). The model predictions show that changes in ocular shape induce non-uniform alterations of blood pressure and velocity in the retina. In particular, we found that (i) the temporal region is affected the least by changes in ocular shape, and (ii) the barrel shape departs the most from the hemispherical reference geometry in terms of associated pressure and velocity distributions in the retinal microvasculature. These results support the clinical hypothesis that alterations in ocular shape, such as those occurring in myopic eyes, might be associated with pathological alterations in retinal hemodynamics.", "journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "date": "2015-10-09", "authors": ["AndreaDziubek", "GiovannaGuidoboni", "AlonHarris", "Anil NHirani", "EdmondRusjan", "WilliamThistleton"], "doi": "10.1007/s10237-015-0731-8"}

Once they infiltrate tissues, they may acquire two main functional phenotypes, being known as the classically activated type 1 macrophages (M1) and the alternative activated type 2 macrophages (M2). The M1 phenotype can be induced by bacterial products and interferon-\u03b3 and exerts a cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. Conversely, the alternatively activated M2 phenotype is induced by Il-4/IL13 and promotes tumor cell growth and vascularization. Although receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) engagement in M1 macrophages has been reported by several groups to promote inflammation, nothing is known about the functionality of RAGE in M2 macrophages. In the current study, we demonstrate that RAGE is equally expressed in both macrophage phenotypes and that RAGE activation by high-mobility group protein box1 (HMGB1) promotes protumoral activities of M2 macrophages. MKN45 cells co-cultured with M2 macrophages treated with HMGB1 at different times displayed higher invasive abilities. Additionally, conditioned medium from HMGB1-treated M2 macrophages promotes angiogenesis in vitro. RAGE-targeting knockdown abrogates these activities.

{"title": "Senescent peritoneal mesothelium induces a pro-angiogenic phenotype in ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model in vivo.", "abstract": "It is believed that senescent cells contribute to the progression of primary and metastatic tumors, however, the exact mechanisms of this activity remain elusive. In this report we show that senescent human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) alter the secretory profile of ovarian cancer cells (A2780, OVCAR-3, SKOV-3) by increasing the release of four angiogenic agents: CXCL1, CXCL8, HGF, and VEGF. Proliferation and migration of endothelial cells subjected to conditioned medium generated by: cancer cells modified by senescent HPMCs; cancer cells co-cultured with senescent HPMCs; and by early-passage HPMCs from aged donors, were markedly intensified. The same was the case for the vascularization, size and number of tumors that developed in the mouse peritoneum upon injection of ovarian cancer cells with senescent HPMCs. When the identified pro-angiogenic proteins were neutralized in conditioned medium from the cancer cells, both aspects of endothelial cell behavior intensified in vitro in response to senescent HPMCs were markedly reduced. The search for mediators of senescent HPMC activity using specific neutralizing antibodies and recombinant exogenous proteins showed that the intensified angiogenic potential of cancer cells was elicited by IL-6 and TGF-\u03b21. At the transcriptional level, increased proliferation and migration of endothelial cells exposed to cancer cells modified by senescent HPMCs was regulated by HIF-1\u03b1, NF-\u03baB/p50 and AP-1/c-Jun. Collectively, our findings indicate that senescent HPMCs may promote the progression of ovarian cancer cells by reprogramming their secretory phenotype towards increased production of pro-angiogenic agents and subsequent increase in the angiogenic capabilities of the vascular endothelium.", "journal": "Clinical & experimental metastasis", "date": "2015-10-05", "authors": ["JustynaMiku\u0142a-Pietrasik", "PatrycjaSosi\u0144ska", "ErykNaumowicz", "KonstantinMaksin", "HannaPiotrowska", "AldonaWo\u017aniak", "DariuszSzpurek", "KrzysztofKsi\u0105\u017cek"], "doi": "10.1007/s10585-015-9753-y\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.003\n10.1146/annurev-pathol-121808-102144\n10.1016/j.canlet.2014.09.041\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.051222\n10.1016/S0022-4804(03)00307-X\n10.1089/rej.2008.0736\n10.1007/s10522-014-9505-4\n10.1007/BF02630943\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.03.014\n10.1007/s10456-012-9266-0\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3452\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0895\n10.1074/jbc.M603307200\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1720\n10.1073/pnas.211053698\n10.1016/j.molonc.2014.07.009\n10.1038/ncomms3126\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0682\n10.1172/JCI43304\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.06.026\n10.1016/j.exger.2007.04.012\n10.3389/fonc.2013.00097\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0895\n10.1016/j.biocel.2013.07.004\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0808\n10.4049/jimmunol.171.6.3194\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.06.006"}

{"title": "Decellularized human placenta chorion matrix as a favorable source of small-diameter vascular grafts.", "abstract": "Biomaterials based on decellularized tissues are increasingly attracting attention as functional alternatives to other natural or synthetic materials. However, a source of non-cadaver human allograft material would be favorable. Here we establish a decellularization method of vascular tissue from cryopreserved human placenta chorionic plate starting with an initial freeze-thaw step followed by a series of chemical treatments applied with a custom-made perfusion system. This novel pulsatile perfusion set-up enabled us to successfully decellularize the vascular tissue with lower concentrations of chemicals and shorter exposure times compared to a non-perfusion process. The decellularization procedure described here lead to the preservation of the native extracellular matrix architecture and the removal of cells. Quantitative analysis revealed no significant changes in collagen content and a retained glycosaminoglycan content of approximately 29%. In strain-to-failure tests, the decellularized grafts showed similar mechanical behavior compared to native controls. In addition, the mechanical values for ultimate tensile strength and stiffness were in an acceptable range for in vivo applications. Furthermore, biocompatibility of the decellularized tissue and its recellularizationability to serve as an adequate substratum for upcoming recellularization strategies using primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was demonstrated. HUVECs cultured on the decellularized placenta vessel matrix performed endothelialization and maintained phenotypical characteristics and cell specific expression patterns. Overall, the decellularized human placenta vessels can be a versatile tool for experimental studies on vascularization and as potent graft material for future in vivo applications.\nIn the US alone more than 1million vascular grafts are needed in clinical practice every year. Despite severe disadvantages, such as donor site morbidity, autologous grafting from the patient's own arteries or veins is regarded as the gold standard for vascular tissue repair. Besides, strategies based on synthetic or natural materials have shown limited success. Tissue engineering approaches based on decellularized tissues are regarded as a promising alternative to clinically used treatments to overcome the observed limitations. However, a source for supply of non-cadaver human allograft material would be favorable. Here, we established a decellularization method of vascular tissue from the human placenta chorionic plate, a suitable human tissue source of consistent quality.

Two kinds of vaccines were separately tested in two independent experiments of CIA. In the first, we tested a kinoid of the murine cytokine VEGF (VEGF-K), obtained by conjugating VEGF-A to KLH. For the second, we selected two VEGF-A-derived peptide sequences to produce heterocomplexes (Vpep1-K and Vpep2-K). DBA/1 mice were immunized with either VEGF-K, Vpep1-K, or Vpep2-K, before CIA induction. Clinical and histological scores of arthritis, anti-VEGF, anti-Vpep Ab titers, and anti-VEGF Abs neutralizing capacity were determined.\nBoth VEGF-K and Vpep1-K significantly ameliorated clinical arthritis scores and reduced synovial inflammation and joint destruction at histology. VEGF-K significantly reduced synovial vascularization. None of the vaccines reduced anti-collagen Ab response in mice. Both VEGF-K and Vpep1-K induced persistently high titers of anti-VEGF Abs capable of inhibiting VEGF-A bioactivity.\nVaccination against the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF-A leads to the production of anti-VEGF polyclonal Abs and has a significant anti-inflammatory effect in CIA.

The significant clinical morbidity associated with flap failure represents an important barrier to even more widespread use of these techniques. Early identification of vascular compromise has been associated with a higher salvage rate, yet most surgeons rely only on clinical assessment intraoperatively. Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) presents a noncontact, objective measurement of tissue oxygenation over a large field of view. This study aims to evaluate the use of SFDI technology in hemifacial composite flap compromise as could occur during facial transplant.\nSix composite hemifacial flaps were created in three 35-kg Yorkshire pigs and continuously imaged using SFDI before, during, and after 15-minute selective vascular pedicle occlusion. Arterial and venous clamping trials were performed for each flap. Changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration, deoxyhemoglobin concentration, and total hemoglobin were quantified over time.\nThe SFDI successfully measured changes in oxygenation parameters in all 6 composite tissue flaps. Significant changes in oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and total hemoglobin were seen relative to controls. Early and distinct patterns of alteration were noted in arterial and in venous compromise relative to one another.\nThe need for noninvasive, reliable assessment of composite tissue graft viability is apparent, given the morbidity associated with flap failure.

Reconstructing the inner lining remains a challenge especially when adjacent tissues are not available after tumor resection. The galea and pericranial flaps (PFs) are widely used in anterior skull base reconstructive surgery.We evaluated the use of the PF for the inner nasal lining in an anatomical cadaver study and present its clinical application in patients with benign and malignant tumors of the nose and anterior skull base.\nFour fresh cadavers were injected with red-colored silicone for determining the pattern of vascularization of supraorbital (SOA) and supratrochlear (STA) arteries of each PF. Four surgical cases (2 nasocranial meningiomas, 1 nasal melanoma, and 1 nasal squamous cell carcinoma) received PF for reconstruction of inner lining.\nThe median distances between the superior orbital rim and the division of the deep and superficial branches of STA and SOA were 8 \u00b1 3.3 mm and 8 \u00b1 3.7 mm, respectively. The maximum measured distance was 11 mm. The SOA provided the longest axial vascularization (70.7 \u00b1 13. 9 mm) compared with STA (35 \u00b1 10.4 mm).

In 1 patient, distal necrosis of tip and columella occurred.\nThe blood supply of the PF is mainly based on the SOA arteries. Thus, superficial dissection must end 15 mm above the orbital rim to ensure the survival of the flap.

Our aims were (1) to document the lack of NeuGc expression on corneas and aortas and cultured endothelial cells [aortic endothelial cells (AECs); corneal (CECs)] of GTKO/NeuGcKO pigs, and (2) to investigate whether the absence of NeuGc reduced human antibody binding to the tissues and cells.\nWild-type (WT), GTKO, and GTKO/NeuGcKO pigs were used for the study. Human tissues and cultured cells were negative controls. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using anti-Gal and anti-NeuGc antibodies, and human IgM and IgG binding to tissues was determined. Flow cytometric analysis was used to determine Gal and NeuGc expression on cultured CECs and AECs and to measure human IgM/IgG binding to these cells.\nBoth Gal and NeuGc were detected on WT pig corneas and aortas. Although GTKO pigs expressed NeuGc, neither humans nor GTKO/NeuGcKO pigs expressed Gal or NeuGc. Human IgM/IgG binding to corneas and aortas from GTKO and GTKO/NeuGcKO pigs was reduced compared with binding to WT pigs. Human antibody binding to GTKO/NeuGcKO AECs was significantly less than that to GTKO AECs, but there was no significant difference in binding between GTKO and GTKO/NeuGcKO CECs.\nThe absence of NeuGc on GTKO aortic tissue and AECs is associated with reduced human antibody binding, and possibly will provide a better outcome in clinical xenotransplantation using vascularized organs. For clinical corneal xenotransplantation, the absence of NeuGc expression on GTKO/NeuGcKO pig corneas may not prove an advantage over GTKO corneas.", "journal": "Cornea", "date": "2015-09-30", "authors": ["WhayoungLee", "YukoMiyagawa", "CassandraLong", "BurcinEkser", "EricWalters", "JagdeeceRamsoondar", "DavidAyares", "A JosephTector", "David K CCooper", "HidetakaHara"], "doi": "10.1097/ICO.0000000000000635"}
{"title": "Transcranial functional ultrasound imaging of the brain using microbubble-enhanced ultrasensitive Doppler.", "abstract": "Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a novel neuroimaging technique, based on high-sensitivity ultrafast Doppler imaging of cerebral blood volume, capable of measuring brain activation and connectivity in rodents with high spatiotemporal resolution (100\u03bcm, 1ms). However, the skull attenuates acoustic waves, so fUS in rats currently requires craniotomy or a thinned-skull window. Here we propose a non-invasive approach by enhancing the fUS signal with a contrast agent, inert gas microbubbles. Plane-wave illumination of the brain at high frame rate (500Hz compounded sequence with three tilted plane waves, PRF=1500Hz with a 128 element 15MHz linear transducer), yields highly-resolved neurovascular maps. We compared fUS imaging performance through the intact skull bone (transcranial fUS) versus a thinned-skull window in the same animal. First, we show that the vascular network of the adult rat brain can be imaged transcranially only after a bolus intravenous injection of microbubbles, which leads to a 9dB gain in the contrast-to-tissue ratio. Next, we demonstrate that functional increase in the blood volume of the primary sensory cortex after targeted electrical-evoked stimulations of the sciatic nerve is observable transcranially in presence of contrast agents, with high reproducibility (Pearson's coefficient \u03c1=0.7\u00b10.1, p=0.85). Our work demonstrates that the combination of ultrafast Doppler imaging and injection of contrast agent allows non-invasive functional brain imaging through the intact skull bone in rats. These results should ease non-invasive longitudinal studies in rodents and open a promising perspective for the adoption of highly resolved fUS approaches for the adult human brain.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2015-09-30", "authors": ["ClaudiaErrico", "Bruno-F\u00e9lixOsmanski", "SophiePezet", "OlivierCouture", "ZsoltLenkei", "MickaelTanter"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.09.037"}
{"title": "Vascular autorescaling of fMRI (VasA fMRI) improves sensitivity of population studies: A pilot study.", "abstract": "The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is widely used for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain function in health and disease. The statistical power of fMRI group studies is significantly hampered by high inter-subject variance due to differences in baseline vascular physiology. Several methods have been proposed to account for physiological vascularization differences between subjects and hence improve the sensitivity in group studies. However, these methods require the acquisition of additional reference scans (such as a full resting-state fMRI session or ASL-based calibrated BOLD). We present a vascular autorescaling (VasA) method, which does not require any additional reference scans. VasA is based on the observation that slow oscillations (<0.1Hz) in arterial blood CO2 levels occur naturally due to changes in respiration patterns. These oscillations yield fMRI signal changes whose amplitudes reflect the blood oxygenation levels and underlying local vascularization and vascular responsivity. VasA estimates proxies of the amplitude of these CO2-driven oscillations directly from the residuals of task-related fMRI data without the need for reference scans. The estimates are used to scale the amplitude of task-related fMRI responses, to account for vascular differences. The VasA maps compared well to cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) maps and cerebral blood volume maps based on vascular space occupancy (VASO) measurements in four volunteers, speaking to the physiological vascular basis of VasA. VasA was validated in a wide variety of tasks in 138 volunteers. VasA increased t-scores by up to 30% in specific brain areas such as the visual cortex. The number of activated voxels was increased by up to 200% in brain areas such as the orbital frontal cortex while still controlling the nominal false-positive rate. VasA fMRI outperformed previously proposed rescaling approaches based on resting-state fMRI data and can be readily applied to any task-related fMRI data set, even retrospectively.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2015-09-30", "authors": ["Samira MKazan", "SiawooshMohammadi", "Martina FCallaghan", "GuillaumeFlandin", "LaurentiusHuber", "RobertLeech", "AneurinKennerley", "ChristianWindischberger", "NikolausWeiskopf"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.09.033"}

{"title": "Regeneration versus scarring in vertebrate appendages and heart.", "abstract": "Injuries to complex human organs, such as the limbs and the heart, result in pathological conditions, for which we often lack adequate treatments. While modern regenerative approaches are based on the transplantation of stem cell-derived cells, natural regeneration in lower vertebrates, such as zebrafish and newts, relies predominantly on the intrinsic plasticity of mature tissues. This property involves local activation of the remaining material at the site of injury to promote cell division, cell migration and complete reproduction of the missing structure. It remains an unresolved question why adult mammals are not equally competent to reactivate morphogenetic programmes. Although organ regeneration depends strongly on the proliferative properties of cells in the injured tissue, it is apparent that various organismic factors, such as innervation, vascularization, hormones, metabolism and the immune system, can affect this process. Here, we focus on a correlation between the regenerative capacity and cellular specialization in the context of functional demands, as illustrated by appendages and heart in diverse vertebrates. Elucidation of the differences between homologous regenerative and non-regenerative tissues from various animal models is essential for understanding the applicability of lessons learned from the study of regenerative biology to clinical strategies for the treatment of injured human organs.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2015-09-29", "authors": ["AnnaJa\u017awi\u0144ska", "PaulineSallin"], "doi": "10.1002/path.4644\n10.1002/reg2.41\n10.3791/3666"}

We compared our results to other reconstruction techniques and other similar series reported in the literature.\nThe average age of our patients was 43\u00a0years and 11\u00a0months. In all cases, defect was traumatic. The average follow-up was 5\u00a0years (4.5 to 5.8). The average flap area was 135cm(2) and the average rib length was 9.21cm. Our microsurgical success rate is 95%. Our global consolidation rate is 82%.\nUse of vascularized rib in the treatment of lower limb traumatic defects is rare. The bone quality of rib is lower than fibula, but the coverage provided is better, due to serratus anterior muscle. The length and diameter of the vascular pedicle is very useful too. Our results are comparable to other series using this flap. Its coverage properties and the possibility of simultaneous bone reconstruction is useful.

We present the first case of successful multiple EGS in a patient with brain ischemic disease who presented with different cerebrovascular findings from MMD.\nA 13-year-old girl had an increased frequency of transient ischemic attacks that affected her right extremities. Digital subtraction angiography showed tapering of the internal carotid artery (ICA). The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) were visible on vertebral angiogram, but not on carotid angiogram. The intact circle of Willis and lack of hypervascularity of the lenticulostriate arteries were observed. Decreased regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the bilateral ACA and MCA territories quantified by (123)I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine-single photon emission computed tomography indicated the need for extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery. Multiple EGS procedures were performed instead of direct anastomosis, which is the standard procedure for intracranial ICA stenosis, because the space for the craniotomy was limited by transdural anastomosis.\nDespite the fact that the diagnosis of MMD was questionable, the hemispheres were well vascularized, and the neurology and CBF improved postoperatively.\nThe preserved circle of Willis and lack of moyamoya vessels were inconsistent with the features of MMD. However, childhood onset, bilateralness, chronic intracranial ICA stenosis, and transdural anastomosis indicated the same underling pathogenicity as MMD. It is hypothesized that ICA stenosis occurred immediately proximal to the posterior communicating artery in this case.

To confirm this premise, we carried out an evolutive and descriptive study of ten MVP procedures as well as a morphological analysis of ten cadaveric mallei using both light and scanning electron microscopies. The arterial supply of the manubrium comes from two main sources: vascular branches that reach this ossicle from the site of insertion of the tensor tympani tendon and small perforating branches which penetrate the bone from arteries of the tympanic membrane that, following the periosteum/perichondrium, they arrange parallel to the bone. The detachment of the tympanic membrane to fasten a MVP prosthesis causes a damage in the periosteal/perichondral vascular supply of the handle as well as micro-trauma on it, which can promote bone resorption at the point of anchorage by osteoclast stimulation.

However, subcutaneous models poorly resemble tumor complexity due to the fast growth not reflecting the natural course. Here, we describe an application of the new spheroid-plug model to combine the simplicity of subcutaneous injection with improved resemblance to natural tumor progression. Spheroid-plug model relies on in vitro formation of tumor spheroids, followed by injection of single tumor spheroid subcutaneously in Matrigel matrix. In spheroid-plug model, tumors grow slower in comparison to tumors formed by injection of cell suspension as assessed by 3D ultrasonography (USG) and in vivo bioluminescence measurements. The slower tumor growth rate in spheroid-plug model is accompanied by reduced necrosis. The spheroid-plug model ensures increased and more stable vascularization of tumor than classical subcutaneous tumor model as demonstrated by 3D USG Power Doppler examination. Flow cytometry analysis showed that tumors formed from spheroids have enhanced infiltration of endothelial cells as well as hematopoietic and progenitor cells with stem cell phenotype (c-Kit(+) and Sca-1(+)). They also contain more tumor cells expressing cancer stem cell marker CXCR4. Here, we show that spheroid-plug model allows investigating efficiency of anticancer drugs. Treatment of spheroid-plug tumors with known antiangiogenic agent axitinib decreased their size and viability.

We tested this safety-efficiency hypothesis in branch xylem across 335 angiosperm and 89 gymnosperm species. Safety was considered at three levels: the xylem water potentials where 12%, 50% and 88% of maximal conductivity are lost. Although correlations between safety and efficiency were weak (r(2) \u00a0<\u00a00.086), no species had high efficiency and high safety, supporting the idea for a safety-efficiency tradeoff.

Species with low efficiency and low safety were weakly associated (r(2) \u00a0<\u00a00.02 in most cases) with higher wood density, lower leaf- to sapwood-area and shorter stature.

Presence of conjunctival fibrosis and visualization of the scleral flap were also analyzed.\nFBs showed significantly more intraepithelial microcysts than did NFBs: the mean grading of microcyst density was 1.86 for FBs and 0.11 for NFBs (P<0.0001). None of the FBs were rated 0 and none of the NFBs were rated 2 or 3 for the density of intraepithelial microcysts. NFBs presented more conjunctival fibrosis than FBs (63% vs. 32%, P<0.05). There was no significant difference between FBs and NFBs for bleb vascularization, visualization of the scleral flap, and presence of subepithelial fluid-filled cavities. There was a direct correlation between postoperative intraocular pressure and intraepithelial microcyst density (r=-0.7655, P<0.0001). The long-term administration of preserved eyedrops before surgery was associated with fewer intraepithelial microcysts (r=-0.5436; P=0.0006).\nFBs were associated with a higher number of intraepithelial microcysts evaluated with en-face OCT. A higher density of microcysts was associated with a lower intraocular pressure and a shorter duration of preserved topical treatment before surgery.

It is demonstrated that 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), a potent neuroprotectant, protected the female neurons but had no effects on the male neurons from CoCl2- and glutamate-induced toxicity. Agonists of the estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, DPN and PPT, respectively, had similar effects to E2. By contrast, effects of E2 were abolished by the ER antagonist ICI-182780, further corroborating the neuroprotective role of ERs. In male neurons, CoCl2 predominately activated the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)-dependent pathway and AIF translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. In comparison, CoCl2 activated the caspase pathway and cytochrome c release in female neurons. The inhibitors of these pathways, namely DiQ for AIF and zVAD for caspase, specifically rescued CoCl2-induced cell death in male and female neurons, respectively. When zVAD and ICI-182780, and E2 were applied in combination, it was demonstrated E2 acted on the caspase pathway leading to female-specific neuroprotection. Furthermore, the PI3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor blocked the rescue effects of DiQ and zVAD on the male and female neurons, respectively, suggesting that PI3K is a common upstream regulator for both pathways. The present study suggested that both sex-specific and nonspecific mechanisms played a role in neuronal responses to stressors and protective reagents.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular neurobiology", "date": "2015-09-16", "authors": ["Hui-YunCheng", "Shin-HuiHung", "Po-JuChu"], "doi": "10.1007/s10571-015-0259-6"}
{"title": "Overexpression of Hif-1\u03b1 in Mesenchymal Stem Cells Affects Cell-Autonomous Angiogenic and Osteogenic Parameters.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of large bone defects still represents a major medical challenge. In recent years tissue engineering has developed techniques based on adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that could represent an attractive therapeutical option to treat large bone defects in the future. It has been demonstrated in various animal models that ex vivo expanded MSCs are capable of promoting the regeneration of skeletal defects after implantation. However, for the efficient regeneration of bone in tissue engineering applications, a rapid vascularization of implanted grafts is essential to ensure the survival of cells in the early post-implantational phase. A promising strategy to enhance vascularization of MSC-containing implants could consist of overexpression of the angiogenic master transcription factor Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (Hif-1) in the MSCs in order to induce angiogenesis and support osteogenesis. In the present study, we overexpressed Hif-1\u03b1 in MSCs by using recombinant adenoviruses and investigated cell-autonomous effects. Overexpression of Hif-1\u03b1 enhanced proliferation, migration, cell survival and expression of pro-angiogenic genes. Other parameters such as expression of the osteogenic markers BMP-2 and RunX2 were decreased. Hif-1\u03b1 overexpression had no effect on invasion, senescence and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Our experiments revealed multifarious effects of Hif-1\u03b1 overexpression on cell-autonomous parameters. Therefore, Hif-1\u03b1 overexpression may represent a therapeutic option to improve cellular functions of MSCs to treat critical sized bone defects.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2015-09-15", "authors": ["F MLampert", "CK\u00fctscher", "G BStark", "GFinkenzeller"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.25361"}

A primary repair is not suitable for all giant omphaloceles. We implanted two grafts, small intestinal submucosal (SIS) and acellular dermal matrix (ADM) onto abdominal wall defects in neonates to study the safety and efficacy of SIS and ADM graft techniques for initial closure of giant omphaloceles in infants, and we also implanted these grafts onto abdominal wall defects in an animal model.\nTwenty-four patients with giant omphaloceles were divided into two groups (ADM group, 12 patients; SIS group, 12 patients). The operative time, skin healing time postoperatively, and the incidence of skin infections, and abdominal wall hernias were observed. In the rabbit animal model, bilateral full-thickness incisions were made through the rabbit rectus abdominus muscles and a 2\u00d74cm longitudinal whole layer defect was created on either the left or right lateral anterior abdominal wall. A four-layered variant of the SIS graft was used to repair the right abdominal defect; ADM was used to repair the left. Tensile strength was measured using an Instron tensiometer. Electron scanning and light microscopy were used to evaluate neovascularization, collagen deposition, and muscle fibers at 2, 4, 8, and 16weeks postimplantation.\nIn the neonatal patients, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to operative time, skin healing time postoperatively, the incidence of skin infections, or abdominal wall hernias. In the SIS group, only one patient developed a skin infection, which led to skin necrosis and sloughing. In the ADM group, four patients developed skin infection postoperatively, and the patch was gradually removed. In the animal study, there was no significant difference between the mean breaking strength of ADM versus SIS repairs. Scanning electron and light microscopy showed collagen deposition, increased vascularization, fibroblasts, and muscular regeneration in both SIS and ADM repairs. SEM showed that the SIS graft was absorbed, while ADM was not. Light microscopy showed foreign body macrophages in ADM, but not in the SIS repairs.\nSIS and ADM grafts adequately enhance healing with a low complication rate.

The pro-permeability factor Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) produced within glioblastoma has been linked to the loss of endothelial barrier integrity. Here, we report that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by patient-derived glioblastoma cells disrupt the endothelial barrier. EVs expressed Sema3A at their surface, which accounted for in vitro elevation of brain endothelial permeability and in vivo vascular permeability, in both skin and brain vasculature. Blocking Sema3A or its receptor Neuropilin1 (NRP1) hampered EV-mediated permeability. In vivo models using ectopically and orthotopically xenografted mice revealed that Sema3A-containing EVs were efficiently detected in the blood stream. In keeping with this idea, sera from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients also contain high levels of Sema3A carried in the EV fraction that enhanced vascular permeability, in a Sema3A/NRP1-dependent manner.

Histopathologic findings included segmentation of the original single implant, stripped of its perichondrium, due to \"kerfing,\" sometimes with overlapping of the segments and scar formation between the segments. In place of the perichondrium that had been removed during the preparation the graft implants, a fibrous pseudoperichondrial capsule had formed. Pyknotic nuclei in varying degrees were typically found in the center of the grafts, despite a high degree of preservation of the extracellular matrix (collagenous, elastic, and proteoglycan components). No evidence of inflammation, cartilaginous vascularization, or necrosis was identified in any graft.\nDespite minimal reactive processes, kerfing (partial thickness cuts made in the graft to increase its pliancy) may be partially responsible for graft migration, deformation, and surgical failure. The consequences were graft fragmentation and overlapping of the multiple fragments. Graft migration can be exacerbated if a posterior lamellar graft is used to correct an anterior lamellar deficiency. Interference with the overall architectural integrity of the graft and its extracellular matrix appears to play no role in failure, despite removal of the perichondrium. Mild to moderate degrees of chondrocytic dropout in the absence of necrosis and inflammation are probably attributable to the thick and coarsely textured collagen of the fibrous pseudoperichondrial capsule that may impede diffusion of nutrients into the center of the graft.", "journal": "Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2015-09-10", "authors": ["Peter WMacIntosh", "Frederick AJakobiec", "AnnaStagner", "AliaRashid", "Francis CSutula", "Michael KYoon", "Aaron MFay"], "doi": "10.1097/IOP.0000000000000540"}

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have inherent anti-inflammatory properties. We postulated that coencapsulation of MSCs with the target cells would reduce PFO. A hepatoinsulinoma cell line (HUH7) was used to model human target cells and was coencapsulated with either human or mouse MSCs at different ratios in alginate microcapsules. Viability of encapsulated cells was assessed in vitro and xenografted either intraperitoneally or subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice. Graft retrieval was performed at 3 weeks posttransplantation and assessed for PFO. Coencapsulation of human MSCs (hMSCs) or mouse MSCs (mMSCs) with HUH7 at different ratios did not alter cell viability in vitro. In vivo data from intraperitoneal infusions showed that PFO for HUH7 cells coencapsulated with hMSCs and mMSCs in a ratio of 1:1 was significantly reduced by \u223c30% and \u223c35%, respectively, compared to HUH7 encapsulated alone. PFO for HUH7 cells was reduced by \u223c51% when the ratio of mMSC/HUH7 was increased to 2:1. Implanting the microcapsules subcutaneously rather than intraperitoneally substantially reduced PFO in all treatment groups, which was most significant in the mMSC/HUH7 2:1 group with a \u223c53% reduction in PFO compared with HUH7 alone. Despite the reduced PFO reaction to the individual microcapsules implanted subcutaneously, all microcapsule treatment groups were contained in a vascularized fibrotic pouch at 3 weeks. The presence of MSCs in microcapsules retrieved from these fibrotic pouches improved graft survival with significantly higher cell viabilities of 83.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6% and 79.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8% seen with microcapsules containing mMSC/HUH7 at 2:1 and 1:1 ratios, respectively, compared to HUH7 alone (51.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7%) transplanted subcutaneously.

We performed quantitative proteomic analysis of ESM proteins on multiple days during the three phases of embryonic development. The ESMs were stripped from both fertilized and unfertilized eggs at different days of incubation, and solubilized in a novel manner using TCEP-HCl (Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride). The changes in ESM proteins between occurred during incubation were analyzed. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that of the 12 functional protein clusters identified, protease inhibitors were present at all phases of chick development. A group of proteins involved in calcium binding and oxygen transport were only present during the second phase. Extracellular matrix, cell adhesion proteins related to the vascularization of chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), antimicrobial proteins and proteins involved in the binding and transport of lipids were found in the second and third phases of development. These findings provide insight into the functionality and evolving nature of ESM associated proteins involved in chick embryonic development.\nThe eggshell membranes (ESMs) are a fibrous scaffold that consists of highly crosslinked collagens (types I, V but mainly X), glycoproteins and CREMPs (cysteine-rich eggshell membrane proteins). The ESMs aid in the development of the chick embryo and protect it against pathogen invasion. This biopolymeric fibrous net functions as a platform for nucleation of the calcitic eggshell which provides a primary physical barrier against bacterial ingress.

In addition, a low-dose model that closely mimics human latent infection has recently been developed. These models are used alongside infection of optically transparent zebrafish embryos and larvae that rely on innate immunity and permit non-invasive visualization of the early stages of developing granulomas that are inaccessible in other animal models. By microinjecting mycobacteria intravenously or into different tissues, systemic and localized infections can be induced, each useful for studying particular aspects of early pathogenesis, such as phagocyte recruitment, granuloma expansion and maintenance, vascularization of granulomas, and the phagocyte-mediated dissemination of mycobacteria. This has contributed to new insights into the mycobacteria-driven mechanisms that promote granuloma formation, the double-edged role of inflammation, the mechanisms of macrophage cell death that favor disease progression, and the host-protective role of autophagy. As a result, zebrafish models are now increasingly used to explore strategies for adjunctive therapy of tuberculosis with host-directed drugs.", "journal": "Seminars in immunopathology", "date": "2015-09-02", "authors": ["Annemarie HMeijer"], "doi": "10.1007/s00281-015-0522-4\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2010.00984.x\n10.1128/MMBR.00010-14\n10.1038/nrmicro1538\n10.1128/MMBR.00032-13\n10.1128/IAI.02850-14\n10.1242/dmm.016089\n10.1111/imr.12273\n10.1101/gr.075069.107\n10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00446-4\n10.1128/IAI.72.11.6306-6312.2004\n10.1128/IAI.00887-06\n10.1016/j.micinf.2004.10.003\n10.1111/j.1462-5822.2008.01133.x\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0020367\n10.1016/S1074-7613(02)00475-2\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.11.014\n10.1038/ni1091\n10.1086/593175\n10.1016/j.immuni.2007.12.010\n10.1038/nm.3412\n10.1111/j.1365-2761.2007.00839.x\n10.1016/j.molimm.2004.11.014\n10.1016/j.molimm.2009.07.002\n10.1016/j.molimm.2009.03.024\n10.1111/j.1462-5822.2012.01755.x\n10.1242/dmm.015453\n10.1073/pnas.150227197\n10.1172/JCI42796\n10.4049/jimmunol.1202722\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1002944\n10.1016/j.ejps.2015.02.017\n10.1073/pnas.1424563112\n10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.08.093\n10.1242/dmm.010843\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1004190\n10.1128/IAI.03135-14\n10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04261.x\n10.1128/IAI.00686-12\n10.1111/cmi.12175\n10.1021/pr301017e\n10.1074/jbc.M114.598482\n10.1128/IAI.03081-14\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.11.003\n10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.03237.x\n10.1002/aja.1002030302\n10.1182/blood-2007-06-095398\n10.1016/B978-0-12-387036-0.00004-9\n10.1242/dmm.015594\n10.1126/science.1179663\n10.1016/j.chom.2014.05.005\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.013\n10.1242/dmm.017756\n10.1242/dev.112003\n10.1038/nmeth.3360\n10.1016/j.devcel.2015.01.032\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016779\n10.1016/j.celrep.2012.06.008\n10.1128/AAC.03588-14\n10.1038/nprot.2013.068\n10.1016/j.chom.2012.07.009\n10.1016/j.dci.2014.07.022\n10.1242/dmm.006676\n10.1021/nn5019126\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.022\n10.1093/infdis/jiu095\n10.1002/emmm.201303575\n10.1038/nature12799\n10.1016/j.chom.2007.06.004\n10.1189/jlb.1012534\n10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07618.x\n10.1242/dmm.014498\n10.1378/chest.09-0903\n10.1016/j.it.2011.10.003\n10.1242/jcs.082792\n10.1371/journal.pone.0116052\n10.1182/blood-2010-01-262873\n10.4161/auto.29992\n10.1016/j.immuni.2008.06.011\n10.1371/journal.pone.0100928\n10.1182/blood-2010-03-276972\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1003789\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00036\n10.1038/nature09247\n10.1111/imm.12223\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.11.024\n10.3389/fcimb.2014.00173\n10.1038/ni1309\n10.1073/pnas.131207398\n10.1128/IAI.70.11.5946-5954.2002\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.26.021607.090326\n10.4049/jimmunol.1302821\n10.1084/jem.20050126\n10.1128/IAI.71.12.7023-7034.2003\n10.5588/ijtld.14.0525\n10.4049/jimmunol.178.3.1723\n10.1002/eji.200323956\n10.1002/oby.20642\n10.1111/imm.12293\n10.1007/978-1-4939-1261-2_15\n10.1016/j.smim.2014.10.002\n10.1111/imr.12249\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.023\n10.4049/jimmunol.1200551\n10.1371/journal.pone.0067828\n10.1038/nature13489\n10.1084/jem.20080767\n10.1016/j.cell.2004.11.038\n10.1038/nri3532\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.012\n10.1016/j.chom.2013.01.008\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1003946\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.06.040\n10.4161/15548627.2014.984280\n10.1016/j.immuni.2010.02.009\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.05.059\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1004650\n10.1038/nature06421\n10.1038/emboj.2013.246\n10.1172/JCI73939\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.05.034\n10.1016/j.chom.2015.05.005\n10.1016/j.chom.2015.05.003\n10.1016/j.chom.2015.05.004\n10.1111/eci.12132\n10.1016/j.smim.2014.09.006\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1004485"}
{"title": "Placentation, maternal-fetal interface, and conceptus loss in\u00a0swine.", "abstract": "Pregnancy is a delicate yet complex physiological process that requires fine-tuning of many factors (hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and receptors) between the mother and the conceptus to ensure the survival of the conceptus(es) to term. Any disturbance in the maternal-conceptus dialog can have detrimental effects on the affected conceptus or even the outcome of pregnancy as a whole. Being a litter-bearing species, such disruptions can lead to a loss of up to 45% of the totally healthy offspring during early (periattachment) and midgestation to late gestation in pigs. Although the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, several factors have been associated with the fetal loss including but not limited to uterine capacity, placental efficiency, genetics, nutrition, and deficits in vascularization at the maternal-fetal interface. Over the years, we investigated how immune cells are recruited to the porcine maternal-fetal interface and whether they contribute to vascularization. We also delineated how cytokines, chemokines, and cytokine destabilizing factors fine-tune inflammation and whether the cytokine shift from early to midpregnancy exists at the porcine maternal-fetal interface. Finally, we evaluated the role of microRNAs in regulating immune cell recruitment and their angiogenic functions during pregnancy. Collectively our research points out that the immune-angiogenesis axis at the porcine maternal interface is significantly involved in promoting new blood vessel development, regulating inflammatory responses and ultimately contributing to pregnancy success. In this review, we summarized current knowledge on spontaneous fetal loss in swine, with special attention to the mechanisms in immune reactivity and interplay at the maternal-fetal interface.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2015-09-02", "authors": ["Rami TKridli", "KasraKhalaj", "MallikarjunBidarimath", "ChandrakantTayade"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.08.001"}

Although several cellular and molecular causes for vein graft disease have been identified using in vivo models, the metabolic cues induced by sudden interruption of vasa vasorum blood supply have remained unexplored. In the present manuscript, we describe the design of an ex vivo culture system allowing the generation of an oxygen gradient between the luminal and the adventitial sides of the vein. This system featured a separation between the inner and the outer vessel culture circuits, and integrated a purpose-developed de-oxygenator module enabling the trans-wall oxygen distribution (high oxygen level at luminal side and low oxygen level at the adventitial side) existing in arterialized veins. Compared with standard cultures the bypass-specific conditions determined a significant increase in the proliferation of cells around adventitial vasa vasorum and an elevation in the length density of small and large caliber vasa vasorum. These results suggest, for the first time, a cause-effect relationship between the vein adventitial hypoxia and a neo-vascularization process, a factor known to predispose the arterialized vein conduits to restenosis.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2015-09-01", "authors": ["MarcoPiola", "FrancescaPrandi", "Gianfranco BeniaminoFiore", "MarcoAgrifoglio", "GianlucaPolvani", "MaurizioPesce", "MonicaSoncini"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-015-1434-0"}

Mesorectal macrovascular features, i.e., the number of vascular branches, average diameter and length, were assessed from baseline-subtracted post-contrast images by two independent readers. Mesorectal microvascular function was investigated by means of area under the enhancement-time curve (AUC). Histopathology served as reference standard of the tumour response to CRT.\nThe average vessel branching in the mesorectum around the tumour and normal rectal wall was 8.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8 and 1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3, respectively (reader1: p\u2009=\u20090.001, reader2: p\u2009=\u20090.002). Similarly, the tumour-surrounding mesorectum displayed circa tenfold elevated AUC (p\u2009=\u20090.01).

Vascularization in response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor or vehicle-control treatment (10 per group) in HaCaT-ras A-5RT3 xenografts was longitudinally assessed in mice by means of first-pass kinetics of nontargeted microbubbles (BR1, BR38; Bracco, Geneva, Switzerland) and VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles (BR55, Bracco) before and 4, 7, and 14 days after therapy. VEGFR2 expression was determined 8 minutes after BR55 injection with destruction-replenishment analysis. US data were validated with immunohistochemistry. Significant differences were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney test.\nFirst-pass analysis with BR1, BR38, and BR55 showed similar tendencies toward decreasing vascularization, with a stronger decrease in tumors treated with anti-VEGF antibody. The median signal intensity (in arbitrary units [au]) of anti-VEGF antibody-treated versus control tumors at day 14 was as follows: BR1, 5.2 au (interquartile range [IQR], 3.2 au) vs 11.3 au (IQR, 10.0 au), respectively; BR38, 6.2 au (IQR, 3.5) vs 10.0 au (IQR, 7.8); and BR55, 9.5 au (IQR, 6.0 au) vs 13.8 au (IQR, 9.8) (P = .0230).

{"title": "In silico tumor control induced via alternating immunostimulating and immunosuppressive phases.", "abstract": "Despite recent advances in the field of Oncoimmunology, the success potential of immunomodulatory therapies against cancer remains to be elucidated. One of the reasons is the lack of understanding on the complex interplay between tumor growth dynamics and the associated immune system responses. Toward this goal, we consider a mathematical model of vascularized tumor growth and the corresponding effector cell recruitment dynamics. Bifurcation analysis allows for the exploration of model's dynamic behavior and the determination of these parameter regimes that result in immune-mediated tumor control.

The combination of mastopexy and breast implants has revealed a moderate recurrence of breast ptosis in many patients particularly with use of medium to large implants. Ptosis is the \"bottoming out\" of the breast tissue with loss of the desired roundness, due to the ptosis of the breast implant and the mammary tissue. In this study, we hypothesize the need for careful planning and careful preoperative surgical execution to minimize this complication.\nBetween January 2007 and July 2011, augmentation mastopexy with implant and autologous tissue (\"double implant\") was performed for 25 patients with grade III mammary ptosis. All patients underwent inverted-T mastopexy with supramuscular moderately cohesive gel breast implant using an inferior-based flap of de-epitelialized dermoglandular tissue and a superior-based nipple-areola complex pedicle.\nAn inferior-based flap of deepithelialized dermoglandular tissue was used to stabilize the implant and is projection. Breast lifting was performed through a strong anchorage to fascia and to muscle of second intercostal space, improving the profile of the breast. Results were analyzed, no breast ptosis recurrence was noted at 30-month follow-up.\nOur technique presents the challenge of determining the amount of excess skin to be removed after implantation to create symmetry and provide for skin tightening without compromising tissue vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research", "date": "2015-08-26", "authors": ["Giuseppe AndreaFerraro", "FrancescoDe Francesco", "SergioRazzano", "FrancescoD'Andrea", "GianfrancoNicoletti"], "doi": "10.3109/08941939.2015.1037940"}

It was the aim of the present study to analyze the role of NDRG1 on glioma angiogenesis and on antiangiogenic treatment. Orthotopically implanted NDRG1 glioma showed reduced tumor growth and vessel density compared to controls. RT-PCR gene array analysis revealed a 30-fold TNFSF15 increase in NDRG1 tumors. Consequently, the supernatant from NDRG1 transfected U87MG glioma cells resulted in reduced HUVEC proliferation, migration and angiogenic response in tube formation assays in vitro. This effect was provoked by increased TNFSF15 promoter activity in NDRG1 cells. Mutations in NF-\u03baB and AP-1 promoter response elements suppressed TNFSF15 promoter activity. Moreover, U87MG glioma NDRG1 knockdown supernatant contained multiple proangiogenic proteins and increased HUVEC spheroid sprouting. Sunitinib treatment of orhotopically implanted mice reduced tumor volume and vessel density in controls; in NDRG1 overexpressing cells no reduction of tumor volume or vessel density was observed.

{"title": "Patient-Specific Biomechanical Modeling for Guidance During Minimally-Invasive Hepatic Surgery.", "abstract": "During the minimally-invasive liver surgery, only the partial surface view of the liver is usually provided to the surgeon via the laparoscopic camera. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the actual position of the internal structures such as tumors and vessels from the pre-operative images. Nevertheless, such task can be highly challenging since during the intervention, the abdominal organs undergo important deformations due to the pneumoperitoneum, respiratory and cardiac motion and the interaction with the surgical tools. Therefore, a reliable automatic system for intra-operative guidance requires fast and reliable registration of the pre- and intra-operative data. In this paper we present a complete pipeline for the registration of pre-operative patient-specific image data to the sparse and incomplete intra-operative data. While the intra-operative data is represented by a point cloud extracted from the stereo-endoscopic images, the pre-operative data is used to reconstruct a biomechanical model which is necessary for accurate estimation of the position of the internal structures, considering the actual deformations. This model takes into account the patient-specific liver anatomy composed of parenchyma, vascularization and capsule, and is enriched with anatomical boundary conditions transferred from an atlas. The registration process employs the iterative closest point technique together with a penalty-based method. We perform a quantitative assessment based on the evaluation of the target registration error on synthetic data as well as a qualitative assessment on real patient data.

Cornin increased the proliferation of RASMC and enhanced the expression of Wnt5a, \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1 and angiopoietin-1 (Ang1). Cornin treatment promoted angiogenesis in the ischemic brain core and improved functional outcomes after stroke.

Only a few hemostatic agents are useful to prevent the bleeding and thus facilitate the surgical resection. Fibrin sealant can be used to achieve sealing, tissue adherence, or hemostasis when other means of hemostasis are inadequate or inappropriate. We report the feasibility and positive effects of direct intratumoral injection of fibrin sealant during resection of a recurrent hemangiopericytoma. Material and Methods\u2003The intraoperative intratumoral injection of fibrin sealant changed the tumor properties of a recurrent hemangiopericytoma of the tentorium with infra- and supratentorial extension. From a loose friable briskly bleeding tumor, this complex lesion became a nonbleeding well-demarcated soft-firm tumor that could easily be dissected off the pial surface and totally resected without extensive bleeding. Results\u2003There are several benefits of intratumoral injection of fibrin sealant in hemangiopericytomas: (1) the extensive bleeding is diminished and blood loss minimized; (2) the restriction of the surgical view by the venous oozing is diminished, making the microsurgical dissection of the tumor capsule off the pial surface easier and safer; (3) the loose consistency of the tumor becomes firmer and facilitates the manipulation of the tumor and leads to a safer resection; and (4) a shorter operating time is needed.

At this time, >100 upper extremity transplants, 30 face transplants, and a variety of other vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) procedures have been performed around the world. VCA recipients present unique challenges for transplantation. The incidence of acute rejection exceeds 80% in hand and face transplantation and is well documented, whereas reports about antibody-mediated rejection and chronic rejection remain scarce. Immunosuppression protocols commonly used at US centers are derived from solid organ transplantation protocols. Novel approaches to minimize rejections in VCA may include improved HLA matching and considerations toward cytomegalovirus infection status. New graft preservation techniques may decrease immunogenicity prior to transplant. Novel monitoring methods such as valid biomarkers, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and sentinel flaps may enable earlier diagnosis of rejection. Cell-based therapies are being explored to achieve immunosuppressive regimen minimization or even tolerance induction. The efficacy of local immunosuppression in clinical VCA remains controversial.

In this study, we aimed to investigate possible engraftment factors limiting the survival and viability of experimentally transplanted human islets beyond the first day after their transplantation to the liver. Human islets were transplanted into the liver of nude mice and characterized 1 or 30 days after transplantation by immunohistochemistry. The factors assessed were endocrine mass, cellular death, hypoxia, vascular density and amyloid formation in the transplanted islets. One day posttransplantation, necrotic cells, as well as apoptotic cells, were commonly observed. In contrast to necrotic death, apoptosis rates remained high 1 month posttransplantation, and the total islet mass was reduced by more than 50% between 1 and 30 days posttransplantation. Islet mass at 30 days posttransplantation correlated negatively to apoptotic death. Vascular density within the transplanted islets remained less than 30% of that in native human islets up to 30 days posttransplantation and was associated with prevailing hypoxia. Amyloid formation was rarely observed in the 1-day-old transplants, but was commonly observed in the 30-day-old islet transplants. We conclude that substantial islet cell death occurs beyond the immediate posttransplantation phase, particularly through apoptotic events.

{"title": "Loss of endothelial programmed cell death 10 activates glioblastoma cells and promotes tumor growth.", "abstract": "Neo-angiogenesis is a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM) and is sustained by autocrine and paracrine interactions between neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells. Programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) is ubiquitously expressed in nearly all tissues and plays crucial roles in regulating angiogenesis and apoptosis. We recently discovered the absence of PDCD10 expression in the tumor vessels of GBM patients. This raised the hypothesis that loss of endothelial PDCD10 affected GBM cell phenotyping and tumor progression.\nEndothelial PDCD10 was silenced by siRNA and lentiviral shRNA. The tumor cell phenotype was studied in direct and indirect co-culture of endothelial cells (ECs) with U87 or LN229. Angiogenic protein array was performed in the media of PDCD10-silenced ECs. Tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth were investigated in a human GBM xenograft mouse model.\nEndothelial silence of PDCD10 significantly stimulated tumor cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and invasion and inhibited apoptosis in co-cultures. Stable knockdown of endothelial PDCD10 increased microvessel density and the formation of a functional vascular network, leading to a 4-fold larger tumor mass in mice. Intriguingly, endothelial deletion of PDCD10 increased (\u22652-fold) the release of 20 of 55 tested proangiogenic factors including VEGF, which in turn activated Erk1/2 and Akt in GBM cells.\nFor the first time, we provide evidence that loss of endothelial PDCD10 activates GBM cells and promotes tumor growth, most likely via a paracrine mechanism.

The mean lipid peroxidation levels were the same in the three groups, but myeloperoxidation was significantly lower in the DMSO-C group than in the other two groups.\nThe study results showed that cutaneous rather than intraperitoneal DMSO administration could preserve the quality and volume of transplanted fat tissue in rats by enhancing vascularity and decreasing inflammation.", "journal": "Aesthetic surgery journal", "date": "2015-08-06", "authors": ["ElifSari", "BulentBakar", "BahramSarkarati", "OnderBozdogan", "TarikCavusoglu"], "doi": "10.1093/asj/sjv119"}

Autologous lymph node transplantation, lymphovenous anastomosis, and other lymphatic surgeries have been developed in the last decades with rising clinical application. Animal models to explore the pathophysiology of lymphedema and microsurgical interventions have reached great popularity, although the induction of stable lymphedema in animals is still challenging. The aim of this review was to systematically assess lymphedema animal models and their potential use to study surgical interventions.\nA systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed without time or language restriction. Studies describing new or partially new models were included in chronological order. Models for primary and secondary lymphedema were assessed, and their potential for surgical procedures was evaluated.\nThe systematic search yielded 8590 discrete articles. Of 180 articles included on basis of title, 84 were excluded after abstract review. Ninety-six were included in the final analysis with 24 key articles.\nNo animal model is perfect, and many models show spontaneous lymphedema resolution. The rodent limb appears to be the most eligible animal model for experimental reconstruction of the lymphatic function as it is well accessible for vascularized tissue transfer. There is a need for standardized parameters in experimental lymphedema quantification.

The coeliac artery emitted the splenic, left gastric and hepatic arteries. The splenic artery directed towards the spleen, and the right ruminal artery, which is its only collateral directed towards the stomach, being the main artery of the rumen. The left gastric artery gave origin to the left ruminal, the reticular and the left gastroepiploic arteries. The left gastroepiploic artery originated the reticular accessory artery. Both arteries, gastric and left gastroepiploic, anastomosed their right counterparts derived from the hepatic artery on the curvatures of the abomasum. The cranial mesenteric artery irrigated the second half of the duodenum until the beginning of the descending colon. The thickest branch emitted by the cranial mesenteric artery was the ileocolic artery, which was destined to the ascending colon, caecum and ileum. The colic branches and the right colic arteries were irradiated on the right surface of the spiral loop of the ascending colon and distributed to both centripetal and centrifugal coils of the ascending colon; the colic branches were also anastomosed with the last jejunals and ileals and with the right colic arteries. There were no variations in the origin of any of the main branches derived from the coeliac and cranial mesenteric arteries.

{"title": "Efficacy of Multilayered Hepatocyte Sheet Transplantation for Radiation-Induced Liver Damage and Partial Hepatectomy in a Rat Model.", "abstract": "Although cell sheet technology has recently been developed for use in both animal experiments and in the clinical setting, it remains unclear whether transplanted hepatocyte sheets improve the liver function in vivo. Radiation-induced liver damage (RILD) combined with partial hepatectomy (PH) has been reported to suppress the proliferation of host hepatocytes and induce critical liver failure. The aim of this study was to improve the liver function in the above-mentioned diseased rat model (RILD\u2009+\u2009PH) using multilayered hepatocyte sheet transplantation. In this study, we used Fischer rats as a donor for primary hepatocytes and dermal fibroblast isolation. Cocultured multilayered hepatocyte sheets were generated by disseminating hepatocytes onto fibroblasts cultured beforehand on temperature-responsive culture dishes. Four cell sheets were transplanted into the recipient rats subcutaneously. Prior to transplantation, RILD (50 Gy) with 2/3PH was induced in the recipients. The same model was applied in the control group without transplantation. The serum was collected each week. The rats in both groups were sacrificed at 2 months after transplantation for the histological analysis. Consequently, the serum albumin concentrations were significantly higher in the transplant group than in the control group (54.3\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6 vs. 32.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7 mg/ml; p\u2009<\u20090.01) after 2 months and comparable to the serum albumin levels in the normal rats (58.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4 mg/ml). In addition, treatment with the transplanted sheets significantly improved the survival rate (57% vs. 22%, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and the hepatocyte sheets showed the storage of albumin, glycogen, and bile canaliculus structures. Some hepatocytes and fibroblasts were positive for Ki-67, and vascularization was observed around the cell sheets. Transplanted multilayered hepatocyte sheets can survive with additional proliferative activity, thereby maintaining the liver function in vivo for at least 2 months, providing metabolic support for rats with RILD.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2015-08-01", "authors": ["ZhassulanBaimakhanov", "KoshoYamanouchi", "YusukeSakai", "MakikoKoike", "AkihikoSoyama", "MasaakiHidaka", "MitsuhisaTakatsuki", "FumihikoFujita", "KengoKanetaka", "TamotsuKuroki", "SusumuEguchi"], "doi": "10.3727/096368915X688669"}

The effect of mechanical cues in guiding and stabilizing the vessels has begun to attract marked interest. This review surveys the impact of mechanical cues on formation of vascular networks in 2D and 3D gel matrices. We give less emphasis to regulation of endothelial monolayers and single endothelial cells. Several vascularization models have consistently found that the stress generated in the gel, and encountered by embedded cells, control various aspects of vascular network formation, including sprouting, branching, alignment, and vessel maturation. This internal stress is generated by cell contractile forces, and is balanced by gel stiffness and boundary constrains imposed on the gel. Actin and myosin II are key molecular players in controlling initiation of vessel sprouting and branching morphogenesis.

Various types of biomaterials with different physical and chemical properties have been developed to improve the localized delivery of growth factor and/or cells for therapeutic angiogenesis in ischemic tissues. Hydrogels are particularly advantageous as carrier systems because they are structurally similar to the tissue extracellular matrix (ECM), they can be processed under relatively mild conditions and can be delivered in a minimally invasive manner. Moreover, hydrogels can be designed to degrade in a timely fashion that coincides with the angiogenic process. For these reasons, hydrogels have shown great potential as pro-angiogenic matrices.

Vascularized lymph nodes have been harvested from a number of donor sites, that is, groin, axilla, and neck. There is a concern that harvesting nodes from the groin and axilla may lead to donor site lymphedema. This risk is greatly reduced in harvesting from the neck due to the abundant supply of lymph nodes here. In this cadaver study, we describe the submandibular and upper jugular groups of lymph nodes, demonstrate their hilar vessels, their source pedicles and drainage veins, quantified and qualified these groups of lymph nodes and their relationship to surrounding structures.\nFive fresh adult cadaver necks (10 sides) were dissected looking at the submandibular and upper jugular neck nodes under the microscope. We carried out vascularized lymph node transfer of upper jugular nodes from the neck to the groin of 1 patient with stage II lower extremity lymphedema and transferred vascularized submandibular nodes from the neck to the upper arm in 1 patient with stage II upper extremity lymphedema.\nThere was a mean of 3.2 (range, 1-5) lymph nodes in the submandibular group and a mean of 4.1 (range, 2-6) lymph nodes in the upper jugular group. The submandibular nodes were perfused by branches of the facial artery, that is, glandular and/or facial branches and/or submental artery in various permutations. The upper jugular nodes were perfused by the sternocleidomastoid artery, which branches from the superior thyroid artery (70%) or emerges directly from the external carotid artery (30%). Hilar veins were found to drain into surrounding larger draining tributary veins and ultimately into the internal jugular vein. At 1-year follow-up, there was a considerable decrease in girth circumference in our patients, no episodes of cellulitis after surgery, with subjective improvement in limb heaviness and skin pliability.\nThis knowledge of hilar blood supply will aid in transferring a lymphatic flap with intact microcirculation.

It is challenging to reconstruct the entire vascular network of any organ experimentally, in particular the pulmonary vasculature, because of its very high number of vessels, complexity of the branching pattern and poor accessibility in vivo. The objective of our research is to develop an innovative approach for the reconstruction of the full pulmonary vascular tree from available morphometric data. Our method consists of the use of morphometric data on those parts of the pulmonary vascular tree that are too small to reconstruct by medical imaging methods. This method is a three-step technique that reconstructs the entire pulmonary arterial tree down to the capillary bed. Vessels greater than 2 mm are reconstructed from direct volume and surface analysis using contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Vessels smaller than 2 mm are reconstructed from available morphometric and distensibility data and rearranged by applying Murray's laws. Implementation of morphometric data to reconstruct the branching pattern and applying Murray's laws to every vessel bifurcation simultaneously leads to an accurate vascular tree reconstruction. The reconstruction algorithm generates full arterial tree topography down to the \ufb01rst capillary bifurcation. Geometry of each order of the vascular tree is generated separately to minimize the construction and simulation time. The node-to-node connectivity along with the diameter and length of every vessel segment is established and order numbers, according to the diameter-de\ufb01ned Strahler system, are assigned.

Cell proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) and microvessel density (CD31) were evaluated in tumours by immunohistochemistry. Tissues were analysed for oestrogen receptor (ER)\u03b1, ER\u03b21, ER\u03b22, ER\u03b25 and androgen receptor (AR) expression. The results demonstrated sex-specific features in MBs, with tumours from females showing a higher apoptosis/proliferation ratio and less tumour vascularization than tumours from males.

Altogether, these findings indicate that signalling mechanisms that control cell turnover and angiogenesis operate more efficiently in females than in males.

{"title": "Transoral Robotic Cleft Palate Surgery.", "abstract": "Objective \u2003 This study aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of transoral robotic surgery for the reconstruction of soft palatal clefts. Design \u2003 The application of transoral robotic surgery for soft palate muscle reconstruction was investigated. The da Vinci Surgical Robot was first used on a cadaver to assess the optimal positioning of the patient and the robot. The robot was then used for the dissection and reconstruction of palatal muscles in 10 consecutive patients with palatal clefts. The procedures were documented using video and still photography. A group of 30 control patients were subjected to surgery with manual instruments. Surgical and clinical outcomes were evaluated with at least 6 months of follow-up (8 \u00b1 1 months). Results \u2003 The use of the surgical robot on a cadaver provided great dexterity and excellent 3D depth perception. The transoral access was efficient and safe for the precise dissection, reorientation, and suturing of palatal muscles. In our series, the surgical duration was longer for the robotic approach than for the manual approach (87 \u00b1 6 minutes versus 122 \u00b1 8 minutes, P < .0001). No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred in either group.\nA robotic surgical approach can be used safely for palatal surgery. We believe that the precise dissection of the palatal muscles provided by the robotic system might reduce damage to the vascularization and innervation of these muscles, as well as damage to the mucosal surfaces that could cause fistula formation. In addition, this technique might improve palatal function and Eustachian tube function in cleft palate patients.", "journal": "The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association", "date": "2015-06-30", "authors": ["NasserNadjmi"], "doi": "10.1597/14-077"}

Anterior tibialis tendon defects may be responsible for a steppage gait and a drop foot deformity. Drop foot reconstruction is challenging because of the high risk of postoperative adhesions and functional sequelae. In this report, we present the results of the reconstruction of post-injury anterior tibialis tendon defects with chimeric deep inferior epigatric artery perforator (DIEP) free flap associated with a quadriceps osteotendinous graft in two patients. Two men (32-year-old and 19-year-old) presented drop foot deformity with defect of the anterior tibialis tendon secondary to a crush injury. The sizes of the soft tissues defects at the foot dorsum were 24 cm \u00d7 8 cm and 20 cm \u00d7 8 cm, respectively. The quadriceps osteotendinous grafts were used to reconstruct the anterior tibialis tendon in both patients. The chimeric DIEP free flaps with skin paddles (24 cm \u00d7 8 cm and 20 cm \u00d7 8 cm) and rectus abdominis fascia (24 cm \u00d7 4 cm and 20 cm \u00d7 4 cm) were used for reconstruction. The skin component based on a musculocutaneous perforator was used for soft tissue reconstruction of the foot dorsum. The fascial component based on a second perforator was used to create a sliding surface around the osteotendinous graft. Postoperative course was uneventful. Rehabilitation lasted 3 months. The range of ankle movement was measured during 12 months. The first patient recovered 10 degree of dorsiflexion. The second patient recovered 25 degree of dorsiflexion. Walk recovery was satisfying in both patients. The single-stage procedure using the chimeric DIEP free flap may be an option for post-injury drop foot reanimation. Creating a sliding surface around a composite osteotendinous quadriceps graft with a vascularized fascial component avoid postoperative peritendinous adhesions.

Current strategies for vascularization of engineered tissues have incorporated multi-disciplinary approaches including engineered biomaterials, cells and angiogenic factors. Pre-vascularization of scaffolds composed of native matrix, synthetic polymers, or other biological materials can be achieved through the use of single cells in mono or co-culture, in combination or not with angiogenic factors or by the use of isolated vessels. The advance of these methods, together with a growing understanding of the biology behind vascularization, has facilitated the development of vascularization strategies for engineered tissues with therapeutic potential for tissue regeneration and repair.

{"title": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C for Polycystic Kidney Diseases.", "abstract": "Polycystic kidney diseases (PKD) are genetic disorders characterized by progressive epithelial cyst growth leading to destruction of normally functioning renal tissue. Current therapies have focused on the cyst epithelium, and little is known about how the blood and lymphatic microvasculature modulates cystogenesis. Hypomorphic Pkd1(nl/nl) mice were examined, showing that cystogenesis was associated with a disorganized pericystic network of vessels expressing platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3). The major ligand for VEGFR3 is VEGFC, and there were lower levels of Vegfc mRNA within the kidneys during the early stages of cystogenesis in 7-day-old Pkd1(nl/nl) mice. Seven-day-old mice were treated with exogenous VEGFC for 2 weeks on the premise that this would remodel both the VEGFR3(+) pericystic vascular network and larger renal lymphatics that may also affect the severity of PKD. Treatment with VEGFC enhanced VEGFR3 phosphorylation in the kidney, normalized the pattern of the pericystic network of vessels, and widened the large lymphatics in Pkd1(nl/nl) mice. These effects were associated with significant reductions in cystic disease, BUN and serum creatinine levels. Furthermore, VEGFC administration reduced M2 macrophage pericystic infiltrate, which has been implicated in the progression of PKD. VEGFC administration also improved cystic disease in Cys1(cpk/cpk) mice, a model of autosomal recessive PKD, leading to a modest but significant increase in lifespan.

To that end, various strategies have been explored to increase blood vessel regeneration within defects to facilitate both tissue-engineered and natural repair processes.

In 8 patients out of 13, venous insufficiency was observed which then resolved spontaneously. Flap donor sites were closed primarily. Myelomeningocele defects with a diameter larger than 5 cm require reconstruction with flaps. To mobilize a well-vascularized tissue over the defect without tension in which the suture lines will not overlap over the midline where the dura is repaired and over the meninges is one of the goals of reconstruction for such defects.

{"title": "Targeting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 to stimulate tissue vascularization.", "abstract": "When tissue perfusion is impaired, the resulting reduction in O2 availability activates hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which mediates increased transcription of genes encoding multiple angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, stromal-derived factor 1, placental growth factor, and angiopoietins, leading to the mobilization of bone marrow-derived angiogenic cells, increased angiogenesis, and arterial remodeling. These HIF- 1-dependent responses are impaired by aging or loss of function mutations at the locus encoding the HIF-1\u03b1 subunit. in mouse models of limb ischemia and lung transplant rejection, the augmentation of HIF-1 activity by gene therapy or chemical inducers was associated with maintenance of tissue perfusion that prevented limb amputation and allograft rejection, respectively.

In our study, we constructed a complex containing highly proliferative fibroblasts that can secrete extracellular matrix components and growth factors to chemotaxize endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in an attempt to create an ideal microenvironment for quick vascularization. Amniotic membrane microparticles (mAM) rich in type IV collagen (COL IV) and laminin (LN) were prepared, and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were infected with lentivirus (LV) of overexpression of SDF-1\u03b1 to construct SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF. Using the rotary cell culture system (RCCS), mAM was loaded with HDF or SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF to construct HDF-mAM and SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF-mAM complexes. The complexes were able to secrete various types of active peptides (IL-6, IL-8, TGF-\u03b2, and bFGF) during in vitro culture. In addition, SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF-mAM complex highly expressed SDF-1\u03b1. Transwell assay showed SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF-mAM complex had an apparent chemotactic effect on EPCs. Transplantation of complexes onto full-thickness skin defects of C57BL mice further demonstrated that SDF-1\u03b1 expression and the number of peripheral EPCs at days 3, 5, and 7 in the SDF-1\u03b1(ov)HDF-mAM group were significantly higher than that in other groups (p\u2009<\u20090.01).

In conclusion, HDF-mAM had a strong proliferative activity and could be used to create a sound microenvironment for quick vascularization by secreting multiple cytokines and extracellular matrix components.

Despite advances in understanding of the oncogenetics of the disease, very few clinical benefits have been shown. One of the main characteristics of PDAC is the tumor architecture where tumor cells are surrounded by a firm desmoplasia. By reducing vascularization, thus both oxygen and nutrients delivery to the tumor, this stroma causes the appearance of hypoxic zones driving metabolic adaptation in surviving tumor cells in order to cope with challenging conditions. This metabolic reprogramming promoted by environmental constraints enhances PDAC aggressiveness. In this review, we provide a brief overview of previous works regarding the importance of glucose and glutamine addiction of PDAC cells.

{"title": "What Is the Outcome of Allograft and Intramedullary Free Fibula (Capanna Technique) in Pediatric and Adolescent Patients With Bone Tumors?", "abstract": "After bone tumor resection, reconstruction for limb salvage surgery can be challenging because of the resultant large segmental bony defects. Structural allografts have been used to fill these voids; however, this technique is associated with high complication rates. To circumvent the complications associated with this procedure, massive bony allografts have been supplemented with an intramedullary vascularized free fibula. However, few studies have examined the outcomes using this technique in the pediatric and adolescent populations.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the revision-free survival using he Capanna technique for limb salvage for pediatric lower limb salvage. We attempted to answer the following questions: (1) What was the overall limb salvage rate along with incidence of reoperation and complications? (2) How did pediatric and adolescent patients functionally perform after this technique? (3) What was the incidence of late complications including infection and fracture? (4) What was the incidence of limb length discrepancy?\nEighteen pediatric patients who underwent lower extremity limb salvage with the use of cadaveric allograft and intramedullary free fibular transfer (Capanna technique) were identified. There were nine boys males and nine girls with a mean age of 11\u00a0years (range, 5-18\u00a0years) and mean followup of 8\u00a0years (range, 2-15\u00a0years), respectively. All patients had at least 2\u00a0years followup. Three patients have not been seen in followup during the past 5-years; however, all had made it to their 5-year clinical followup. The patients' medical records were reviewed for clinical and functional outcomes as well as postoperative complications. Time to union was recorded through an evaluation of radiographs. Mankin functional outcome and Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) rating scale were recorded for each patient.\nThe overall limb salvage rate was 94%. Fourteen patients underwent an additional surgical procedure. Six patients underwent additional procedure(s) to treat a symptomatic nonunion. Seventeen of the patients had a good or excellent Mankin score with a mean MSTS rating of 93% at last followup. Six of the patients underwent a limb length modification procedure.\nUse of large allografts in conjunction with intramedullary vascularized free fibulas appears to be a reliable method for the reconstruction of large bony tumors of the lower extremity in this population, although we did not directly compare this with allografts alone in our study. The use of locked plates may improve union times. The proportion of patients achieving limb preservation was high and complication rates are acceptable.\nLevel IV, therapeutic study.", "journal": "Clinical orthopaedics and related research", "date": "2015-02-24", "authors": ["Matthew THoudek", "Eric RWagner", "Anthony AStans", "Alexander YShin", "Allen TBishop", "Franklin HSim", "Steven LMoran"], "doi": "10.1007/s11999-015-4204-2\n10.1302/0301-620X.91B10.22212\n10.1055/s-2008-1081406\n10.1097/00003086-200002000-00003\n10.1055/s-2007-1006786\n10.2106/JBJS.M.00655\n10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181fa7981\n10.1007/BF02620523\n10.3109/17453679408993716\n10.1097/00003086-200510000-00029\n10.1097/00003086-200008000-00025\n10.1016/j.ejso.2007.11.010\n10.1002/micr.20668\n10.1097/MOP.0b013e328334581f\n10.1055/s-0030-1267381\n10.1002/jso.21922\n10.1002/1097-0142(19820815)50:4<613::AID-CNCR2820500402>3.0.CO;2-L\n10.1097/00003086-199603000-00011\n10.1097/01.prs.0000227682.71527.2b\n10.1007/s11999-008-0303-7\n10.1097/01.blo.0000141652.93178.10\n10.2106/JBJS.D.02170\n10.1097/00006534-197505000-00002\n10.2106/JBJS.E.00257\n10.1007/s11999-009-1024-2"}

Unfortunately, the high-energy radiation used can lead to severe osteoradionecrosis. Radical debridement of devitalized bone and soft tissue coupled with reconstruction using well-vascularized tissues is the accepted treatment for this condition. However, osteoradionecrosis cannot be controlled easily or rapidly. The aim of this study was to present the results of the use of serial negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in combination with a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap for treatment of gluteal osteoradionecrosis in a consecutive series of patients. Between January 2003 and December 2012, nine patients underwent reconstruction using serial NPWT and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps. We applied negative-pressure dressings for at least 8 weeks. Final reconstruction was performed after the infection was controlled. The superior gluteal artery and vein were used as recipient vessels in all the cases. The mean interval between operation and radiation therapy was 28.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3 years, and the mean number of debridement performed was 6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091. NPWT dressings were applied for 8-12 weeks (mean, 9.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092 weeks). The defects ranged in size from 14 \u00d7 8 cm to 18 \u00d7 15 cm. The flap size ranged from 15 \u00d7 10 cm to 18 \u00d7 15 cm. All flaps survived uneventfully except in one patient who experienced chronic seroma and wound dehiscence. There were no recurrences of osteomyelitis during the follow-up periods (mean, 14\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 months).

The purpose of this study was to determine how revascularizaton of processed nerve allograft would affect motor recovery. Eighty-eight rats were divided in four groups of 22 animals each. A unilateral 10-mm sciatic nerve defect was repaired with allograft (group I), allograft wrapped with silicone conduit (group II), allograft augmented with vascular endothelial growth factor (group III), or autograft (group IV). Eight animals from each group were sacrificed at 3 days, and the remaining animals at 16 weeks. Revascularization was evaluated by measuring the graft capillary density at 3 days and 16 weeks. Measurements of ankle contracture, compound muscle action potential, tibialis anterior muscle weight and force, and nerve histomorphometry were performed at 16 weeks.

These cells are associated with vascular niches which regulate GSC self-renewal and survival. Recent studies suggest that while blood vessels support glioma stem cells, these tumor cells in turn may regulate and contribute to the tumor vasculature by transdifferentiating into endothelial cells directly or through the secretion of regulatory growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatoma derived growth factor (HDGF).

Differentiation potential of stem cells treated with CM was monitored by AdipoRed staining and qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Angiogenic potential of human endothelial cells treated with CM was tested via sprouting assay.\nThe CM of adipose tissue significantly enhanced ASC proliferation (P < 0.01). Treatment with CM showed no inductive effect on ASC differentiation into adipocytes but, at the same time, significantly induced cell sprouting of endothelial cells (P < 0.001). We show for the first time that CM of adipose tissue is a potent inducer of proliferation of ASCs and angiogenesis, with comparable effects with those of stem cell-enriched CM.\nWe suggest the use of the secretome of adipose tissue to produce CM for topical application on wounds, rather than working with adipose tissue or including the difficult process of enriching the patients' stem cells in vitro.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2014-10-03", "authors": ["JohannaKober", "AlfredGugerell", "MelanieSchmid", "MaximilianZeyda", "ElisabethBuchberger", "StefanieNickl", "StefanHacker", "Hendrik JanAnkersmit", "MaikeKeck"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0000000000000358"}

Time to return to walk and to run and tendon thickening were also recorded.\nPatients in the soleus transfer group had a higher increase in AOFAS and VISA-A score at 6\u00a0months and at the mean 4-year final follow-up (by 5.4 points, 95\u00a0% CI 2.9-7.9, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and by 5.7 points, 95\u00a0% CI 2.5-8.9, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, for AOFAS and VISA, respectively). They also needed less time to return to run: 98.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.4\u00a0days compared to 122.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.3\u00a0days for the longitudinal tenotomies group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0019).

Despite similar outcomes in postoperative functional scores, soleus transfer allows a faster recovery but has a higher incidence of tendon thickening.

Patients with LS received combined rhIGF1/rhIGFBP3 1-2\u2009mg/kg/d in a single dose and digital fundus imaging was performed. The number of branching points and tortuosity of retinal vessels were studied.

Perforator flaps in general and propeller flaps in particular have opened up an entirely new subset of local tissue transfer alternatives that can potentially avoid the difficulties that accompany microvascular tissue transfers. The first dorsal metatarsal artery (FDMA) perforator propeller flap represents another variation of this theme.\nA standard FDMA flap from the dorsum of the foot was raised in reversed fashion based on the distal communicating branch or \"perforator\" from the plantar foot circulation in 2 patients with great toe defects. All distal skin tissue between this perforator and the defect was kept with the FDMA flap as an attached minor blade, to thereby create an FDMA propeller flap.\nSalvage of the great toe in both patients was achieved. The benefit of the minor blade of the propeller was to fill a portion of the donor site defect of the traditional FDMA major blade, to permit tension-free donor site closure of the dorsal foot without sequela.\nThe distal-based FDMA flap can be useful as a local flap for coverage of distal foot and toe wounds, but direct donor site closure can be problematic as mirrored by its relative the dorsalis pedis flap. The FDMA perforator propeller flap variation can achieve the same reconstructive goals while simultaneously transferring vascularized tissue into the dorsal foot donor site to thereby minimize the tension if direct closure is possible or minimize the need for a skin graft in this notoriously difficult region.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2014-07-09", "authors": ["Geoffrey GHallock"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0000000000000264"}

If the exposed bone cannot be adequately covered using local tissues, the stump can be reconstructed using a number of well-described free flap transfer techniques. Between January 2002 and December 2011, 31 patients with severe injuries to the lower extremities underwent above-the-knee, below-the-knee, and Chopart and Ray amputations. Bony stumps were covered using latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps alone (group 1), or together with serratus anterior muscle flaps (group 2). The groups were compared with respect to age, flap survival, skin flap size, immediate complications, wound sloughing, deep ulceration, need for bone amputation, limb visual analog scale score, time to prosthesis, and follow-up duration. The mean area of the latissimus dorsi skin flap was 255.9 cm, and immediate complications occurred in 8 (25.8%) patients. In the double-padding group, there were fewer cases of deep ulceration than in the single-flap group, and prostheses could be worn sooner. There were no statistically significant differences in other parameters. Successful reconstruction of amputation stumps requires an adequate, durable, weight-bearing, and well-contoured soft tissue cover.

After completion of PDT, fibroblasts appeared further increased in number. Mast cells, closely clustered with fibroblasts, also showed an increase in their numbers, degranulation index and expression of basic fibroblast growth factor.\nThe present findings support a primary role of fibroblasts in the wound healing process upon PDT treatment, given their early and intense reaction to injury. Mast cells seem to play an accessory yet important role, on the basis of their number and degranulation index variations and expression of basic FGF. In addition, the clustering of mast cells with fibroblasts around blood vessels suggest that these cells may stimulate angiogenesis and, in parallel, fibroblasts to secrete extracellular matrix during PDT therapy.", "journal": "Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societa italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia", "date": "2014-06-14", "authors": ["AlessandroCorsi", "Pier PLecci", "StefanoBacci", "PietroCappugi", "NicolaPimpinelli"], "doi": null}

{"title": "In vivo vascularization of cell sheets provided better long-term tissue survival than injection of cell suspension.", "abstract": "Cell sheets have shown a remarkable ability for repairing damaged myocardium in clinical and preclinical studies. Although they demonstrate a high degree of viability as engrafted cells in vivo, the reason behind their survivability is unclear. In this study, the survival and vascularization of rat cardiac cell sheets transplanted in the subcutaneous tissue of athymic rats were investigated temporally. The cell sheets showed significantly higher survival than cell suspensions for up to 12 months, using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system to detect luciferase-positive transplanted cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay also showed a smaller number of apoptotic cells in the cell sheets than in the cell suspensions at 1 day. Rapid vascular formation and maturation were observed inside the cell sheets using an in vivo imaging system. Leaky vessels appeared at 6 h, red blood cells flowing through functional vessels appeared at 12 h, and morphologically matured vessels appeared at 7 days. In addition, immunostaining of cell sheets with nerve/glial antigen-2 (NG2) showed that vessel maturity increased over time. Interestingly, these results correlated with the dynamics of cell sheet mRNA expression. Genes related to endothelial cells (ECs) proliferation, migration and vessel sprouting were highly expressed within 1 day, and genes related to pericyte recruitment and vessel maturation were highly expressed at 3 days or later. This suggested that the cell sheets could secrete appropriate angiogenic factors in a timely way after transplantation, and this ability might be a key reason for their high survival.

It is therefore crucial to provide functional adipose tissue implants with appropriate volume stability. Here, we investigate two different fibrin formulations, alone or in combination with biodegradable polyurethane (PU) scaffolds as additional support structures, with regard to their suitability to generate volume-stable adipose tissue constructs. Human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) were incorporated in a commercially available fibrin sealant as well as a stable fibrin hydrogel previously developed by our group. The composite constructs made from the commercially available fibrin and porous poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)-based polyurethane scaffolds exhibited increased volume stability as compared to fibrin gels alone; however, only constructs using the stable fibrin gels completely maintained their size and weight for 21 days. Adipogenesis of ASCs was not impaired by the additional PU scaffold. After induction with a common hormonal cocktail, for constructs with either fibrin formulation, strong adipogenic differentiation of ASCs was observed after 21 days in vitro. Furthermore, upregulation of adipogenic marker genes was demonstrated at mRNA (PPAR\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b1, GLUT4 and aP2; qRT-PCR) and protein (leptin; ELISA) levels.

{"title": "Collagen-chitosan-laminin hydrogels for the delivery of insulin-producing tissue.", "abstract": "Islet transplantation is an emerging strategy for treating patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although the proof of concept for cellular replacement therapy in diabetes has been firmly established, vascularity of the transplant site and the long-term survival and function of transplanted islets remains suboptimal. In the present study, human circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) and porcine islet cells embedded in collagen-chitosan hydrogels, with and without laminin, were investigated as potential engineered biomaterials for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Hydrogels were evaluated in vitro for their physical properties (compression, degradation, porosity and wettability) and cell compatibility. Increasing the chitosan content in the collagen-based hydrogel resulted in increased stiffness (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.04) and time to gelation (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but reduced porosity (from 22-28% to 16-19%). The material design formulations (10:1 vs 20:1 collagen:chitosan ratio) directly affected the cell properties. The viability of both human CACs and porcine islets embedded in the 20:1 collagen-chitosan matrix was higher at 24\u2009h compared to the 10:1 formulation. For islet function, glucose stimulation indices for the 20:1 formulation at 24\u2009h compared favourably with values reported in the literature, more so than the 10:1 formulations. While laminin improved the short-term viability of CACs, its presence did not confer any benefit to islet viability or function. Overall, the design features outlined in this study provided the degree of control required to establish viable tissue with potential for islet transplantation and neovascularization.

{"title": "Enhanced intestinal anastomotic healing with gelatin hydrogel incorporating basic fibroblast growth factor.", "abstract": "Anastomotic leakage is a common complication of intestinal surgery. In an attempt to resolve this issue, a promising approach is enhancement of anastomotic wound healing. A method for controlled release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) using a gelatin hydrogel was developed with the objective of investigating the effects of this technology on intestinal anastomotic healing. The small intestine of Wistar rats was cut, end-to-end anastomosis was performed and rats were divided into three groups: bFGF group (anastomosis wrapped with a hydrogel sheet incorporating bFGF), PBS group (wrapped with a sheet incorporating phosphate-buffered saline solution) and NT group (no additional treatment). Degradation profiles of gelatin hydrogels in vivo and histological examinations were performed using gelatin hydrogels with various water contents and bFGF concentrations to define the optimal bFGF dose and hydrogel biodegradability. The anastomotic wound healing process was evaluated by histological examinations, adhesion-related score and bursting pressure. The optimal water content of the hydrogel and bFGF dose was determined as 96% and 30 \u00b5g per sheet, respectively. Application of bFGF significantly enhanced neovascularization, fibroblast infiltration and collagen production around the anastomotic site when compared with the other groups. Bursting pressure was significantly increased in the bFGF group. No significant difference was observed in the adhesion-related score among the groups and no anastomotic obstruction and leakage were observed. Therefore controlled release of bFGF enhanced healing of an intestinal anastomosis during the early postoperative period and is a promising method to suppress anastomotic leakage.

{"title": "The incorporation of growth factor and chondroitinase ABC into an electrospun scaffold to promote axon regrowth following spinal cord injury.", "abstract": "Spinal cord injury results in tissue necrosis in and around the lesion site, commonly leading to the formation of a fluid-filled cyst. This pathological end point represents a physical gap that impedes axonal regeneration. To overcome the obstacle of the cavity, we have explored the extent to which axonal substrates can be bioengineered through electrospinning, a process that uses an electrical field to produce fine fibres of synthetic or biological molecules. Recently, we demonstrated the potential of electrospinning to generate an aligned matrix that can influence the directionality and growth of axons. Here, we show that this matrix can be supplemented with nerve growth factor and chondroitinase ABC to provide trophic support and neutralize glial-derived inhibitory proteins. Moreover, we show how air-gap electrospinning can be used to generate a cylindrical matrix that matches the shape of the cord. Upon implantation in a completely transected rat spinal cord, matrices supplemented with NGF and chondroitinase ABC promote significant functional recovery. An examination of these matrices post-implantation shows that electrospun aligned monofilaments induce a more robust cellular infiltration than unaligned monofilaments. Further, a vascular network is generated in these matrices, with some endothelial cells using the electrospun fibres as a growth substrate. The presence of axons within these implanted matrices demonstrates that they facilitate axon regeneration following spinal cord injury. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of electrospinning to generate an aligned substrate that can provide trophic support, directional guidance cues and regeneration-inhibitory neutralizing compounds to regenerating axons following spinal cord injury.

{"title": "Co-culture of adipose-derived stem cells and endothelial cells in fibrin induces angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in a chorioallantoic membrane model.", "abstract": "Neovascularization of adipose tissue equivalents is a crucial step in successful adipose tissue engineering, since insufficient vascularization results in graft resorption in an in vivo situation. A possible cellular approach to overcome this limitation is the co-implantation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) with endothelial cells to stimulate the formation of a vascular network. We investigated the potential of ASCs derived from human abdominal fat tissue co-cultured with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from human peripheral blood to stimulate neovascularization of fibrin constructs on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of fertilized chicken eggs, in direct comparison to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). After 9\u2009days of incubation, cell-fibrin constructs were explanted and histologically evaluated with respect to ingrowth of avian blood vessels into the construct and formation of human blood vessels by co-implanted endothelial cells. When administered on the CAM, ASCs successfully guided host vasculature into the construct (angiogenesis) and guided formation of capillary-like structures by co-implanted human endothelial cells (vasculogenesis), with HUVECs being superior to EPCs, leading to a perfused avian and human capillary network within the fibrin construct. However, the results also showed that perfused human blood vessels were only observed near the CAM compared to unperfused capillary-like structures near the top of the construct, indicating that perfusion of the cell-fibrin construct takes longer than 9\u2009days. In conclusion, as blood vessel formation is an essential step during adipogenic differentiation, the data support our hypothesis that cellular communication between transplanted ASCs and endothelial cells is beneficial for vasculogenesis.

Seven days of module culture in a microfluidic chamber under continuous flow resulted in the formation of interstices, formed by random packing of the modules, which served as channels and were lined by the EL-MSCs. We observed maintenance of the endothelial phenotype of the EL-MSCs, as demonstrated by CD31 staining, and the cells proliferated well. Next, collagen modules covered with EL-MSCs, with or without embedded MSCs, were implanted subcutaneously in immune-compromised SCID/Bg mice.
